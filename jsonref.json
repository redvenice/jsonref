You can start a rumor about a guy like me or a celebrity just like that.\u0027All you have to do is press a button on your phone and say, so and so did this to me.

Because my heart is so big people betray me and I keep forgiving em,\u0027 he cried.King, without missing a beat, told him he sounded like he was \u0027playing the victim.\u0027 He cried into his hands in response and said: \u0027I\u0027m just telling the truth! And the reason I\u0027m emotional is because this is the first time I was able to say something. I have said nothing!\u0027 Kelly also said that he had been \u0027assassinated\u0027 and \u0027buried alive\u0027, adding proudly: \u0027But I\u0027m still alive.\u0027 Despite claiming that he has done nothing illegal or wrong, he admitted that if his daughter alleged against another man what he is accused of doing himself he would be so enraged he would not be able to control himself. \u0027I would have to arrest myself after I did what I had to do,\u0027 he said.   "},{"url":null,"title":"Sunset Mulholland Inside Hollywoods retirement home list stars look own","story":"    The Motion Picture and Television Fund (MPTF) runs a retirement community in suburban Los Angeles for industry professionals the home is the focus of new documentary Sunset Over Mulholland Drive, which premieres this week at the SXSW film festival in Austin, Texas          Actress Connie Sawyer, who features in the documentary, passed away at the age of 105 before the film\u0027s international debut she continued acting and auditioning almost until her death and appeared alongside everyone from Susan Hayward to Liev Schreiber during her decades-long career          Director Jerry Sedley Kaufmann talks with fellow resident and actress Dena Dietrich they collaborated on a film created and produced on the MPTF campus          Residents of the home include producer Joel Rogosin and his wife, Deborah, a psychotherapist the community is open to the spouses of professionals even if they were not involved in the entertainment business‘There’s a deep connection between the running business and the retirement home – that’s what I realized,’ says director Uli Gaulke, who spent the last four years working on a new documentary about the community titled Sunset Over Mulholland Drive – which will have its world premiere next week at the SXSW film festival in Austin, Texas.He tells DailyMail.com: ‘In Hollywood, it’s very present, this project. The Motion Picture and Television Fund is supported by a lot of people from Hollywood … it’s a good idea, because I think the success of the A-list stars, if they realize that the success of the minority is based on the work of a lot of people around. And they give something back.’He adds: ‘That is a good way to send respect for the people who are not in the focus.’The campus, open to residents age 70 and over, offers impressive facilities the grounds include acres of walking paths, rose gardens, a community greenhouse, a putting green, dining options, a café, lounges and game rooms. In addition to options for independent living such as the cottages and bungalows, there’s a long-term care facility with 40 beds and a specialized Alzheimer’s and Dementia unit called Harry’s haven – named in memory of Kirk Douglas’ father, Harry Deminsky.Perhaps most importantly, however, the home features multiple creative outlets. There’s a 247 closed-circuit channel that showcases the original work of residents. There’s a studio, a writing group, and reading and video libraries. ‘Creativity is ageless,’ the MPTF community’s website boasts.And that’s exactly what filmmaker Gaulke – clearly enamored with the place and its residents – witnessed firsthand.‘The atmosphere at the retirement home, there was this kind of energy, this kind of creativity – and every one of the residents was interested in doing something, and they had all the facilities to do this,’ he tells DailyMail.com. ‘What impressed me was that their whole life, they were struggling. They had to earn money and they had to work hard, and now they were free to do what they want.’Gaulke’s film showcases a broad array of MPTF residents, all of them brimming with personality. Among them is actress Sawyer, who sadly passed away at the age of 105 before the film’s international debut.Growing up in Oakland, California, she dreamed of being an actress, but her father made her go to business school. She lasted three weeks in an office job before she quit and started acting on stage and screen, forging a lifelong career performing. She lights up as she watches herself on screen as a young woman, acting alongside Susan Hayward, Dean Martin and other luminaries.‘Do you know what she’d eat for lunch?’ she says of Hayward in the documentary. ‘A tomato and a hard-boiled egg. No wonder she had such a little waist.’Sawyer continued auditioning almost up until her death in recent years, she appeared in everything from Ray Donovan and New Girl to How I Met Your Mother and The Office.Other actor residents featured include Faulkner and King – but many members of the MPTF retirement community built their careers behind the screen.Producer Daniel Selznick, for example, may not be instantly recognizable, but he comes from what is akin to Hollywood royalty – and has been responsible for blockbuster successes himself.Both of his grandfathers were studio executives, including Louis Mayer, the head of MGM – who’d playfully bite his grandson’s arm when he visited the studio, pretending to be the iconic MGM lion, Selznick grins in the documentary.His father, David Selznick, was the award-winning producer of Gone With The Wind.‘My parents didn’t insist that I go into the film business they said, you know, “You can choose it if you like, but we won’t be unhappy if you don’t choose it.”’          The campus, open to residents age 70 and over, offers impressive facilities the grounds include acres of walking paths, rose gardens, a community greenhouse, a putting green, dining options, a café, lounges and game rooms  Actress Anne Faulkner, right, played a recurring role as the boss of Roseanne Barr on the ribald comedian’s titular sitcom, left, appearing in most scenes alongside a young George Clooney – who, to this day, lights up when he sees her          Screenwriter Tony Lawrence, right, who worked on projects ranging from The Twilight Zone to Bonanza, moved to the MPTF Home with his wife more than a decade ago.

After the elder Selznick’s death, however, ‘I felt badly about the fact that I’d never worked in motion pictures,’Selznick was 28, and he took a job at Universal Studios, working in ‘a new unit for low-budget movies that will appeal to the younger audiences under 30.’ One of the films Selznick selected was a screenplay by two USC students, attached to an up-and-coming director – named George Lucas. The film was American Graffiti.‘The film cost $750,000 and ended up grossing $60million,’ Selznick says in the documentary, proudly proclaiming it the ‘highest percentage in the history of Hollywood of budget to gross to this day. And so George became a star overnight.‘Then he was invited to go to 20th Century Fox to make Star Wars – so you can say the rest is history.’He ended up at the MPTF home after the sudden death of his wife.‘A number of my friends kind of converged on me and said, “Daniel, why don’t you move to the Motion Picture Relief Fund?” It took a little bit of persuading, but not too much,’ he says in the documentary.While many of the residents, such as Selznick and Sawyer, come to the home alone, the facility is also open to spouses of industry professionals, even if they work in different fields producer Joel Rogosin, for example, lives there with his wife, Deborah, a psychotherapist.

Huawei has been making headlines in recent weeks after the December arrest of its chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, who is wanted in the United States for allegedly violating sanctions against IranA Canadian court on Wednesday set a May 8 date for the start of Meng\u0027s hearing into a U.S. extradition request over charges that she and Huawei circumvented U.S. sanctions against Iran. Two affiliates also have been charged with stealing trade secrets from telecommunications group T-Mobile.Two Canadians were subsequently detained in China in suspected retaliation over Meng\u0027s arrest.Huawei officials said the company, which operates in 170 countries, had never been party to any major security breaches and never received any request from the Chinese government to install security \u0027backdoors\u0027 in its equipment or to gather intelligence.Chief legal officer Song Liuping acknowledged, however, that Chinese laws may require Huawei to respond to government requests for assistance but said it would only do so in matters such as terrorism or criminal activity.\u0027But if this went beyond express stipulations of the law, we would reject such a request,\u0027 Song said, adding that installing backdoors would be commercial \u0027suicide\u0027 if such things were revealed.Huawei officials denied that the privately held company was \u0027owned or influenced\u0027 by China\u0027s government.Some China-watchers, however, say it is highly unlikely that Ren could have steered his company to such heights in such a strategic sector without the support of Beijing, which has clearly stated its goal of becoming the world\u0027s high-tech leader.Much of the U.S. concern is rooted in fears that China, through Huawei, may export the high-tech security state that is accelerating under President Xi Jinping.Guo suggested the U.S. campaign to contain Huawei was prompted in part by the US\u0027s belated realisation that the company had become a rival to American tech leaders.Huawei\u0027s equipment is seen as considerably more advanced than that of competitors such as Sweden\u0027s Ericsson or Finland\u0027s Nokia.\u0027Is it afraid that other countries may catch up to and overtake its use of advanced 5G technologies?\u0027 Guo asked."},{"url":null,"title":"Taiwan Barbecue Goddess tourist sensation","story":"    Ruo Yan, (pictured) became a \u0027barbecue goddess\u0027 after footage of her skills went viral onlineWearing a low-cut black shirt and jeans, the camera focuses on the curvy cook as she flips meat and serves food.She has since become a tourist attraction herself at the scenic mountain spot, Shanhaiist reported.‘I drank from small to big’: Chinese coconut milk brand...The pies have it: Pastry fans from around the world descend...Share this articleMs Yan is a member of the Tsou, who are the indigenous people of central southern Taiwan.When she isn\u0027t modelling or working in the performing arts industry, she returns home to help out at the barbecue shop.    Ruo Yan (pictured) works at her family\u0027s barbecue stall when she isn\u0027t modelling or working in the performing arts industryShe\u0027s not the only attractive Taiwanese food stall worker who has garnered attention online.Last year, photos of a snack stall worker called \u0027Little Peach\u0027 went viral after she was photographed selling food in a low cut top and very short denim hot pants.

The point is always the same: how to phrase the backstop in a way that could be acceptable for the UK.\u0027          The EU has warned Theresa May (pictured leaving No 10 tomorrow) she must offer \u0027acceptable\u0027 new ideas within 48 hours if she wants to salvage talks on the Brexit dealBrussels has now told Theresa May she has 48 hours to save her Brexit deal, which faces a catastrophic defeat in the Commons next week. There are growing rumours that the Prime Minister could fly to Brussels to meet Jean-Claude Juncker before Monday to force a breakthrough - but is unlikely to travel unless she is sure of a positive result.Tory Brexiteer Mark Francois told ITV\u0027s Peston show last night: \u0027The rumors today are that Cox has got nothing.

With just five days until the crunch vote on May\u0027s Brexit deal, estimates suggest Mrs May is well short of the votes needed to win on Tuesday Tory sources have said that a Norway-style Brexit would cause such turmoil in the party that it could split in two.This ramps up even more pressure on the Prime Minister and the Attorney General to secure some kind of legally binding change to her Brexit deal from the EU.But insiders on both sides have given inside contrasting accounts as talks floundered. British sources have said that Michel Barnier would not be flexible as talks entered the 11th hour.A No 10 source told The Sun: \u0027We made what we thought were some pretty reasonable proposals on Tuesday night. Barnier just didn\u0027t want to engage. The EU has privately pushed back and said the UK is still yet to offer \u0027anything new\u0027 and said: \u0027What Britain is asking for goes way beyond where Barnier can go. It doesn\u0027t look we\u0027re going to bridge the gap any time soon\u0027.Britain has been given until the end of Friday to come forward with fresh proposals to break the Brexit deadlock.EU officials have said they are ready to work through the weekend if the UK comes forward with an \u0027acceptable\u0027 plan to resolve the impasse over the Northern Ireland backstop, the BBC reported.Theresa May is facing a crunch Commons vote on Tuesday when she takes her Brexit deal back to MPs following its overwhelming rejection in January by a majority of 230.          The latest row over the backstop – designed to prevent a hard border emerging in Ireland – centres around disagreements over language which could either form a new document to be added to the Withdrawal Treaty or sit alongside it, said to be taken from a letter written by European Commission President Jean-Claude Junker (pictured)The Prime Minister has staked her hopes of getting through the \u0027meaningful vote\u0027 this time on securing concessions from the EU on the backstop - which has proved the main stumbling block to an agreement.Tory Brexiteers have been demanding legally-binding assurances the UK cannot be tied indefinitely to EU rules through the backstop, intended to prevent the return of a hard border on the island of Ireland.However, talks in Brussels on Tuesday between the EU\u0027s chief negotiator Michel Barnier and Attorney General Geoffrey Cox and Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay broke up without agreement.Both sides acknowledged that the meeting had been \u0027difficult\u0027, with reports Mr Barnier complained that Mr Cox had brought forward \u0027a legal solution to a political problem\u0027.Answering MPs\u0027 questions in the Commons, Mr Cox said discussions with the EU would now \u0027almost certainly\u0027 carry on over the weekend and he dismissed suggestions the Government had failed to come forward with clear proposals.\u0027We are discussing text with the European Union. I am surprised to hear the comments that have emerged over the last 48 hours the proposals are not clear. They are as clear as day and we are continuing to discuss them,\u0027 he said.Chancellor Philip Hammond warned Tory Brexiteers against voting down Mrs May\u0027s deal next week, saying rejecting it would lead to a delay to Brexit.\u0027If the Prime Minister\u0027s deal does not get approved on Tuesday then it is likely that the House of Commons will vote to extend the Article 50 procedure, to not leave the European Union without a deal, and where we go thereafter is highly uncertain,\u0027 he told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme.\u0027For those people who are passionate about ensuring that we leave the European Union on time it surely must be something that they need to think very, very carefully about now because they run the risk of us moving away from their preferred course of action if we don\u0027t get this deal through on Tuesday.\u0027The Chancellor said he believed MPs would not support leaving the EU without a deal, but refused to be drawn on how he would vote if MPs are asked whether they want to delay Britain\u0027s withdrawal.\u0027I\u0027m not going to speculate about something that hasn\u0027t happened and I don\u0027t think will happen because I think the Government is very clear where the will of Parliament is on this,\u0027 he said.\u0027Parliament will vote not to leave the European Union without a deal next Wednesday, I have a high degree of confidence about that.\u0027Meanwhile, French Europe minister Nathalie Loiseau said the Withdrawal Agreement could not be reopened, and that it represented \u0027best possible solution\u0027.11th hour Brexit talks collapse after bitter clash between Geoffrey Cox and Brussels\u0027 Michel Barnier leaving Tories fearing \u0027party meltdown\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Derelict 180 year old Methodist church quirky 2m home","story":"    St John\u0027s Hall pictured above) has been described by the selling agent as \u0027Canterbury\u0027s most exciting new home\u0027          One of the most striking features of the property is a woodburner which has been designed to look like Marilyn Monroe\u0027s lips          The property is flooded with light from the nine original Georgian arched windows (one pictured above) and offers versatile and spacious accommodation arranged over three floors          Some of the more modern features of the property include this room with leopard wallpaper and a wooden archway          The library has a bespoke barrel-vaulted solid walnut ceiling and a cocktail cabinet (right) which was once a pianoThe Hebels, who have been developing property for almost two decades and were nominated for a RIBA prize in 2012, have completely renovated it with new foundations, floors, ceilings and an internal steel structure.It is effectively a new home and has a ten-year building warranty.The house is also heated by a ground source heat pump, which makes it cheaper to run and may mean the buyer can qualify for a renewable heat incentive - currently estimated at £27,000 over seven years.The house has 4,426 sq ft of accommodation over three floors with a kitchenbreakfast room, dining room, living room, library, study and five bedrooms all with en suite bathrooms.When the couple first bought the property graffiti was plastered on the doors and some of the windows were boarded up.However, now it couldn\u0027t look more different as it has been restored to its full glory and mixes new contemporary designs with traditional.            A planning document for the property which shows the scale of the property which includes a reception and a study areaHistoric country home that sheltered Emily Bronte and her...200-year-old Georgian board game created out of paper and...Builder, 51, who scooped a £76m EuroMillions win snaps up a...Share this article    An exterior shot of the property after the completion of the renovation.

It was just a shell really, but all the basic brick and mortars were in good condition and the location was perfect - just 200 metres from the cathedral.\u0027It was such a grand building, for me it was easy to envisage what to do.\u0027I wanted to add personality to the property. I\u0027m not sure where the idea for the lips came from. I\u0027d worked with James Clegg before on a traditional hanging fireplace and I just thought wouldn\u0027t it be fun if it was shaped like a pair of lips.\u0027She said the library ceiling had been made from walnut at the beginning of the renovations but  the piano bar was a last-minute addition.          In homage to its past as a school the property features fun decor including this sign which reads: \u0027The Shop is open for fifteen minutes before commencement of class\u0027          Before the renovations the property sat empty and the area next to it had been cordoned off by fencing (pictured above)          The former chapel and school had been heavily vandalised with graffiti around the entrance, and windows were boarded up          A scaffold tower stands in the middle of the property with old chairs stacked against the walls as renovation work begins           One of the windows of the property before renovation. It was boarded up, with peeling paint and weeds growing in the cracks\u0027I\u0027d bought the piano for something silly like £25 but it was beyond any form of salvage as a piano, so we thought what could we do with it that\u0027s constructive.\u0027We came up with the cocktail bar and used the cast iron workings to create a coffee table.\u0027We also used old art boards left from the school to create a worktop for the sink in the downstairs toilet.\u0027The porthole was from a boatyard in Exeter and it means the person in that bedroom can look down to the kitchen, you can call down and ask what time\u0027s dinner.\u0027          The restored property mixes contemporary designs with traditional and is just over 200 yards from Canterbury Cathedral           Walnut-coloured wood features throughout the property and contrasts well with the modern tiling and woodburnerShe said they designed the top floor like a Swiss chalet and used wood that was 150 years old, to match the age of the building.\u0027We created four bunk beds which have charging points and peep holes so children can peer through and talk to each other.

At the time, the theatre would usually show French musicals such as Paris To Picadilly          Two poodles, fresh from a pampering, emerge from their backstage  area where a team of handlers and groomers prepare them for the show          Pampered and scantily clad showgirls dote on their equally pampered poodles in a backstage room at the Prince of Wales theatre. The dogs are seen with bows tied on to their fur to add an extra touch of glamour to the typically French musicals they starred in          A group of the pooches pose with Parisian cabaret star Mini Gerard who cradles one of the dogs under her arm. In the 1950s, the long-running productions were Paris to Piccadilly, Pardon My French, Paris by Night and Plaisirs de Paris          A sopping wet poodle is lifted out of the bath where it was washed. This is the first stage of the long pampering process which could take several hours          The pre-stage preparation involves making sure each poodle\u0027s fur is perfect. A team of white-coated professional groomers would cut, comb, wash and blow-dry the dogs before the show          Unlike most dogs, poodles only have a single layer of fur which is dense and curly. When the dog sheds its coat, instead of falling off it becomes tangled which can lead to matting if not cared for properly. It is not uncommon for poodles to be brushed for hours before a show, such as the ones at the Prince of Wales Theatre in the 1950s  Armed with clippers, scissors and brushes, the poodle\u0027s team of groomers set to work on making their dogs ready for the spotlight. But while most of the pooches sit patiently for their fur to be treated, one restless dog leaps high into the air           It takes two: A couple of the grooming team set to work on one of the poodles. A man holds the dog\u0027s head still while a woman dries its fur which is still wet from being washed          One of the backstage team shears off a chunk of the poodle\u0027s fur by its tail as the dog stands patiently on a table cluttered with brushes, clippers and other beauty tools          Another pooch rests on a woman\u0027s lap as she delicately runs her brush through the patch of fur on top of its damp head. The work which went in to ensuring the dogs looked their best led the Prince of Wales to be lauded for its spectacular French revues          The finished product: An arduous process with many stages ends with the glamorous dogs lining up for a group picture. The animals were used to recreate Parisian lavishness and style as their immaculate appearance would compliment the glitzy showgirls          Game face: And a single poodle strikes a dramatic pose, sitting bolt upright with its head cocked up as it prepares to take to the stage and perform in front of over a thousand people            Two handlers grasping a bunch of leads take the seven poodles into an iconic London black cab which will drive the dogs  from the Prince Wales Theatre back to their kennels           When the canines have bundled into the back of the now-crowded taxi, the driver whisks them and their handlers away   While most of the dogs walk across the road, one smaller poodle hitches a ride by perching on his handler\u0027s shoulder "},{"url":null,"title":"Local paper blunders printing two rude words obituaries page","story":"    The swear words were accidentally left on an obituaries page by the newspaper I left him for literally two minutes!\u0027 Shocked mom discovers...Bohemian travesty!

Kelly is back behind bars in Chicago for failing to pay his child support \u0027Why would you take your daughter -- if I were going to take my daughter and she\u0027s 19 years old to a 49-year-old icon whatever, celebrity, R. Kelly concert, whoever it is, I\u0027m not going to  put her on the stage and leave her. \u0027I\u0027m going to take her to the concert.\u0027\u0027Their father is more into my music and knew about my music than they do,\u0027 he said. Kelly\u0027s legal troubles are split between two cases. The first is a criminal case in which he is accused of raping four women, three of whom were minors when they say he attacked them, between 1998 and 2010. He has pleaded not guilty on all counts and will return to court soon.The second case is the child support case which is ex-wife, Andrea, has is pursuing. That is what landed him in jail for a second time after he posted bail on the criminal rape charges. His new legal woes come after years of speculation and accusations about his sexual relationships with young girls.It came to a head earlier this year with the release of the Lifetime docu-series, Surviving R. Kelly, where seven women made allegations against him.  "},{"url":null,"title":"Swans waddle town centre raid bins junk food Lake Windermere","story":"    Swans scavenge for scraps of food in bins in Bowness-on-Windermere in the Lake DistrictHowever, a number of the mute swans have grown accustomed to the unhealthy options and now wander a third of a mile into Bowness town centre to beg for bread outside Tesco Express and rummage through the bins for discarded junk food.One swan even walked a mile-and-a-half into Windermere town centre craving white bread and chips and had to be brought back to the lake in a car.Ian Wilkinson, who works at Windermere Lake Cruises, beside where the swans used to be fed, said: \u0027The problem was that everybody was feeding them and someone, nobody knows who, has put the sign up and now the swans are not getting what they want.\u0027I dread to think what the swans are eating up in town.\u0027The pelican you don\u0027t want to cross! Angry bird doesn\u0027t seem...\u0027It\u0027s half human!\u0027: Delivery driver is terrorised by an...Safari ranger is crushed to death by sexually charged bull...Share this articleA Tourist Information spokesperson confirmed that the \u0027don\u0027t feed the birds\u0027 signs just appeared and have nothing to do with the local South Lakeland Council or the Lake District National Park Authority.A group of around four swans bravely march uphill from the lake to linger outside Tesco Express and Costa - where there are no signs not to feed them - hoping for tourists and well-meaning locals to throw them scraps.A number of residents have expressed fears that the birds could be hit by the busy passing traffic or attacked by dogs, and also that their large size could be intimidating to pedestrians, particularly small children.The large, long necked birds, also find rich pickings in the many rubbish bins en route from the water\u0027s edge to the town centre.Marian Jones, area ranger for the Lake District National Park Authority, advised people to resist the temptation to offer food to any of the birds. \u0027We work with a number of organisations and key landowners including the RSPCA and South Lakeland District Council to help manage the impact of waterfowl on Windermere,\u0027 she said.\u0027One of the reasons swans and other birds are attracted to Bowness is because they\u0027re being fed by locals and visitors in the area. \u0027Unfortunately, this can cause health problems for the birds and make them tame which can put them at risk from traffic and dogs.          The birds are often seen heading into the town as they look for food after claims an unofficial ban has stopped people giving them bread \u0027To protect these birds and reduce the risk of accidents, we advise people to not feed them.\u0027Annabel Rushton, of the RSPB in Cumbria, said: \u0027Just like us, swans need a variety of food in their diet to stay healthy. A swan\u0027s natural diet is made up of water plants and grass as well as small insects and snails.\u0027Fast food should not be fed to swans. Just like us humans, it is not good for them and its grease can get stuck to their feathers making it difficult for them to preen, which they need to do to keep their feathers waterproof.\u0027Most types of bread are acceptable to birds, but should only ever be given as a small part of a varied diet.\u0027Bread can act as an empty filler, so although it isn\u0027t harmful to birds per se, it should only be fed in small amounts as its nutritional value is relatively low. What can often happen in public spaces is that swans and ducks can end up on a diet of predominantly or entirely bread and so can suffer from serious vitamin deficiencies from a lack of balanced diet. \u0027Essentially they can become reliant on it and habituated to the places where they are fed it if it is given to them regularly, so they don\u0027t get the nutrients they need. Sometimes people also feed mouldy bred which is obviously not good for them.          A board has been erected on the shoreline asking people not to feed the swans although it is not clear where the note to tourists has come from \u0027Better alternatives include bird seed, halved grapes, potatoes, and greens like spinach, to try and provide a more varied, more natural diet than bread.\u0027An ancient law states that mute swans are the Queen\u0027s property and anyone injuring them could theoretically be charged with causing criminal damage. "},{"url":null,"title":"With just five days crunch vote analysis reveals PM staring defeat face","story":"      The EU has warned Theresa May (pictured leaving No 10 tomorrow) she must offer \u0027acceptable\u0027 new ideas within 48 hours if she wants to salvage talks on the Brexit deal, which faces a potentially fatal defeatDesperate Geoffrey Cox claims the backstop would breach the...Brexiteers warn May they will crush her orce plan AGAIN...\u0027There\u0027s no light at the end of the tunnel\u0027: How frosty EU...Share this article  Philip Hammond (pictured in Downing Street yesterday) warned Brexiteers voting for Theresa May\u0027s deal on Tuesday is the \u0027last chance\u0027 to leave the EU on time today            The latest row over the backstop – designed to prevent a hard border emerging in Ireland – centres around disagreements over language which could either form a new document to be added to the Withdrawal Treaty or sit alongside it, said to be taken from a letter written by European Commission President Jean-Claude Junker (pictured)Amber Rudd refers to Diane Abbott as a \u0027coloured woman\u0027Shocking moment man slaps his wife in the face during weddingDancer alleges even though Jackson was kind there was abuseMan knocks somebody out in one punch for harassing their mumChris Watts describes how he killed his wife and two daughtersLeaving Neverland: \u0027He was larger than life and then he likes you\u0027Paramedics tend to stabbed man on the streets of LeytonLondon mayor Sadiq Khan on knife crime rise in the cityMan is stabbed in shocking mass brawl outside West Midlands pubPhilip Hammond urges colleagues to ‘think carefully’ on Brexit dealLast night it emerged that Mr Cox is trying to secure an \u0027arbitration panel\u0027 that would determine if the two sides were acting in good faith in trying to find alternatives to the backstop.But according to a report on the BuzzFeed website, the idea was rejected by Mr Barnier.Sources say Mr Cox and Mr Barclay could be back in Brussels as early as tomorrow to help push a deal over the line in time for next week\u0027s vote.Technical discussions, led by Mrs May\u0027s chief Brexit adviser Olly Robbins, will continue in Brussels.

Photograph:  Maxwells. International Women’s Day is in danger of becoming “what holy days used to be” and “a chance to skive off with friends”, the Minister of State for Higher Education has said. Mary Mitchell O’Connor said she thinks the annual occasion, which takes place on Friday, needs to be repurposed in order to achieve “our objectives”. “The problem as I see it is that International Women’s Day is in danger of becoming what holy days used to be when we were going to school back in the day, a chance to skive off with friends and to have no homework for that day,” she said.“I think that we need to repurpose now International Women’s Day so that we actually achieve our objectives.”Ms Mitchell O’Connor was speaking at a conference in Dublin on Thursday in relation to ending sexual harassment and violence at third-level institutions. She said the majority of people attending events in relation to International Women’s Day would be women as the level of interest from men was “small”. “Something is wrong with that picture...I love being in the company of women but I believe that we’re all making a huge mistake if we think that by talking about women’s issues to groups made up of almost exclusively of women we’re going to change to things,” she said. InitiativesMs Mitchell O’Connor said the Government is due to announce initiatives on Friday in relation to women’s issues following a Cabinet meeting, which will be “groundbreaking”. “We certainly need to do something, it is a reality that there is sexual harassment and violence on our campuses and we have the numbers,” she said.“For example when I did visit the sexual assault trauma unit here in Dublin, what was reported to me that just under 40 per cent of people presenting at that sexual assault trauma unit were students.”Ms Mitchell O’Connor also said that after she announced 45 senior academia roles within the higher education sector over the next three years were to go to women, “men stayed mostly silent, presumably feeling safer in silence”. “Women, committed feminists even, patted me on the head and said that they understood where I was coming from but that really the positions would be seen as second rate,” she added. ConfinedShe said for generations men within academia have “effectively confined hundreds of professorships and lectureships to men”. “Were any of those professorships or lectureships regarded as second rate as a result of that,” she said. “Yet the minute a female Minister says ‘lads here’s a handful of posts that you can’t go for, here’s a handful of posts that by way of a tiny tilt towards equality will be kept for women’, the view taken was very negative.”She said the reality is that academic posts are “outrageously biased in their distribution towards men” and “although we’re making some inroads we’re not making that many inroads”. Orla O’Connor, director of the National Women’s Council of Ireland, said women aged between 18 and 29 were most likely to experience sexual harassment and violence. “Many of these will be students which makes them less likely to report these crimes when compared to other groups,” she said. “Sexual harassment and violence, offline and online, have a significant impact on their lives, yet many women experience an ongoing atmosphere of silence.“While sexual harassment and violence are not unique to higher education institutes, they are uniquely placed in showing leadership on this issue.” "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3817766.1551964986!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"varadkar on brexit uk rather than eu needs to make concessions","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Leo Varadkar at the launch of the Action Plan for Education 2019 in Dublin on Thursday.

The sticking point is the backstop, the insurance policy to avoid a hard Irish border.“In terms of making concessions, I think we’ve made a lot of concessions already,” Mr Varadkar said.“I often wonder why people are asking us to make further concessions, we’ve made a lot of concessions already accepting a UK wide element to the backstop when we only ever wanted it to be Northern Ireland specific. We never asked to tie-in Britain into any of these arrangements.“We’ve already agreed to a review clause and a good faith cause. This problem of a hard border on our island with disruption to trade and our economy, these are problems created in Britain.

Airwars, an organisation that tracks civilian deaths, believes between 7,500 and 12,077 non-combatants are likely to have died over the same period - 10 times higher than the official figures.The one civilian casualty the UK has said it was responsible for would amount to just 0.09 per cent of all of the coalition\u0027s civilian casualties.“The RAF’s claim of a ratio of one civilian casualty against 4,315 enemies must be a world record in modern conflict,” Iain Overton, executive director of AOAV, said of the findings.“Yet few conflict experts believe this to be true. To them, it is clear that far more needs to be done by the UK to improve transparency surrounding civilian casualties from airstrikes. Its coalition partner the US has committed to such, so why not the UK? Air strikes have flattened cities across Syria and Iraq. Bodies are still being pulled from the ruins of Mosul, Iraq’s second city.Local morgues have reported to have received as many as 9,000 to date. Mass graves are still being discovered in Raqqa, the former capital of Isil’s “caliphate” in central Syria, where victims of raids were dumped.A female sniper of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) monitors the area during a celebration at the iconic Al-Naim square in Raqqa on October 19, 2017, after retaking the city from Islamic State Lydia Wilson, research fellow at Oxford University\u0027s Centre for the Resolution of Intractable Conflict, said it is absurd to suggest only one civilian was killed while whole cities were reduced to rubble.I would ask how the RAF came at their numbers that is, how they distinguish between fighters and civilians when buildings have collapsed on top of inhabitants, and on-the-ground, independent reporting is impossible, she said.The RAF insists it has taken extreme care to avoid civilian casualties and that this has been the most precise air campaign in history.Relatives bury the body of a two month old girl, killed during fighting in Mosul, near an IDP cluster point south of Mosul, IraqAn MoD spokeswoman said: After every British airstrike we conduct detailed battle damage assessment, which thoroughly examines the outcome of the strike against its target, be it Daesh fighters, weapons, or bases.This assessment also looks very carefully at whether or not there has been any civilian casualty or damage to civilian infrastructure.Airwars said a possible reason behind the UK’s refusal to acknowledge civilian harm was due to a reliance on “observable” evidence as proof while dismissing reliable reports from the ground.The UK-based war monitor said the coalition almost never conducts field investigations, instead relying heavily upon remote analysis.“This inability of the coalition to properly model ‘unobservable’ civilian harm in urban fighting - even though this is likely how most non combatant deaths and injuries occur - is in the view of Airwars likely to be a key reason why the coalition continues significantly to undercount civilian harm,” Chris Wood, Airwars director, said.Leaving Neverland: who is Brett Barnes, Jackson’s ‘other boy’?Canal and River Trust deem aqueduct \u0026#39safe\u0026#39 after teenager bypassed railings and fell to deathBrexit latest news: EU gives UK 48 hours to come up with new plan for backstop toComment: Brexit looms, MPs fret... and Geoffrey Cox shouts about his codpieceSwans addicted to fast food have been legging it to town to get their fatty fixComment: From Trudeau to Macron, the Left\u0026#39s virtue-signalling demigods are falling to earth Kew murder: Body of film producer, 34, found in shallow grave two days after she was reported missingMSF condemns \u0026#39militarised\u0026#39 response to Ebola outbreakA nap is as good as a pill for cutting blood pressure, study suggests\u0026#39I was raped by superior officer\u0026#39, says US senator and first female combat pilotTechnological solutions to Irish border ignored in UK-EU Brexit talksTeenager bailed over murder of grammar school pupil Yousef MakkiFather of murdered Jodie Chesney praises his \u0026#39proud geek\u0026#39 daughter as he pleads for help to catch her killersCern cuts ties with scientist who said women were worse at physics than menFreshers to be offered training to overcome pressures of starting university, Government announcesComment: Sadiq Khan\u0026#39s inaction on knife crime is matched only by his boundless vanity\u0026#39Lowest ever\u0026#39 prices for Easter holidays to Europe as travellers delay booking over Brexit fearsHolidaymakers given Government guarantee flights to and from EU will not be grounded in no-deal BrexitComment: The political plot to engineer a soft Brexit is doomed to fail spectacularlyWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/03/07/TELEMMGLPICT000190651978_1_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq-LJS7LKjeK9Zr8QxHnNHG4itpGhsZrUs3owZAjQ2uWw.jpeg?imwidth=4","title":"swans addicted fast food have legging town get fatty fix","story":"Swans scavenge for scraps of food outside Tesco Express in Bowness-on-Windermere, Lake District after signs telling tourists to stop feeding them junk food leave them going hungryFor decades, nutritionists and doctors have argued that fast food is as addictive as it is unhealthy because it is high in salt, fats and calories.But now a herd of swans appears to have proven the point after tourists to the Lake District were persuaded to step feeding them junk food forcing the birds to waddle nearly half a mile into town to beg and forage for their calorific diet.For years, visitors to Lake Windermere have stood on the jetty and beach to throw chips and scraps of bread to the waterfowl.But in recent weeks a series of notices have appeared along the shoreline which simply read: “Please don\u0027t feed the ducks, geese and swans bread or fast food.”Since then the swans have been seen wandering into Bowness-on-Windermere to loiter near shops, a Tesco Express supermarket and fast food outlets to scavenge for scraps of fatty foods. No signs discouraging feeding the birds exist in the town.Swans scavenge in bins for take-away cartonsSome swans have been seen rummaging through bins in the hope of finding discarded take-away food or packets of half-eaten fish, burgers and chips.One peckish swan even walked a mile-and-a-half into Windermere town centre to try to sate its carbohydrate habit before being carefully placed in a car and returned to the lake.Ian Wilkinson, who works at Windermere Lake Cruises, alongside the spot where the swans used to be fed, said: “The problem was that everybody was feeding them and someone - nobody knows who - put the sign up and now the swans are not getting what they want.”A Tourist Information spokesman confirmed that the ‘don\u0027t feed the birds’ signs simply appeared and have nothing to do with South Lakeland Council or the Lake District National Park Authority.Swans loiter outside Tesco Express in Bowness-on-WindermereHowever, the influx of swans to the town has not been entirely welcome. Some residents have expressed fears the birds could be hit by passing traffic or be attacked by dogs. There is also concern that size of the birds could be intimidating to pedestrians, particularly small children.Marian Jones, area ranger for the Lake District National Park Authority, advised people to resist the temptation to offer food to any of the birds.“One of the reasons swans and other birds are attracted to Bowness is because they\u0027re being fed by locals and visitors in the area.“Unfortunately, this can cause health problems for the birds and make them tame which can put them at risk from traffic and dogs.“To protect these birds and reduce the risk of accidents, we advise people not to feed them.”Annabel Rushton, of the RSPB in Cumbria, said swans should only be fed bread in small amounts, as they require a varied diet.“A swan\u0027s natural diet is made up of water plants and grass as well as small insects and snails,” she said.“Fast food should not be fed to swans. Just like us humans, it is not good for them, and its grease can get stuck to their feathers making it difficult for them to preen, which they need to do to keep their feathers waterproof.“Most types of bread are acceptable to birds, but should only ever be given as a small part of a varied diet.“Bread can act as an empty filler, so although it isn\u0027t harmful to birds per se, it should only be fed in small amounts as its nutritional value is relatively low.”She added that swans and ducks that become reliant on a diet made up of entirely bread can suffer vitamin deficiencies due to not have a balanced diet.“They can become reliant on it and habituated to the places where they are fed it if it is given to them regularly, so they don\u0027t get the nutrients they need,” she said.“Better alternatives include bird seed, halved grapes, potatoes, and greens like spinach, to try to provide a more varied, more natural diet than bread.Nicola Sturgeon slaps down deputy over staging \u0026#39illegal\u0026#39 indy ref 2 vote when Theresa May says noLeaving Neverland: who is Brett Barnes, Jackson’s ‘other boy’?Canal and River Trust deem aqueduct \u0026#39safe\u0026#39 after teenager bypassed railings and fell to deathBrexit latest news: EU gives UK 48 hours to come up with new plan for backstop toRAF claims only one civilian casualty in 1,700 strikes against Islamic StateComment: Brexit looms, MPs fret... and Geoffrey Cox shouts about his codpieceComment: From Trudeau to Macron, the Left\u0026#39s virtue-signalling demigods are falling to earth Kew murder: Body of film producer, 34, found in shallow grave two days after she was reported missingMSF condemns \u0026#39militarised\u0026#39 response to Ebola outbreakA nap is as good as a pill for cutting blood pressure, study suggests\u0026#39I was raped by superior officer\u0026#39, says US senator and first female combat pilotTechnological solutions to Irish border ignored in UK-EU Brexit talksTeenager bailed over murder of grammar school pupil Yousef MakkiFather of murdered Jodie Chesney praises his \u0026#39proud geek\u0026#39 daughter as he pleads for help to catch her killersCern cuts ties with scientist who said women were worse at physics than menFreshers to be offered training to overcome pressures of starting university, Government announcesComment: Sadiq Khan\u0026#39s inaction on knife crime is matched only by his boundless vanity\u0026#39Lowest ever\u0026#39 prices for Easter holidays to Europe as travellers delay booking over Brexit fearsHolidaymakers given Government guarantee flights to and from EU will not be grounded in no-deal BrexitWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/03/02/14/apprenticeship.jpg","title":"apprenticeships week 2019 levy university alternatives","story":"IM Subscribe \u0026nbsp registerIM SubscribeCreated with Sketch.IM Join us?

The party made a manifesto pledge to have 3 million apprenticeships by 2020, and introduced a new system whereby businesses would pay for these training positions. However, four years on, the perception of apprenticeships is still mixed and both students and companies say they need more support to help meet the government’s target. Apprenticeships got a boost in popularity and became more appealing to school leavers in the wake of higher tuition fees. Many students who might previously have submitted applications to universities without a second thought found themselves weighing up their options more carefully, and for some, an apprentice scheme proved to be a good alternative to a degree. Created with Sketch.Ucas chief puts the case for apprenticeships Show all 2Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.However, despite the government’s target of bringing more young people into the workforce via apprenticeships, many school leavers still find it difficult to get the information they need about the schemes that are available. In some cases, schools are failing to provide information, and still focus on university places and Ucas forms. Moshe Shamash, 21, says that he had no clear idea about what he wanted to do when he left school, but he knew that university was not the right path for him. “It was a mixture of grades and the fact that I wasn’t sure,” he says.\u0026nbsp“I was hearing stories about people who didn’t get jobs after uni.”Shamash is now a software engineer apprentice at Workplace by Facebook, but he tells the Independent that it was not easy to pursue this path. “At school there was no mention of apprenticeships,” he says. “The general feeling that you have to go to uni was quite prevalent. They weren’t too impressed that I was going on an apprenticeship scheme.”This experience is echoed among other apprentices. Jack Moore, 20, an apprentice at Vodafone, says that although his school was initially supportive of applications for apprenticeship schemes, “that very quickly went away”. “Then it was all about Ucas and going to uni, so I was the only one in my year who actually went on to do an apprenticeship,” he says. Despite the lack of support from some schools, for many young people the benefits of doing an apprenticeship far outweigh the attractions of going to university. Nayan Maghmare, 19, is also on the apprenticeship scheme at Vodafone. He says he joined the scheme because it felt like a “win-win situation”. “You get corporate experience and you earn money. There are particular skills that you learn on the job that you might not learn at uni,” he says, highlighting time management in particular as a skill he has picked up in the workplace. Ishaan Korotan, 19, decided on the apprenticeship route for similar reasons, joining the scheme at Cisco. “I’m really interested in cyber security and I thought ‘what better way to learn about it than by working for the company’ –\u0026nbspin terms of knowledge and skills you get from working within the industry it’s quite valuable.”It is not all upsides, though.\u0026nbspSri Konreddy, 19, is also at Cisco, and says she has less free time than her friends who are still in education. “I’m adulting much sooner than my friends at university,” she says. However, she adds: “It’s a good thing for me. I’ve made friends for life and the support has been great.”Meanwhile, for businesses, while apprentices are widely viewed as a good thing, the government’s apprenticeship levy, aimed at supporting these schemes, has not gone down so well. The levy, which was introduced in 2017, requires employers paying more than £3m in total each year to allocate 0.5 per cent of their payroll costs to training. This financial obligation was supposed to support the apprenticeship strategy –\u0026nbspbut in 2017-18, apprenticeship starts were down 24 per cent year-on-year, falling from 494,900 to 375,800. James Reed, chairman and chief executive of Reed Recruitment, says: “It’s clear that the apprenticeship levy is in urgent need of simplification in order to make a success of it. “It is also clear that financial incentives on their own are not enough to achieve the kind of results the government had hoped for.”Schools refuse to let students hear more about technical coursesHammond to announce £125m new funding for apprenticeships and jobsBusiness groups urge apprenticeship reform as GSCE results roll inThe apprenticeship levy is poisoning our economyThe Independent announces new editorial apprenticeship schemeCharlie Mullins, founder of Pimlico Plumbers, has long been a vocal critic of the levy, although he supports the aim of increasing the numbers of apprentices joining the workforce. “The apprenticeship levy was supposed to increase the number of new apprentices, in a genuine effort to combat the UK’s skills gap,” he says.“On paper, so far so good but in reality it has proven an unmitigated disaster, and has led to a catastrophic collapse in new apprenticeship starts.“The problem is part perception, and part that the levy is just too damn complicated and time consuming to claim for businesses already heavily burdened with the existing tax bureaucracy. “Business owners, especially of SMEs, just don’t have the time to get their heads around how to claim the money. What we need is a simple system where the government pays businesses directly for each apprentice they take on.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

They certainly should have been. \u0026nbspWith profits plunging by 45 per cent to £160m, their annual payments this year will amount to just 3 per cent of their salaries.\u0026nbspNo one working at the retailer now will have experienced anything like that.\u0026nbspJohn Lewis to close Knight \u0026amp Lee department storeM\u0026ampS, Debenhams and John Lewis reveal disappointing Christmas salesYou have to go back to 1954 to find a comparable number, when their grandparents, great-grandparents in some cases, received 4 per cent.\u0026nbspBut there are reasons to feel cheerful\u0026nbspeven if it might not look that way.For a start, John Lewis is one of those vanishingly rare institutions in Britain in which everyone who works there really is in it together.\u0026nbspRetail CEOs regularly pick up millions for doing far worse than the leadership of this one, where there are no such rewards for failure. Lewis bosses do fairly well for themselves, but the salary of the top paid executive is fixed to a multiple (75) of the average hourly rate of non management partners. You won’t find anything like that at the retailers which are listed on the stock market.\u0026nbspThey also get\u0026nbspthe same percentage bonus that\u0026nbspeveryone else does.\u0026nbspThere are none of the free shares other retail bosses get through long term incentive schemes, which aren’t really long term and only incentivise them to feather their own nests.\u0026nbspThat’s has to be worth\u0026nbspsomething.\u0026nbspBetter still is the fact that John Lewis isn’t firing people in the way other retailers are, retailers\u0026nbspthat are barely making any money at all.\u0026nbspJohn Lewis’ numbers aren’t pretty. They have been hit as a result of its IT investments, various one off costs, and the fact that the chain, which also owns Waitrose,\u0026nbsphas had to respond to the widespread discounting that’s been going on as reeling rivals struggle to make sales.\u0026nbspThe latter causes a particular problem for a chain that\u0026nbspboasts of “never being knowingly undersold”.\u0026nbspThing is, the discounting it\u0027s been forced to match\u0026nbspisn’t sustainable. It will die off as struggling rivals\u0026nbspdie off, if not before.\u0026nbspAt some point you can see there being maybe two or three general retailers left on the British high street. One of them will be John Lewis. Another will be Mike Ashley’s ‘Harrods of the High Street’ amounting to an amalgamation of what\u0027s left of House of Fraser and (probably) Debenhams.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.High-end slipper retailer Mahabis has gone into administration. 2 Jan 2019Coca-Cola has paid £3.9bn for Costa Coffee.

And, yet, the iconic spaghetti kiss from Disney’s 1955 animated film has been oft imitated but never surpassed, as the two pups indulge in an Italian delicacy, all soundtracked to Sonny Burke and Peggy Lee’s “Bella Notte”. And, as Tramp proves, there’s no greater act of chivalry than offering your date the last meatball… Gabriel Axel’s Oscar-winning 1987 Danish film is a visual treat for any self-confessed gourmand. The story sees two pious Protestant sisters offer refuge to a French woman fleeing the political tumult in Paris after the collapse of the Second Empire in 1871. They agree to hire her as a housekeeper, All the very best chefs know that a dash of pure imagination is key to creating a true culinary wonder. It’s a lesson well-taught in Steven Spielberg’s 1991 classic, Hook, as a grown-up Peter Pan (Robin Williams) looks on in disbelief as the Lost Boys tuck into what appears to be nothing at all. It’s only when he truly believes that he can see the brightly colour feast laid out before him. And what childish feast would be complete without an old fashioned food fight? 420 Breakfast at Tiffany\u0027sSure, the 1961 film’s title may be a little misleading. Its protagonist, Holly Golightly (Audrey Hepburn), in reality only has breakfast outside of Tiffany’s, popping out of a cab in the early morning light to peer into the jewelry shop window, all while enjoying a pastry and some coffee in a paper. The moment has still remained the peak of glamour, decades later, so who cares if it’s all a little white lie?It’s a classic scene that proves to be surprisingly instructional. Francis Ford Coppola’s 1972 film has a full-blown recipe tucked within its elegant drama, as Vito Corleone’s close associate, Peter Clemenza (Richard Castellano), offers his version of the perfect pasta sauce. As he explains: “You start out with a little bit of oil. Then you fry some garlic. Then you throw in some tomatoes, tomato paste, you fry it you make sure it doesn\u0027t stick. You get it to a boil you shove in all your sausage and your meatballs. And a little bit of wine, and a little bit of sugar—that\u0027s my trick.620 Willy Wonka and the Chocolate FactoryAlthough the 1971 musical is, as a whole, a sugary delight, it’s hardest to resist the temptation of Willy Wonka’s Fizzy Lifting Drinks, a soda described as so bubbly that it lifts anyone who drinks it right off the ground. It’s no wonder that it was the one stop on the tour that ended up tempting the pure-hearted Charlie Bucket (Peter Ostrum) and his grandfather (Jack Albertson). Now, the real question is: does it come in different flavours?For anyone who considers pizza to be the true love of their life, Ryan Murphy’s 2010 romcom is a perfect cinematic match. It’s hard not to relate to the moment Liz Gilbert (Julia Roberts) bites into a piece of authentic Italian pizza, during the Naples stop on her global adventure of self-discovery, and declares: “I’m in love. I’m in a relationship with my pizza.”820 Beauty \u0026amp the BeastAlthough we might not fully be convinced that the grey stuff is delicious, the “dinner and show” approach to Lumiere (Jerry Orbach)’s hospitality is something we could certainly get used to. In Disney’s 1991 animation, Belle (Paige O\u0027Hara) is presented with a whole cavalcade of sumptuous dishes: including beef ragout, cheese souffle, pie and pudding en flambe. And there’s a sage piece of advice to go with it all, too: “If you\u0027re stressed, it\u0027s fine dining we suggest!” Indeed. While there’s been a growing fad of ambitious, unusually themed cakes – you need only look at the success of the TLC reality series Cake Boss – there are few cinematic cakes that quite stick in the memory like Jackson (Dylan McDermott)’s armadillo-shaped groom cake from 1989 comedy-drama Steel Magnolias, a spin on the tradition from the American South of having another cake separate to the main wedding cake. And did we mention that it’s red velvet on the inside? When it came to director Sofia Coppola conjuring the ultimate image of decadence for her 2006 biopic on the French queen, there was no more perfect treat than Ladurée’s famous macarons. Delicate and pastel-toned, the meringue-based confection has long been the speciality of the French bakery, first established in 1862. A new flavour was even created in honour of the film, with the Marie Antoinette offering a combination of rose and anise flavours.Food is often regarded as one of the best ways to understand a culture, and The Hundred-Foot Journey is wonderful for showing the efforts the talented, self-taught novice Hassan (Manish Dayal) goes to in order to comprehend that. During a picnic he reveals he has mastered the five “mother sauces” of French cuisine, and the delicate tasting process that follows demonstrates just how important food is to France.“In prison, dinner was always a big thing.” So much so that the Wise Guys ate better than most people on the outside. “Beyond the Sea” plays in the background as the gangsters prepare their meal: Garlic sliced so thin with a razor blade that it would “liquefy in the pan with just a little oil”, meatballs in a tomato sauce that’s “a little too oniony”, steak cooked medium rare, iced lobsters, prosciutto, salami, cheese, red wine and good Scotch. Maybe crime does pay after all.There are few pleasures in life more fulfilling than that of cooking for others. In Chocolat – based on the book by Joanne Harris – a slow-motion scene where dinner party guests tuck into the feast created by expert chocolatier Vianne Rocher (Juliette Binoche) is full of warmth and laughter.In a world where people seem more than happy to fork out £15 for some mushy avocado on toast, $5 for a milkshake doesn’t seem too unreasonable. Vincent Vega (John Travolta) takes his boss’ wife Mia (Uma Thurman) out to Jack Rabbit Slim’s for a burger, where she decides she wants the “$5 dollar shake”. “You don’t put bourbon in it or nothing?” a bewildered Vincent asks the waiter. When it arrives, Mia takes a long sip: “Yummy.” “I gotta know what a $5 shake tastes like,” Vincent says. He takes a sip. Then another. “Goddamn, that’s a pretty f***ing good milkshake.”Nora Ephron’s feature film based on the intertwining stories of chef Julia Child and Julie Powell, the blogger who rose to fame after documenting her pledge to cook all 524 recipes in Child’s cookbook, is all about the joy one can find in food. It is some of the earlier scenes that capture this best, like when Julia (Meryl Streep) and her husband Paul (Stanley Tucci) arrive in Paris and stop at a French restaurant, where Julia is served a sizzling platter of sole. It looked so mouth-watering in the final edit that Ephron “wanted to call up Martin Scorcese and say, ‘you’ve never shot a fish like that before’”.  Fearsome critic Anton Ego takes a bite of ratatouille and is transported back to his childhood, where it was a favourite comfort food, in the best scene from Pixar’s wonderful animated film. The detail is superb, from the process of Remy the rat preparing the dish to the moment Ego’s pen falls to the ground as he remembers the power of a favourite meal in evoking memories we thought were lost.“I don’t want this, I want large bread… but I can rise above it, I’m a professional.” The miniature bread catastrophe is a beautiful parody on every self-absorbed rock star to have kicked off over something as ludicrous as the food they’re served backstage. Guitarist Nigel Tufnell sits next to a tray of sandwiches looking baffled as his manager walks over. Look, he says, picking up a sandwich. This, this miniature bread. It\u0027s like... I\u0027ve been working with this now for about half an hour. I can\u0027t figure it out. Let\u0027s say I want a bite, right, you\u0027ve got this... After all the trauma she has been through – at the hands of her abusive husband and a racist ex-employer – Minny (Octavia Spencer) arrives at her employer Celia Foote to find a beautiful dinner cooked for her as a thank you for everything she has done for Celia and her husband. You see the care that has gone into it as Celia lays everything out on the table, from a “mile high meringue” to the fried chicken Minny taught her how to make. “That table of food gave Minny the strength she needed,” the narration explains. “She took her babies out from under Leroy and never went back.”It was a scene that helped propel a revolution in American dining. Il Timpano, a dish inspired by the notoriously tricky-to-make Italian meal, is the star of a moment in Big Night where chef brothers Primo (Tony Shalhoub) and Secondo (Stanley Tucci) prepares it as the centrepiece for a feast attended by their rival, Pascal. “Goddamit, I should kill you,” he screams, throwing his fork down after tasting Il Timpano. “This is so f***ing good, I should kill you.”120 Lady \u0026amp the TrampWho would have guessed one of the most romantic scenes in cinema would involve two dogs eating scraps in an alleyway?

The average price of a house rose to £236,800 in the three months to February, up 2.8 per cent compared to the same period one year prior. This is a marked contrast with the 3 per cent month-on-month decline recorded in January. Russell Galley, managing director at Halifax, said: “The shortage of houses for sale will certainly be playing a role in supporting prices. “People are still facing challenges in raising a deposit which means we continue to expect subdued price growth for the time being. However, the number of sales in January was right on the five year average and, at over 100,000 for the fifth consecutive month, the overall resilience of the market is still evident.”Lucy Pendleton, founder of estate agents James Pendleton, said: “This market is rattling around like a ricocheting bullet. It’s an incredibly unusual shift, even for monthly prices which are known to be more volatile.

The house, generally labelled unique by estate agent Foxtons, looks all the more unusual because it is sandwiched between two regular-sized homes. It doesn\u0027t even have a proper back door - images of the interior suggested renovators had sought to maximise the property\u0027s space by including a folding aperture to the similarly narrow back garden. 715 The Mayfair penthouse that sold for £30 millionA Mayfair penthouse on Albemarle Street, one of Mayfair\u0027s oldest roads, sold to a mystery buyer for £30 million in December.

The starter home flats at Trinity Square by Galliard Homes went for a combined £60 million, or an average of £700 per sq ft.

Now on the market for £3.65 million through Rokstone agency, the four-bedroom flat has been refurbished into a luxury apartment, providing an exceptional 40 meter window frontage and depth. It claims to be the longest and most outstanding lateral flat - ones that stretch the full width of a building, or sometimes across two buildings - currently for sale in London’s West End.1115  Gatti House: the flats with celebrity links and private pizza lift that sold for a collective £16.5 millionCelebrity links, a famous history and a private “pizza lift” has helped set a new record for price per square foot for a block of flats in central London.

We have as much certainty over Britain’s exit from the EU as we did a year ago. “The more likely answer is that in key areas low supply is squeezing those buyers who have a need, rather than just a desire, to move and just can’t put it off any longer.”Meanwhile, Samuel Tombs at Pantheon Macroeconomics said the volatility shown in the latest figures provoked “little confidence in Halifax’s index as a reliable indicator of the housing market”. “Its extreme volatility… undermines its validity,” he added. “Like others, the index is seasonally adjusted, but it uses an outdated methodology which potentially is contributing to its excessive volatility. All other indicators suggest that house prices essentially are on a flat trend.”UK house price growth grinds to halt as Brexit uncertainty bitesBrexit uncertainty will push rents up faster than house prices by 2023Mr Tombs said: “The support to house prices from the combination of faster growth in nominal wages and extremely low unemployment is being offset, for now, by anxiety about Brexit. The housing market likely will revive for a short period if, as we still expect, MPs sign off a Brexit deal by the summer. But a Brexit deal also will give the green light to the MPC to push through further increases in bank rate. “With loan-to-income ratios at a record high, even modest increases in mortgage rates will greatly dampen house price growth. As a result, we still expect the official measure of house prices to rise by just 1.5 per cent over the course of 2019.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

Government forecasts show that secondary school pupil numbers will rise by 15 per cent over a nine-year period. The population is expected to peak at 3.3m in 2027 –\u0026nbsp418,000 more than in 2018.But not all parts of the country will experience a shortage of school places. A child’s chance of winning a place at their preferred school\u0026nbspvaries significantly depending on where they live.The problem appears to be most acute in London and its surrounding counties, as well as other cities with significant population growth.Parents to protest after children left without any school placesA recent survey suggests that only 6 per cent of children in Somerset did not get their first choice secondary school, compared to more than a third in London. And more than 700 children were left with no secondary school place at all in the capital last week.All this has angered\u0026nbspparents, who say multiple warnings were made about the baby boom and its impact on places.For a number of years, councils, schools and unions have spoken up about a potential shortage of secondary places. And yet in some areas, not enough forward planning appears to have taken place. \u0026nbspThe government says it\u0026nbsphas\u0026nbspincreased the number of free schools to ensure there are enough places, but these are not always in the right areas. And some may not have not opened in time.Moreover, councils, who are responsible for making sure there are enough places, are not able to create schools. They also cannot force academies and free schools to expand to take more pupils.And it can be difficult to encourage a school to expand if they lack the space and resources to do so.State schools are struggling to pay for repairs to their existing buildings and class sizes have been rising amid squeezed budgets. Other secondary schools may be reluctant to admit more pupils due to fears that they will not have enough staff to teach and look after the children properly.With the swathe of problems facing secondary schools, we can expect more parents across the country to speak up and protest about the lack of provision over the next few years. The problem is not going away anytime soon.We’ll tell you what’s true. You can form your own view.At The Independent, no one tells us what to write.

And, yet, the iconic spaghetti kiss from Disney’s 1955 animated film has been oft imitated but never surpassed, as the two pups indulge in an Italian delicacy, all soundtracked to Sonny Burke and Peggy Lee’s “Bella Notte”. And, as Tramp proves, there’s no greater act of chivalry than offering your date the last meatball… Gabriel Axel’s Oscar-winning 1987 Danish film is a visual treat for any self-confessed gourmand. The story sees two pious Protestant sisters offer refuge to a French woman fleeing the political tumult in Paris after the collapse of the Second Empire in 1871. They agree to hire her as a housekeeper, All the very best chefs know that a dash of pure imagination is key to creating a true culinary wonder. It’s a lesson well-taught in Steven Spielberg’s 1991 classic, Hook, as a grown-up Peter Pan (Robin Williams) looks on in disbelief as the Lost Boys tuck into what appears to be nothing at all. It’s only when he truly believes that he can see the brightly colour feast laid out before him. And what childish feast would be complete without an old fashioned food fight? 420 Breakfast at Tiffany\u0027sSure, the 1961 film’s title may be a little misleading. Its protagonist, Holly Golightly (Audrey Hepburn), in reality only has breakfast outside of Tiffany’s, popping out of a cab in the early morning light to peer into the jewelry shop window, all while enjoying a pastry and some coffee in a paper. The moment has still remained the peak of glamour, decades later, so who cares if it’s all a little white lie?It’s a classic scene that proves to be surprisingly instructional. Francis Ford Coppola’s 1972 film has a full-blown recipe tucked within its elegant drama, as Vito Corleone’s close associate, Peter Clemenza (Richard Castellano), offers his version of the perfect pasta sauce. As he explains: “You start out with a little bit of oil. Then you fry some garlic. Then you throw in some tomatoes, tomato paste, you fry it you make sure it doesn\u0027t stick. You get it to a boil you shove in all your sausage and your meatballs. And a little bit of wine, and a little bit of sugar—that\u0027s my trick.620 Willy Wonka and the Chocolate FactoryAlthough the 1971 musical is, as a whole, a sugary delight, it’s hardest to resist the temptation of Willy Wonka’s Fizzy Lifting Drinks, a soda described as so bubbly that it lifts anyone who drinks it right off the ground. It’s no wonder that it was the one stop on the tour that ended up tempting the pure-hearted Charlie Bucket (Peter Ostrum) and his grandfather (Jack Albertson). Now, the real question is: does it come in different flavours?For anyone who considers pizza to be the true love of their life, Ryan Murphy’s 2010 romcom is a perfect cinematic match. It’s hard not to relate to the moment Liz Gilbert (Julia Roberts) bites into a piece of authentic Italian pizza, during the Naples stop on her global adventure of self-discovery, and declares: “I’m in love. I’m in a relationship with my pizza.”820 Beauty \u0026amp the BeastAlthough we might not fully be convinced that the grey stuff is delicious, the “dinner and show” approach to Lumiere (Jerry Orbach)’s hospitality is something we could certainly get used to. In Disney’s 1991 animation, Belle (Paige O\u0027Hara) is presented with a whole cavalcade of sumptuous dishes: including beef ragout, cheese souffle, pie and pudding en flambe. And there’s a sage piece of advice to go with it all, too: “If you\u0027re stressed, it\u0027s fine dining we suggest!” Indeed. While there’s been a growing fad of ambitious, unusually themed cakes – you need only look at the success of the TLC reality series Cake Boss – there are few cinematic cakes that quite stick in the memory like Jackson (Dylan McDermott)’s armadillo-shaped groom cake from 1989 comedy-drama Steel Magnolias, a spin on the tradition from the American South of having another cake separate to the main wedding cake. And did we mention that it’s red velvet on the inside? When it came to director Sofia Coppola conjuring the ultimate image of decadence for her 2006 biopic on the French queen, there was no more perfect treat than Ladurée’s famous macarons. Delicate and pastel-toned, the meringue-based confection has long been the speciality of the French bakery, first established in 1862. A new flavour was even created in honour of the film, with the Marie Antoinette offering a combination of rose and anise flavours.Food is often regarded as one of the best ways to understand a culture, and The Hundred-Foot Journey is wonderful for showing the efforts the talented, self-taught novice Hassan (Manish Dayal) goes to in order to comprehend that. During a picnic he reveals he has mastered the five “mother sauces” of French cuisine, and the delicate tasting process that follows demonstrates just how important food is to France.“In prison, dinner was always a big thing.” So much so that the Wise Guys ate better than most people on the outside. “Beyond the Sea” plays in the background as the gangsters prepare their meal: Garlic sliced so thin with a razor blade that it would “liquefy in the pan with just a little oil”, meatballs in a tomato sauce that’s “a little too oniony”, steak cooked medium rare, iced lobsters, prosciutto, salami, cheese, red wine and good Scotch. Maybe crime does pay after all.There are few pleasures in life more fulfilling than that of cooking for others. In Chocolat – based on the book by Joanne Harris – a slow-motion scene where dinner party guests tuck into the feast created by expert chocolatier Vianne Rocher (Juliette Binoche) is full of warmth and laughter.In a world where people seem more than happy to fork out £15 for some mushy avocado on toast, $5 for a milkshake doesn’t seem too unreasonable. Vincent Vega (John Travolta) takes his boss’ wife Mia (Uma Thurman) out to Jack Rabbit Slim’s for a burger, where she decides she wants the “$5 dollar shake”. “You don’t put bourbon in it or nothing?” a bewildered Vincent asks the waiter. When it arrives, Mia takes a long sip: “Yummy.” “I gotta know what a $5 shake tastes like,” Vincent says. He takes a sip. Then another. “Goddamn, that’s a pretty f***ing good milkshake.”Nora Ephron’s feature film based on the intertwining stories of chef Julia Child and Julie Powell, the blogger who rose to fame after documenting her pledge to cook all 524 recipes in Child’s cookbook, is all about the joy one can find in food. It is some of the earlier scenes that capture this best, like when Julia (Meryl Streep) and her husband Paul (Stanley Tucci) arrive in Paris and stop at a French restaurant, where Julia is served a sizzling platter of sole. It looked so mouth-watering in the final edit that Ephron “wanted to call up Martin Scorcese and say, ‘you’ve never shot a fish like that before’”.  Fearsome critic Anton Ego takes a bite of ratatouille and is transported back to his childhood, where it was a favourite comfort food, in the best scene from Pixar’s wonderful animated film. The detail is superb, from the process of Remy the rat preparing the dish to the moment Ego’s pen falls to the ground as he remembers the power of a favourite meal in evoking memories we thought were lost.“I don’t want this, I want large bread… but I can rise above it, I’m a professional.” The miniature bread catastrophe is a beautiful parody on every self-absorbed rock star to have kicked off over something as ludicrous as the food they’re served backstage. Guitarist Nigel Tufnell sits next to a tray of sandwiches looking baffled as his manager walks over. Look, he says, picking up a sandwich. This, this miniature bread. It\u0027s like... I\u0027ve been working with this now for about half an hour. I can\u0027t figure it out. Let\u0027s say I want a bite, right, you\u0027ve got this... After all the trauma she has been through – at the hands of her abusive husband and a racist ex-employer – Minny (Octavia Spencer) arrives at her employer Celia Foote to find a beautiful dinner cooked for her as a thank you for everything she has done for Celia and her husband. You see the care that has gone into it as Celia lays everything out on the table, from a “mile high meringue” to the fried chicken Minny taught her how to make. “That table of food gave Minny the strength she needed,” the narration explains. “She took her babies out from under Leroy and never went back.”It was a scene that helped propel a revolution in American dining. Il Timpano, a dish inspired by the notoriously tricky-to-make Italian meal, is the star of a moment in Big Night where chef brothers Primo (Tony Shalhoub) and Secondo (Stanley Tucci) prepares it as the centrepiece for a feast attended by their rival, Pascal. “Goddamit, I should kill you,” he screams, throwing his fork down after tasting Il Timpano. “This is so f***ing good, I should kill you.”120 Lady \u0026amp the TrampWho would have guessed one of the most romantic scenes in cinema would involve two dogs eating scraps in an alleyway? And, yet, the iconic spaghetti kiss from Disney’s 1955 animated film has been oft imitated but never surpassed, as the two pups indulge in an Italian delicacy, all soundtracked to Sonny Burke and Peggy Lee’s “Bella Notte”. And, as Tramp proves, there’s no greater act of chivalry than offering your date the last meatball… Gabriel Axel’s Oscar-winning 1987 Danish film is a visual treat for any self-confessed gourmand. The story sees two pious Protestant sisters offer refuge to a French woman fleeing the political tumult in Paris after the collapse of the Second Empire in 1871. They agree to hire her as a housekeeper, All the very best chefs know that a dash of pure imagination is key to creating a true culinary wonder. It’s a lesson well-taught in Steven Spielberg’s 1991 classic, Hook, as a grown-up Peter Pan (Robin Williams) looks on in disbelief as the Lost Boys tuck into what appears to be nothing at all. It’s only when he truly believes that he can see the brightly colour feast laid out before him. And what childish feast would be complete without an old fashioned food fight? 420 Breakfast at Tiffany\u0027sSure, the 1961 film’s title may be a little misleading. Its protagonist, Holly Golightly (Audrey Hepburn), in reality only has breakfast outside of Tiffany’s, popping out of a cab in the early morning light to peer into the jewelry shop window, all while enjoying a pastry and some coffee in a paper. The moment has still remained the peak of glamour, decades later, so who cares if it’s all a little white lie?It’s a classic scene that proves to be surprisingly instructional. Francis Ford Coppola’s 1972 film has a full-blown recipe tucked within its elegant drama, as Vito Corleone’s close associate, Peter Clemenza (Richard Castellano), offers his version of the perfect pasta sauce. As he explains: “You start out with a little bit of oil. Then you fry some garlic. Then you throw in some tomatoes, tomato paste, you fry it you make sure it doesn\u0027t stick. You get it to a boil you shove in all your sausage and your meatballs. And a little bit of wine, and a little bit of sugar—that\u0027s my trick.620 Willy Wonka and the Chocolate FactoryAlthough the 1971 musical is, as a whole, a sugary delight, it’s hardest to resist the temptation of Willy Wonka’s Fizzy Lifting Drinks, a soda described as so bubbly that it lifts anyone who drinks it right off the ground. It’s no wonder that it was the one stop on the tour that ended up tempting the pure-hearted Charlie Bucket (Peter Ostrum) and his grandfather (Jack Albertson). Now, the real question is: does it come in different flavours?For anyone who considers pizza to be the true love of their life, Ryan Murphy’s 2010 romcom is a perfect cinematic match. It’s hard not to relate to the moment Liz Gilbert (Julia Roberts) bites into a piece of authentic Italian pizza, during the Naples stop on her global adventure of self-discovery, and declares: “I’m in love. I’m in a relationship with my pizza.”820 Beauty \u0026amp the BeastAlthough we might not fully be convinced that the grey stuff is delicious, the “dinner and show” approach to Lumiere (Jerry Orbach)’s hospitality is something we could certainly get used to. In Disney’s 1991 animation, Belle (Paige O\u0027Hara) is presented with a whole cavalcade of sumptuous dishes: including beef ragout, cheese souffle, pie and pudding en flambe. And there’s a sage piece of advice to go with it all, too: “If you\u0027re stressed, it\u0027s fine dining we suggest!” Indeed. While there’s been a growing fad of ambitious, unusually themed cakes – you need only look at the success of the TLC reality series Cake Boss – there are few cinematic cakes that quite stick in the memory like Jackson (Dylan McDermott)’s armadillo-shaped groom cake from 1989 comedy-drama Steel Magnolias, a spin on the tradition from the American South of having another cake separate to the main wedding cake. And did we mention that it’s red velvet on the inside? When it came to director Sofia Coppola conjuring the ultimate image of decadence for her 2006 biopic on the French queen, there was no more perfect treat than Ladurée’s famous macarons. Delicate and pastel-toned, the meringue-based confection has long been the speciality of the French bakery, first established in 1862. A new flavour was even created in honour of the film, with the Marie Antoinette offering a combination of rose and anise flavours.Food is often regarded as one of the best ways to understand a culture, and The Hundred-Foot Journey is wonderful for showing the efforts the talented, self-taught novice Hassan (Manish Dayal) goes to in order to comprehend that. During a picnic he reveals he has mastered the five “mother sauces” of French cuisine, and the delicate tasting process that follows demonstrates just how important food is to France.“In prison, dinner was always a big thing.” So much so that the Wise Guys ate better than most people on the outside. “Beyond the Sea” plays in the background as the gangsters prepare their meal: Garlic sliced so thin with a razor blade that it would “liquefy in the pan with just a little oil”, meatballs in a tomato sauce that’s “a little too oniony”, steak cooked medium rare, iced lobsters, prosciutto, salami, cheese, red wine and good Scotch. Maybe crime does pay after all.There are few pleasures in life more fulfilling than that of cooking for others.

They killed many of the 123 British soldiers and 42 Royal Ulster Constabulary police who died there\u0026nbspbetween 1970 and 1997. Described by British home secretary Mervyn Rees as “bandit country”, the area\u0026nbspwas so dangerous for British forces personnel that they only travelled by helicopter. \u0026nbspBritain Before Brexit: a portrait of Northern IrelandThose lethal wires linked to explosives are long gone thanks to the Good Friday Agreement (GFA) of 1998, but in a broader sense the 310-mile-long border that ides Northern Ireland from the Irish Republic itself constitutes a trip wire which, if touched or interfered with in any way, has the capacity to trigger a political explosion that could end 20 years of peace.\u0026nbspThe removal of the physical border with its hundreds of blocked and cratered roads and blown bridges, channelling traffic through a few heavily guarded military checkpoints, was an essential part of the GFA.Protestants and Catholics, unionists and nationalist communities, which each make up about half of the 1.9 million population of Northern Ireland, could choose to be British or Irish without either being able to dominate the other. A stable balance of power between the two was held in place by an elaborate structure of institutions and laws negotiated by the leading nationalist and unionist parties of the day and buttressed by the British and Irish governments\u0026nbspacting in cooperation along with the EU.\u0026nbspThis structure has maintained a hard-won peace for over two decades, but it is now crumbling under the impact of Brexit. The referendum of 2016 opened the way for – indeed made it difficult to avoid – the resurrection of the border as an international frontier between an Irish Republic as a member of the EU, with all its rules and regulations, and the UK determined to be outside it.\u0026nbspThe radicalism and gravity of what is proposed by the Brexiteers is masked by mumbo-jumbo about “backstops”, “hard borders”\u0026nbspand “max fac” (maximum facilitation) borders that will somehow be automatically monitored by technical gadgetry which, though\u0026nbspyet to be invented, will apparently be sure to make any human presence unnecessary.The debate about the “backstop”\u0026nbspin the UK ignores the political and demographic realities on the ground in Northern Ireland.Ryanair boss calls May and Corbyn ‘idiots’ and demands end to BrexitThe threat to a hard border is often portrayed as coming from dissident Republican groups that never accepted the GFA.But these are small, fragmented, under surveillance by MI5 and lack popular nationalist support. More likely are spontaneous protests by farmers and local people on the border determined to prevent an international frontier once again cutting through their neighbourhoods.\u0026nbspAll this stuff about bar codes and cameras is nonsense because only the good guys will obey them.\u0026nbspMuch of the border runs through land populated (on both sides) by a majority of Catholics and nationalists.\u0026nbspAny new barrier would probably in practice require the deployment of military force.After all, the EU is like a club which requires porters at the door to keep non-members out\u0026nbsp– or ensure that, if they do enter, they abide by the club’s rules and regulations. In the case of\u0026nbspNorthern Ireland, s at the gate would be customs and other regulatory officials, but these could not be stationed there in the face of local nationalist opposition without police protection and the police would not come without the deployment of the British Army, which\u0026nbspwould presumably operate from a network of fortified positions,\u0026nbsppotentially even\u0026nbspblocking many of the 300 roads crossing the border – as they did in the past.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspThe “backstop” is portrayed as an insurance policy under which all of the UK would remain in the customs union if the UK and EU cannot agree some other way of avoiding a “hard border”. But the latter could not be recreated without reigniting the Northern Ireland conflict, something that neither nationalists nor unionists want to happen, but that might be brought about by the momentum of events, just\u0026nbspas it was in Northern Ireland in 1968-69.\u0026nbspSome supporters of Brexit argue naively that the UK government could solve the problem by allowing almost free passage of people and vehicles and relying on cooperation and goodwill to ensure that their passage, and the goods they carry, will be registered electronically.Feeney is scathing about such plans, saying: “All this stuff about bar codes and cameras is nonsense because only the good guys will obey them. The rest would cross the border from Cavan and Monaghan where there are no bar codes or anything else.”Cheap but illegal Brazilian beef and American chicken would thus flood out of the UK and into the EU through the unguarded Northern Ireland breach in its defences. The EU could not permit a trade deal with the\u0026nbspUK that allowed Northern Ireland to become a smugglers’ paradise.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.

Total constitutional constipation. Ironically Brexit also sounds like a constipation relief medicine.But the problem of the Irish border is not primarily about trade and commerce, important though these may be.What is really at issue here – and the “backstop” is unwittingly at the centre of this – is the shifting balance of power between the Catholics and Protestants on the island of\u0026nbspIreland.\u0026nbspBrexit may be isive in England but is even more so in Northern Ireland because it plugs into the 400-year struggle between the two communities, a historic confrontation which over the last hundred years has\u0026nbspgained its most visible expression in the island’s partition.\u0026nbspMany observers in Northern Ireland are frightened by the seeming carelessness with which the British government and the Conservative Party have presided over the rebirth of\u0026nbspthe Irish Question. They appear to ignore its toxic legacy as an issue that has bedevilled British politics from the First Home Rule Bill in 1886 until the partition of Ireland in 1921, and again during the 30-year conflict from the first Catholic civil rights march in 1968 to the GFA in 1998. \u0026nbspMowlem\u0026nbspwas instrumental in the negotiations which led to the Good Friday Agreement (AFPGetty)The latter agreement was under pressure but was working until the Brexit vote in the UK reopened old issues and old wounds. Northern Ireland voted Remain by 56 to 44 per cent but sectarian isions have widened.Why looming collapse of cash as a means of payment is a Brexit issueJust how bad tends to be underestimated in Westminster because British politicians, aside from Tony Blair, have traditionally had a blind spot about Ireland until things go irredeemably wrong and it is too late to do anything about them. The same is largely true of the British media according to commentators in Belfast.“Those that covered the conflict 20 years ago catch on pretty quickly about what is happening here,” one local journalist told me. “Those that are here for the first time are completely bewildered because they don’t know what happened in the past.”\u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspPeople who live in Northern Ireland have an acute sense of how problems that had been neutered, though\u0026nbspnot resolved, by the GFA are stirring into life.“I am grappling with the idea of a hard border which I would call a Second Partition of Ireland,” says Tom Hartley, a Sinn Fein veteran and former lord mayor of Belfast. He is baffled by British actions that appear so much against their interests, saying that “they had parked the Irish problem, but now Ireland has moved once again into the centre of British politics”.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.

Neither the nationalist community nor Sinn Fein, which has won more than two-thirds of the nationalist vote in Northern Ireland in recent elections, wants to go back to war.Nationalists have done well out of the peace. Catholics\u0026nbspno longer face religious discrimination when it comes to jobs, housing and justice, as they did in 1968.Irish TV host tears up as she lists Troubles victims in Brexit warningSinn Fein are conscious that demographically the nationalist community is growing faster than the loyalist one:\u0026nbspalready 51 per cent of school children are Catholics compared to 37 per cent who are Protestants. Within two years, the Catholics may be the majority of the voting population, though this does not necessarily guarantee political power.I lived in Belfast between 1972 and 1975 writing a PhD about Joe Devlin, the northern nationalist leader in the first decades of the 20th century, at the Institute of Irish Studies which was part\u0026nbspof Queens University. These were the worst years of the Troubles. In 1972 alone some 479 people were killed, including 135 soldiers, and 4,876 were injured.Everybody in Northern Ireland has a lot to lose and not a lot to gain, but some of the most important struts of the agreement that established long term peace have been cut away by the British government in pursuit of BrexitI got used to the sounds of bombs and gunfire and the sectarian geography of Belfast became imprinted on my brain. Along with the rest of the population, I automatically calculated the real proximity of danger without giving the matter much thought.I once showed a visiting American publisher around the city and, years later, he told me that he had been struck by one moment during our tour when he had queried me about the route we were taking, saying: “I thought you said this street was dangerous?” And I had replied, as if stating the obvious: “No, I said that that side of the street was dangerous, but the side we are on is safe.”\u0026nbspAlmost everything is safe in Belfast today, though the sectarian boundaries are largely the same as they were 50 years ago.I drove through the site of Harland and Wolff shipyard that at its peak employed 35,000 men, almost all Protestants from east Belfast. Today it is the site of the Titanic exhibition which is, along with other developments, dwarfed by the enormous yellow gantry crane marked H \u0026amp W in giant letters. Housing is, and has always been, segregated in Belfast and east Belfast remains a Protestant stronghold, aside from a small Republican nationalist enclave called Short Strand pressed up against the Lagan river. It is protected by one of the many peace lines or walls in the city topped by metal staves.“They got higher when the Protestants discovered catapults,” said a local observer, who pointed to the grills over the windows and the slates on the roofs that look normal but are made out of metal so they do not break when stones hurled over the peace wall hit them.\u0026nbspI once had a shabby flat off the Antrim Road in north Belfast, but I could not remember the name of the street. This used to be a particularly murderous part of Belfast because of the jigsaw puzzle of Protestant and Catholic districts permanently engaged in low level war against each other, most often in the shape of tit-for-tat or retaliatory killings.“Get your retaliation in first,” was an old Belfast joke, though retaliation was not necessarily local. If a Catholic was killed in Short Strand where the Catholics were weak and outnumbered, then the retaliatory killing of a Protestant might be arranged from Ardoyne, where the Catholics were strong and well organised.Likewise, if a Protestant UDR (Ulster Defence Regiment) soldier was shot by the IRA in County Fermanagh 70 miles to the west, there might be a tit-for-tat revenge murder of a Catholic in Belfast.\u0026nbspPeace may have come but militant commemorative murals showing fallen heroes and historic scenes on the side walls of houses are repainted every few years.“The Republican ones became rather ethereal a few years ago, but now they are showing more guns,” commented a friend. One enormous mural on a wall in the Ardoyne shows a wounded James Connolly, the socialist leader, in the GPO in Dublin during the Easter Rising in 1916. \u0026nbspDerry Girls and MPs stage Northern Ireland abortion protestWhy abortion remains illegal in Northern IrelandMPs urge government to redraft new domestic abuse billElaborate\u0026nbspcommemorative shrines to fallen Republican martyrs, who died fighting the British security forces, are common all over west Belfast, the political heart of the northern nationalist community. But the British Army fortresses in the area have all gone, the places where they once stood used for public housing or community centres. The Falls Road, which\u0026nbspused to be one of the world’s most menacing streets, looks spruce and cheerful with fewer closed shops than most British cities.I had mostly lived close to Queens University during my three years in Belfast, but when I went back the houses along University Road had been demolished, which was no great loss, and replaced with better looking buildings. The pub where I used to drink, the Club Bar, had been replaced, so far as I could see, by a small Tesco store.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCould Belfast and Northern Ireland go back to the three-cornered battle between Protestants, Catholics and the British security forces which I had witnessed?Everybody in Northern Ireland has a lot to lose and not a lot to gain, but some of the most important struts of the agreement\u0026nbspthat established long-term peace have been cut away by the British government in pursuit of Brexit or because some in its ranks see the GFA as a Labour project that mistakenly diluted British control over Northern Ireland. \u0026nbspThe bits of the GFA that have been abandoned are important.\u0026nbspThe British government is meant to be neutral between unionists and nationalists so as to enable it to play a mediating role between the two communities. David Cameron and later Theresa May have shown their support for the unionists, a bias that became total when Ms May\u0026nbspbecame reliant on the DUP for her parliamentary majority.Similarly, the British and Irish governments were supposed to cooperate if local power sharing arrangements failed, as they have\u0026nbspbut the government has shown increasing hostility to the nationalists in the north and to any role by the Dublin government.The most destabilising factor in Northern Ireland today is the British government itself.We’ll tell you what’s true.

Used for conditions such as myopia and cataracts.The team stuck electrodes into the water of four hot springs, and left them for a month to be colonised by the bacteria.“The natural conditions found in geothermal features such as hot springs are difficult to replicate in laboratory settings,” said Dr Haluk Beyenal, who supervised the study.\u0026nbsp“So, we developed a new strategy to enrich heat-loving bacteria in their natural environment.”Some of these electricity-producing bacteria have the power to convert toxic pollutants into less harmful substances.Two types of bacteria ‘consistently low in people with depression’As they do so, the electrons passing through their body as they digest their food are dumped outside their bodies on minerals or metals, using hair-like structures that protrude from their bodies like wires.This produces a stream of electricity in an efficient process that can conceivably be used in low-power applications.While scientists hope that the\u0026nbspmicrobes could one day\u0026nbsppower\u0026nbspall kinds of systems, they have been limited by the handful of varieties that have been grown in labs.But by employing the naturally occurring populations in places like Yellowstone, they hope they can develop something that helps to both produce electricity and clear up pollutants.We’ll tell you what’s true.

Perhaps she doesn\u0027t want a debate as it will expose her Party\u0027s failing on the problem? The Tories have been skirting around the big issue for a long time and have not addressed the elephant in the room.Every day Muslims face appalling abuse on the streets and online, and it\u0027s time things changed. Islamophobia has become normalised and we need our politicians and society to understand how and why it so wrong, and that we need to eradicate in all its forms, she added.Baroness Warsi, the former chair of the Conservative party, responded to her former colleague\u0027s comments and said British Muslims are errrr British.\u0026nbspThe latest gaffe came moments after Amber Rudd issued an apology for referring to Labour\u0027s\u0026nbspDiane Abbott as a coloured woman during a BBC radio interview.Referring to abuse suffered by politicians, the work and pensions secretary, said: It\u0027s worst of all if you are a coloured woman. I know that Diane Abbott gets a huge amount of abuse, and I think that\u0027s something we need to continue to call out.The remarks immediately triggered a backlash, and Ms Abbott said the term was outdated, offensive and revealing choice in a response published on social media.\u0026nbspMs Leadsom\u0027s office has been reached for further comment.We’ll tell you what’s true.

We are waiting for a proposal from the British government, we have heard what you don\u0027t want, we are willing to know what you want,” Ms Loiseau told BBC Radio 4 early on Thursday.Brexit negotiations going badly as EU warns \u0027no solution\u0027 in sight“Let me tell you, there we no precise proposals, no. There were ideas, but there were never, until now - maybe there will be today because I know talks are going on in Brussels - but we are waiting for a sustainable proposal.”Earlier in the week Irish prime minister Leo Varadkar told the Irish parliament the UK had proposed no actual legal text for the EU side to consider.After his latest meeting Attorney General Geoffrey Cox said on Wednesday: “I cant reveal the discussions, they are private and confidential discussions but we are into the meat of the matter, both sides have exchanged robust, strong views and we are now facing the real discussions.”A leaked diplomatic note from the EU side suggests the UK has proposed two possible changes to the controversial policy.\u0026nbspThe note, first reported by BuzzFeed News, includes plans for an arbitration panel that would allow the backstop to end if one side or another was not judged to have taken “reasonable” steps to find alternatives to it.\u0026nbspThe second proposal is that of a “mini-backstop” which would limit regulatory alignment only to areas crucial to avoiding infrastructure on the Irish border.EU officials are said to have rejected both these plans because they believe they would undermine the certainty of the backstop preventing a hard border in Ireland.Talks are said to be somewhat ill-tempered, with EU officials resenting yet another change of interlocutor on the UK side, following the departures of David Davis and Dominic Raab, a switch from visits by Ollie Robbins and the eclipsing of Stephen Barclay by Geoffrey Cox. Michel Barnier and Sabine Weyand have remained the EU\u0027s main negotiators throughout the process.Theresa May is expected to visit Brussels herself either this weekend or on Monday, if there has been enough progress to produce some kind of concession.Created with Sketch.Brexit deal vote: Opposing groups of protesters gather by parliament Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.An anti-Brexit protester adjusts her pro-EU wig A message to Jeremy Corbyn in support of a people’s voteA mock Titanic captained by Theresa May heads towards an iceberg in a stunt by campaigning group AvaazProtesters of opposing sides are in close contact outside of parliamentPaintings of Theresa May and Jeremy CorbynFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentA pro-Brexit protester in Parliament SquareOpposing protesters share the space outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters stand on Westminster BridgeFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate outside the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester sets up outside parliamentAn anti-Brexit protester waves an EU flag on Westminster BridgeProtesters of opposing sides demonstrate outside parliamentProtesters of opposing sides stand near parliamentAn anti-Brexit protester adjusts her pro-EU wig A message to Jeremy Corbyn in support of a people’s voteA mock Titanic captained by Theresa May heads towards an iceberg in a stunt by campaigning group AvaazProtesters of opposing sides are in close contact outside of parliamentPaintings of Theresa May and Jeremy CorbynFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentA pro-Brexit protester in Parliament SquareOpposing protesters share the space outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters stand on Westminster BridgeFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate outside the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester sets up outside parliamentAn anti-Brexit protester waves an EU flag on Westminster BridgeProtesters of opposing sides demonstrate outside parliamentProtesters of opposing sides stand near parliamentHer visit would come one day ahead of the second planned meaningful vote on her deal, where the Government hopes to overturn MPs’ first decision to reject the plan. If her deal is rejected MPs are then on Wednesday scheduled to vote on a no-deal, and on Thursday whether Article 50 should be extended.Brexiteer MPs\u0026nbspdo not like the backstop becuase they fear it will trap the UK in a permanent customs union with the EU. The DUP, on whom Theresa May relies for a majority, do not like it because it treats Northern Ireland differently to the rest of the UK. The UK government agreed to the plan but then said it would renegotiate it after pressure from Tory MPs. The EU says the policy is necessary to prevent a hard border in Ireland and preserve the peace process.We’ll tell you what’s true.

Islamophobia has become normalised, and we need our politicians and society to understand how and why it is so wrong, and that we need to eradicate it in all its forms.Shadow Northern Ireland Secretary Tony Lloyd\u0026nbsphas called for Karen Bradley to resign\u0026nbspover her claims that Troubles killings by the security forces were not crimes.He said: “Today I wrote to Karen Bradley, asking her to come to the Commons and give a real apology for her comments.“But following the former Ombudsman’s comments, it’s clear that Karen Bradley does not have sufficient credibility to stay in her post.“This was not just a gaffe and Bradley did not simply ‘misspeak’. What she said reflected a disturbing pattern, with her and the Prime Minister having made a succession of baseless claims about military personnel being treated unfairly compared to others.“If Theresa May can’t find a replacement, they must finally tell us what the government is going to do with Northern Irish legacy cases.”The House of Commons listened in silence as an MP read out the names of more than 130 women killed by male violence in the last year.Labour\u0027s Jess Phillips\u0026nbspsaid she wanted to use the debate on International Women\u0027s Day to honour her promise to share with the Commons the names of those who have died since the previous debate.Ms Phillips said she could feel the nervousness in the room that she would not finish reading the list within the seven-minute time limit imposed on speeches.She said the names of those women who have died need to be heard by MPs so they can try and introduce changes to make it that next year\u0027s list is a little bit shorter.Work and pensions secretary Amber Rudd has said she is mortified at my clumsy\u0026nbsplanguage and has apologised after describing shadow home secretary Diane\u0026nbspAbbott as coloured in a radio interview.\u0026nbspThe government would reject any request from the SNP for another referendum on Scottish independence, Jeremy Hunt has said.Speaking in Glasgow, the foreign secretary said Theresa May would not allow a second legally-binding independence vote.Asked what Ms May\u0027s response would be if\u0026nbspScottish first minister Nicola Sturgeon made the request,\u0026nbspMr Hunt said: The answer of course would be no.Amber Rudd, the work and pensions secretary, is getting a bit of stick after referring to Labour\u0027s Diane Abbott as a coloured women.\u0026nbspSpeaking about abuse of female politicians, she told BBC Radio 2:\u0026nbsp“It’s worst of all if you are a coloured woman. I know that Diane Abbott gets a huge amount of abuse.”Former cabinet minister Theresa Villiers, a Eurosceptic, has said she believes that MPs will again reject Theresa May\u0027s Brexit deal next week.\u0026nbspShe told\u0026nbspBBC Radio 4\u0027s The World At One:\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspI suspect we will get the same result as last time in that MPs will vote down the agreement.It really does depend on whether there is a last-minute breakthrough in the Geoffrey Cox work.Amber Rudd has\u0026nbspclaimed that Margaret Thatcher believed it\u0026nbspwas\u0026nbspnot particularly relevant to help other women.\u0026nbspThe work and pensions secretary said the former prime minister inspired women simply through her position but\u0026nbspdid not make any particular effort to do so.\u0026nbspSpeaking on International Women\u0027s Day, she told BBC Radio 2:\u0026nbspI think she just didn\u0027t see herself as a champion of women, although she was externally because we all saw her and become inspired by it, but she didn\u0027t make any particular effort herself.\u0026nbspNorthern Ireland secretary Karen Bradley is facing mounting pressure to resign over her comments yesterday.Northern Ireland\u0027s former police ombudsman, Baroness Nuala O\u0027Loan, called on Theresa May to sack the minister, saying she had showed a\u0026nbsptotal disregard for the rule of law and a total lack of understanding about Northern Ireland and utter contempt for those who suffered the loss of loved ones.She said Ms Bradley had demonstrated yet again that she is not fit to be the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.\u0026nbspThe most senior civil servant at the Department for Exiting the European Union is set to retire on 29 March - the day Britain is due to leave the EU.\u0026nbspPhilip Rycroft, 57, will be replaced as permanent secretary by\u0026nbspClare Moriarty, currently the top civil servant at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, the government said.\u0026nbspThese are the comments that Karen Bradley has just apologised for:\u0026nbspWe’ll tell you what’s true.

Not only that, but we should also be in a customs union with the EU, which is an even closer relationship than Norway’s.\u0026nbspThere is some overlap between their plan and the Labour Party’s policy, which is to keep Britain in a permanent customs union with the EU. So it is significant that Jeremy Corbyn is holding talks with Boles and Letwin.\u0026nbspSome MPs are thinking ahead to Tuesday next week, and asking what will happen if the prime minister’s deal, possibly with a legal codicil attached (on the Irish border question), is voted down again.They wonder if there might be a cross-party majority in the House of Commons for a softer Brexit based on a compromise between Labour policy and the Boles-Letwin plan.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.

Total constitutional constipation. Ironically Brexit also sounds like a constipation relief medicine.You can see how the parliamentary arithmetic might work. At the moment, Theresa May cannot get her deal through because neither hard-Brexit Tory MPs nor soft-Brexit Labour MPs will vote for it.\u0026nbspIf she made her plan softer – that is, if she switched to proposing an even closer economic relationship with the EU after we have left – maybe the vast majority of Labour MPs would vote for it. This might more than compensate for the number of Tory MPs she would lose off the other end of the seesaw, and might give her the Commons majority she needs.\u0026nbspOur Labour party can unite behind Corbyn\u0027s challenge to a Tory BrexitThere are obvious drawbacks to this cunning plan, which is why it hasn’t happened so far.One is that May would be left with a rump Tory party. She would probably be able to retain the support of only a minority of her MPs for such a deal – led by Amber Rudd and Philip Hammond in the cabinet and a large cohort of junior ministers, but a rather depleted contingent of backbenchers.\u0026nbspShe would be in a position mirroring that of Ramsay MacDonald, the Labour prime minister who led a government of mostly Conservative MPs after the economic crisis of 1931.\u0026nbspIf the PM’s deal is defeated on Tuesday the Commons would certainly vote the next day against leaving the European Union without a deal, but after that things become less clearAnother problem is Corbyn. Even if the compromise gave him everything he says Labour wants – a permanent customs union, protections for workers’ rights and so on – it would be hard to imagine him whipping his MPs to prop up a Tory prime minister, even one who was implementing a “Labour Brexit”.\u0026nbspAs it is, Theresa May’s Brexit deal is very close to what a Labour government would have negotiated.Indeed, there is no material difference between the withdrawal agreement that Corbyn says he wants and the one she presented to the Commons in January. The government and opposition disagree only about details of the long-term trade relationship with the EU that has to be negotiated after we leave.\u0026nbspA third problem is that Norway-plus is in effect EU membership without voting rights, and it would mean accepting the free movement of people – possibly with a few token restrictions that are claimed to be compatible with EU law.\u0026nbspBut who knows what could happen if the prime minister’s deal is defeated on Tuesday? The Commons would certainly vote the next day against leaving the EU without a deal, but after that things become less clear. MPs might then vote to postpone Brexit – or they might vote against that too.\u0026nbspEither way, it is possible that Norway-plus might be one of the options that comes into play. In which case, the extent of the common ground that Corbyn, Boles and Letwin found today could decide the nation’s future.Got an unanswered question about Brexit?

But given parliament looks set to extend Article 50, there’ll be further opportunities to secure support for Labour’s alternative Brexit deal.“This would bring the country together and defend jobs, rights and our security.”Labour’s David Lammy, a supporter of the anti-Brexit group Best for Britain, said: “It’s become clear today that there is no majority in the house for May’s deal, but also that Labour’s alternative plan cannot command a majority either.“In the key votes ahead of us we must extend Article 50 to take a catastrophic no deal off the table and use that time to put this decision back to the people to decide if they back the government’s botched Brexit deal or staying in our current EU deal.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

The average price of a house rose to £236,800 in the three months to February, up 2.8 per cent compared to the same period one year prior. This is a marked contrast with the 3 per cent month-on-month decline recorded in January. Russell Galley, managing director at Halifax, said: “The shortage of houses for sale will certainly be playing a role in supporting prices. “People are still facing challenges in raising a deposit which means we continue to expect subdued price growth for the time being. However, the number of sales in January was right on the five year average and, at over 100,000 for the fifth consecutive month, the overall resilience of the market is still evident.”Lucy Pendleton, founder of estate agents James Pendleton, said: “This market is rattling around like a ricocheting bullet. It’s an incredibly unusual shift, even for monthly prices which are known to be more volatile.

It was originally listed with an asking price of £300 million –more than double the price of the UK’s second most expensive home.“At first glance this monthly surge could be a bout of pre-Brexit confidence but nothing has changed. We have as much certainty over Britain’s exit from the EU as we did a year ago. “The more likely answer is that in key areas low supply is squeezing those buyers who have a need, rather than just a desire, to move and just can’t put it off any longer.”Meanwhile, Samuel Tombs at Pantheon Macroeconomics said the volatility shown in the latest figures provoked “little confidence in Halifax’s index as a reliable indicator of the housing market”. “Its extreme volatility… undermines its validity,” he added. “Like others, the index is seasonally adjusted, but it uses an outdated methodology which potentially is contributing to its excessive volatility. All other indicators suggest that house prices essentially are on a flat trend.”UK house price growth grinds to halt as Brexit uncertainty bitesBrexit uncertainty will push rents up faster than house prices by 2023Mr Tombs said: “The support to house prices from the combination of faster growth in nominal wages and extremely low unemployment is being offset, for now, by anxiety about Brexit. The housing market likely will revive for a short period if, as we still expect, MPs sign off a Brexit deal by the summer. But a Brexit deal also will give the green light to the MPC to push through further increases in bank rate. “With loan-to-income ratios at a record high, even modest increases in mortgage rates will greatly dampen house price growth. As a result, we still expect the official measure of house prices to rise by just 1.5 per cent over the course of 2019.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

Passengers reported that officials were asking more questions than normal at passport control, and security checks on bags were also taking longer than normal.“Customs officers are strictly applying the rules and reinforcing controls,” David-Olivier Caron, an official from the CFDT trade union, said.May could force ministers to vote for no-deal Brexit, Fox saysWorkers are demanding more staff to help them after Brexit, as well as better overnight pay and a danger allowance ahead of the UK’s departure, which on paper is set to happen on 29 March.Philippe Bollengier from the CGT union added: “There will be stronger controls. Today you have a demonstration of what is going to happen.”A spokesperson for Eurostar said: “Eurostar trains departing Paris today are subject to delays of up to 60 minutes.\u0026nbsp“This is due to passport and security checks, carried out by French customs officers, taking longer than usual.

The committee recommended that the change be enacted from 2021, later than originally planned.This is why the clocks go back for Daylight Saving TimeHowever, in practice member states would still be expected to coordinate time zones amongst themselves for simplicity’s sake – and the expectation is that they would move away from daylight savings time.A European Commission consultation received 4.6 million responses out of 510 million citizens, with 84 per cent against the current practice of changing the clocks.Three million of the responses were from Germany, however - which led to some EU diplomats to claim it was unrepresentative.Juncker (AFPGetty)If MEPs back the plan in the vote later this month then they will have to enter negotiations with member states, who are split on the issue.Member states who want to keep the old rules include the UK, Greece, and Portugal, while France, Denmark, and the Netherlands are among those undecided. Most other member states, most notably Germany, back the change.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.French gendarmes arrive for evacuation as prison guards block the entrance to the penitentiary center of Alencon, in Conde-sur-Sarthe, northwestern France, two days after a prison inmate seriously wounded two guards in a knife attack before being detained in a police raid. - The prison of Alencon  Conde-sur-Sarthe, where two guards were seriously stabbed on March 5 by a radicalized detainee, was blocked again on March 7 by about a hundred prison guards.

I know, I know. It really could go either way, that one, couldn’t it  You might end up looking as toned as Joe Wicks — or more like Piers Morgan with an industrial air compressor up his rear.Fortunately, ITV and its diet expert Michael Mosley had gathered “six famous guinea pigs” to gorge themselves stupid and settle this debate for good: Nadine, Hayley Tamaddon off Coronation Street, Peter Andre, Made In Cha’s Hugo Taylor, “Chaser” Shaun Wallace and Tessa Sanderson, who all brought their own degree of hype and range of medical quirks to the experiment.Hayley, for instance, has irritable bowel syndrome, while Hugo suffers from a debilitating strain of irritable personality syndrome and is prone to quoting the Dalai Lama or grandly announcing: “I’m trying to do this for other people. It’s kind of, like, a selfless act.” Or it was, until Hugo decided he couldn’t be arsed and pulled out of the experiment at the end of Week One.The other five kept eating, eating, eating, though, until their bodies began to groan, fart and generally give up on their owners. Hayley and Tessa both had to be withdrawn from the process on health grounds, Shaun Wallace developed sleep apnoea and Nadine began passing “rubber pellets”.One other thing also became apparent during the opening few days of The Junk Food Experiment. Their innards could’ve been begging for mercy and Nadine might well have been on the verge of crapping a cc song, but they all looked exactly the same.It was no sort of spectacle at all, so they tried perking it up with all sorts of production stunts. Peter Andre went for a brain scan that revealed it’s  per cent McFlurry, Michael Mosley entered a competitive eating challenge and Shaun Wallace was sent to his local pub quiz, where he misidentied “the unwanted, loud screeching sounds you sometimes hear from a microphone or speaker” as “white noise” rather than the correct answer, Little Mix.On Day , Nadine also went for another dump — and I don’t know what she was thinking while she sat there, but my mind was wandering to the fact it’s now  years since ITV axed World In Action, a show that was sold around the world and conducted the investigation leading to the release of the Birmingham Six.Here we are now, two decades later, watching six self-publicists come to the the “no-s***, Sherlock” conclusion of the century — eating nothing but pizzas and fast food is bad for you.With the most damning fact of all being that ITV, at the very least, is sending mixed messages about the obesity crisis on its network Hub, where I watched The Junk Food Experiment and every other show received the same promo message.“Sponsored by Domino’s — the official food of unmissable entertainment.”Thanks for your concern, though, ITV.

What continues to stop it being the most pointless exercise in TV history, though, is the narrator Rob Beckett, who’s fantastically dismissive about everyone and everything involved with Celebs Go Dating.So when David finally reveals “I’m a club rep”, he mutters: “I was thinking either that or a jockey,” and when Kerry reminds yet another person, “I used to be in a girlband,” Rob adds: “Before realising her dream of flogging frozen prawn rings.”In the brutal and relentless process, he’s somehow turned this epic non-event into one of television’s funniest shows, and I just wish the industry could come up with a better reward for him than All Together Now.The Real Marigold On Tour, Paul Nicholas: “There is humour in everything.” See Martin Clunes’ sitcom Warren for proof there really isn’t.BEST news of the TV week is that Channel ’s admirably un-PC The Bachelor has ed to our screens after a seven-year hiatus.Prize this time is a civilian called Alex, who was “bullied at school” , found salvation in the gym and now spends his days running along beaches, like a right dobber.

I mean who, in their imaginations, wants to eliminate the human race It is worth looking at some data. Many of the kids, led by Greta herself, argue that governments are “doing nothing” to reduce carbon emissions.  Not that they are failing to do enough – which is a legitimate argument – but that they are doing nothing.Yet figures published on Monday show an astounding decline in Britain’s CO₂ output. According to statistics released by Carbon Brief,  saw the sixth consecutive fall in the carbon pumped by Britain into the atmosphereTotal emissions are down by  per cent since , a record unmatched by any other major country. With the exception of , the year of the General Strike, you have to go back to  to find a lower level of carbon output.Given the rise in our population in the meantime, that figure is even more impressive. In per capita terms, we have now reduced CO₂ emissions to the level of .You can of course argue that there is still more to do. But “doing nothing”  Seriously  Yet that is indeed the claim being made by eco-activists. They are asserting that governments, including ours, are deliberately wasting time for some reason that no one ever quite explains, but that vaguely has to do with “putting profits before people”.Listen to the way in which the London marchers explained their behaviour in a video put out by the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn. One after another, the young people claimed that they were protesting against people who were quite happy to wreck Planet Earth.“The government doesn’t really care about our future,” said the first demonstrator. “They’re just trying to waste time,” said the second. “I really care about it, because it’s gonna be my kids who wake up and the world’s in pieces,” said the third. “We’re the ones who have to live here,” said the fourth.And where do you suppose the rest of us will be living  I mean, I get that it is tempting to demonise your opponents, but not wanting their own kids to survive  That’s not exactly setting the bar high, is it To be fair, most of us see the world in black-and-white when we’re in our teens. Think back to what you used to read or watch at that age. Young adult literature doesn’t really go in for shades of grey, does it  J.K Rowling doesn’t try to explain what makes the Malfoys nasty. Their nastiness is a given.Some youngsters extend their Harry Potter view of the world into politics, ing the world, not into Leftists and Rightists, but into goodies and baddies. Why would someone want to poison the seas or burn the rainforests  Because – weren’t you listening  – they’re baddies.Most of us eventually learn that le is more complicated than that. For example, Britain has seen huge reductions in its CO₂ emissions because, under Margaret Thatcher, it stopped subsidising unprofitable coalmines. At that time, the sort of people who now march against climate change were marching against the closures.The reason that the United Statesis also seeing a sharp fall in its carbon output is that it is has taken up large-scale fracking – again, a technology that many of the marchers hate.But rehearsing these arguments means acknowledging that things aren’t always simple. It means understanding that there is a trade-off between opportunities for deprived communities and carbon output. It means grasping that most carbon emissions come from China and India. It means recognising the contradiction between “mining coal good” and “burning coal bad”.Most of the marchers will come to understand these things. But some will carry on telling themselves that people who disagree with them are, like the Malfoys, just evil. A few will never grow out of their teen certainties at all.

If Theresa May were to win such a vote for a second time then there is no ­obligation for the Government to follow mere motions of the Commons.Similarly, ­ministers who cannot support Government policy are entitled to leave the Government, as the honourable recent example of George Eustice shows.Naturally, the Government must prove that it is committed to the referendum result, for that is the authoritative ­constitutional voice.No responsible government ought to allow the constitution to be subverted because of its own weaknesses. The ­conventions are there for good ­reasons and,ignored, confidence in the system that has served well for ­centuries will be damaged — with ­consequences that could include the rise of extremist parties. Failure to deliver Brexit would be a gt to Tommy Robinson.Fortunately, it is in the power of the Government, and especially of Mrs May, to deliver Brexit.  Votes in the House of Commons cannot override the law.If they could we would have arbitrary government and the law says we leave at the end of this month.The Prime Minister could simply refuse to ask for an extension or to move the ­Statutory Instrument that is needed to change the date. Mrs May may choose to fulfil or to break her promises to the electorate and will be held to account accordingly.Eurosceptics must similarly be guided by the electorate — it is our duty and obligation to those who trusted that the vote in  would be decisive and would be implemented.This makes it necessary to vote against the current deal as well as efforts to move the date beyond March .The people have spoken.

But Nato is responsible for the peace and freedom. And prosperity hasn’t found its way to, say, Greece, or the vast numbers condemned by the euro to unemployment.And it’s hard to swallow anyway from a man whose economy is flat-lining and his cities under siege from enraged, ­yellow-vested anti-EU protesters.Macron admits the EU has problems and speaks of the “European trap”. But, incredibly, it turns out this trap is “NOT being part of the European Union”. And off he goes into a tantrum about Brexit.The icing on the cake, though, is his idea of EU reform: more Brussels control.Brilliant, Emmanuel! A few Leavers might have been wobbling.

It’s like a runaway horse.“Don’t watch it go, or let others be the ones to tame it.“The current lot are still in the stable, events have overtaken them and they cannot catch that horse now.”He will add: “We must tame it – our generation. It’s time for a new generation to take over and govern dferently”.Blasting today’s political leaders as “a profession of insincerity”, Mr Mercer will also insist all MPs must be more honest and upfront with voters to win back their trust.Turning on some older Tories, Mr Mercer - tipped as a future Tory leader – will go on: “I love many of my colleagues dearly, but we’ve selected too many of the wrong people over the last twenty years.“We must be courageous enough to hold a mirror up to ourselves”.Speaking at an event organised by the think tank Onward, Mr Mercer will also call for the Tories toto a more compassionate brand of One Nation politics after two years of bitter feuding over Brexit.Showing empathy is the key to reclaiming millions of centre ground voters who currently feel politically homeless, he will argue.The Plymouth Moor View MP will insist Tory MPs must “walk in people’s shoes, govern with compassion as well as fiscal competence, look for common ground, reject the extremes, and ditch the spin”.He will added: “There is a country out there, full of hope, full of optimism, desperately looking for something to vote for.“We are not a hard left country – people don’t want the socialism of Jeremy Corbyn. They want a modern, centre-right values led party.“If we do that, we’ll reach out to plenty of people who feel politically homeless. We’ll connect. We’ll build a movement, not a party.”Mr Mercer will also name-check a series of younger Tory MPs as the party’s future in his speech.He will champion two campaigners for causes from more ordinary backgrounds, AE nurse Maria Caulfield and former postman Scott Mann.And he also heaps praise on Tracey Crouch, who resigned as Sports Minister to force through curbs on fixed odds betting terminals, as well as Cabinet Office minister and ex-No aide Oliver Dowden.Mr Mercer’s broadside heaps yet more pressure on Mrs May to set her departure date for later this year once Brexit has taken place.The PM was forced to promise she would stand down before the  general election in December to fend off a bid by angry Brexiteer Tories to oust her.But despite her own MPs growing frustrations with her, Mrs May last week signalled she wants to stay on in No for some time yet to deliver on her domestic agenda.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

All forbidden under the new rules.The Farmdrop episode is an early sign that there is more to the crackdown on so-called “junk food” than we have been led to believe.Last year, the Government proposed a ban on junk food adverts on television before pm, a ban on junk food being displayed at the entrance of shops or at the end of supermarket aisles, and a ban on junk food being sold at a discount.But junk food has no legal definition. It is a pejorative term used by campaigners such as chef Jamie Oliver to push their nanny state agenda.In practice, the legislation will apply to all food or drink considered to be high in fat, salt or sugar— and that includes the kind of food your grandmother would have approved of, such as butter and jam.The official definition of HFSS was drawn up over a decade ago, when Tony Blair banned junk food advertising on children’s television.A system was devised in which food products were given a mark out of , with points added for “negative” nutrients — such as saturated fat, sugar and sodium — and points subtracted for “positive” nutrients such as fruit, vegetables, protein and fibre.Calories are also counted as negative nutrients. If a food gets more than four points, it is classed as HFSS and cannot be advertised on children’s TV.The system was never intended to be a measure of “junk food” or “unhealthy food”. It was only supposed to distinguish “less healthy” food from “more healthy” food for the purposes of encouraging children to eat better.Nevertheless, the system has since been adopted by the Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, for his ban on junk food advertising on public transport.It could also soon be used to decide which products can be advertised before pm, which products can be included in discount deals and which products can be displayed in prominent areas of shops.In reality, the system sets the bar for “healthy food” so high that it condemns hundreds of everyday products as junk.Nearly all bacon, burgers, sweets, crisps, desserts and biscuits fail the test, but other products classied as HFSS include ketchup, mayonnaise , jam, honey, Marmite, soy sauce, mustard, gravy, stock cubes, butter and olive oil.I have never met anyone who thinks that raisins, sultanas, hummus, walnuts, pesto, olive bread, dressed salads and tomato soup are unhealthy, yet all would be covered by the Government’s proposed bans.So too would dried fruit, cereal bars, margarine, most tinned fruit, most yoghurts, nearly all cheese , many pasta sauces and one in four sandwiches.Asthis system were not puritanical enough, Public Health England is in the process of making it even harder for food and drink to be classed as “more healthy”.A new version will soon come into effect that will classy all yoghurt drinks, a quarter of pasta brands, a quarter of noodle brands, most high-fibre breakfast cereals,  per cent of coffee and  per cent of fruit juice and smoothies as HFSS.This will leave the Government in the absurd position of officially advising people to drink pure orange juice as one of their five a day while banning adverts for it because it is junk.Some snacks Public Health England recommends as part of its £.million ChangeLe campaign will be classied as HFSS, as will most of the soft drinks that have been reformulated with less sugar.Under pressure from the Government, and to the fury of many loyal customers, brands such as Irn-Bru and Lucozade have had their sugar content cut dramatically, and yet they will face severe restrictions on price and promotion under the Government’s plans.Looking at the range of food and drink products that are classied as HFSS, it becomes clear that what is being proposed is not so much a crackdown on junk food as a crackdown on food in general, with exemptions for raw ingredients and health food.Politicians and the public have been sold a pig in a poke by those who campaign against the meaningless category of “junk food”.When askedthey agree with a ban on junk food adverts that are targeted at children, most people say they do, but that is not what is being proposed.If they were asked whether they would support a ban on olive oil being advertised during the Channel  News, they might take a dferent view.We are sleep-walking into legislation that is far more extensive than most of us realise.Hysterical claims about junk food have been used as cover for tobacco-style regulation being rolled out across the food supply.The nation’s biggest and most important industry could soon be banned from advertising most of its products during daytime television, costing broadcasters tens of millions of pounds and lowering the quality of programming.The ban on HFSS products being positioned at the entrance, checkout and end of aisle will cause shopkeepers all kinds of headaches, and the ban on discounts, such as buy-one-get-one-free, could cost consumers hundreds of pounds a year.Surely a rethink is in order Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

A Cabinet Office spokeswoman said: Islamophobia is unacceptable wherever it takes place.It was thought the MP for Bradford West was referring to a global definition of Islamophobia.International efforts to combat Islamophobiaare lead by the PM’s special envoy on freedom of religion or belief, Lord Ahmad, at the Foreign  Commonwealth Office.Of course, any form of Islamophobia in the UK would be dealt with swtly by the Home Office or MHCLG as appropriate.

This demands we change the economy’s rules and claim a better future for the many, not the few. Another world really could be possible. But we are stuck. I feel it and I speak to people right across our country, who feel it too. Were stuck in the mess the government has made of Brexit. It is dragging our communities down, whether they voted leave or remain, and driving deep ision. It’s time we raised our sights from this  ide and moved beyond Brexit to deal with the real pressures facing people. Over a million elderly people are not getting the care they deserve. Take home pay has barely risen since the financial crisis and household debt is growing six times faster than wages.   We are experiencing a surge of violent crime on our streets, with fatal stabbings at their highest levels since records began. Our schools are sending begging letters to parents and even closing early on Fridays because they can’t afford staff and supplies. Last month, thousands of school children demonstrating in towns and cities across our country and biblical scenes of wildfires in England, Wales and Scotland on the hottest February day on record should have shamed us all into immediate and radical action on climate change. Instead, the issue barely registers in Westminster.   Getting Brexit right is vital but it can’t block out everything . That’s why I am holding meetings with business groups, trade unions and senior MPs from across Parliament to try to deliver a majority in the House of Commons for a close economic relationship with the EU, so we can move beyond Brexit. On Tuesday, I met the five biggest organisations that represent Britain’s businesses, large and small. They want what Labour wants, the uncertainty to end and a sensible deal to be struck.   Yesterday, I saw senior Labour and Conservative MPs to discuss a close economic relationship with the EU, which would help protect jobs like those of the Honda workers in Swindon, some of whom I also met. I left both meetings more certain than ever that we can find a way to work across parliament to force the government to back a sensible Brexit plan that protects jobs and more determined to achieve it. I will continue to reach out to get a decent Brexit deal so our country can spend more time talking about our children’s future than a customs union.   Labour respects the result of the referendum and a close economic relationship is the best Brexit compromise for both  million leave voters and  million remain voters. But we can’t accept a damaging Tory Brexit or a no deal outcome, so we also support preparing for a public vote in case parliament is not able to achieve a sensible Brexit. We will do whatever we can to find a solution that can unite the country so, together, we can face down the real challenges and seize the opportunities in this moment of great change.

Ms Bradley faced calls to resign following the comments on Wednesday, which sparked criticism from victims of the security forces and nationalist political leaders, while the Irish Government sought an explanation. In her apology, Ms Bradley said her language was wrong and deeply insensitive to many of those who lost loved ones. Shadow Northern Ireland Secretary Tony Lloyd wrote to Ms Bradley explaining why her comments had caused such hurt. He said: Families who have lost loved ones to illegal killings by republican and loyalist terrorists or state actors share in the same pain irrespective of who committed the crime.   This pain and suffering has been compounded by the lack of truth and of justice over far too many years and your comments yesterday served only to compound this even further. Northern Irelands former police ombudsman Baroness Nuala OLoan urged the Prime Minister to seek Ms Bradleys resignation. Ahead of the apology, Baroness OLoan said: Those comments show a complete disregard for the operation of the rule of law. Moreover, they also demonstrate a total lack of understanding about Northern Ireland and utter contempt for those who suffered the loss of loved ones.  Today the Northern Ireland Secretary issued a statement and the Prime Minister was forced to say she had confidence in her. Ms Bradley said: Yesterday I made comments regarding the actions of soldiers during the Troubles.  I want to apologise. I am profoundly sorry for the offence and hurt that my words have caused. The language was wrong and even though this was not my intention, it was deeply insensitive to many of those who lost loved ones. I know from those families that I have met personally just how raw their pain is and I completely understand why they want to see justice properly delivered. I share that aim and that is why I launched the public consultation on addressing the legacy of the Troubles. My position and the position of this Government is clear. We believe fundamentally in the rule of law. Where there is any evidence of wrongdoing this should be pursued without fear or favour whoever the perpetrators might be. That is a principle that underpins our approach to dealing with legacy issues and it is one from which we will not depart.But Labour have said that her statement is part of a disturbing pattern for the government.The cabinet is understood to be split over whether or not to impose a statute of limitations for members of the armed forces who served in Northern Ireland. Theresa May has said that Troubles investigations are skewed against veterans. Tony Lloyd accused both Ms Bradley and Theresa May of causing confusion and concern with inaccurate comments around how historical cases are investigated in Northern Ireland.  Emma Little Pengelly, who represents Belfast South for the Unionist DUP, said: Well over % of the murders and injuries caused during the troubles in Northern Ireland were caused by acts of terrorism. Very few prosecutions and investigations are under way and innocent victims are being left behind, with thousands of unsolved cases. When will the Secretary of State address that issue and put in place a mechanism to investigate the acts of terrorism—over %—that caused those murders and injuries  Ms Bradley repeated the claims of the DUP politician and added: Every single one of those was a crime. The under % that were at the hands of the military and police were not crimes they were people acting under orders and instructions, fulfilling their duties in a dignied and appropriate way.

Charmaine Parkin, , was granted permission today to fight a formal Judicial Review against the Department for Work and Pensions . Her lawyers Leigh Day say a key part of the benefit for self-employed people called the Minimum Income Flooris “unjustied discrimination” and “irrational”. If the case is successful, it could force the DWP into a U-turn affecting hundreds of thousands of self-employed claimants who are on hard times. Last year the DWP estimated , self-employed claimants would be hit by the MIF by  - shaving more than poundbillion a year off their benefits. The forecast was uncertain though, and the rollout of UC has been slowed down since it was made.  Actor Charmaine, from Brighton, said rules for the self-employed under UC left her borrowing from family and feeding her two children through food banks. In a statement today she said: I am delighted that the court has granted permission for my judicial review. I am determined to hold the government accountable for its flawed universal credit system which is causing misery to so many. It cannot be right that a system designed to help support people in work has resulted in some people being better offthey give up their work.” The MIF bans self-employed people from claiming more benefits under Universal Credit thanthey were employed by someone  on minimum wage. It is designed to stop loss-making businesses being propped up by the taxpayer.  But the MIF meant Charmaine would have been pound a month better offshe quit her career and moved onto the equivalent of jobseekers’ allowance, her lawyers say. Legal papers stated thatshed paid her landlord in November , even after her earnings she would have had pound. left to pay for a month’s food, travel, bills and council tax. A date is yet to be set for the judicial review. Tom Short, a solicitor from law firm Leigh Day, said: Our client is one of the many self-employed people suffering from the application of the MIF. The effect of the MIF is particularly harsh on those who work in areas such as the entertainment industry and farming where fluctuations in income are common.  Our client’s situation shows just how illogical and inconsistent the universal credit system is and we look forward to putting her arguments to the court. Just as Charmaine launched her case, the DWP agreed a new one-year grace period where people moving to UC will be exempt from the floor. But campaigners have said the government must go further. And Charmaine, who struggled to find work after moving home and was forced to UC when she split up with her partner, said that was “absolutely not long enough”. “I thought Universal Credit could give me financial stability, help me to budget and settle in,” she said last year. “I was very wrong. A DWP spokeswoman said today: “We are unable to comment on an ongoing legal case. “Universal Credit strikes the balance between supporting self-employment and being fair to taxpayers. We haverecently announced changes to the Minimum Income Floor and New Enterprise Allowance scheme to provide additional support for self-employed claimants”.

The millions of UK travellers planning to travel on the continent could be barred from entering several European countries in the event of a no-deal Brexit unless they renew their passports by Friday, according to Which  Holiday makers and business travellers risk falling foul of rules for entering countries in the Schengen zone such as France, Spain and Italy. Full guide in the link below:   Visitors usually need at least six months left on their passport from the date they arrive. Until recently, UK citizens who renewed their passport before it expired could have up to nine months of the remaining validity added to their new travel document. The Government has warned that this time carried over will not count towards the six-month requirement after a no-deal Brexit, meaning people with up to  months left on their passport could be denied entry to many popular destinations on the continent. Figures obtained by Which  show that around . million current British passports will not comply with the validity rules. The consumer group noted that Friday will be three weeks before the UK is due to withdraw from the EU, which is the time it takes for passports to arrive after a standard renewal application.   Rory Boland, editor of Which  Travel magazine, said: Millions of people could find their holiday plans disrupted or, worse yet, find themselves stranded at the departure gate and prevented from travelling altogetherthey fail to renew their passport before the cut-off date.

Ann Rudkin, from Weymouth in Dorset, was pronounced dead after her packed Tuesday flight landed at Malaga Airport. The -year-old English teacher, who lived in the Costa del Sol holiday resort of Fuengirola, was reported to have told other passengers she was suffering with a chest infection picked up on a Caribbean cruise holiday. Following a post mortem examination, Anns family has today confirmed that she died of a heart attack. They have praised the way easyJet dealt with the tragedy and said theres nothing the airline could have done to change things. Passenger Jacob Rodgers had said he had been concerned about the victim before she died having met her in the airport prior to flying. But EasyJet has said that the woman presented no symptoms which would warrant concern or any action prior to prevent them from travelling at that time. Anns family, whose statement is in full below, said she could not have been saved from her heart attack by the airline. They spoke of the very dficult time they have been having since her death. Anns son Scott posted a tribute picture of her with grandsons Joshua and Cameron on social media. Friend Rita Brennan commented on the picture: Ann so loved her grandsons. She’ll be watching over them.   An EasyJet spokesperson earlier said: EasyJet can confirm a passenger was taken ill onboard flight EZY from London Gatwick to Malaga on  March  after landing in Malaga. The cabin crew assisted by doctors onboard provided first aid and on arrival emergency services attended to provide medical care however the passenger sadly passed away. Our thoughts are with the family and friends of the passenger and we have offered support and assistance at this dficult time. The safety and wellbeing of our passengers and crew is easyJet’s highest priority. The statement continued: The cabin crew did a seatbelt check which is noted in the witness report by Jacob Henry Rodgers which we have read. It says the passenger was sleeping at this time. An onboard doctor performed CPR alongside the crew whilst the aircraft was taxi-ing to its stand. The aircraft was met by paramedics and CPR continued but unfortunately the passenger sadly passed away. Our ground staff and crew will not allow any passenger to travel should they believe they are unwell and unfit to travel.  The family statement in full... Our experience of easyJet has been very comforting. They have treated us with respect and dignity. They met Ann’s son Scott at Malaga Airport and were very helpful to him and other relatives, to the point of rearranging flights they already had booked from the UK so they could reach Spain quicker without asking for anything in . We want to make sure that easyJet’s name is not blackened in all of this. They have been really helpful and superb to Ann’s son. We have been told after the post-mortem that Ann died from a heart attack, not a chest infection as has been reported, and there is nothing easyJet could have done to change things. We are upset about the reports they behaved badly. Nothing could be further from the truth. The family statement added: Ann was a very private person and she would have been mortied about all of this coming out the way it has. We know she was unwell on the Saturday night when she was still on the ship and she may have thought she had a chest infection. The ship doctor decided to put her on a drip for an hour because he felt she was dehydrated. She experienced pains in her neck while she was on the ship but she never mentioned that to the doctor because she didn’t think anything of it. She had experienced dficulties breathing but she was a smoker and smokers sometimes have problems catching their breath which may have been why she thought she had a chest infection. I am sure the passengers on the plane who reported all this told the truth about what Ann told them. But a heart attack is not something easyJet could have saved Ann from. It must have been a challenging incident for them and the assumptions that have been made have been very upsetting in what is already a dficult time for the family. Ann’s relatives also confirmed Mrs Rudkin had flown back to the UK from the Caribbean on Monday morning and was not on a separate flight from Barbados where passengers were reportedly quarantined after a sickness outbreak onboard. They said she was on a TUI cruise and not the MSC Preziosa cruise which has reportedly been linked to the sickness outbreak.

Former goalkeeper Jade Almond was originally hospitalised in July last year after falling back off a chair and smacking her head. The accident left the -year-old struggling to concentrate properly, suffering from uncontrollable shakes, and unable to walk. Doctors diagnosed her with al neurological disorder , which required intensive, privately-funded physio treatment. And after seven gruelling months of pound, crowd-funded physio, Jade was incredibly able to walk, run and dance again. She was discharged on February  this year, with footage from that day showing the teenager excitedly running up stairs.   She was also filmed jogging on a treadmill for the first time in seven months as she marked the end of her treatment. But in a cruel twist of fate, Jade, from Abram, Greater Manchester, was involved in a car crash on the M on her way home the same day. The former Wigan Athletic Ladies youth team goalkeeper was joined by mum Michelle Almond, sister Josie and two pals at the time. They claim the other cars driver was leaning over and trying to pick up popcorn from the vehicles floor when she ploughed into them. The impact of the crash has left Jade bed bound with the strength of a newborn baby, partially paralysed and unable to sit up unaided. The courageous teen said: Its heartbreaking being in this position and knowing all that hard work has been undone.   I was pretty much back to normal - able to run, dance and play football again - I was  per cent there and only had a bit of a tremor in my leg. After the car crash its worse than its ever been as now its affecting my whole body. During the crash, the other car allegedly ploughed into the groups vehicle, causing Jade to bang her head twice. She first realised there was a problem when she was unable to move her right arm to comfort her friend. Her legs then gave way as she tried to get out of the car. She recalled: On the day I was discharged from Sheffield we were all so happy. That night I had a commercial and street dance class and was so excited to go for the first time in ages.   We had music on in the car, were singing along and just having a really good time. I was talking to my friend when the crash happened and was facing left, I flew forward and banged my head and then again when we stopped. I first noticed that the back of my friends head was bleeding. I went to hug her because she was so upset and my hand wouldnt move, I was so confused. My left arm was moving but when I tried to move my right arm it was just stuck. I tried to stand up getting out of the car and I fell to the floor, my mum had to catch me. She added: In hospital I was just sitting there and couldnt move, my mum was tapping my leg but I couldnt feel anything at all. I was so scared and did panic because Id never had those symptoms before. I had an instinct it was an FND relapse, Id never had those symptoms before so it was a huge shock.   You couldnt make it up that on the day I left physio this happened. It was heartbreaking knowing all the hard work had been undone. Jade was initially treated at Salford Royal Hospital before being transferred to the Royal Albert Edward Infirmary in Wigan. Footage shows how she is unable to sit up unaided. Instead, she is forced to rely on mum Michelle to prop her up. Jade said: From the elbow down on my right arm is paralysed, I cant move or feel it at all. Both my legs are really numb and weak and when I try to stand on them they just collapse. My sitting balance has completely gone - my core and my neck are really weak - and I cant sit straight. It seems like Ive lost all my strength, its like Ive only got the strength of a baby.   Even when Im lying down I have to have pillows under me or I fall to that right side. Its so frustrating not being able to move, all I want to do is get up and back to where I was or at least move instead of just lying in a bed all day. The family have already spent pound, on Jades original treatment. Now, they are raising more funds through GoFundMe to help cover the cost of further treatment needed after the crash. Jade said: Im desperate to get back to physio because weve learnt that intensive rehab is the way forward for me. Its what I need but the only place that provides it is expensive, weve got the proof it works but its hard to get back to that. We didnt put up a GoFundMe at first because we didnt want to ask for money. We didnt want to feel like we were begging for money - it felt wrong.   It took a few months to pluck up the courage to put one together but when we did we got pound in a few hours. We were shocked at the number of people wanting to help. The number of people wanting to help has been amazing. Treatment is expensive but its worth every penny - you cant put a price on it.She added: The dream is to be able to go back to football, dancing and acting - I just want a normal le back. Former NHS worker and mum Michelle, , said: Its heartbreaking seeing what shes going through now after everything. It was devastating seeing her go from a perfectly healthy girl and then go through what she did. Her le was on hold for those seven months as she couldnt go to college or do the things she loved such as football, acting and dancing.  Seeing her be able to run up stairs for the first time since it happened, go for a jog and dance again last month was absolutely amazing - it was the best feeling. [On the day of the crash] traffic had gone to a complete standstill. The woman behind me was apparently picking up popcorn off the floor and careered into the back of us at what felt like -mph. Jade was in the back and had direct impact, it was awful. For this to happen is heartbreaking but Jade has been so positive about it as shes seen she can improve.

Elspeth Moore told doctors her tummy felt like it was on fire but her parents were told she simply had a viral infection. They took her home - without being given advice on how to monitor her symptoms - and she died in her bed several days later as her worried father lay next to her.The inquest was told that despite being diagnosed as having viral gastroenteritis, Elspeth was actually suffering from appendicitis which developed into peritonitis and sepsis .Although the coroner found that the misdiagnosis was reasonable in the circumstances, he did say the hospital should have advised her parents better when they allowed them to take her home. The inquest heard Elspeth had been sent home from school on July  last year, following a bout of diarrhoea, and her parents rushed her to hospital after her GP said she was dehydrated and should be put on an IV drip.  Doctors at Southampton Childrens Hospital, Hants, did not put her on a drip, but instead took her observations, finding she had a fever of .C and an increased heart-rate. They set up a fluid challenge whereby her parents gave her ml of water every five minutes for two hours to seeshe could keep it down. Due to Elspeths parents asking to leave the hospital and continue the fluid challenge at home, a second set of observations were not done. Elspeths parents, who said they werent aware of a need for second observations that would rule out sepsis and appendicitis, asked to take the little girl home to continue the fluid challenge as it was past her bed time. The inquest heard they were allowed to leave without a discharge letter, and were only given verbal advice by the doctor, with nothing in writing to tell them what symptoms to look out for and when to come back to the hospital. Elspeth died in her bed just days later, as her high fever and diarrhoea gave way to vomiting on July , last year. Speaking at Winchester Coroners Court, Hants, Elspeths father, systems analyst Steven Moore, from Lymington, Hants, described their time in the hospital.  He said: We understood Elspeth had viral Gastroenteritis and there werent any antibiotics to be given as it was a virus and it would be something we would have to see out. Mr Moore said that after askingit would be alright to continue giving her fluid at home, he was told staff were happy for her to be discharged. Given that when we arrived we were freaking out, and then to be told actually your daughters got viral Gastroenteritis that will work its way out, I actually felt quite relieved. We werent given specic advice on when to come back or things to look out for. Back at home, Elspeth seemed a little better the next day, eating more food than she had done previously, but by July , she was worse again, and was vomiting. He father said: [That evening] I stayed up, went into Elspeths room every half hour to check on her. At about pm I went in and she was still awake. I said Im going to stay in here with you, and lay down on the floor next to her. I said love you and she said love you daddy. It can only have been five or  minutes later, I heard her making a weird noise, like something was catching in her throat. I said whats that noise all about Elspeth, that doesnt sound right. She didnt respond.   I said do you want to sit up darling. I sat her up, at which point her head just flopped back and her eyes rolled up. Mr and Mrs Moore called an ambulance, but their daughter was pronounced dead just after her arrival at AE in Southampton General Hospital at .am on July . Giving evidence, consultant Dr Faye Hawkins said there was no reason that Elspeths parents couldnt continue with the fluid challenge at home. AE doctor Nicola Trevelyan, who was on call the night of Elspeths death, and head of nursing Louisa Green said lessons had been learned from the death. They said changes were made to ensure paperwork and leaflets be made available to parents taking their children out of hospital, with a new text-messaging system in place to link parents to online advice. Recording a death by natural causes, Central Hampshire coroner Grahame Short said that gastro enteritis was not an unreasonable diagnosis as Elspeth had an unusually positioned appendix. But he said doctors could have advised the parents better. I find however there was insufficient advice given on how to look after Elspeth at home and most importantly what to look out for, he said. Although Dr Hawkins gave general advice it was not clear to them.

Things would be easierthey had the other half of Ken’s miner’s pension, pocketing pound a week instead of pound. But the Government has that – part of the poundbillion that has been raided from miners’ pension pots since .  Ken, , of Tredegar, Gwent, has heard thousands of heartbreaking stories over the past three years as he visited every village and town in the impoverished former pit communities of South Wales, gathering signatures for a petition against the “great pension deception”. And yesterday, he joined colleagues from Yorkshire, the North East, Kent and Nottinghamshire to deliver the ,-name document to Downing Street, demanding back the cash that so many have been “robbed” of. Ken, who worked at Oakdale Colliery, said: “We’ve had tremendous support but it’s been shocking to discover even miners themselves are oblivious to the depths of this betrayal. “Their communities have been destroyed and they’ve been left to scrape by on a pittance while the Government uses their pension billions as a slush fund to dip into at will. “Gathering signatures, I spoke to one widow who gets pound. a week. Her husband spent a letime underground and died at . The Government has had more than its fair share. It’s time to stop.”   The scandal dates to , when British Coal was privatised. The Government vowed to back two funds – the Miners’ Pension Scheme and the British Coal Staff Superannuation Scheme – infor a - split on any surplus earned. It was estimated the funds would earn the Treasury poundbillion over the next  years with members sharing the same sum. But Energy Minister Claire Perry confessed the Government has had pound.billion from the MPS alone since  and the Tories have taken poundmillion since  – poundmillion in  alone. They plan to take another poundmillion over the next three years. Meanwhile, former miners get an average of pound a week.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn – who signed the petition – said: “It is scandalous.“There must be a renegotiation and the Government must correct this injustice.”  In the week marking  years since the end of the - strike, the sense of injustice is still strong. Paul Stevey was an electrician at Manchester’s Agecroft Colliery and is now living in a caravan on a pension of just pound a week. The -year-old, of Allonby, Cumbria, said: “I sold my home six years ago and the caravan was meant to be a stop-gap while I found something smaller. But the cost of living ate into my savings and now I can’t afford to buy a home. I get another pound a week from my late we’s pension but it’s all soon gone once I’ve paid site fees and utilities, I barely have enough to live on.“Even so, that bit of income means I haven’t been able to get Universal Credit or access free training schemes.” Emlyn Davies moved in with daughter Maggie in Mountain Ash, South Wales, six years ago after losing we Gwynneth.The -year-old, in remission from prostate cancer, cut coal by hand from .

The miners never agreed to this - split, the unions didn’t agree – what has happened is criminal.” MPs Jonathan Edwards and Liz Saville Roberts of Plaid Cymru turned out for the petition hand-over at pm. Mick Newton, of the UK Mineworkers’ Pension Association, said efforts compiling it were “testament to the strength of feeling on this”. Minister Claire Perry last year asked the Department for Business to liaise with pension trustees and “explore options” for a review.

Mum-of-two Donna Carter had been overweight for many years before finally realising she wanted to shed the pounds.

The -year-old, of Worksop, Nottinghamshire, said: I realised that I didn’t want to be an embarrassment to her, I wanted her to feel as proud of me as I did of her One Sunday afternoon while watching TV the WW advert came on - I grabbed my iPad, went online and signed up for  months.

I started to feel more positive about actually achieving the milestone I had set myself.

More importantly I have gained so much confidence and I have learned more about the person I am and want to be.

But being a Duchess might not actually be as amazing as we like to think, as there are often many stressful things Kate has to juggle in a day. The mum-of-three must balance her royal le with family le, juggling engagements and s with dropping the kids off at school and finding time to walk the dog. But what other things make up her routine that arent exactly of the norm and how does she really spend her time during the day    Most people find it stressful having to pick one outfit to wear to work, or to go out on a date, but when it comes to daily le for Kate, she often has to plan for more than one occasion. According to Vanity Fair, the -year-old, can have to fit up to five outfit changes into her dayshe is out on royal business - this may include outfits for the school run, visiting a charity, an afternoon tea or a formal dinner. And when shes not out at events and meetings, the Duchess of Cambridge also has to deal with the stress of finding a private moment to enjoy by herself, which with a full household of staff around at all times, can be incredibly dfcult. Even when doing more mundane tasks, such as nipping out to the supermarket spotted in Waitrose, Kate is not alone while pushing the trolley up and down the aisles, but is followed by protection officers.   Despite having staff and a dedicated nanny to look after her children, it is thought that Kate prefers to do a lot of things each day for herself. For example she is often spotted dropping off and picking up her children from school, with Prince George and Princess Charlotte attending two dferent schools. Shes also a keen cook and when shes home she is said to enjoy preparing William a roast chicken dinner, as well as making her own sausages and homemade jams. And back when she was first settling into married le, Vanity Fair reported that Kate would also walk the familys Cocker Spaniel, Lupo, three times a day - though we imagine she has someone to do this for her when shes out on engagements now.   The Duchess has always been very fitness orientated and enjoys activities such as running, cycling and incorporates these ious work outs into her daily le. A royal insider told Mail Online: Kate is an exercise junkie. Pippa and Kate take their toned physiques extremely seriously. The duchess is reportedly also a fan of CrossFit and yoga, makes time to go for a run most days, enjoys cycling, and does all her workouts without a personal trainer!   After all of that is done, Kate may find herself spending the evening at a lavish event, such as the recent BAFTA Awards, where she and William dazzled as they made their way up the red carpet. However what the couple does on their nights off from banquets and balls might surprise you - because its probably the same thing you often find yourself doing after work. Reports say the couple sometimes venture out to their local pub to enjoy a drink, or theyll spend an evening avoiding being photographed by staying in and watching DVDs.   Essentially it seems Kate spends her days very much the same way most working mothers do, iding her time between all of her many responsibilites. However she just so happens to have a designer wardrobe of clothes to do it all in, meaning she looks fabulous no matter the task at hand. She does also have the added benefit of household staff, who can take care of all those pesky issues that arise out of the blue, and doesnt really have to worry too much about childcare what with having a nanny. So while some aspects of her le, such as her lack of privacy, may seem rather stressful and out of the ordinary to us, its fair to say, for the most part, her day to day le sounds pretty good!

Laureline Garcia-Bertaux, , was found dead in her back garden in Richmond upon Thames, south-west London, on Wednesday evening.Before she disappeared, a close friend revealed he thought the man his friend was meeting before the murder a bit suspicious and that he was a charismatic vet. Ms Garcia-Bertaux had been reported missing after she failed to turn up for work at public relations company Golin on Monday. Her friend Daniel Hughes, , told the Press Association he had not seen her for about a month, but had spoken to her best friend, who reported her missing. I think the last point the CCTV caught her was outside a Sainsburys on Saturday evening in Richmond, he said.   She was meant to go shopping in Oxford Street on Sunday, daytime. She was meant to meet a man for coffee on the Sunday evening. Were not sure when the murder took place, whether it was Saturday night or Sunday night. She was meant to move out of that house on Monday morning.  She met him in a shop or something like that and then he must have chatted to her then and they arranged a coffee on Sunday evening, he said. We dont knowshe went out to meet him or not because we dont know what the point was when that happened. Mr Hughes, who said he previously worked with Ms Garcia-Bertaux at the Discovery Channel, said she was single and lived alone with her two dogs.   Shes tall, got a lot of presence. Always very friendly, very talkative, would never have hurt anyone. Got a lot of confidence and passion, a lovely lady. She had a lot of friends as well, including me, he said. Im pretty harrowed about it. Ive been in that house, Ive been in that garden. Its creepy, its upset me quite a lot.  Members of Ms Garcia-Bertauxs family, who are believed to have flown into the UK from France, have been informed of developments and are being supported by specially trained officers, police said. No-one has been arrested and a post-mortem examination is to be carried out. A large police cordon has been put in place around the scene in Darell Road which extends to cover the garden and passageway area at the back of the terraced property.   With the noise of playing children echoing from a nearby school, forensics officers in blue suits could be seen erecting a large tent, with evidence markers visible down the narrow alley between a number of homes. Neighbour Bob Bassett, , told the Press Association that he knew of Ms Garcia-Bertaux, and would speak to her about her two large dogs.  She was quiet. I never saw a boyfriend, he said, adding that as far as he knows she lived in the ground-floor flat alone, and was originally from France. Another neighbour who did not want to be named said he had previously seen her with a Leonberger - a large breed of dog. He said others on the street have told him they had seen a man visiting the property now and again, and added: I did not see her very much.

The case, involving a girl who reports say was  when she became pregnant to Magers, then aged  and unemployed, has alarmed pro-choice campaigners. The case is set to become a flash-point in the controversial abortion issue that continues to dominate political debate in the United States. Pro-choice activists fear a conservative majority on the US Supreme Court could see the landmark Roe v. Wade decision that enshrined womens access to abortion struck down.Fox reported that Magers was able to file the lawsuit because voters in Alabama, a conservative state, had passed an amendment to its constitution to recognise the personhood of a foetus months earlier. Baby Roe’s innocent le was taken by the profiteering of the Alabama Women’s Center and while no court will be able to bring Baby Roe back to le, we will seek the fullest extent of justice on behalf of Baby Roe and Baby Roe’s father, Attorney Brent Helms said of Magers case in a statement reported by Fox. He said the case was set to break legal ground, calling for consistency in Alabama: Either we fully acknowledge the personhood of the unborn or we cherry pick which innocents we protect and which ones we trash for profit.” The Washington Post reported that the girl was  when she became pregnant. Speaking anonymously to the newspaper to protect his daughters privacy, her father said the family is distraught over the lawsuit. He claimed Magers was  and unemployed when they discovered she was pregnant, and the relationship has ended.    We had a long discussion over what she was going to do when she got pregnant. And we said we would support her either way, he told the Post.They weren’t married, and I felt legally it was her right to make that decision. The lawsuit was reportedly filed by Personhood Alabama and praised by pro-le lobby groups, including the Personhood Alliance, as other Republican states look set to attempt to follow its suit. However similar attempts to use the legal concept of identity for an embryo in the US courts have not been clear-cut, as the high profile case involving Modern Family star Sophia Vergara revealed. The actress has been locked in a dragging legal battle for years with her ex Nick Loeb over two embryos the couple froze in case they needed them for fertility treatment in the future.  She is remarried and wants the embryos destroyed, but Loeb, who has even named the cell clusters Emma and Isabella, wants to keep them. The lawsuit has continued in Louisiana without resolution. NARAL Pro-Choice America president Ilyse Hogue called the latest lawsuit scary in a tweet on Tuesday, writing: First under Alabamas new personhood law, asserting womans rights third in line. Very scary case. US media is reporting abortion rights groups are alarmed because it is the first case in the state naming an unborn foetus as a person in the lawsuit. Activists view the moves as an attempt to recognise embryos and foetuses as separate from the women who carry them. They fear the judge allowing Magers to name the foetus as a co-plaintf in the suit for wrongful death will open the floodgates to similar cases. Campaigners say it presents a worrying direction, after cases of the concept being used to accuse women of abuse or punish mothers who choose their own birth plans against doctors advice emerged, the Post reported. In one case, a mother lost custody of her child when she delivered her baby by vaginal birth instead of the C-section her doctors had insisted upon. In others, pregnant woman who had miscarriages after drinking alcohol or took drugs - including prescription drugs - have been accused of child abuse. The Alabama Womens Centre is reportedly preparing to fight the case, which it called unprecedented, the Post said.

For many people, there is a wonderful satisfaction that comes from popping a pimple - it’s almost euphoric, says Traube.  You not only relieve the physical pressure of the blockage, theres a pleasant mental effect as well from the release of dopamine, your brain’s happy chemical. Not only does this happen when you attend to your own spots, but it can also be experienced when you turn your attentions to someone s too. But whats the motivation  Well, here comes the good news and the bad news.   Firstly, the good news. According to Traube it is one surefire way of demonstrating love and committment. As disgusting as it might sound to some, that you would pick your partners pimples, that does show a certain closeness, a bond, an attachment between you and your partner, says Traube. If someone is on a first or second date, I don’t think you’re going in for a pimple pop. Or certainly run for the hillsthey do... However, it could also be a sign that you want to fix your partner, or that theyre trying to fix you.   For many, the skin itself can be a metaphor for the person or the relationship, Traube adds. Its kind of analogous to finding a solution. You look at it and go, Ew, it doesnt feel right, its on my partner, I need to fix it. In some regards, its a way to improve your husband. Or it could be a sign theyre stressed and need a release. The takeaway, Traube explains, is thatyour other half enjoys squeezing your spots, its more about them than it is about you. The key, he advises, is to be honest with themyou dont like that. Thats pretty important in relationships too.

The woman, in her s, was held captive for two days in the dirty shed in Meningie, South Australia, by twisted Gene Charles Bristow. She was shackled to a couch, stripped naked and sexually abused multiple times during her horric ordeal, a court heard. She also had her phone taken from her so couldnt call for help. Th backpacker, from Europe, had been initially contacted by Bristow after she posted an advert online looking for farm work. She believed she had been given a job, but after being driven to Bristows farm, she was locked up in the shed, prosecutors said.   The images of inside the building were shown to the District Court of South Australia during the farmers trial for kidnapping and rape. They depict the couch the woman alleged she was tied to, as well as the sheds filthy floor, metal roof and large bales of hay. Other disturbing pictures show the chains used to shackle the tourist, and a replica gun that was used to threaten her, ABC.net reports. This week, Bristow, , was found guilty of the aggravated kidnapping, rape and indecent assault of the woman, who cannot be legally named. Jurors had deliberated for just three hours. The court heard the crimes took place in , when Bristow lived on the farm with his we of  years, his son and his sons partner.   In the days before the attack, the farmer carried out sickening Internet searches for shackles, handcuffs and date rape drug Rohypnol. Responding to the womans online ad, he told lies about his farm - including that there was a vacant position, the court was told. He arranged to collect the backpacker and drive her to the property. But once there, he took her inside the pig shed, according to The Advertiser. Michael Foundas, prosecuting, said that Bristow used a fake gun to threaten the woman before locking her up in the shed. The victim told the court she had her hands tied behind her back with cable ties and her feet shackled with chains by the farmer. She said she feared she was going to die there.  The court heard the shed was out of view of Bristows family home. At one point during her ordeal, the woman found a way to break free from her chains and used her laptop to alert her loved ones and police. Although Bristow had taken her phone, the laptop was still in the shed. Bravely, after sending the messages, the woman decided to reshackle herself because it was dark and she did not know where to run to. She had been threatened with deathshe tried to flee, Mr Foundas said. Her courageous actions led to her escape. Police began searching the area, which caused Bristow to panic and decide to release his victim.   He dropped her off at a motel before leaving, the court was told. Bristows defence team did not contest the woman had stayed overnight at the site, but claimed she wasnt held against her will, the BBC reports. They also denied that any sexual assault had taken place. But the farmer, who had pleaded not guilty, was convicted by jurors. He nows faces up to le behind bars when he is sentenced.

She played with her friends and spent time with her family just like every other child. But when she turned eight everything changed. She started noticing people looked at her strangely and pointed. Some parents wouldnt let their children play with her. Yulianna, who is now , has a huge birthmarkwhich covers most of her back and stretches around to her stomach. She also has smaller marks over the rest of her body, including lots on her legs. Speaking to , she said: I was quite a happy and carefree child. Before I was eight-years-old, I didnt pay much attention to my birthmarks.I remember myself looking at my skin in the mirror pretty much without any particular emotions. But after eight I started to notice all these eyes on me and fingers that were point on my legs, and words that people liked to say. In three words - I was bullied. It wasnt only comments, parents of another children didnt let me to play with their kids because they thought that I was contagious. As Yulianna, who lives in Warsaw in Poland, got older things only got worse and after years of teasing she started to just stay at home and only go outside when it was dark.  When I was  or  years old, I went with my friend to the beach, and of course people looked at me. Some old woman come to me with her advice on how to remove my warts, some waitresses in the cafe said unkindwords to me. Lots of things likethis happened that morning. My friend said to me oh my God, Julie! Walking with you just like walking with a monkey. I know it was just words and in some ways it was a joke.I wasnt angry at her, but after this I began to just sitat home all summer and walked for one or two hours in the evenings when it was dark.  I would just ask why me , why do I deserve this and thought that nobody would ever love girl with a black and hairy back. I was thinking that boys would never pick up me because they have choice to pick up a normal girl with perfect skin. I was a dalmatian, a giraffe, a cow, I was dirty, people thought thatthey spoke to me my birthmarks would jump at them. But when she grew older she decided enough was enough and it was time to start loving her body. I was so tired of hiding and being afraid of people, of their reactions and actions. I was hating myself for the weakness and that I felt so much pity towards myself. I then understood that nobody would help me just myself, to bring me up with my confidence.   The first thing I thought when I started analyze the reactions is that maybe % people really didnt know what it is. So in some point they were afraid of it.And then I understood thatthey all knew maybe my le and lives of the other kids and adults with CMN would be much easier. She set up an Instagram account to show off photos of her birthmark and her le, and she now has just shy of , followers.   She said: Im happy I did. I want to be happy, healthy, feel beautul and confident and sexy in my own skin and I am now. But it’s been a long way to this.

He got the wire out of his finger last week.“He can start his comeback proper and he’s keeping Andrew Davies company at the moment – they’ve done a lot together on the bikes and they’re doing running on the training ground so it’s great to see them coming back.”Meanwhile, two bodies he’d like back sooner are nearing aand Jim is hoping he’ll have his striking options boosted for Saturday’s home clash with Hearts.Frontmen Andrew Nelson and Craig Curran missed the - defeat to Rangers last midweek but have a chance of athis week.“They are coming on, slow,” Jim said.“They aren’t back on the training ground yet but we’re hoping we’ll have at least one back training by the end of the week.“Craig had an injection in his stomach last week which has settled down nicely but it needs time.“Nelson is his heel which he picked up celebrating his goal at Livingston.“Again that is better but it’s not fully away yet.“What we don’t want to do is bring him back too early and there is a recurrence.“We’ve tried a couple of dferent things but he was tender last week and we had to back off.“It was better over the weekend so we’ll see what he’s like by the end of the week.”At Ibrox, Jim opted for on-loan forward Scott Wright to lead the line in an attempt to catch Steven Gerrard’s Rangers on the hop with pace and will have that option again. However, he’d welcome goalscorer Nelson and “focal point” Curran back.The Dens gaffer said: “Craig has been a focal point for us and brings a lot of people into play in terms of the work he puts in and how he doesn’t let defenders settle.“We went for pace against Rangers by putting Scott Wright up and pace on the sides with Jesse Curran and Andy Dales.“That wasn’t an easy decision because we had Kenny Miller’s experience there as well but we felt we could get down the sides of them when their full-backs went forward but we met them on a night when they were excellent.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/pressandjournal/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/12/magellan_cruise_-1-e1546007762270-940x521.jpg ","title":"buy one get one free set sail with the tele on a luxury cruise to norway and the scottish isles departing from dundee","story":"Tele readers will be able to enjoy the best sights Norway and Scotland have to offer when the paper sets sail on its very own cruise adventure.The exclusive Tele voyage on the majestic Magellan cruise ship  will depart on a nine-night tour around some of the most breath-taking scenery in the world.With up to , passengers, the glamorous ship will visit awe-inspiring fjords and some of Scotland’s stunning islands.A convenient departure from the Port of Dundee means you can look forward to leaving the hassles of airports behind and get straight into holiday mode.The journey evokes nostalgic memories of the days when The Tele#s parent company ran a famous shipping line in the s.There will be plenty of entertainment on board as well during the special trip # all organised by The Tele#s owners DC Thomson and ship operator Cruise and Maritime Voyages.Fresh delights will await every day as a dedicated team of expert chefs and attentive restaurant staff serve up delicious meals and a luxurious evening dining experience with up to five courses.Magellan, named after the great explorer Ferdinand Magellan, offers an incredible iety of activities within its ftframe, including a show lounge, pubs, coffee shops, casino and shopping galleria.The Tele Magellan voyage departs from Dundee on June  , and arrives back in Greenock  days later # after taking in sights including Flam, Bergen and Portree.While best known these days for its industry-leading publishing work, DC Thomson has a long and proud association with the sea.Following his success in business, William Thomson II looked to the seas and purchased a stake in a sailing ship.His involvement escalated over the years when he purchased more vessels.Eventually, with a fleet of , the Thomson family was responsible for one of the most invaluable shipping firms in the world and provided essential aid to South Africa during the Boer War.Andrew Thomson, chairman of DC Thomson, said: “It’s wonderful to see DC Thomson realigning with its heritage by ing to the seas.“When William Thomson established the Thomson Shipping Line in the th century I’m sure he didn’t contemplate that over  years later DC Thomson would be transporting passengers by ship around the Scottish Isles and Norway.“This kind of ersication of the business is a great fit for DC Thomson.”Craig Houston, head of enterprise for DC Thomson Media, said: “Working with Cruise  Maritime Voyages to bring this highly desirable sailing route to DC Thomson Travel customers has been a pleasure.“We’re excited to be offering such a special route with a trusted partner and we can’t wait to hear what our passengers say about this amazing trip.”"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee gaffer mcintyre delighted at signing winger josh todd","story":"Dundee manager Jim McIntyre is “delighted” to have secured the pre-contract signing of winger Josh Todd.The -year-old has impressed at Queen of the South over the past year and the Dens Park boss says he’s been a fan of the former St Mirren man for a while.The Tele revealed back in January the Dark Blues were making a move for the Englishman to bring him in at the end of his contract after he shone for the Doonhamers in their - Scottish Cup draw at Dens Park.Todd set up the opening goal for Stephen Dobbie and was a constant menace to the home defence – something Jim is hoping to see from the midfielder in his side next season.He said: “Josh Todd is a player I have liked for a while.“I went to watch him a couple of times before we played them and he did exceptionally well and then did really well in the game here at Dens.“I’m delighted we managed to do that so I’m looking forward to seeing him in the summer.“He’s not a traditional winger that’ll hit the byline but he makes great runs beyond the strikers and he’s got a goal in him.“He’s an athlete, he can get up and down the pitch, has really good conditioning and knows where the goal is.“He’s also quick.

but it’s a crazy league.“Weeks ago, nobody would have seen us going to Tynecastle and getting a result so there will be ups and downs and we have to stick together.“We’ve looked through the Rangers game and seen what we can do better defensively as a team and take that on to the next bunch of games to get some points on the board.”With no match over the weekend due to the Scottish Cup taking priority, it’s been a welcome break for the Dark Blues after a couple punishing results.Woods hopes the breather will allow them to up their game when Hearts come calling on Saturday.“I think it’s been a tough run of games so it’s been good to sit back, reflect and get ready to go again,” he added.“We’ll work on a few things in the training ground and take it into the next bunch of games which are going to be vital.“We have a couple of tough ones coming up with Hearts at home, which we hope to get something out of, and then Celtic at home will be a day we have to be disciplined and get off to a lot better start than we did at Rangers.”If they keep their discipline and manage to up their level from the first half at Ibrox, Woods is confident their luck will turn to help them make it two wins in a row against Hearts, after their -

They will cause problems.”Reynolds, meanwhile, is happy to see no astroturf surfaces on the horizon after missing recent away trips to Queen of the South and Falkirk on physio’s orders.“That’s the last game on plastic pitches so, unless we go to the play-offs and have to play on one it’ll be fine.“It was just too early, that’s me not long back from a cruciate ligament injury so the advice from the physios was not to play on it and not risk it.“They were the guys that got me back so it would be daft not to listen to them.”"},{"url":null,"title":"former dundee united defender harry souttar called into australian squad","story":"Former Dundee United defender Harry Souttar has been called into the Australia U  squad.The -year-old, who is on loan at Fleetwood Town from current employers Stoke City, has accepted a call-up for Australia’s Olympic qualication squad for their training camp in Malaysia and qualiers in Cambodia.Souttar has already represented Scotland at U  and U  level and, along with brother John, is poised to be the first Scottish siblings to play for dferent countries.John made his international debut last year after Hearts boss Craig Levein warned Scotland risked losing him to Australia because he was eligible to play for the Socceroos.Harry had previously insisted it was his dream to play for Scotland.He#s eligible to play for Australia through his mother, who was born in Australia.He stressed two years ago during Scotland U ’s Elite Round qualiers in Czech Republic he was desperate to play for his country.He said: “My ambition has always been to play for Scotland.

He has marshalled a slight upturn in fortunes in recent weeks which has only been offset by the improved form of their relegation rivals Hamilton Accies and St Mirren, also.However, for Macca, it won’t be job done until Dundee are mathematically safe.And that is a long way off, as they sit in the relegation play-off place, three points behind Accies and only one ahead of the Buddies.Tonight, the Tele takes a look at the Dark Blues’ run-in to the split to see where they can pick up much-needed points.Dundee v Hearts # Saturday, March One of Dundee’s four wins this season, and their only one against a team which currently occupies the top six, came at Tynecastle at the end of January.That - success in Gorgie, coupled with the Jambos’ recent struggles – they are without a win in their last four league outings – will give the Dark Blues confidence going into Saturday’s clash at Dens Park.However, the Dee have only won once at home all season and need that to changethey are to have any hopes of staying in the ision.It’s must-win, for me, and I think they will rise to the occasion.Verdict: Three points.Dundee v Celtic # Sunday, March A game in which Dundee will not be judged on come the end of the season but one,they keep it tight at the back, could see them sneak a valuable point.However, I fancy Celtic to go on a really good run as they look to wrap up eight titles in a row under new manager Neil Lennon.They’ll have too much.Verdict: No points.St Mirren v Dundee # Saturday, March One word. Ten letters. Hyphenated. Six-pointer.If the teams go into this one still practically neck and neck, which I expect they will, a win would be extremely valuable for both.However, I feel, with the enormity of the occasion, they will cancel each other out in Paisley.Verdict: One point.St Johnstone v Dundee # Wednesday, April The Dee and Saints have had some tasty encounters in recent seasons and this one should be no dferent with both teams likely to still have plenty to play for.St Johnstone may still be in the mix for the top six while Dundee’s situation is self-explanatory.I fancy the Dark Blues for this one, they play better on the road and have more to lose than the Perth men.Verdict: Three points.Dundee v Aberdeen # Saturday, April You have to go back to November  for the last time Dundee got a win of any sorts against the Dons.That’s a run of  games without a win, with  losses in a row.That run has to end at some point, so I’ll back the Dee for a hard-earned draw.Verdict: One point.Total points: Eight points.That would leave Dundee with  going into the split and, you would like to think, put them in a decent position to stay up. That is, depending on how Hamilton and St Mirren get on with their fixtures .Hamilton – Motherwell , Hearts , Kilmarnock , Livingston , St Mirren .Verdict: Five points.St Mirren – Kilmarnock , St Johnstone , Dundee , Celtic , Hamilton .Verdict: Eight points.That would leave Hamilton level and St Mirren a point behind Dundee."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/03/medw-tele-sports-podcast-twa-teams-4-846x564.jpg ","title":"podcast twa teams one street must win weekend ahead for dundee and united after disappointments","story":"This week, the Tele#s sports reporters George Cran and Calum Woodger are joined by the newsdesk colleague David Wren as they discuss Dundee United#s trip to Partick and Hearts# visit to play Dundee at Dens Park on Saturday.

wide-ranging public art programme of which Rest Spaces is one part, said she thought it was ldquorather magnicent.Adding that, cumulatively, the artworks being created along the riverside would make walking in the area a more interesting experience she said: \"There might well be some detractors but we are all iniduals.\"Councillor Ken Gowans, who was a vocal critic of the previous \"tilting pier\" proposals shelved several years ago, said he was more relaxed about the Bank Street installation.\"It will be in a very busy and popular location, especially with tourists, and I suspect it will add some interest to that part of the river,\" he said.Their remarks were made as other councillors continued to voice anger over revelations that the larger scale curving walls artwork proposed for a site close to the Ness Islands has been nodded through by planning officers rather than being put before elected members.Previously called The Gathering Place and My Ness, but referred to as My River Ness in the recently approved application, this artwork involves two crescent-shaped walls curving out from opposite sides of the river.Having been approved by officers under delegated powers councillors have reportedly been told there is now no way to call it in to the planning committeeNess-side SNP councillor Ron MacWilliam said he is set to meet with Inverness city centre manager David

impact assessment which has never been revised to reflect the new location and design.\"Common sense tells you that not a soul will visit Inverness to view this utterly boring creation.\"He added: \"As things stand it appears that as a member of the Inverness city committee, a trustee of the Inverness common good fund and member of the south planning applications committee I, and therefore the people I am elected to represent, have not been involved in the decision-making.\"Inverness West councillor Bill Boyd, who also sits on the planning committee, said he has written to officers to complain about the way the application has been dealt with.However Councillor Graham Ross, depute provost for Inverness, said it was his understanding that the application had been advertised following normal procedures and had failed to attract enough objections to require it to go to committee.\"The decision to approve was then taken under delegated powers, which means it met with all the planning regulations,\" he said.Thursday  Mar  : PM"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04119000/04119894.jpg","title":"Smoking not wanted at

This area of Argyll is the most fragile in the region. The people of Argyll, businesses and visitors deserve no less.Forget the squandering of £m on unreliable, mitigation measures trying to justy a flawed decision made many years ago to use the Old Military Road as a ersion which has failed on many occasions and now has a landslip between the two roads. Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less. In  at Dawlish .km of double tracked railway and .km of sturdy seawall was built at a cost of £m in eight weeks.

Transport Minister Michael Matheson, Transport Scotland and our Government must abandon their obsession with mitigation measures and fund a permanent solution.

A long ball to the right hand side was met by Ryan Caskie who cut the ball back to Stuart McLean. The youngster took a touch before slotting past the Pupils# goalkeeper to give Star a - lead.Star continued to press and doubled their lead when Coll McCallum robbed the Pupils# defender on the edge of the box before cutting the ball across goal. The unfortunate Pupils# defender could only ert the ball into the empty net, with McLean waiting on a tap in. The game continued at a frantic pace, however, there was no further scoring in the first half and Star went in with a - advantage.Pupils came out with purpose in the second half as they looked to force themselves back into the game, however, it was a howler from Red Star which allowed them back into the match.A square ball across the back resulted in a mix-up between Star keeper Luke Kalache and defender Ben Forbes which allowed Donald McCallum to prod the ball home from just inside the box and Pupils were back in the game at - with eight second half minutes gone.The home side didn’t recover from this and you could sense a nervousness that gave the visitors plenty encouragement. The equaliser arrived with  minutes remaining when good play from Pupils down the right by Soudan saw him get a low cross in which was met by the on-rushing run of Ryan Deans and he finished well to level the score at -.This set up a frantic finish and both sides could have nicked it towards the end. Pupils went close with a headed effort which was clawed to safety while at the other end there was a goalmouth scramble which Star couldn’t convert and both sides had to settle for a draw in the end as referee Jimmy Litster blew for full time.Red Star were dealt a blow as it emerged that captain Aaron Moore suffered a dislocated shoulder. Hopefully this will not keep him out for too long.On Saturday February , Star have another important home game as they look to move off the bottom of the table when they take on Claremont AFC.

Shoppers stopped in their tracks and shopkeepers stood on their doorsteps to honour an Ayrshire soldier. Police sealed off the High Street to cars as the cortege arrived at the Kirk Port entrance to the Auld Kirk. The silence was broken only by the lament of a lone piper as Jock’s family filed their way into church. Jock’s coffin was carried into a packed service by men of the Scottish and North Irish Yeomanry. His coffin was draped in a union flag and on top were his cap, belt, his campaign medals and a wreath. A dozen colleagues in the firing party formed a guard of honour after the coffin had passed under the  lych gate. Jock, , lived in Dundonald with second we Gigliola, better known as Julie. And he ran a log and firewood business, as well as being a yeomanry reservist. He was laid to rest with full military honours at Drongan where he spent his boyhood and where parents Dan and Rita live. The father-of-two died six days after his armoured car overturned at the Catterick Garrison in Yorkshire on January . Among the mourners in the Auld Kirk was Colonel John Dalrymple Hamilton, who was representing Prince Charles. Provost Helen Moonie of South Ayrshire Council also attended the service. And there was military top brass from both regiments in which Jock served –the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards and the Scottish and North Irish Yeomanry. Other regiments represented included the Royal Engineers, the Royal Artillery, the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers and the Le Guards. Members of the Army Cadet Force were also present to pay their respects. Jock was  years in the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards, rising to be a Challenger tank commander. He survived tours of duty in Iraq, Kuwait and Kosovo, only to die in a training exercise. Auld Kirk minister Rev David Gemmell described how John McKelvie ‘grabbed le by the throat’ from his earliest days. He wasn’t much of a scholar at Drongan Primary and Auchinleck Academy, but he knew every creature that ran, crawled, swam or flew in the countryside. And a love of the great outdoors was a huge part of his le – whether it was fishing, playing rugby, ski-ing or mountain biking.  He and we Julie were fond of dogs, and Julie taught her big action man how to ride a horse, said the minister. Major Richard Boyle of the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards read the lesson - ‘To every thing there is a season’ from Ecclesiastes. There were hilarious army anecdotes from best buddy JR Ewing, telling how they had shot at each other - with paintballs. J R also mentioned how when Jock was rebuked by a French officer in Kosovo, the big man pointed to his Royal Scots Dragoon Guards cap badge – a French eagle with the word Waterloo underneath. J R, his voice breaking, concluded by saying: “He was the best soldier I ever served with and my best friend.” Former RSDG officer Will Galbraith highlighted Jock’s pride in his regiment, his family and his friends. He said: “He had a strong sense of honour, of right and wrong, and would always stand up for the underdog.” Will said: “He was a big man, with a big voice and a big heart – a big character. But when you really got to know him, he was a big softie – although you wouldn’t tell him that. You had to be aware of those big hands.” Army chaplain Rev Duncan Macpherson said there were bound to be feelings of frustration, anger and regret at the way John McKelvie died. He hoped these would be resolved, adding: “He was someone who was thoroughly tested, who rose to the challenge and who was a thoroughly professional soldier. He was passionate about vehicles and made sure his was ready for any task.” Lt Colonel Toby Gaddum, commanding officer of the Scottish and North Irish Yeomanry, led the congregation in the regimental prayer. Rev David Gemmell brought the church service to an end by poignantly reciting “We Let You Go’. The poem ends: “We love you, we miss you, we want you to be happy. Go safely, go dancing, go running home.” A collection at the end of the service raised vital cash for the Ayrshire Yeomanry Families Fund. Jock was laid to rest at Drongan Cemetery, where a guard of honour fired three volleys from their rles.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnPrince CharlesRoyal Scots Dragoon GuardsSouth Ayrshire CouncilMiddle EastArmed forcesRoyal FamilyLove and romanceDundonaldAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"ayr boxing king calvin mccord","story":"NewsAyr boxing king Calvin McCord crowned Scottish Lightweight Champion after thrilling bout at Trump TurnberryThe Ayr star won his first Scottish title in an exciting bout before a sell-out crowd in the Donald J Trump ballroom.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR NewsCalvin McCord celebrates with his title\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailRing king Calvin McCord told how he got off the canvas twice to land his first Scottish title.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":null,"title":"college staging wine fuelled feast","story":"NewsCollege staging wine-fuelled feast as job cuts loomLeaked emails tell of lavish bash at cash-strapped Ayrshire CollegeShareByStephen Houston:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR News\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailCollege bosses have defended holding a celebration to honour their success amid a climate of drastic job cuts and cash problems.

Chairman Willie Mackie said: “She has made a signicant contribution to Ayrshire for over  years.” Ms Dunk retired on February , leaving an impending restructure which will cost jobs. A consultation ends tomorrowand it has emerged the Private Finance Initiative which built the Kilwinning campus is a huge drain on funds. An email which Ms Dunk sent to staff in January read: “We need to make signicant savings to be financially sustainable due to the costs associated with the PFI, unfunded national bargaining costs and the increasing costs of pensions, utilities and other services. I am very disappointed that an organisational review is necessary, it is not what I want to be focused on in my last weeks as principal. “However, we must manage within the financial allocation we receive in this very dficult fiscal climate.” Under the consultation, one of the four vice-principals would be axed, three directors culled, heads of learning cut from  to nine, and three marketing coms staff would go. Also at risk of the chop are two posts within estates as well as a shake-up of duties among departments. The board of management will approve the final structure and staff impacted will get a severance package. Ayrshire College acknowledged finance was a major challenge for all Scottish colleges but said the dinner costs were met by sponsorship. A spokeswoman said: “Our main financial challenge for the year ahead is to meet the costs associated with the Kilwinning PFI Campus, national bargaining costs and the increasing costs of pensions, utilities and services. “While the Scottish Funding Council has agreed to provide further strategic funds to help manage these rising costs, the college still requires to make signicant savings to secure its financial sustainability and jobs for the future. “We are, therefore, considering proposals for an organisational review. “All staff are aware of the challenges the college faces, and have contributed to a consultation regarding potential efficiencies and opportunities for income generation. “We have just passed our five-year anniversary as Ayrshire College, and have planned an event, ‘Celebrating Five Years of Success. It is important to recognise this milestone and celebrate success – for learners, staff, the college and the region. “We are mindful of the costs of holding such an event and so have secured full sponsorship.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnUniversities and CollegesAyr NewsAyrEducationKilmarnockSchoolsKilwinning"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"end line rnli ayr charity","story":"NewsEnd of the line for RNLI Ayr charity branchThe Royal National Leboat InstitutionAyr branch announced their closure after it struggled to keep afloat.Share Ayr branch announced their closure after it struggled to keep afloat.\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _emp_ayp_rnliJPG.jpg\" data-tracking\"facebook|share|\" Ayr branch announced their closure after it struggled to keep afloat.\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _emp_ayp_rnliJPG.jpg\" data-tracking\"messenger|share|\" Ayr branch announced their closure after it struggled to keep afloat.\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _emp_ayp_rnliJPG.jpg\" data-tracking\"twitter|share|\" Ayr branch announced their closure after it struggled to keep afloat.\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _emp_ayp_rnliJPG.jpg\" data-tracking\"whatsapp|share|\" Ayr branch announced their closure after it struggled to keep afloat.\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _emp_ayp_rnliJPG.jpg\" data-tracking\"linkedin|share|\" Ayr branch announced their closure after it struggled to keep afloat.\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _emp_ayp_rnliJPG.jpg\" data-tracking\"flipboard|share|\" Ayr branch announced their closure after it struggled to keep afloat.\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _emp_ayp_rnliJPG.jpg\" data-tracking\"email|share|\"ByAbi Smillie:,  MAR NewsAlicia Watson , Robin Whiteand David Macpherson\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailIt’s the end of an era for a le-saving charity branch following failed attempts to gain members and volunteers. The Royal National Leboat InstitutionAyr branch announced their closure after it struggled to keep afloat. The branch, which has been around for over  years, issued an urgent appeal last November, appealing for a younger generation to pitch in to save the Ayr branch . Committee member and Secretary Robin White, said: “Sadly the number of volunteers helping to run the branch recently has been dwindling, to such an extent that so few are left the AGM came to the sad decision to close the branch down. However, a number of branch members have indicated they still wish to support the RNLI and will now do so via the Troon Branch. “This Branch is looking for new volunteers, soyou would like to help, please get in touch.” Ayr once had its own Leboat, stationed at Ayr Harbour in  under the management of Ayr Harbour Trust.   During the following  years a number of dferent Leboats were in service, one of which was built in Shadwell, London in  for just under pound. This was transported from London to Ayr Station by rail free of charge, by the London and North Western Railway Company. It was taken down Ayr High Street to Ayr Harbour and christened the ‘Janet Hoyle’, after the donor’s we. Eventually in  the RNLI Committee of Management decided to close the station as Troon had a motor Leboat where there was deemed a safer harbour entrance. There was then no RNLI presence in the town until the late ’s when a group of people decided to start a Fundraising Branch. This has been in existence ever since and has raised well over pound, in its time.

Now a row has broken out after it emerged one council department had not even bothered to speak to another. The unsightly corral cluster for five bins was secured in place near The Cross in Troon without any consultation. Troon Councillors have now become aware after a multitude of complaints. The cleansing department is claiming they contacted the planning department about the placing of the bins. But planners are denying any knowledge of a consultation. Troon SNP Councillor Craig Mackay is now leading the charge to find somewhere  for the bins to be situated, rather than outside the Jade Garden Chinese and Macintyre’s bar. He is asking for officials to meet councillors at the spot in Templehill to try and find a resolution. Councillor Mackay said: “We are trying to develop a coherent vision for our town centre. “I’m not convinced this is the best we can manage for such a high profile location. Cleansing regrettably installed these enclosures without any prior consultation. While it is arguably an operational matter that doesn’t require any such input,they had asked any of the councillors or the community council for comment then I am certain we would not have found ourselves in this situation. “The council’s Planning service disappointingly also appear not to have been consulted on the siting or design of this bin store within the conservation area. I don’t wish to play departments off against each other, but would seek to find a community consensus about what is appropriate for our public realm. “This will almost certainly involve an alternative solution for the bins.” A council spokesman confirmed they are investigating, saying: ““We introduced communal bins to keep the litter secure and away from gulls. The early indications are that this system is working well, however we are currently reviewing the location of the bins.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnScottish National PartyTroonAyrAyr News"},{"url":null,"title":"look out sooty sweep heading","story":"NewsLook out, Sooty and Sweep are heading to AyrStage show insists laughs will come thick and fast at Ayr GaietyShareByStephen Houston:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR News \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailSooty is set to SWEEP into Ayr next month.

The story focusses on protagonist Charity Hope Valentine who is desperate to find her Mr Right.She works at the seedy Fandango Ballroom but has dreams of moving on to bigger things.But it may eventually be the performers themselves who reach the top ndash as their talent shone all evening. In the opening scenes Carla, Jan Bairdand Ruth Davidsonwowed the sell-out crowd with their renditions of classics including You Should See Yourself and Big Spender.And just when it looked as though Charity may have found the one when she meets Italian film star Vittorio Vidal, played by Jack McAulay, she ends up spending the night in his closet as his partner Ursulas home.The cast mastered their American accents, while Jackrsquos Italian twang seemed second nature. And he also impressed with his powerful performance of Too Many Tomorrows.Charity however gets her second chance when she gets stuck in a lt with Oscar ndash a claustrophobic accountant hilariously played by Clark Eaton Turner.Clark is no stranger to the Volunteer Hall stage, and it is clear that the versatile actor can turn his hand to anything. Everything looks well for the dance hall hostess, as Oscar proposes.But the wedding plans are dropped ndash and Charity has to find happiness within herself.On an evening of such commanding performances, it can be easy to forget the people who also work so hard behind the scenes to create this spectacle.Producer and musical director Jeff Thomson deserves huge credit as does choreographer Marie McCullough who obviously worked tirelessly.The sets are brilliantly designed and the scene-changes are swt. The orchestra was also given a deserved ovation at the end. There wasnrsquot a note out of place.Sweet Charity is running this week at the Volunteer Hall, Galashiels, until Saturday, March .

Ally Bally Bee - with a trail of children in his wake.Coltart also lived at houses in Henderson Close and Park Street, which have both since been demolished.And he was known to travel to nearby Melrose and Selkirk, as well as other Borders towns, to sell his candy on the streets.An appeal in January for further information on Robert Coltart saw Angela receive messages from across Scotland and even Canada, which helped with the final design.Historian Mary added: ldquoRobert Coltartrsquos story is one that many more people should know about and I hope this sculpture will encourage people to find out how the famous song Coulterrsquos Candy came to be written by a weaver from Galashiels.The finished tribute in the Market Square will become part of a new town trail, supported by the Scottish Government.Around pound, of improvements are planned as part of the regeneration of the town centre.Helen Calder of Energise Galashiels Trust, who has also championed Coltartrsquos story, said: ldquoWe want Galashiels to be a more vibrant, welcoming and confident community.\"The tale of Robert Coltart embodies this vision, and we are delighted progress is now being made to finally celebrate his link to our town.The funding from the Scottish Government is also supporting new visitor signage and improvements to Channel Street and Douglas Bridge, as well as helping to fund the Great Tapestry of Scotland visitor attraction.The town trail will include the location of Robert Coltartrsquos one bedroom flat in Overhaugh Street, which he shared with his family.Councillor Mark Rowley, who is the spokesman for business, said: ldquoIn line with other regeneration works going on in Galashiels, the Coulterrsquos Candy project has been taken forward with a number of partners and it was important they all had sight of the initial design before it was issued publicly.ldquoA real effort is being made to ensure visitors are attracted to Galashiels, and the wider Borders area, and it is worth noting that without the Great Tapestry of Scotland visitor attraction -

This was his first goal for the Pupils and just reward for his perseverance.It was good to see two teenagers making their mark for the club, with Ross Brown joining his academy teammate MacBrayne in a fine first half performance on opposite flanks of midfield.Nevertheless, the home side ‘stole’ into the lead in the st minute, a comic-cut situation that saw Ellis Robertson unbelievably penalised for stumbling over his own heels.The resultant free kick was delivered with venom and a headed deflection thundered into the net to restore the home side’s lead.The setback was short-lived as almost immediately the in-form Donald McCallum cut inside past two defenders to drive the ball high into the roof of the net for a superb equaliser.This heralded the Pupils# best spell of the match, with Ross Brown ending a great move with a volley that left the keeper rooted to the spot.But the goal, arguably the best of the match, was ruled out for offside.Ryan McConnachie was next to try his luck with an audacious overhead kick that just cleared the bar.Lady luck deserted the cause when the referee awarded a soft penalty kick to home club.The visitors were a goal behind despite dominating most of the second half.With  minutes remaining the league leaders looked to have sealed the points when a tactical long throw was forced home to give ‘the Port’ a two goal advantage.However, in an exciting end to another close fought match, Lee Allen scored a towering header from a Donald McCallum corner to make the score -.Despite a great effort in the closing minutes, the Pupils couldn’t score to get their just reward.Having played well and given everything, the visitors ed home with nothing to show for their efforts.TomorrowCampbeltown Pupilsto home action with another dficult match against third-placed Hillington at Kintyre Park with a pm kick off.  See social media and posters for confirmation of venue.Fraser MacBrayne in action earlier this season at Kintyre Park. _cpupils"},{"url":null,"title":"down memory lane march 1 2019","story":"Ellen Sager, , from Tumbler Ridge, sent a letter to the Courier in August , asking for information about her Campbeltown-born grandfather, Thomas Douglas.Ellen said she knew very little except what her mother, Isabella, who emigrated to Canada in , had written in her grandmother Bessie’s obituary.It read that -year-old Bessie was the widow of Thomas Douglas, a lighthouse keeper who drowned at McArthur#s Head Lighthouse, Islay, in November , just nine months after Isabella was born.Ellen received two replies to her  request, from relatives who gave her the name and address of Robert Douglas, Thomas#s nephew, who was born in Campbeltown in  but moved to Australia in .Ellen said: #When I contacted Robert, he said he did not know that his uncle Thomas had a family.#I have been blessed to have many letters that Robert has written describing le in Campbeltown.

Such days are ones which have been borrowed from another month, and I think given the temperature and weather we have had recently the days have been borrowed from May.In , May will have borrowed Februaryrsquos days, so we can expect some unseasonal weather in that month as well, but in a dferent way.Sunday was a borrowed day for sure it was so mild and the later part sunny with a feeling of spring in the air. It was a perfect day for a discovery.We set off to find a place Irsquod only recently heard about. A friend had asked me what I knew about the lsquoKingrsquos Chairrsquo by Gullane. I had to admit that Irsquod never heard of it. He told me one of the holes at the golf course there has this name, but it seems it is named after a location nearby.This set me investigating. Sure enough, I found it marked on the map and searched for an image, which I found on a website called Ancient Stones: a large boulder, shaped like a throne, guarded by two other stones either side. It intrigued me and so our quest began.The starting point of our adventure was Gullane Beach car park. I knew roughly where to look but purposefully hadnrsquot brought the map so that we had a challenge to find the lsquochairrsquo. We knew what it looked like and that we needed to walk along the upper path, not the one that heads for the beach.We went the wrong way at first and got stuck in a mass of sea buckthorn, but on reflection that just added to the sense of adventure and achievement. We soon found our way and then suddenly there it was, up on Gullane Hill. The kids ran excitedly towards the stones, shouting: ldquoFound it, found it.I felt quite exhilarated at the discovery, and to be honest impressed by the sight of the Kingrsquos Chair. I can see how it got its name, as it looks something like a majestic reclining armchair. The two boulders on either side of it look like sentries keeping watch.The kids sat on it, of course, and I had to wait my turn after my we, who reckoned it could just as easily be a lsquoQueenrsquos Chairrsquo.When I finally got a chance to seat my majestic posterior on the chair, I realised the view was majestic as well, with Gullane Beach very visible in the near distance.I reflected on the fact we had recently visited Edinburgh Castle and seen the Stone of Destiny or Stone of Scone, along with the crown jewels. This rather uninspiring stone in Edinburgh Castle may be the coronation stone used for  years in England, but it is not, I am sure, the coronation stone used by ancient kings of Scotland, despite official claims that it is.I think itrsquos pretty clear that Edward I never got his hands on the real Stone of Destiny and I am convinced it has remained in Scotland, hidden somewhere, ever since. It occurred to me that this stone actually better fitted the early description of the original coronation stone at Scone than the one in Edinburgh Castle.ldquoImaginethis is the real Stone of Destiny and has been here all the time, I said fancully out loud. I know it isnrsquot, of course, but I have to saythis Kingrsquos Chair was on display at Edinburgh Castle it would certainly look more authentic.But sadly there seems to be no recorded tradition connected to this Kingrsquos Chair. I could find no story, or reference to the origin of its name. Perhaps some local people have some information on this There is an entry from the s that records the name, citing locals as the source, so there is some historic veracity in its title. But no suggestion is offered for the origin of the name, or any tradition associated with the stone. Its geology I could not say but it doesnrsquot seem to be a glacial erratic.And so we are left to wonder. We discussed how the stone got here and how it got its name. Maybe some children played here many generations ago and gave the boulder its title. Perhaps a Viking king who landed on Gullane Beach sat himself down on this natural throne to survey his warriors at their bloody work.Whatever the origin, the name, the location and the nature of the stone make this a worthwhile and fun discovery, even without a firm legend attached to it.And as I sat on the chair I watched smoke billowing from the coastline a little further to the west, close to the edge of Aberlady nature reserve. What caused the fire I didnrsquot know, but even from a distance it seemed destructive.It was a prophetic sight to witness from the Kingrsquos Chair. It looked like a burning coastline from a Viking raid. Thankfully the distant screech of fire engines told us help was on the way. The children wanted to go see the fire, but we kept our distance from the flames and let the firefighters do their job.So the trip to the Kingrsquos Chair had been an adventure in more ways than one. On our way back, the children advanced dferent theories about the origin of the name. It was universally agreed that a story must be made, but no agreement on the actual tale.ldquoPerhaps, I said, ldquowe should leave it to the imagination of those who search for and discover it, so they can sit and feel the power of the place and get ideas.My imagination was certainly ablaze. I saw the leader of the ancient Gododdin tribe, King Loth, sitting on the stone, looking out to the Firth as he watched his terried daughter in a small coracle being taken out to the open sea, his brutal punishment for her defiance of his authority.The story would fit as her journey began at Aberlady Bay, and so her small craft would have been seen from the Kingrsquos Chair as it passed by, being pulled out to sea by one of the kingrsquos boats.Itrsquos all a fancy of my imagination, of course, but thatrsquos my story.

People pick up dferent ideas from other peoplersquos weddings and events in other parts of the world and then they want that for themselves. Itrsquos an aspiration thing and the Internet has a lot to play, making people more educated, savvy and know what they want. Because of this, people think out the box and are able to put their own personal touch on the wedding to make it unique.Thinking outside the box is definitely what Hassanrsquos clients do well. The biggest wedding he has planned in his career involved a dizzying , guests. With clients more cost-savvy now, he describes how over-the-top ideas from couples are never far.ldquoThe craziest idea wersquove had was when a couple wanted , flowers hung from the ceiling two years ago, Hassan remembers, amused. ldquoIn big spaces like conference rooms, it softens the space, but these things are expensive - particularly with fresh flowers - so we then have to look at the next best thing, how we can achieve it, how it can be set up. We would then have to work with other professionals who can work at heights.In the first episode, we get to see a wedding being put together in the cityrsquos Crowne Plaza as Hassan and his staff scramble to hang hundreds of flowers from the ceiling, albeit fake ones.He explains: ldquoFresh flowers are obscene and not everyone can afford it, so we then look at articial flowers, which look just as real. For the sake of a few hours, they want it to look good, obviously.What is it about weddings that have Asian families going over-the top ldquoPakistanis are not that extravagant in their day-to-day lives, but a wedding is when theyrsquoll either be welcoming a new addition to the family or giving their daughter away, so theyrsquoll spend the most, says Hassan.ldquoWith pound, budgets, you have to take everything into consideration, including clothes and jewellery, which are a big expense. Clients travel to Pakistan and India to get their shopping done. Remember, Asian weddings can last for days as well. Some families will put marquees up at home and host pre-wedding events where the whole family comes together. It does add up to quite a lot of money, but the Bank of Mum and Dad can help out. Though, these days, professional couples themselves are very much in control and can pay everything themselves. Many live with their parents so they have that additional income saved up, he adds.Viewers will get to see a Falkirk mum planning a joint walima for her two sons in episode one as Hassanrsquos clients work on ways to cut down costs.Hassan says: ldquoSome will realise itrsquos too extravagant and theyrsquoll decide to put money into a house instead. But, nowadays, clients will cut down on the number of events they have and just roll it all into one day to cut down on costs.Working with demanding clients and large families comes with its tribulations. Hassan says: ldquoWhen yoursquore working with two families trying to create one event, sometimes it gels really well and other times itrsquos the opposite and you get friction. Usually, one family will sit back and let the other take control. If both families have dferent views, they can clash. Irsquove had that before and it does get tricky. Wersquove witnessed barnies happening right in front of us and it can get awkward, but itrsquos just about stepping in and mediating. In the end, theyrsquore always smiling.Itrsquos been his busiest year on record and, as Asian weddings continue to evolve, whatrsquos next for Hassan and his team ldquoWersquore seeing people sht away from having weddings in Scotland and opting for destination weddings.

Tell you that therersquos going to be a referendum on Brexit, that the ERG are back in their box, Jezza has finally come good, and Theresa May has been put in a secure unit. But I canrsquot in all honesty agree with commentators, like the blessed Polly Toynbee, who believe we are now on the road to redemption.Yes, Labour did repeat its promise to hold a referendumJeremy Corbynrsquos ldquoworkable plan of a permanent customs union is rejected ndash as it was in one of last weekrsquos many meaningless votes. Oh, and Labour will support a referendumthere is no General Election. Anda no deal Tory deal looks likely. If, , .ButLabour really wanted to eliminate the threat of no deal, it would have moved heaven and earth to deliver the SNPrsquos motion calling for precisely that.Looking back on this dismal week, the standout, surely, is the arrant insanity of Parliament ndash a rational body of elected representatives ndash failing to take the opportunity to rule out an event which would put the army on the streets, interrupt food and medicine supplies, and cause the loss of tens of thousands of jobs.Yes, the Yvette Cooper Oliver Letwin amendmentwas endorsed by Parliament overwhelmingly, after Theresa May gave it the nod. This means that there will be an extension to Article Parliament doesnrsquot support a deal by March . Well and good. If therersquos one thing the UK Parliament is supremely good at itrsquos failing to agree.It doesnrsquot like Mayrsquos botched deal, the Norway option, EFTA or any other solution that Brussels thinks acceptable. So that means an extension is inevitable. Except that the French president Emmanuel Macron and the Brussels negotiator, Michel Barnier, have made clear that the  countries of the EU , will only contemplate delaying Britainrsquos departure from the EUit is for ldquoa purpose. Holding more meaningless votes, staging more ministerial resignations and arguing on College Green outside Parliament do not, one suspects, constitute a legitimate purpose.Still, everyone seems convinced that an extension is in the bag. This led to largely unwarranted excitement on the Remain side. With Labour calling for a Peoplersquos Voteand Theresa Mayrsquos deadline finally breached, Twitter went into orbit. Lord Adonis all but declared victory in the Battle of Brexit. Europhiles were dancing in the streets, metaphorically at least, and jeering at the nasty Brexiters who had been defeated by the forces of good. It was like the last reel of Lord of the Rings.But such triumphalism was premature. Much as I wish it were the case, there is still no majority in Parliament for a referendum. Stephen K Bush, the political editor of the New Statesman, has been counting them out and counting them back in again and he is adamant that the Labour Brexit rebels will prevent any motion for a referendum passing through Parliament. He says at least  Labour MPs are opposed. Hersquos right.ldquoRebels here is something of a misnomer since there is widespread belief that Brexit is the outcome desired by their leader. Indeed, on one interpretation of last weekrsquos events, Jeremy Corbyn has managed to find a way to secure Brexit while also appearing to support a referendum. This is because what is called the Kyle Wilson amendment.This cross-party proposal, which Labour is minded to support on March , calls for MPs to agree to Theresa Mayrsquos deal , but only on the condition that there is a referendum to validate it. Bingo. Labour can tell all its working-class Brexit supporters in target marginals that, yes, it didnrsquot block Brexit. But Jeremy can also curry favour with the Remainiacs of Islington by appearing to support a Peoplersquos Vote.Itrsquos very clever, but to my mind somewhat bonkers. Why would Labour help pass Theresa Mayrsquos deal, which Jeremy Corbyn has said is worse than no deal, would lose thousands of jobs and would lock the UK into a backstop from which it cannot escape  At least this is what he has said repeatedly in the Commons.Surely, a vote is a vote. Theresa May could legitimately say that her deal has been endorsed by Parliament, and call on Labour to campaign for it in any referendum. Not that she has the slightest intention of calling a referendum.Theresa Mayrsquos strategy is the same as it ever was: not listening, nothing has changed, take it or leave it. It pains me to say it, but the Prime Minister at least has a strategy. It is to run down the clock, while allowing the ious tribes in Parliament and in her Cabinet, to fall out among themselves.Itrsquos working. Labour is moving ever more in the direction of her deal, however much they may deny it. Parliament canrsquot agree on anything.There are tears in Cabinet and more resignations ndash  from the Government so far. But whorsquos counting  The European Research Group ndash that comically misnamed faction of extreme Brexiters ndash has reportedly split over William Rees-Moggrsquos equivocation on the Irish backstop.And while all about is chaos and acrimony, so ticks away the clock until Brexit day. Twenty-eight days at the time of writing. Goodness me, is that really the time  Yes it is. As in the film of the same name, the zombies are stirring.I accept that is an offensive way to describe Nigel Faragersquos ldquoBrexit Betrayal march from Sunderland to London. But it could get nasty on the road.What do I think will happen in the end  As Irsquove been saying in this column since Christmas, I think Parliament will block a no-deal Brexit. There will be an extension of Article , and Labour will probably end up backing Mayrsquos deal, or abstaining on it which amounts to the same thing.If Labour, by some remote chance, continues to reject Mayrsquos deal or its iants, in the meaningful vote on the inglorious twelfth, then I think MPs would still reject a referendum. There is still no majority for one, and Labourrsquos die-hard Brexiters are not for turning.Which makes the most likely option ndash about the only one Theresa May can authorise as PM under her prerogative powers ndash would be to revoke Article . Pull the plug. End it.OK, so thatrsquos wishful thinking on my part. Her Government would fall and precipitate an election. But looking at the chaos that is Brexit, and the lack of time, it seems as good a shout as any, especiallyBrussels reject a meaningless extension.If Britain canrsquot decide how to leave the EU, an extension to Article  would be pointless. The sensible thing to do would be to cancel Brexit, go away, and think again."},{"url":null,"title":"state-of-scottish-labour-we-need-to-talk-about-richard","story":"His fourth press chief in  months, Ms McMath is said to be a good signing: experienced, likeable, an ideas woman. How is she at miracles, though  Any chance of her turning her hand to the political equivalent of changing water into wine  For that is what Scottish Labour needs as it staggers towards its spring conference in Dundee this weekend.With membership falling, donations down, and impact lessening by the day, the long, slow decline of Scottish Labour continues. The party has become the embarrassing relation of Scottish politics, the one that has to be invited to events because, well, the poor soul does not get out much. They are not doing any harm in the corner, nursing a drink and talking about the old days when vast swathes of Scotland were the colour of the peoplersquos flag.It is a cautionary tale every political party should heed. There is a long list of reasons for the condition Scottish Labour is in, from the partyrsquos arrogance-induced idleness to its inability to adapt to Scotlandrsquos changing political landscape. If we were to go through all the factors in detail we would be here till Christmas , and itrsquos Brexit OrsquoClock already and not a dish washed.Just as a patient at AE undergoes assessment, so the political doctor, spin or otherwise, must zero in on what action needs to be taken immediately, and what can wait. In short, we need to talk about Richard.Richard Leonard  Leader of Scottish Labour  Medium height, grey hair, Tetley tea folk accent, given to wearing red ties  Asks the third question at FMQs  Yes, thatrsquos the one.To appreciate the sorry state of Scottish Labour today one only has to have watched the first instalment of Paul Mitchellrsquos enthralling new documentary Yes No: Inside the Indyref, containing as it did interviews with Gordon Brown, Alistair Darling and Jim Murphy. It was like the famous graphic showing the evolutionary stages of man, from crouching to upright, but in reverse. Once, Scottish Labour produced future Prime Ministers and Chancellors of the Exchequer. Beginning with Jim Murphy, however, the calibre of leader has been less high office and more David Brent from The Office. No offence to Brent.On the eve of any party conference it is customary for grievances to be aired and tussles take place over the agenda. Conferences are one of the rare times when parties can more or less be guaranteed coverage, evenit is just a line in a radio bulletin. What better time to raise your voice Spin doctor number four for LeonardBut Mr Leonard is now embroiled in not one, not two, but three pre-conference fights. First, his inability to show the faintest leadership in tackling anti-Semitism within the party has been demonstrated, once again, by the rejection of a conference motion demanding ldquorobust disciplinary measures for such behaviour. The Eastwood branch that proposed the motion has been told to submit it to the party conference in September. Good luck with that. So an ideal opportunity to take a strong stand against the toxic racism that has swept up from down south has instead become another own goal for the party.Debating the matter in Dundee would have shown that Mr Leonard was his own man, ready to take steps to distance himself from London when necessary. This has been an unofficial part of the job description of Scottish Labour leader since Johann Lamont quit the post in frustration at London treating the party in Scotland as a ldquobranch office. Mr Leonard, however, seems to go out of his way to give the impression that he and Jeremy Corbyn are as close as two coats of paint, asthis is some kind of recommendation. Any other half-able UK Labour leader would have the party surging ahead of the Conservatives amid the chaos of Brexit. Instead, Labour has become a grisly sideshow, its dithering leader unable to form a position that he can communicate clearly, or get behind fully.Eve of conference bout number two involves Mr Leonard and Gary Smith, the head of Mr Leonardrsquos own trade union, GMB Scotland, for which he worked for more than  years. Mr Smith told The Herald on Sunday that the Scottish Labour leader had not done enough to tackle anti-Semitism, and had missed a chance to pick up on Remain sentiment in Scotland by backing a second EU referendum. Attacks by union leaders on Labour politicians are hardly novel , but this one hit home because it summed up general criticism of Mr Leonard.Union chief slates Labour leaderBout number three is the latest one, involving Mr Leonardrsquos predecessor, Kezia Dugdale. As reported by Tom Gordon, political editor of this parish, Ms Dugdale is furious at her partyrsquos leader, accusing him of airbrushing out of history, or rather the conference guide, a statement from former MEP Catherine Stihler supporting a second EU referendum.Ms Dugdale has now lodged a formal complaint about the man who gave her a written warning for running off to join the Irsquom A Celebrity, Get Me Out of Here circus instead of serving her constituents in parliament. That last sentence sums Scottish Labour up perfectly for the blend of low farce and mutual recrimination it has become.At this point it would be the done thing to suggest writing Mr Leonardrsquos leadership off as an interesting failure and naming possible replacements. Yet no-one of any serious merit wants the job, for to do so means throwing in their lot with the current leadership in London. What ails Scottish Labour cannot begin to be tackled until the rot stops in London, and it will take a General Election, or a very bad Brexit, to bring that to a head. The peoplersquos party is letting down those most in need of its help. If that does not change soon it will not deserve to exist.Read more: Leonard and Dugdale at war"},{"url":null,"title":"herald-diary-when-rude-boy-wasnt-that-rude","story":"FOOTBALL fans are mourning the passing of stalwart Rangers and Scotland captain Eric Caldow.

Some % are now actively shopping with companies promoting ethical or sustainable packages.Modern, green-conscious shoppers know exactly what they want. Their top demands are plastic free produce and packaging, compostable carrier bags, plant-based foods, natural fabric clothes and clothing resale and recycling schemes.The message is clear. Selling sustainably may help the climate and therefore be a good thing in itself, but itrsquos also extremely sound business. In what is currently an extremely tough retail climate, it can be a real dferentiator in attracting customers.To maximise the impact of this growing demand, retailers and social enterprises with a real commitment to sustainable trading need to grow and develop their links with each other.These enterprises, % of which are led by and accountable to local communities, supply a wide range of ethical products, helping to meet demand from the big retail buyers wanting to burnish their green credentials.So therersquos a strong mutual interest in getting it right.

But as well as that, they have the opportunity to learn from the retailers and receive mentoring and guidance. Early stage social enterprises can then make an informed decision aboutthese are business opportunities they want to pursue.The event might also open up investment opportunities, providing funding to qualying social enterprises. The finance can come from SIS itself or from one of its support programmes. The social enterprises taking part may be able to strike a deal with one of the big retailers involved or take advantage of the mentoring and education they offer.ldquoSomeone may not get a deal but learn a lot about how they can grow their business in other says, explains Alastair Davis. ldquoIf thatrsquos the case, we would be entirely happy with that.ldquoTherersquos a whole raft of evidence showing that consumers are becoming more interested in supply chains and the retailers are aware of that.

Total annual income was estimated at pound. billion.One of the highlights of the academy will be a pitching session, where each social enterprise will be invited to explain its products. Retailers will be encouraged to provide their own expert feedback and help each potential supplier refine its pitches for future product listing opportunities.The retailers will also have the opportunity to continue their discussions with inidual enterprises andappropriate to offer product listings in their stores. This yearrsquos main sponsor for the event is the supermarket chain Asda.It has been involved in previous academies and has already established trade relationships with a number of social enterprises including the Edinburgh craft brewery Brewgooder, a supplier that donates all its profits to clean water enterprises. Its lager is now available in more than  supermarkets.Polly Jones, Asdarsquos Corporate Affairs Manager, says that the SIS Retail Academy has been an excellent way for the retail chain to throw its weight behind the social enterprise movement.ldquoWe have also discovered new products which wersquove been able to introduce to our stores across the UK.ldquoBy harnessing the power of our retail experience and expertise alongside our store estate and online shopping ision, we can help social enterprises to enter the large retail market while providing our customers with better access to ethical products.The deadline for social enterprises to apply to take part in the academy, which runs between May  and , is March .--------------------------------------------------------------------Drive forward use of public transportGovernment must help prioritise buses as a sustainable method of travel, says Paul White Deputy Director of CPT UK ScotlandThe Scottish Transport Statistics, published last week, should serve as a wake-up call to those tasked with reducing Scotlandrsquos transport emissions.Bus remains by far the most-used public transport mode with more than  million passenger journeys each year. However, despite heavy investment from operators in new fleet and the latest smart technologies, bus patronage has fallen by % over the past five years.The statistics also show that operating costs per bus journey remain higher in Scotland than the UK average. This, and an % reduction over the past five years in funding from local and national government, has a real impact on the bus industry with consequences for both fares and services.It is not just the commercial bus market that is suffering in this climate. Due to budgetary pressures, some Scottish local authorities have taken the tough decision to end funding for supported bus services altogether.The picture is especially bleak when you consider that delivering air quality improvement by tackling car use is dependent on providing a viable, attractive public transport alternative.A recent KPMG study found that there are many contributing factors to bus patronage decline in Scotland including the low cost of car ownership, increasing congestion, and the growth in online shopping . KPMG concluded that % of the factors that impact on bus patronage are outwith bus companiesrsquo control. As such, coverage which lays blame for patronage decline solely at the feet of bus operators is wideof the mark.Bus companies want to carry more people. However, the bus sector requires political will and brave leadership ndash nationally and locally - to create a supportive framework that prioritises sustainable and active travel. It is  years since John Prescott labelled the bus a workhorse ldquofamiliar, even friendly, but rather dull and unexciting.Sadly, wersquore still fighting that uninformed perception today. More still has to be done to put bus and bus passengers on an equal standing with other modes.Bus passengers can only look on with envy at projects like the refurbishment of Glasgow Queen Street Stationor the delivery of the Subway refurbishment programme . Meanwhile Buchanan Bus Station, responsible for  million bus journeys per annum, is due to be refurbished at the cost of poundk. The disparity in funding between modes is staggering.The Scottish Government will shortly embark on a new Scottish Transport Projects Reviewthis summer. The review will look at means to address government aims around reducing emissions and improving journey times, quality, accessibility and affordability.More grand projects that cater for the car or allocate huge chunks of funding for small but expensive rail schemes are not the answer.I hope the STPR process will acknowledge the importance of the comparatively low-cost infrastructure improvements required to make walking or cycling easier and safer ndash and bus journey times quicker and more reliable. This latter ask could form part of a local Bus Partnership with local operators committing to service improvements in .Meeting Scotlandrsquos air quality targets means getting people out of cars and onto more sustainable modes of transport. Nobody will leave their car behind when therersquos no viable, attractive transport alternative. Providing a framework for bus patronage growth is a key piece in the air quality jigsaw.Hopefully these recent statistics serve their purpose and Scotlandrsquos bus passengers, responsible for % of all public transport trips, become a priority andnot an afterthought within Scotlandrsquos transport policy.------------------------------------------------------------------Project makes world our oysterConservation is the aim of the lsquopound Billion Challengersquo where private, public and non-profit partners drive investment in Scotlandrsquos natural environmentAN ambitious new initiative aims to pioneer new ways of funding nature conservation in Scotland through the launch of the pound Billion Challenge.Led by the Scottish Wildle Trust and the Scottish Environment Protection Agency , the Scottish Conservation Finance Project aims to generate new forms of investment in Scotlandrsquos stocks of natural capital in ways that will deliver signicant environmental, social and economic benefits, as well as s for investors.Natural capital can be defined as the worldrsquos stocks of natural assets which include geology, soil, air, water and all living things.The project brings together organisations from the private, public and non-profit sectors to develop cutting-edge investment and funding models for large-scale nature conservation activities, for example planting native woodlands, restoring oyster reefs and creating urban green spaces.ldquoGlobally, investment in nature needs to increase substantially to meet the growing challenges posed by climate change and bioersity loss, says Jonny Hughes, Chief Executive of the Scottish Wildle Trust.ldquoScotland was among the first nations in the world to pledge support for the UN Sustainable Development Goals and has been at the forefront of a number of pioneering environmental initiatives, including the World Forum on Natural Capital.ldquoThe aim of this new initiative is to provide a practical opportunity to come together, exchange ideas and collectively achieve a lasting impact. Ultimately we want to begin to drive billions of pounds of investment into Scottish conservation in the coming years.According to a  report by Credit Suisse AG and the McKinsey Center for Business and Environment, an estimated - billion per year is needed globally to preserve healthy ecosystems on land and in the oceans. Currently only around  billion is available per year, mostly in the form of public and philanthropic funds.Terry ArsquoHearn, Chief Executive of the Scottish Environment Protection Agency, said: ldquoIn Scotland, we currently using the resources of three planets, but only have one.ldquoGood leaders say ndash therersquos only one planet, we have to work within it. But great leaders say ndash how do we turn this from a threat into an opportunity for our organisation  The Scottish Conservation Finance Project is an exciting opportunity to bring the right people together to meet this challenge.The pound billion Challenge was showcased in London last week at the Natural Capital Investment Conference at the Royal Society, following its successful launch in Edinburgh in early February."},{"url":null,"title":"nicola-sturgeon-dismisses-idea-of-wildcat-independence-referendum-at-fmqs","story":"It comes after Keith Brown, the SNP depute leader, suggested that a referendum could occur evenit was rejected by the UK Government.:SNP deputy leader Keith Brown backs wildcat IndyrefKeith Brown said:ldquoIf we want to have a referendum, then we decide wersquore going to have a referendum. and that Brexit could becomeldquonormalisedthe Yes movement ldquodidnrsquot go relatively soon for independence.However, the idea of such a referendum seemed to be dismissed by Nicola Sturgeon at FMQs.When quizzed by opposition during First Ministers Questions, Nicola Sturgeon said:\"The legal basis for the next independence referendum should be the same as the basis for the last independence referendum.\"And the only reason were talking about this issue is the disgracefully anti-democratic stance of the Conservatives, who refuse to recognise a mandate at two elections and endorsed by this Parliament.\"When responding to claims that the SNP were obsessed with the idea of a second independence referendum, the First Minister said:\"Let me tell Jackson Carlaw what my obsession is right now.

It is therefore unsurprising that barn owls in the north of Scotland have a hard time during the winter months, with peak mortality rates being between December and March due to starvation.As temperatures start to drop in winter, small mammals become less active, meaning a lot less food is available for barn owls, and they need to work extra-hard to find it. This often results in the owls being forced to feed during daylight, even though they are naturally nocturnal hunters.This lack of food is particularly dangerous for barn owls as they are poorly insulated and need more food in winter to provide them with enough energy to stay warm.The Barn Owl Trust estimates that between  and  barn owls are killed each year on UK roads.RSPB Scotland site manager Dave Jones recently sent a deceased barn owl to the Scottish Agricultural College in Thurso for autopsy, when some concerned neighbours reported it after finding it at the roadside.The results of the autopsy showed that the bird was fit and healthy, \"in good shape and hunting successfully\", and that the death followed trauma to its wing and abdomen ndash suggesting that the bird died as a result of being hit by a vehicle.Dave said: \"It is extremely sad to discover that a fit and healthy birds le ended in this way. The barn owls in Caithness really are at the edge of their natural comfort zone and are particularly vulnerable in winter, so it isnt an unusual result, unfortunately. Its not all doom and gloom, though. Although we still find some casualties in this way, our population of barn owls in Caithness has recovered from the particularly poor winters of   and  , and they are considered to be the most northerly population of barn owls in the world.\"While we cant control the weather, there are some things we can do to help. If putting up a nest box, please make sure it isnt placed close to any busy roads. If you see a road casualty and it is safe to do so, please stop and report the find to your local wildle officer and to the Barn Owl Trust.

He questioned Minister for Public Finance, Kate Forbes MSP, in the Scottish Parliament earlier this afternoon, Wednesday, asking how this shortfall squares with the government’s commitment to the principle of fair funding for our leline internal ferry services.According to the Orkney MSP, the minister responded by saying that the government recognise the challenges in running these ferry services and that they have been clear in their budget that adequate funding is to be delivered.Commenting after the exchange, Mr McArthur said: “We now know that the Scottish Government has cut funding for Orkney’s internal ferry services by £, compared to last year.  This has left a £.m shortfall in the Council’s budget for delivering these leline services.#It is baffling how Ministers think this approach is consistent with their commitment to the principle of fair ferry funding.  It certainly flies in the face of the will of parliament, which voted for the government to deliver on its earlier promises.“Meantime, the island communities that rely on these leline services are left picking up the tab, including a three per cent increase in fares this year.  Ministers may ‘recognise’ the challenges of running these services, but they also must recognise their obligations genuinely to provide adequate funding.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

From isles patients attending hospital appointments to local businesses trying to remain competitive, these services are a genuine leline.“Even at this late stage, we would urge HIAL and the unions to get back round the table and resolve this dispute.  Ministers must also do everything possible to help broker a resolution and avoid the massive disruption any airport closures would inevitably cause.#Following Friday#s announcement from the Prospect union, that air traffic controllers under their membership had voted to undertake industrial action, HIAL said, as a government-sponsored agency, they had to follow the Scottish Government pay policy, and could not implement pay awards more than that directed by the government.A Scottish Government spokesman has since weighed in on the situation, saying: “HIAL has implemented a pay rise for all staff, which is a signicant improvement on previous years, as well as signicantly increasing their contribution to their pension scheme in order to maintain this benefit for employees. Staff also continue to receive generous annual leave, sick pay and other allowances.“In the face of the UK Government’s continued budget cuts, the Scottish Government delivered a distinctive and progressive Pay Policy for   — one which is fair, supports those on lower incomes and protects public sector jobs and services while delivering value for money for the people of Scotland.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It also signals the desperation with which the Scottish Government is now approaching the whole area of education –you can’t mend it, chuck a barrel of money at it. Well, the EIS’s head is well inside the mouth of this particular gt horse, and we can leave them there for the moment. What is necessary, and what isn’t happening, is a much more radical discussion of where Scotland lies educationally, so here are some more thoughts for public consideration, while the teachers and the Government discuss how to deliver more of the same at agreater cost.I have already suggested that we need a much more inidually tailored and much more flexible approach to the way schools are structured, but of course there is also the issue of what we actually teach in the schools. As you will know, the current Scottish curriculum goes under the title of ‘Curriculum for Excellence’when, as many commentators have pointed out, it’s not a curriculum at all, and it doesn’t seem to be leading towards excellence. A fairer name would be something like ‘A Theory towards Vagueness’ or possibly a ‘Prescription for Citizenship’. The Curriculum for Excellence took as its starting point what were called the four ‘capacities’, which were – and like many Scottish teachers, it took me months to learn them – that children should be effective contributors, responsible citizens, confident iniduals and ... wait for it ... successful learners.: The grim reality of le as a pupil in a Scottish school – Harriet SweatmanI can’t imagine there is anyone – parent, pupil or teacher – who doesn’t think that schools have a duty to produce successful learners. Scottish schoolchildren – and this in itself is an issue worthy of discussion – spend about seven hours a day, four-and-a-half days a week,  weeks of the year in schools. This amounts to only about  per cent of their entire time for  years,they stay to S. What has happened is that all of society’s expectations for young people are now meant to be managed by schools. It’s as , on entering hospital with a broken leg, the expectation is that hospitals will – as well as mending the leg – make children better, more confident, happier people, ready to face the world, and deal with every aspect of their capacity as young citizens of Scotland. These other qualities, of kindness, social awareness and confidence, can be achieved in other ways, and it’s simply not feasible to carry on with CfE when academic standards, including the basic levels of literacy and numeracy, are dropping.I believe that primary education needs to have a bit less faffing about and focus, in the classroom, on reading, writing, numeracy, IT skills, science, creative thinking and resilience, this latter through things like outdoor education and team building, with the aim of beginning to combat this huge epidemic of unhappiness, some of it actual mental illness, which is afflicting teenagers.: Cameron Wyllie: Face the facts, some kids are just smarter than othersI think that the first step in closing the poverty-related attainment gap should be to ensure that all Scottish schoolchildren can read and write and use a computer at a level appropriate to their age by the time they leave primary school. I would have a certicate of literacy, as previously suggested but eventually rejected by the unions and others, at age . Then I think that in secondary education, after S, there needs, in combination with the flexible approach to academic and vocational education, to be much greater flexibility with regard to subjects studied and the levels of study. We have a problem in Scottish classrooms which I characterise as the S French problem, though it applies in other subject areas too. Many, many Scottish pupils do French in S and lots of them, particularly less ‘academic’ boys and girls don’t like it in my view the modern language courses are particularly bad, despite the best efforts of teachers to teach them. Many, many children are bored in S French, either because it’s way too easy, or because it’s simply something they are not interested in or can’t do. We have children sitting in French classes who can’t read or write properly in English.At every turn, when we are deciding on what subjects should be taught and what level each child is being taught at, the watchword should be ‘appropriate’ – appropriate to that child. We do need to look long and hard at what we offer and its applicability. And the patronising view that every child needs to have an extended bash at academic learning so they are not shut off from entering university needs to be questioned hard, while at the same time we do more to push our most academic pupils. One personal, fairly large, bee in my mortar board is to ask why it is that we don’t insist that young people know more about Scotland today – most young people would struggle to identy the dferences between Scottish political partiesbut we expect them to grow up and vote about Brexit – remember the Scottish Government wants young people to vote at but the education system doesn’t do much to help them.So my cheeky finishing thought is this – let’s make the modern studies curriculum more Scottish biased, and let’s make it a compulsory subject from S to S.

Salmond and Farage, the opposite sides of a nasty #nationalist# coin.And what of British Nationalists Mr Tinkler For example Michael Gove yesterday, banning #Of Mice  Men# and #To Kill a Mockingbird# from school reading lists in England.Can you imagine the SNP doing likewise because the want -% of literature studied to be Scottish Inconceivable.For whatever reason British nationalism # incredibly, even in the form of UKIP # isn#t sneered at the same way as Scottish nationalism.What is your point Carl  Scotland is somehow superior to England because it does not ban “Of Mice  Men” and “To Kill a Mockingbird” from school reading lists. How very petty of you. For information I loathe all nationalism, Scottish, British what is the dference, just raw tribalism by another name.SNP, UKIP, Scottish Independence, United Kingdom Independence, as I said, two sides of a very nasty littlecoin.How verySad andironic, the Scots# inScotland have just elected a UKIP MEP!! I#m glad to hear it Ian.So you are pro-EU and pro-immigration You mean you loathe most of human society from the ancient world to the st century  Nation-states have existed throughout human history and patriotism # or nationalism # is a normal part of human social experience, as evidenced in innumerable great artistic works, for example.Where things go wrong is where one nation-state wants to conquer and control others. But that has a dferent name: imperialism.Well Carl, when it comes to education and this of literature, I would rather have a book written by a british,not scottish, author than this of an american, in which to study or reflect on with regard to literary works used for educational purposes. Quite rightly, these books, written by foreigners##sorry, yanks, should be taken out of the national curriculum and author#s unique to the UK or Scotland selected instead.I must confess, I am a little worried and concerned about the UKIP doing so well in the European Election#s considering Mr Farrage is a more extreme version of the vile Tories, and how he gives the impression of a nationalist, xenophobic buffoon where, I feel,we do leave the EU, he will, like the vile Tories, be in a position to rule and do as he pleases without being answerable to anybody, namely the EU under the European Human Rights Act. Many people may criticize the EHRA, but I would dread to think what this country would be like without it     David, you never fail to amaze me.You start off by arguing that teachers should be banned from using any book written by a foreigner and then go on to criticise nationalism and xenophobia.You really do believe in taking the scatter gun approach to political philosophy.Without the European Human Rights Act there would be an awful lot less terrorists running round for a start, old hook hands would of been deported along with his pals years ago, The   tube an bus bombings may never of taken place, an Cherie Blair would have a few less £millions in the bank. Any and all of these options are preferable to what we have now.At the last general election when the Lib Dems signed a pact with the Conservatives the writing was on the wall, they blew it big time and will never in the future be able to have an influence on British politics.Maybethey had made a coalition with Labour it might have been dferent but now its too late, any vote for Liberal in the future will be a vote wasted.The study of English literature should, in my view, encompass all literature written in the English language, including its many dialects and historic iations. That should include studying local writers, but not to the exclusion of international authors.We study literature for all sorts of reasons, but bolstering national pride or trashing another nation shouldn#t be amongst them.If we were to go down the road of only studying our own literature, Scots students would never study Shakespeare or Dickens, English students would never study Burns or Lewis Grassic Gibson, neither would study Melville or Twain, and all would be worse off for it.The attack on the English curriculum has come from the dreadful Michael Gove, but it could quite easily have come from Nigel Farage who hates hearing non-English accents, let alone reading non-English texts.UKIP under Farage represents a severely authoritarian threat to our liberty which should not be under-estimated. So far we#ve only seen the tip of this particular iceberg.Farage is married to a German so he hears a foreign accent every day, such a pity you only soak up what murdochs media tell you instead of a few facts.How very true John, they, the LibDems, know how to go out with a bang##so to speak.

You start off by arguing that teachers should be banned from using any book written by a foreigner #lol Malcolm, I was being slightly sarcastic in my response to what literature teachers should be using to teach with ###.but on a more serious point, I do not see why teachers cannot use books written by scottish or british authors to demonstrate literature and its meaning##..within and between the lines. I am sure, as you might agree, there is just as equally good examples of literature within the boundaries of our own country or the UK in which to use for educational purposes  I wasn#t specically saying every foreign book should be banned##.it was, as said sarcastically, yank#..sorry, american in the context of the subject.Theo Smith and the other  Shetland Lib-Dem voters might explain why they like it so much. But they won#t.Are you unable to express your own views Brian  because that link is your longest post by far.Carl Pickard, in answer to # Ian. So you are pro-EU and pro-immigration # I am strongly forUnity of all humanity, that does not mean I carte blancheagree with of all the attemptsand mechanisms to forge those unities by politicians. However the EU is a vast improvement of what went before it. WW and WW were the result of the preceding collection of sovereign nation states.On balance I there for do support the EU, however there are grounds to improve it, not demolish it. I most definitely agree with immigration and the opening of borders to all friendly states and cultures..Britain has benefited hugely due to its ersity of cultures.If anyone advocates banning immigration and sending #them# home, would they expect all UK and Scottish ex pats to be expelled from wherever they are and be sent backThat would be fun would it not I would expect to be deportedfrom whatever country I was in other than my ownI broke their laws. I would not expect that country to feed clothe and house me, nor would I expect free everything, maybe that#s just me as I don#t expect this country to do that for me either . Instead of hysterical rantings of they want to send them all back try actually listening to what they say instead of what the murdoch media say they say.A new experience # Iagree with Ian Tinkler.Robert Sim, in answer to # you loathe most of human society from the ancient world to the st century# I certainly do loath the primitive mentality which is soblind and stupid to realise most of human suffering is simply because Nation States and nationalistsare collectively too selfish to look beyond theirown self interest and belief in racial superiority.. Nationalism is a prime example of that and Salmond and his NATS a great example. Our oil, we are better, fairer, alone we would be wealthier, ect,ect and all that self righteous rubbish. Also nationalism goes a bit beyond great artistic works, a few examples : The Holocaust ,Omagh bombing , Bloody Sunday. Ethnic cleansing . Tribal massacresCambodian genocide , these are a few examples of hundreds of incidents..These killings have little to do with imperialism, more about tribalism and a self belief in racial superiority. #The simple fact is we are all the same species with exactly the same ancestry and emotions.# Very true, Ian.

He said: “For me, it was the image that was in the press of the building and particularly the roof, which was covered in greenery.

Over the last few weeks KPL staff have been busy ferrying equipment, supplies and crews out to it as part of the first such contract secured by the yard. During a visit, I expected to find a hive of activity the roar and clang of big machines.But on Thursday of last week I found the whole site surprisingly quiet. This, I am told, is because most of the activity is now taking place onboard what KPL directors refer to as the OGW.“The rig is crawling with insurance people and regulators right now,” says one of the directors, Simon Russell, as he shows me round. “They are all signing off their bits and pieces before the rig gets the final piece of paper that says it’s good to go.”Every weld is being stress tested. Every item of equipment is being put through its paces.Before the rig can face the punishing swells of the north Atlantic, such attention to detail is a matter of le and death.There are also inquisitive guests onboard, doing a little window shopping. They’ve been helicoptered straight on to the rig, the property of US firm Diamond Offshore. These VIPs are potential customers from major players such as Tarka Oil, here to see what the buzz is all about. While doing so, they may also be mightily impressed with Kishorn Port Ltd. That is the hope, anyway.As you are reading this, there is a good chance the Ocean GreatWhite, with a crew of  aboard, will be making its way back up the Minch. If the weather is favourable it may even be doing so under its own steam, without the need for a fleet of tugs to tow it to the Blackrock prospect, some  miles north west of Shetland.So advanced is the OGW that each corner-leg contains two enormous thrusters, powered by engines capable of generating , brake horse power of thrust. For non-petrol-heads that’s  Ferraris per engine. A top speed of eight knots is the result. Not bad for a structure that isn’t exactly designed to cut through the water. Stability is the name of game: even in the roughest seas the thrusters are meant to ensure that the rig doesn’t deviate by more than a metre from the drill point. West of Shetland, it may need every Newton of force those thrusters can provide. Once safely in place, the Ocean GreatWhite will be used by Siccar Point Energy and Shell UK to test for oil in an unexplored area of the seabed.“This is really cutting edge stuff,” enthuses Alasdair Ferguson, the other director in this   venture involving his own firm, Ferguson Transport and Shipping, and Simon’s LeithsLtd. “The rig can operate in , feet of water and drill a hole , feet deep.”In other words, that’s six miles into the earth’s crust. This is how far down we now have to go to get the black stuff. As the ‘Age of Oil’ wanes, rigs like the OGW could become the workhorses of the near future.However, the days of building giant concrete caissons to support them are long gone. Whatever finished products emerge from Kishorn in the next few years, another Ninian Central will not be among them. Deep water is where the action is – and that means floating oil rigs like the Ocean GreatWhite, a sixth-generation model designed specically to harvest the hard-to-reach hydrocarbons that now makes up much of what the UK still produces. Thankfully for Kishorn, that means west of Shetland.  According to Simon, this trend involves the “centre of gravity” shting away from Aberdeen and towards the west coast.KPL is ready and waiting for that trend to continue.“The same thing is happening with offshore wind,” says Simon. “If you look at the next round of Crown licenses you’ll see that most of them are here on the west coast.”“We want to create a multi-use facility,” adds Alasdair. “We want to build resilience into this facility so that it is not reliant on any one industry.”Offshore wind turbines need concrete caissons, albeit smaller than the Ninian Central’s. That’s another box ticked in favour of Kishorn.From about  metres away, the Ocean GreatWhite does indeed look like a floating hotel, to use Simon’s description. Unfortunately, this is as close as we are allowed to get. Obtaining insurance cover for non-crew is a minefield Diamond Offshore also doesn’t want any photographs taken of their cutting-edge equipment. So circling the rig aboard the ‘Infinity’ will have to do for us.Aside from ferrying crew to and from the Ocean GreatWhite, the ‘Infinity’ usually takes tourists out to St Kilda from the Stein jetty in Waternish. But that happens mostly in the summer.“We have been flat out doing this since the rig arrived,” says skipper Kenny Mackinnon.Regular work over the winter is good for those who don’t usually have it.In fact, the arrival of the OGW has been a boon for the area. Twelve locals have been taken on in ious positions. This is the direct benefit. There is a harder to quanty knock-on effect for local businesses in what Alasdair refers to as the “downstream supply chain”. Everything from additional bed nights to sandwiches bought in the nearest shops are covered by this concept. And there have been quite a few of those over the last six weeks.Food and lodgings for visiting crews and subcontracted workers might sound like small beer, however. But the temporary largesse created by the presence of the OGW could be the start of something much bigger.Nothing like the crazy days of the s and s, though, when a town of , people sprung up in accommodation blocks behind the dry dock. That kind of development, said Simon, will not happen again, partly because of the strain it would place on local infrastructure.  Instead, he envisions - people employed directly at the site.The prefabs of Kishorn’s heyday are long gone but the dry dock is still here, its original concrete floor as good as new, so I’m told. The faint imprint of the Ninian Central , once the biggest manmade object ever moved across the face of the Earth, is still visible a spectral impression of the past.KPL have more modest ambitions than trying to resurrect what was.Simon and Alasdair are building in small steps. They’re making progress, just at a slower pace than many would like to see.Further investment is required to speed things up. That, however, is based partly on more rigs using the yard. KPL have a few irons in the fire on that front, but nothing definite yet.“The revenue this will generate will enable us to extend one of the piers, out into the deeper water, so we can load and unload directly rather than having to ferry equipment and people back and forth,” says Alasdair.Just sixty metres from the shore Loch Kishorn reaches a depth of around  metres, easily enough to accommodate oil rigs which, it should be remembered, need taken apart when they’ve reached the end of their working lives. Decommissioning s is on the KPL menu too.If , jobs were a flash in the pan,  jobs might be the sustainable optimum. By definition, the slow build lasts longer than the quick buck.In this place of big numbers,  might be big enough."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1447107.jpg--.jpg?1550046202000\n","title":"2 800 donation for braid valley community first responders","story":"THE new Braid Valley Community First Responders Scheme enjoyed a great response to their Open Day with more than  people attending.This was an ideal opportunity for potential volunteers at NIAS Northern HQ, Ballee to find out more information and they showed a lot of interest in joining the scheme.

As Moy Park celebrates  years in business, Aaron reflects on changes in the sector and milestones along the way. He said: “I first joined Moy Park in  when I was still at school, working part time at the weekends as a factory operative. “As a student, it was a great insight into the world of work and business. It taught me the value of hard work, money earned, and motivated me to want to do more of both! “After gaining a degree in Health and Leisure from Queen’s University Belfast, I was keen to move into a business environment and decided to apply to Moy Park’s Graduate Management Programme, to find out more about a career in one of our fastest growing industries, agri-food. “The two-year programme was the ideal way to find out more about ious strands of a business, from operations to finance, HR and marketing, and what might suit my skillset best. “From my time as a sht worker on the factory floor, I had a healthy respect and interest in the processing side of Moy Park, and the opportunities and challenges therein. “Once I completed the Graduate Management Programme - which we still use as a recruitment tool today - I took up a position as a sht manager, capitalising on my people management skills and interest in operations. “Since then, I have worked my way up across a number of Moy Park’s sites – moving from factory manager to area manager and have now been General Manager at Ballymena for two years. “Ballymena is a great place to work. From a business point of view, it’s strategically located with fantastic transport links and from a social standpoint, you’ll never find yourself wanting for something to do – from shopping to socialising over a drink or a bite to eat. It’s also quickly becoming the spa capital of Northern Ireland! “While Ballymena has faced a number of economic challenges, it’s an area with a rich history and heritage of business success. This spirit is still very much evidenced by the people, businesses and organisations in the town today. “Mid and East Antrim Council has an ambitious integrated economic development strategy for the area to help encourage business growth across the borough, and it’s one we are keen to help support. “It’s a strategy important not just to Moy Park as a business, but to me personally. “I sit on Mid and East Antrim Council’s Manufacturing Task Force Team, a working group committed to supporting and fostering growth. I was delighted to attend Westminster with a delegation from the Task Force recently when Northern Ireland representatives presented their plans for a Belfast City Deal. “Hearing these plans certainly gave us food for thought when it comes to nurturing growth locally. “As Ballymena’s General Manager, I’m responsible for all business s at the site – from technical to HR and finance. “With over , members of staff, it’s a erse and busy job but that’s what makes it worth doing. In the last  years, business management has evolved signicantly. “While there might be more paperwork, regulations, travel and late nights, there is also an incredible amount of collaboration - with customers, industry, educational bodies and government and our local communications. “Managers today cannot afford to work in silos, you need to adopt an attitude of knowledge sharing and foster an environment of innovation to truly succeed. “My key piece of advice to anyone viewing management as a career is to do your research and bolster your skillsyou need to. Being a good manager isn’t a static position, you constantly need to challenge yourself, and a good employer is one who lets you not only challenge yourself but equips you with the skills to overcome these challenges. “One of my own personal highlights over the last  years was been being named ‘Young Processor of the Year’ at the Meat and Poultry Processing Awards in . “Given my background working on the factory floor, it was great to win an industry award. At a business level, I’ve been very proud to see Ballymena evolve to become a Centre of Excellence, focused on driving innovation in food manufacturing. “As General Manager, it’s my ambition to see our facilities continue to grow.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1460409.jpg--.jpg?1550570234000\n","title":"children from gran canaria welcomed to ballymena","story":"A group of children from Gran Canaria have been visiting Ballymena to take part in the annual local music festival.The group of  children are pupils of the British School of Gran Canaria, and are taught by local woman Claire McDonald.Claire, who is the head of the music department at the English speaking school has accompanied her pupils to Northern Ireland to take part in the festival, sightsee, improve their English skills and experience the culture of Northern Ireland.The young people, who are all aged between  and  years old are keen musicians, with some playing the piano, drums, violins while others are singers.They have experienced success at the festival, with some winning first and second prizes and others were highly commended.The group have been travelling around NI, visiting the Giant’s Causeway, Hillsborough Castle and the Titanic museum and performed in a local concert with Kellswater Flute Band.This has been their first taste of Northern Ireland, and it did not disappoint!One of the students, Miguel said: “I’ve really enjoyed my trip. “I play the drums and the musical festival has been great.“We learn English at school so it’s good to speak it here.”Fellow student Alicia, said: “Northern Ireland is great and the festival has been a wonderful experience.“I was really excited to play with the band but my favourite part was the Giant’s Causeway and the music festival.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1460481.jpg--.jpg?1550570359000\n","title":"rodney quigley announces independent candidacy","story":"Ballymena man Rodney Quigley has announced he plans to stand in this year’s Council elections.Announcing his candidacy on Facebook this week, the well known community activist posted: “I intend to stand as an Independent candidate in the Mid and East Antrim council elections on nd May.“As someone who has worked tirelessly as a community worker for over  years, and as a member of the policing and community safety partnership for  years, I feel that I have something to offer at local council level.“I have dealt with many community issues in the past and will continue to put the community first on any issues that are brought to my attention. “Ive also worked with many councillors on many issues in the past and would continue to work along side them for the good of everyone in Ballymena.“I know that many people have said its time for change and it would be good to see a few new faces within Mid and East Antrim council.“If this is the case Id like to be one of the new faces.“I can assure people thatelected, I will put my best foot forward every time and will work to resolve local issues for everyone in Ballymena.”Election datesNomination forms for prospective candidates must be ed to the Deputy Returning Officer by pm on Monday April , .The election will be held on Thursday, May , .

During the piece I never mention death, I never mention anything being lost, in fact I say very little. The piece is very movement-based, it’s an interpretation of grief, because I wouldn’t be able to stand up and talk about it. I wouldn’t want to and I don’t think anyone would be really interested in listening to that either – not really.”Asked why she has chosen to take on something so raw and so close, Róisín tells me: “Well, it is something that keeps coming up in conversation. For me, it was a real compulsion to remember daddy, born out of a fear of forgetting him. I recorded him speaking when he was sick and those recordings have become the soundscape for this piece. His voice is very present in the piece. “I could just do this for myself and not show it to anyone. I could just write it all down and put it under my bed and that would be a part of my grief process. People can be in the same space and share what is a very universal, inevitable thing for every single human being.“I don’t think we as a society are really that great at dealing with grief. “There was a time I wanted to make myself a little badge saying, ‘I’m grieving, please be patient with me.’ Hopefully this piece is a good way for people to share and create conversation – some people might not want to talk and that’s fine. I think that the bottom line is about putting trust and faith in the universe, in nature and the hope and comfort that this is a cycle and we live on.I want people to feel comforted and feel hopeful in some way and I want them to see what I clung on to. Ultimately I want to do daddy justice.”• Natural Disaster is on at the MAC on March  and . Tickets for the play are priced at £.

During last week’s public testimony, he called Mr Trump a con man, a cheat and a racist.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  President Donald Trump has accused his former lawyer Michael Cohen of lying Mr Trump, in turn, has said Cohen “did bad things unrelated to Trump” and “is lying in order to reduce his prison time”.In his statement on Thursday, Mr Davis said when he was brought on to Cohen’s legal team in June, his client “authorised me as a new lawyer to say publicly Mr Cohen would never accept a pardon from President Trump evenoffered”.“That continues to be the case,” Mr Davis said. “And his statement at the Oversight Hearing was true — and consistent with his post-joint defence agreement commitment to tell the truth.”Politicians have requested information about talks on possible pardons for Cohen and other defendants close to the president who have become entangled in Mr Mueller’s investigation. He is investigating possible co-ordination between Russia and Mr Trump’s  presidential campaign.Cohen is headed to prison in May after pleading guilty to campaign finance violations, lying to Congress and other crimes.Federal prosecutors have said Mr Trump directed Cohen to arrange payments to buy the silence of two women — porn actress Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal — who had alleged they had sex with Mr Trump.

The second half continued to be a feisty affair and a great spectacle for the neutral spectator.With the lowered sun in Ballynahinchrsquos eyes, Ballymena did the smart thing and constantly took the high router, creating numerous scoring opportunities for Ballymena.Unfortunately, for lsquoHinch, their lead didnrsquot last too long as Ballymena bounced back with another great counter-attacking goal to make it -.It was end-to-end stuff, like the first half, the best of the chances falling to Millar, McIlwaine and Campbell only to be denied by the hard-working Ballymena defence and lsquokeeper.Cards were shown to both sides with William Edgar, Andrew Mulholland and Tim Crean doing time on the sideline.Ballymena had decent short corner chances, but were closed down well by Ashley Brown, Rea Coffey and of course Aaron Donnell.lsquoHinch had a few shorts of their own, but couldnrsquot convert. With  minutes remaining on the clock, Ballynahinch patiently played the ball around the back, waiting for an opening.Ashley Brownrsquos pass then found the lurking Stuart Hunter in space. Hunter was able to pick out roaming right back Leslie Harrison, who pulled a perfect pass back into Millar and he made no mistake in finding the net.Ballynahinch could easily have sat back and closed up shop, but they pinned Ballymena into their own half with a series of concerted attacks.Congratulations to everyone involved with the Ballynahinch menrsquos team, especially the supporters who never miss a game.The celebrations were short-lived as Ballynahinch have a huge game this weekend when they face Portrush in Coleraine in the Irish Hockey Challenge semi-final at pm.Ballynahinch: Aaron Donnell, Rea Coffey, Andrew Mulholland , Ashley Brown, Leslie Harrison, Matthew Martin, Stuart Hunter, William Edgar,Tim Crean, Jason Campbell, Alex Millar, Andrew McIlwaine, Luke Curry, Micheal Carney, Josh Higginson, Steven Crean.Joint men of the match: Alex Millar and Rea Coffey.Ballynahinch Ballymena ULSTER INTER LEAGUE.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"£2m tidal turbine providing energy spins in to action  ","story":"A poundm tidal turbine currently in Strangford Lough could provide electricity for between - homes, it has been revealed.The Scottish firm behind the innovative Subhub has said that energy produced from the fast-flowing lough could cost as low as p per kWH for local industrial load customers.However, the Subhub is not connected to the local electricity grid and is being tested for its environmental impact and maintenance needs.The distinctive yellow Subhub mdash which is roughly the size of of a bus mdash has been in Castleward Bay for the last six weeks.Easily seen from Portaferry, it was towed from Belfast Harbour and fixed into position within  hours on January .Jeremy Smith, managing director of QED Naval, said that Strangford Lough was chosen over the Orkneys for the Subhubrsquos final commissioning before being made available for the global market.Mr Smith explained: ldquoThe Subhub is a foundation structure for tidal turbines and provides a means of transporting and fixing tidal turbines to the sea bed.ldquoWe want to prove the environmental credentials of Subhub after developing it since .ldquoWe selected Strangford Lough as the commissioning site specically as it had the iants of conditions that Orkney hadnrsquot. The Orkneys was problematic as itrsquos a long way away. It would also have costed a lot of money to tow up into position but also the conditions up there were not what was needed.ldquoOur Strangford site has fast-flowing water, a pure rock sea bed and is a stonersquos throw from the shoreline. Itrsquos very accessible and also happens to be a beautul part of the world.Mr Smith said that the Subhub would be in the lough for the next three months at least as it was being assessed.ldquoWe are working with Cuan Marine Services who provides us with daily reports really to see what the environmental impact is for marine mammals.He said that QED Naval had developed Subhub which was less expensive to make, to move into position and to decommission, than other tidal wave s.He believes that some industrial load customers could avail from its electricity.ldquoIndustrial load customers could be paying between -p per kWH now, added Mr Smith.ldquoIf we could work with local industrial customers to get power purchase agreements, there is potential for us to cut their fuel bills for heating water to less p per kWh.QED Naval has worked in collaboration with the Centre for Advanced Sustainability at Queenrsquos University on the project.The Subhub spent last year being equipped at Cimpina Engineering in Belfast before being moved to Strangford Lough.This is the second tidal power development in Strangford Lough.The worldrsquos first commercial-scale tidal turbine was commissioned on the lough in July, .The .MW SeaGen project developed by Marine Current Turbines comprised two KW turbines and represented a poundm investment.

In fact, the South Eastern Trust has been concentrating for some time on trying to find suitable day surgical services which could be delivered in Downpatrick.Miss Ritchie said it appears ldquovery short sighted to relocate services from the Downe to other hospitals, suggesting the bedding down of eye surgery will result in the increased requirement for theatre access for ENT and other services.She added: ldquoAs the Downe has high level computerised technology theatres, it is important that full use is made of them to ensure continued local accessibility to day surgery services at the point of delivery.ldquoI have already written to the Trust urging that ENT surgical clinics are retained in the Downe Hospital.Also this week, Miss Ritchie has issued a fresh call for a permanent MRI scanner to be installed in Downpatrick.She said that for a number of years the local community has been involved in trying to secure a permanent scanner which health chiefs agree is a necessity.She added: ldquoI understand that the permanent facility is subject to a business case which needs a Minister in place to approve. Whilst the devolved institutions remain in cold storage, the approval of such a facility will probably take some time.ldquoIn the meantime, a mobile scanner has been located at the Downe for a limited period to deal with a current overburdened service at the Ulster Hospital in Dundonald. I hope this unit can remain in place until the business case for the permanent scanner has been approved.A South Eastern Trust spokeswoman has confirmed that there are no plans to reduce the number of ENT sessions delivered at the Downpatrick hospital.She added: ldquoThe Trust is planning to increase ENT clinics at the Downe and to relocate an ENT day surgery session from Downpatrick to the Lagan Valley Hospital to facilitate the cataract elective care centre prototype work..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Food firm to create 125 jobs with £17m investment  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK is in line for a major jobs boost.Finnebrogue Artisan has this week unveiled plans to create  new jobs as part of a poundm investment in an ultra-modern nitrite-free bacon facility.The news comes just weeks after the firm unveiled details of a poundm investment in a new vegan and vegetarian factory to support  jobs.Already one of the districtrsquos leading employers and widely regarded as one of Northern Irelandrsquos most innovative food producers, Finnebrogue Artisanrsquos latest investment is being supported by Invest NI.The new manufacturing facility is for the production of the companyrsquos nitrite-free bacon, hailed by many experts as a breakthrough in the food processing sector when it was unveiled to wide acclaim in January last year.The Naked Bacon range is now widely available in leading supermarkets across the UK, with Invest NI offering the Downpatrick company over pound.m of support towards the capital investment in the new nitrate-free bacon facility.The  new posts are expected to be created by , supporting  posts already in place at the ultra-modern plant outside Downpatrick.Finnebrogue chairman Denis Lynn says it has been known for decades that nitrites used in curing meat can cause cancer.ldquoThatrsquos why, despite being the UKrsquos leading top tier sausage maker, we refused to make a single rasher of bacon until we could figure out a way to make it better and safer, he continued.ldquoWe always set out to make food the best it can be, without being bound by the way it has always been done.

The development proposal includes plans for almost  parking spaces, eight of which are reserved for mountain rescue team members.A new pedestrian crossing at the Bryansford Road junction with Shimna Road forms part of the proposal and while planners have received  objections, they have also received five letters in support of the proposal.In papers submitted ahead of next weekrsquos meeting, planners confirm that none of the statutory consultees, including the Department for Infrastructure, Rivers Agency, Environment Agency and the local environmental health department, have lodged any objections to the redevelopment of the former school site.They confirm that roads officials are content that the proposed development will not have any ldquoadverse impact on the existing road infrastructure and is acceptable in terms of road safety.Planners are also insisting that the indicative designs of both the new store and mountain rescue centre would not be inappropriate in this part of the resort.They say it is acknowledged that there are ldquoobvious restrictions for the redevelopment of the existing Lidl store in Railway Street and there are no alternative vacant sites in the town centre which can accommodate the supermarketrsquos needs.ldquoA suitable brownfield site has become available at the edge of the town centre which could accommodate the proposal and has met the requirements of strategic planning policy, say planners.They also confirmed that a study of the impact of the new store on existing retailers shows the proposed investment will not have any ldquosignicant or unacceptable impact on Newcastle town centre.Environmental health officials say they have no objection in principle to the investment, provided conditions are attached restricting hours of business and deliveries, with planners concluding that the overall impact of the proposal, which is close to a number of homes, is not considered to be ldquosignicantly detrimental to warrant a refusal of the application.Lidl has confirmed it plans to develop a new , square metre supermarket, explaining it opted to redevelop the former primary school site as there are limited opportunities to redevelop the storersquos current base at Railway Street in the resort.Lidl says it has been looking for alternative premises in Newcastle town centre for over a decade without success and that while properties have become available, none were suitable because they were too small.It says the current sales area at its Railway Street base is is too small for the store to carry a full range of goods, pointing to narrow aisles with limited circulation space. The company says the car park is too small and fails to meet its requirements, with the general customer experience falling short of a modern food store.Planners say that having assessed the ious planning policies and having regard to all representations made, all consultees engaged and all other material considerations, it is found that the proposal is acceptable in planning terms and approval is recommended..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Newcastle’s pop up beach back on agenda of council  ","story":"A DECISION to reject a proposal for a pop-up beach in Newcastle has been overturned.Last month, a Newry, Mourne and Down Council Committee recommended not to proceed with the articial beach mdash similar to those in Paris and other parts of Europe ndash at the townrsquos promenade.However, the decision was overturned at Monday nightrsquos meeting of the full council when it was agreed to seek funding for the pop-up beach and develop a business case which could pave the way for its introduction.But not all councillors agreed, with Sinn Fein members rejecting it. They said there were health and safety concerns associated with the beach. They expressed support for transporting sand by road from Ballykinlar to Newcastle promenade and implementing an enhanced beach management plan.The radical suggestion to bring a touch of French summer flair to Newcastle was initially discussed last September when it was agreed to further explore the idea, with the initial focus on the cost of developing such a facility.The idea was suggested because of the lack of sand on Newcastle beach.Pop up beaches along the banks of the Seine and other cities and towns across Europe are hugely popular and some local politicians believe they can be a success in Newcastle.Council officials have confirmed that while Newcastle promenade is not suitable for pop-up beaches, two areas adjacent to the Downs Road car park would be suitable and that the cost over a nine-week period would be pound,.At last monthrsquos meeting of the local authorityrsquos Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourism Committee, politicians rejected the pop-up proposal and agreed to seek a meeting with the Environment Agency to discuss securing a marine licence to transport sand from Ballykinlar to Newcastle.It was also suggested that groins would be placed along sections of beach to protect the sand and a programme of better beach management introduced. On Monday night, this recommendation was overturned by  votes to .Mournes SDLP councillor Laura Devlin, who initially proposed to explore the merits of a pop-up beach, said the local authority ldquoneeds to think outside the box to create an articial beach or ldquosimply accept that Newcastle will never have a sandy beach.She continued: ldquoIf improving the natural beach was an option I would obviously proceed in that direction. However, it is not workable.ldquoI have been advised in no uncertain terms by a iety of coastal erosion experts that importing sand to Newcastle or removing stones from the beach simply wonrsquot work due to the movement of sediment and that permission to do this work would be denied by central government.ldquoAs a councillor for Newcastle, I want to improve our tourism product and the pop-up beach proposal is simply my suggestion to try and do something dferent. I also recognise that an articial beach would have to be properly managed and maintained.Cllr Devlin added: ldquoA pop-up beach could not just be created at the start of the summer and left. It would have to be adequately cleaned and looked after. As a mother, I would not want my child playing in dirty sand so the management and cleanliness of the pop up beach is essential.ldquoThis suggestion wonrsquot be without itrsquos issues, but surely as a council it is our job to try and make improvements and better our area where possible, expressing disappointment Sinn Fein opposed her proposal.Sinn Feinrsquos Willie Clarke argued that there was no appetite for a pop-up beach and that the suggestion to move sand from Ballykinlar to Newcastle was to replace the hundreds of tonnes which drt away on a seasonal basis.He continued: ldquoHow are you going to manage a pop-up beach that will be filled with stagnant sand  There is the potential for both dogs and young infants to foul the sand and other health and safety issues which need to be addressed.ldquoWill the sand be cleaned every day  What measures will be taken to prevent sand from blowing up Main Street  Local people and traders want to see a sandy beach, not a pop-up beach. I believe it is a no brainer that we try to secure Environment Agency agreement to place sand on the beach.Cllr Clarke said part of the pleasure of going to the beach was being able to go into the water and suggested that a pop-up beach could not provide such an experience.He added: ldquoWe need to look at anti-social behaviour issues associated with pop-up beaches which could contain broken glass. I wonder who is going to look after them given the dficulty I have in getting someone to clean the beach ldquoWe need to invest resources to ensure the proper management of the beach and encourage people to go to parts of it where there is sand.Cllr Andy McMurray described pursuing the idea as ldquofolly given the current problems in keeping the promenade tidy..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Penalties settle derby cup tie  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH Olympic set up a Clarence Cup quarter-final clash away to Comber Rec, but they had to do it the hard way at Kilmore Road on Saturday.The biting cold wind and rain turned this derby clash into a lottery which went to a penalty shoot-out that ended in total controversy.Olympic held a slight advantage at - on penalties when Kilmore goalkeeper Darren Ross threw his side a leline after he brilliantly saved Niall Murrayrsquos spot kick.This was no more than Kilmore deserved, but their players and supporters quickly became incandescent with rage when the referee insisted that Ross had moved off his line and ordered the spot kick to be taken again.Murray made no mistake at the second attempt and blasted Olympic into the last eight as Kilmore were left to rue what might have been.Olympic played with the swirling, gusting wind in their backs in the first half, but Matty Hardy and Jack Larkin at the heart of the Kilmore defence looked calm and composed.Olympic were struggling to get the ball down in the middle of the park and play their normal passing game as Kilmorersquos Michael Monan and Anton McGrattanrsquos forced Stevie and Ryan Noade into hurried passes.However, with  minutes gone Murray used the wind to his advantage.Olympic were awarded a free kick just inside the Kilmore half and out on the line beside their own dugout. Murray launched the ball high into orbit and wasnrsquot the least bit surprised when the wind took over and helped it on its way to the top right hand corner of the net with Ross clutching at thin air.Six minutes later at the other end Anton McGrattan struck yet another free kick from just outside the box past Ryan Walsh to bring the sides level.Olympic continued to see more of the ball, but Jones, when he did receive the ball out wide, was let down on a few occasions by a lack of support in the box and some wasteful finishing from Shane Murray.Kilmore were far from out of it and the bustling Joe McKinney was proving a handful and he almost gave the visitors a nd minute lead when he shot wide after a sizzling breakaway run from Anton McGrattan.Murray missed another good chance for Olympic after Jones carved out another opening before Kilmore seized the lead.Callum Dougan foraged deep and played a delightful through ball into the path of McKinney, who had beaten the offside trap. McKinney wasnrsquot for hanging around and after shrugging off Stevie McGoran, herounded lsquokeeper Walsh to make it -.The unrelenting wind and rain greeted both sets of players back for the second half and it was Kilmore who went on the offensive with Ryan Slavin being denied by Walsh.Two minutes later Kilmore shot themselves in the foot when Murray floated a free kick into the box and Jason Noade had all the time in the world to head the ball past Ross.Things became hot and heavy for a while with the tackles flying in, but clear cut chances at either end were hard to come by.Kilmore were now asking most of the questions, but a resolute Olympic rearguard refused to budge and Walsh had relatively little to do, apart from the odd shot from distance.Extra-time produced little of note, but Kilmore could have wrapped things up in the second period when McKinney crossed for Pete Casey, but, for once, he sliced his effort into no manrsquos land.Jones, Jason and Stevie Noadersquos first three penalties were perfect for Olympic, but they were matched by McGivern, McKinney and Larkin for Kilmore.Adam McLean nudged Olympic - ahead before Anton McGrattan fired his effort wide, advantage Olympic.Murrayrsquos first attempt was saved by Ross, but the referee made him retake the penalty as he insisted Ross had moved forward off his line. Murray was not about to look a gt horse in the mouth and drilled his second attempt to the net, much to the despair of a mightily aggrieved Kilmore side.Ballynahinch Olympic: Ryan Walsh, Dalton Tate, Aaron McClean, Jason Noade, Ryan Noade, Stevie McGoran, Stevie Noade, Ryan Molloy, Shane Murray, Niall Murray.

The backstop is part of the Withdrawal Agreement, and the Withdrawal Agreement is not open for re-negotiation.\"And French President Emmanuel Macron also said the agreement was \"not re-negotiable\", in comments just moments before MPs voted.The Commons approved a cross-party amendment, tabled by Midlands MPs Caroline Spelman and Jack Dromey, rejecting a no-deal Brexit by  to .The vote is not legally binding on the government but will impose massive political pressure on the prime minister to delay Brexit from its scheduled date of March she cannot secure a new deal from Brussels.The PM told MPs: \"I agree that we should not leave without a deal. However, simply opposing no-deal is not enough to stop it.\"The Government will now redouble its efforts to get a deal that this House can support.\"There was uproar in the chamber as she said: \"There is limited appetite for such a change in the EU and negotiating it will not be easy. But in contrast to a fortnight ago, this House has made it clear what it needs to approve a withdrawal agreement.\"Mrs May said she would seek \"legally binding changes to the Withdrawal Agreement that deal with concerns on the backstop while guaranteeing noto a hard border\". article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The deaths has been reported to the coroner.It comes as almost , patient accidents or falls were reported between November  and December .Of the five unexpected deaths to patients known to mental health services, one was found hanging at home but the cause of deaths of the other patients are not yet confirmed.One dental patient was diagnosed withsquamous cell carcinoma ndash a form of skin cancer ndash having previously been downgraded from urgent to routine.Another patient suffered a stroke after ldquofollow-up processes were not followed and had not started blood thinning treatment, while another patient died whilst on the cardiac surgery waiting list.In another serious incident, an eye disorder patientrsquos sight ldquodeteriorated signicantly after not being offered a follow-up appointment.A regulation  report ndash which is sent to organisations when a coroner believes that action should be taken to prevent further deaths ndash has also been sent to the health board since the end of November.The report relates to an inquest in which the coroner concluded that a patient died after taking a deliberate overdose of his prescribed medication on an in-patient ward at University Hospital of Wales.The medication was not locked away in his bedside cupboard, which contravened the medicines code patient property policies, a health board report says.The health board report says: ldquoThe management of patientrsquos own medication is one which presents a particular challenge in the healthcare environment. Following the incident the UHB has carried out a benchmarking exercise across the UK and it does not appear that there is anyone centre that has managed to put an effective solution in place.ldquoWhile patients are always encouraged to hand over all medication or to send it home with family, there are many practical issues that make this dficult to implement and monitor robustly. Medication is the patientrsquos own property and they can refuse to hand it over should they wish. Staff would of course always have a discussion with the patient and the family with regards to the risk.ldquoIt is not possible for staff to monitor patientsrsquo property on a continuous basis and there are occasions when family members bring in additional property for patients while they are in hospital and this may include medication.ldquoThe UHB has submitted a response to the coroner and will continue to benchmark in order to find an effective solution.No new lsquoNever Eventsrsquo took place between November and December.Of the , falls reported betweenNovember  and December , % resulted in no harm, or minor harm.In December , more than  falls were reported ndash but this was the lowest monthly figure for that period.The health board is developing a strategy to reduce falls and reviewing prevention and management of bed sores.New guidance from the Welsh Government will mean fewer pressure damage incidents will be reported as lsquoSerious Incidentsrsquo, a health board report says.Patient approval remains high with the arearsquos two main hospitals as surveys suggest % are satisfied with their experience atUniversity Hospital of Llandough, and % of patients are satisfied atUniversity Hospital of Wales.A spokeswoman for Cardf and Vale University Health Board said: ldquoIn line with our duty of candour we report allseriousincidentsto Welsh Government, the public and to our board in line with best practice.ldquoWelsh Government guidance requires us to report unexpected deaths of patients who are known to mental health services and die unexpectedly or experienceseriousharm in a community setting. Patients and their families are made aware ofincidentsand are kept informed during investigations and discussions with our clinical teams.ldquoThe increased reporting of pressure damage reflects a period of education and training of staff to improve the quality of data being recorded.ldquoAllincidentsare fully investigated and appropriate actions are taken to reduce the risk of recurrence in the future. This enables clinical boards and the corporate teams to identy areas of good practice but also to identy emerging trends and issues that require action in order to improve safety and quality of services. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentsSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

Dealing with this type of call prevents our staff from dealing with genuine emergencies.ldquoCalling an ambulance when you donrsquot need one wastes time and resources which could have been better spent responding someone genuinely in need of the high level clinical care ambulance crews provide. Ambulances are not a taxi service and arriving at hospital by ambulance does not mean yoursquoll be seen quicker.\"She added: ldquoIf someone is seriously ill or injured and their le is at risk, you should call  immediately.

That being the case, this council, like many others in Wales, is unable to continue to provide the level of subsidy to outdoor sports provision that it has in the past.ldquoExploring dferent ways of working, including the transfer of responsibilities in appropriate circumstances to community groups is a key element of the councilrsquos strategy moving forward as it addresses dficult budget priorities.ldquoFollowing the successful transfer of responsibilities for five libraries to community-based organisations and looking at a number of successful sports clubs across the Vale of Glamorgan who operate without any subsidy from the Council, it is hoped that the majority of clubs currently using council facilities will be able to continue to provide opportunities for all to participate in sports activities. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The event ran from Saturday March  to Tuesday March .The Vale brewery Tomos and Lilford produced a special beer called ldquoCarnival - Penarth Pale Ale.Meanwhile the two Penarth butchers, Thompson Family Butchers and David Lush Butchers, both created their own special Penarth carnival sausages.The organisers estimated that more than  people took part in costume in the walk through town on Saturday, which saw the coronation of the lsquoFirst Foolrsquo at am. The procession marched from Sully Terrace through town.At .am in Penarth Library, there was a presentation of the head of Bendigeidfran, from The Mabinogion. The head was made by children from Cogan and Penygarth schools.The lsquoFirst Foolrsquo was then sent by train to the Tower of London to bring news of the Carnival to the traditional resting place of the head of Bendigeidfran, where he met the Raven Master.Long distance cyclist Dave Hann was due to cycle to Harlech, north Wales to raise money for the RNLI Penarth, and bring news to Harlech that Carnival had broken out in Penarth.Unfortunately Mr Hann only got as far as Cardigan before Storm Freya made it too dangerous to continue. Organisers have one barrel of carnival ale left and will take it to Harlech by train in the next few weeks to share it and the storybook of the carnival.On Sunday, two rugby teams took part in a ldquotug-o-sausage to decide which butcherrsquos sausage was better. Congratulations were extended to the winners, Team Thompson.Congratulations were also extended to the traders Ener-chi and Lilypad by the organisers, for having the best-dressed shop windows. Particular praise was singled out for the carnival flowers at Holm House Hotel created by Lilypad.Further nights of partying, songs and dancing were spotted in the Albion, St Faganrsquos Castle, and other pubs, bars and venues across Penarth. There were also celebrations on the Penarth Pier on Tuesday night following a Pancake Day event, while wandering bands of musicians like Wonderbrass kept spirits high.The festival culminated in a grand Mardis Gras party on Tuesday, which saw crowds of costumed residents dance the night away.Richard Parry, one of the carnival organisers, said: ldquoToday is Ash Wednesday, the beginning of Lent. Carnival finished last night on Mardi Gras.ldquoThanks to everyone who took part, contributed, encouraged, sponsored, smiled and partied, especially those people who took a carnival Bank Holiday Monday.ldquoIt was fabulous to hear your Carnival Bank Holiday stories, and to all those people who have had little private carnival moments of joy over the festival, thatrsquos what it has all been about.ldquoAnd some people have already said, lsquosee you next year!rsquoldquoThere were lots of people laughing and smiling on the sidelines, telling me they wanted to take part next year ndash just with a little more notice next time. But now itrsquos established, wersquoll be back next year and ready for even more people to join in the fun! article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

How did you get started in the industry  When we first opened Asia Supermarket in , it was the family’s ambition to bring a taste of home to Belfast. We brought the Chinese culture to the local community through cuisine and provided authentic and tasty ingredients for the hospitality trade here. We branched out due to demand to also provide Indian, Korean, Philippine, Thai and Middle Eastern food and are always looking for opportunities to extend our range. Typically, who are your clients or customers  Our customers would be both wholesale and retail to include restaurants all over Northern Ireland, as well as consumers who want to create some unique dishes in their home kitchens. Do you enjoy what you do, and what in particular  Yes, and in particular having just completed the new build we have enjoyed being involved in the day-to-day aspects, given the bespoke nature of the project, coupled with the hustle and bustle of the day to day challenges of satisfying our customer needs. What is the most dficult part of your job  One of the most dficult parts of the job is sourcing good quality produce at competitive prices and enhancing the range of products available. However, we’re very proud of our new supermarket and warehouse which provides even more quality and choice for our customers. What are the challenges facing your sector, and the economy in general  One of the biggest challenges facing our sector is the cost of goods from our suppliers, particularly those procured in foreign currencies which in turn has a knock-on effect on what we charge our wholesale and retail customers. To maintain our share of the market we constantly endeavour to get the best prices from our suppliers so that we can pass on competitive prices to our customers to maintain and grow our market share. With Brexit looming it will bring a major impact on imports costs and supplier prices which will present a major challenge for our business.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/cleaver_1.jpg","title":"is the future bright for the ni energy market","story":"Posted on Tuesday  February  by Ulster Business It is clear that there are a number of signicant challenges facing the energy sector in Northern Ireland but where there are challenges, there are also opportunities, according to law firm Cleaver Fulton Rankin.The ExecutiveNorthern Ireland has just completed its second year without a ing local government and in the words of David Sterling, head of the Northern Ireland Civil Service, the Civil Service is “… doing everything we can in the prevailing circumstances…but civil servants cannot take the place of ministers when it comes to strategic policy development or in taking transformative decisions”.  This is very much the case with regard to energy policy. The Department of the Economy’s Strategic Energy Framework, which was endorsed by the Executive in , has over the last nine years, led to some very positive changes to the energy generation and supply mix, particularly from renewable sources.However the  year framework is nearing its end and needs to be replaced. The Department is making such preparations as it can on a draft Strategic Energy Framework across the areas of heat, electricity, transport and energy efficiency which it aims to make public some time in the spring. Whether or not this region has its Assembly back to adopt such a framework will remain to be seen, but in the meantime it will ensure the subject remains live and high on the agenda.Brexit and I-SEMThe new wholesale electricity market known as the Integrated Single Electricity Marketwent live on October , . It is designed to deliver increased levels of competition which, it is hoped, will help put downward pressure on prices as well as encouraging greater levels of security of supply and transparency. While the island of Ireland is now integrated more closely with European markets, there is a risk that Brexit could halt this integration. British and Irish business groups and energy trade associations such as the CBI, IBEC, Electricity Association of Ireland, RenewableUK, British Irish Chamber of Commerce and EnergyUK all refer to the delivery of I-SEM, or to the UK’s continued access to the IEM, as post-Brexit priorities for security of supply and or consumer protection. I-SEM is clearly a priority that must be preserved.While Brexit may present challenges and continuing uncertainty, there are certainly opportunities for investment and acquisition in the electricity market as more complex, specialist expertise will be required to effectively trade power on the I-SEM. Policy barriers or inaction cannot be allowed to prevent I-SEM from realising its potential of fully integrating the market by efficiently moving energy from producer to demand.Renewable incentive schemesDespite being on track to hit its target of % of electricity generation from renewables, Northern Ireland risks being left behind. The lack of a replacement for the development support mechanism, Renewables Obligations Certicateafter its closure in April , means Northern Ireland is lagging behind Great Britain which has established the Contract for Dference regime and Ireland, which has started work on its Renewable Electricity Support Scheme . While neither scheme is perfect, doing nothing is not an option. The devolution of energy presented Northern Ireland with the opportunity to shape its own policy but without a government, will the sector and the infrastructure be able to remain fit for purpose GasWith its development over the last  years, the gas network in Northern Ireland, with its low population density, must be seen as a success story. Consumers and businesses have been offered greater choice in terms of price and security of supply. Nevertheless there are certainly further opportunities for gas distributors and suppliers to expand the natural gas network, particularly in the west of the country and east Co Down. So despite the apparent obstacles and challenges, there is opportunity for development and progress in Northern Ireland’s energy sector. The benefits for Northern Ireland will be in terms of security of supply, price and environmental sustainability. Cleaver Fulton Rankin,  Bedford Street, Belfast BT FW.

The proposal for the work to Broadcasting House on Ormeau Avenue in Belfast was approved last March by the BBC board, with the announcement made to staff by the BBCs director general Lord Tony Hall. Now, the plans – which include the redevelopment of the exisiting BBC Broadcasting House building, including the refurbishment and extension of the buildings – will be put to the public, as part of a necessary pre-application event before planning can be submitted. It includes a new extension to the rear, including a landscaped plaza opening onto Linenhall Street. A spokesman for BBC Northern Ireland told Ulster Business: \"As part of the pre-planning application process, public consultation events will take place this month before we can move on to the next phase. The investment to BBC Broadcasting House in Belfast, announced in March last year, will transform the iconic building, its technology and facilities, highlighting the BBC’s commitment to audiences in Northern Ireland. We will share more detail in due course.\" Money invested will go towards structural work on the -year-old building to ensure its long-term sustainability, addressing what the state broadcaster has said are \"critical deficiencies\". Before the announcement last year that the BBC was to stay put and develop its existing building, it was understood the broadcaster had been eyeing up other city centre locations, or could create a new media hub in the Titanic Quarter. The event will take place at the Clayton Hotel on March , between pm and pm, and March  between pm and .pm.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/pin_1.jpg","title":"pinnacle given top sage accolade","story":"Posted on Wednesday March  by Ulster Business IT firm Pinnacle has been awarded a top accolade for its Sage software and services in Ireland.The company, which has offices across the UK and Ireland including Belfast and Dublin, has been named by Sage Ireland as its ‘highest growth partner’ for sales of Sage cloud.Search Workshop Supplies, one of Ireland’s largest suppliers of garage and workshop equipment, is one of the latest firms which has partnered with Pinnacle.Olivia O’Dea of Search Workshop Supplies, said: “From our initial meeting with Pinnacle’s business development director Siobhan Marley, we were given a solid reassurance that Pinnacle fully understood the growing needs of our business.”Barry Murphy, managing director of Sage Ireland, said:“The team at Pinnacle are incredibly passionate in supporting their customers to thrive in an ever-evolving market.

Since I took on the Northern Ireland role six years ago, we’ve doubled the workforce, become the fastest-growing UK region and are now the biggest office outside London with just over , people,” he says. “Our strategy was to be the leading provider of professional services in the Northern Ireland market but there’s no way we’d be the size we are now had we only focused on that.”Instead Paul built on the legacy of his predecessors and accelerated growth in new, technology solutions, while retaining the traditional accounting, tax and consulting services. Today PwC remains the leading provider of advisory services to the region’s family-owned and owner-managed businesses and multinationals, but has also built an impressive portfolio of cutting-edge technologies, opened the door to signicant export markets and is tackling some of society’s most challenging issues. “We’ve grown in many new areas – blockchain, cyber, cloud-based accounting services – but the single biggest impact has come from developing our distinctive ‘Operate’ ision,” Paul says. ”Operate is our service delivery business, which supports and delivers technology and people solutions to large, often regulated organisations. So instead of just advising clients how to solve their problems, we now do the heavy lting for them.”Run by Ian McConnell, a partner who’s been with the firm for  years, Operate is already attracting global attention. “Clients increasingly don’t want a consulting firm just to tell them what to do: they want a problem-solving partnership.” he says. “In its first year of operation, Operate earned over £m, now has , people and is still growing.”Reinforcing Paul’s confidence to invest in Northern Ireland as a strategic location is a  forecast from TheCityUK that it could become the second fastest-growing financial services region outside London by , helping deliver £bn of additional gross value-addedto the UK economy. But that depends on the ability to recruit the right talent, and he says the challenge now is finding and retaining the skills.That’s an issue that particularly concerns Paul as he looks ahead at the economic picture with Brexit and lack of an Assembly to the fore.“The business community wants clarity and certainty. Ideally we want to see a Brexit withdrawal agreement that then gives the scope for a trade deal that offers Northern Ireland the capacity to trade both with the EU and as part of the UK. The potential competitive advantages and ability to attract investment would be terric and the kind of economic accelerator which we have sought for years, but never managed to gain.“However I do worry about the impact of political stalemate on our long term future. Failure to invest, particularly in education and skills, will impair our competitiveness and make this a less attractive place for business.The decreasing effectiveness of health, environment and infrastructure will mean that talented people will opt to make choices to live their lives where.“In my national role, I see other parts of the country fusing partnerships in innovative and exciting ways between business,education and government. Compared to that, we are already getting left behind. We should be moving forward.”Which brings us to Merchant Square, the £m, , sq ft office development which PwC takes over in . “We have great people and one reason why we’re moving to the city centre is because that’s where they want to be. By the time we’re ready to relocate towards the end of , we will have at least , people moving in to the heart of Belfast.“That makes it important for Belfast too and not just because it’s the city’s biggest-ever private sector office deal. As we were making our decision, the whole Bank Buildings issue was at its height, and we wanted to show our support for the city and its future.” The Merchant Square relocation project is led by Kieragh Nelson, a director who joined the firm in . “We’ve got serious ambitions for Merchant Square,” she says. ”There’s a sense of ‘OK, we’ve just opened flagship offices in London, and Manchester – what more can we do in Belfast how can we make it even better ’ And the vast majority of decisions on how it will look, feel and work are made by the team here. Our goal is to create the most technologically-advanced, innovative and collaborative space for ourselves, our clients, and also for the communities around us.”Doing the right thing is a maxim often repeated in PwC, but it gets backed up. On the morning of our interview, a large group of people from the firm, including Paul, took part in one of their regular ‘Darkness Into Light’ walks to raise awareness of mental health. The firm’s commitment to social mobility has seen a number of employment programmes launched, notably the UK’s first technology degree apprenticeships, with Queen’s University one of five universities selected to run the programme. And it’s expanding its Hive Academy programme, which delivers free technology education to primary and secondary schools, to the Channel Islands.This year the firm challenged itself and created a unique charity partnership – the PwC Challenge – to create innovative suicide prevention programmes.“Our purpose is to build trust in society and solve important problems, and it really does feature in how we look at what we do. We strive to celebrate and share our knowledge widely and unselfishly with our people and communities and not be afraid to take a stand and do the right thing. And we put it at the heart of what we do every day. “Take the PwC Challenge: more people in Northern Ireland have died by suicide since the signing of the Good Friday Agreement than from the violence in the years before. This is a crisis, and it’s one which affects our people, and our communities. So we asked local charities in north and west Belfast, the worst affected areas in the UK, to collaborate and devise really innovative approaches programmes to give opportunities to young people and their families through education, technology, sports, and mental health coaching.“As well as the clubs in PwC which fundraise every year for the challenge, our own people are volunteering every week in ious projects – particularly with our Hive Academy. We want to ensure that people, who are high achievers in many dferent fields, are supported to play their fullest part in society.” For Paul, it’s all about the people. Last year PwC invested around £m on staff development here, and this year, a number of people have begun the first Masters in Operation service delivery, run by Ulster University. “It’s important to support people to develop their careers in ways they mightn’t have considered when they joined. That’s a key building block of our purpose – it drives social mobility, equality and ersity.“It’s true thatsomeone decides they want to head off and join PwC Australia or New York, they can. That’s the beauty of working for a global firm – those opportunities are there. But what I really want to make sure is that you don’t have to leave:you want to live and work in Belfast, and have global clients, work with cutting-edge technology and be part of a firm that’s engaged in society, you can do that too.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/eopen_1.jpg","title":"the open its the biggest thing since sliced bread","story":"Posted on Wednesday March  by Ulster Business With just  weeks until Northern Ireland hosts the biggest sporting event in its history, John Mulgrew speaks to the bosses tasked with organising the legendary Open Championship We’ve come a long way in just a short few years. Despite its huge golfing credentials, especially in the modern game, it had been more than  years since Northern Ireland played host to the Irish Open.That all changed in , when it ed north to Royal Portrush. And that, buoyed on a refreshed and renewed interest in both the tournament, and the sport itself.Now, in  weeks, that same links course will see more than , people flock to arguably the world’s greatest golf tournament and the largest sporting event ever hosted on these shores – The Open – transforming a small Co Antrim town for a handful of summer days.“There is a buzz with everyone at the RA,” Johnnie Cole-Hamilton tells Ulster Business. He’s executive director of championships at the RA – the ruling authority of golf throughout the world, aside from areas such as the US, and organisation responsible for organising The Open.“This will be my th Open Championship, and one reason I continue to be involved is that it’s a challenge every time.”It will see Irish golfing greats, including Open winners Rory McIlroy and Darren Clarke, Graeme McDowelland Padraig Harrington – among others – join the biggest name in sport, Tiger Woods.“One of big drivers to ing to Royal Portrush was the success of the Northern Irish and Irish golfers. They have raised the profile of golf immeasurably. “We are absolutely delighted with the response so far – % of tickets sold in  hours, and sold out within a record-breaking eight weeks.”Johnnie says the decision to choose Portrush, bringing it back to the course after a  year hiatus, was the correct one – buoyed by the support from the community, agencies and organisations. The th Open will be held at Royal Portrush from July -.“In my career, we had a similar scenario, ing to Liverpool for the first time in  years, and we had a very similar response. It ed in , and now Royal Liverpool is firmly on the rota, and I hope that Royal Portrush is similar.”Of course, aside from the golf, both the short-term and long-term economic benefits will trickle down and benefit, not on the surrounding areas, but prop Northern Ireland up on yet another global .According to Tourism NI chief executive John McGrillen that longer-term benefit could be worth up to £m for the wider economy.“There will be , tickets sold for championship days, and % of those sold to people out of state, outside Northern Ireland,” he tells Ulster Business.“It allows us to present an extremely positive image for Northern Ireland, and into key markets across the globe. We will never have experienced the opportunity to provide such a positive image of Northern Ireland. Despite what we might think, there are perception issues.“Northern Ireland has a normalised society and some of the most dramatic golf courses, scenery and landscape to see.“More specically, the fact that the Open will have been here, as one of the world’s top golf courses, will drive up the amount of spend, especially from golf tourism.”That alone makes up around % of Northern Ireland’s tourism intake. John says he wants that to grow to £m by . He says golfing visitors spend around four times that of an average tourist.Johnnie says all signs so far suggest that the Open in Portrush is “going to be an enormous” success. But the process hasn’t come without its challenges – namely theIrish Sea.“This is the first Open Championship we have hosted in my time, in which we have a body of water between our base and our contractor base. There’s getting things across water, and an enormous amount of work on the golf course – new holes, a new road system around the course and a tunnel for the players from one of the new greens to tee. You can’t do that without support from the golf club“The members have been hugely supportive, turning the course upside down, but maintaining integrity and enhancing .”He said, along with the blue light services, local authorities, council and tourism groups, the community in and around Portrush “understands that this will bring great benefits” to the area and Northern Ireland as a whole. “You can overcome dficulties with support,” he says.“Royal Portrush has never had more than , people drive to it, or get the train to it, at the same time. It’s a challenge to make sure we deliver a wonderful Open Championship and a spectator experience.”John McGrillen says the triumph in landing the Open itself was down to the success of the Irish Open in the last few years. “You had more than , people turning out at Portrush… visitor numbers had been dwindling.“That allows us to demonstrate that the course can deal with that many people. Everyoneworked very well, collectively, and that gave confidence to the RA that we would have the capacity to deliver it. The risk factors they had were eliminated because of the success of the Irish Open, and that was very critical.”As for boosting many of the hundreds of businesses in and around the area, John said: “It will do, as it’s showing off Northern Ireland… we have seen a big boost in the number of Americans playing golf. We don’t have to wait until after the event. “The visibility the Irish Open has given us. We have Royal County Down, Royal Portrush and Portstewart – that’s increased signicantly. It’s not just those courses which are benefiting – it’s being spread. People will typically stay in Belfast and travel around.”For John, the best outcome is, of course, an Irish winner. Oh, and clear skies. “A local winner would be phenomenal. It would be fantastic to see Rory win, or Tiger Woods.“If Tiger Woods won the Open in Portrush, that would remain in peoples’ memories forever. While we would love Rory or other locals to win, I would not be disappointed in Tiger winning it.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/pwc_1221.jpg","title":"pwc ni to crack  staff by ","story":"Posted on Thursday March  by Ulster Business PwC is set crack the , staff mark by the end of next year as it moves into its new £m offices in the heart of Belfast city centre, Ulster Business can reveal.Just  months after being appointed to PwC’s national management board as head of UK regions, Paul Terrington, PwC’s NI regional chair, has no plans to reduce his commitment to keep growing the business here.“This is an incredibly exciting time to be part of PwC. Since I took on the Northern Ireland role six years ago, we’ve doubled the workforce, become the fastest-growing UK region and are now the biggest office outside London with just over , people,” he says. “Our strategy was to be the leading provider of professional services in the Northern Ireland market but there’s no way we’d be the size we are now had we only focused on that.”Speaking about the move to its new headquarters in Merchant Square – a £m, , sq ft office – Mr Terrington said:“We have great people and one reason why we’re moving to the city centre is because that’s where they want to be. By the time we’re ready to relocate towards the end of , we will have at least , people moving in to the heart of Belfast.”On the current political uncertainty, he says: “The business community wants clarity and certainty. Ideally we want to see a Brexit withdrawal agreement that then gives the scope for a trade deal that offers Northern Ireland the capacity to trade both with the EU and as part of the UK. The potential competitive advantages and ability to attract investment would be terric and the kind of economic accelerator which we have sought for years, but never managed to gain.”Meanwhile, lettings in Belfast are expected to remain buoyant this year despite the uncertain political climate, according to a report from Lambert Smith Hampton. That’s been buoyed by PwC’s pre-letting of the Merchant Square development, which is currently under construction.
