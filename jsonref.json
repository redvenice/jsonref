Why can\u0027t we get the best fish in the world, create the best batter and try and serve with amazing potatoes?\u0027We\u0027ve just deemed fish and chips as this cheap product but the cooking process is something very different.\u0027Speaking at the event, Kerridge also urged domestic cooks to have a microwave to cut down on food waste and ensure leftovers can be reheated. He told how culinary snobs should rethink their views of the devices, first popular in the 1980s and 1990s, which he believes are \u0027great\u0027. \u0027Microwaves are really good.

My son Acey, I did him toast the other morning. I did set the fire alarm off.\u0027Beth, my wife, was out. I did it under the grill, right, forgot about it. We\u0027ve all done that.

I’m playing with the idea of comedy and tragedy – the masks of ancient Greek theatre’As an actor, and coming from a family in entertainment, I’ve spent pretty much my whole life on set. But what a lot of people don’t realise is just how much downtime you have between scenes. Photographing those moments became a way of documenting my life and the lives of people around me, like a personal archive.Ten years ago, I had just finished filming Crazy Heart when I got a call from George Clooney pitching me his new film, The Men Who Stare at Goats. I was exhausted, but it was such a crazy idea I was immediately interested. When I started to explore it in a little more depth, I knew I had to do it, and off we went into this crazy thing together.I had never met George before, but he was splendid to work with and for. He produced the film and starred in it, and we had such a great time making it. He created such a relaxed atmosphere on set. As this picture shows, he’s playful – an entertainer who’s game for pretty much anything.I shoot on a Widelux, a mechanical swing-lens panoramic camera, which is how I got this doubling effect. I get George in the far left of the viewfinder, then as the shot is exposing, I shout “shift!” at which point he turns his face and makes his sad face. The actor doesn’t move across or anything, they just turn their head.This image is part of a series of photographs that plays with the idea of comedy and tragedy and the masks of ancient Greek theatre. Partly, it’s a way of me exploring what is to be an actor, and tapping into the thrill of acting as I see it: the chance to represent what it means to be a human being – the extreme joy and sadness that make us human. But it also speaks to the masks we all wear in different situations.I’ve always been interested in photography. As a kid I played with my dad’s Nikon, and when he installed a darkroom in our house I loved getting into the technical side of it and seeing what shots would come out of the soup. The first wide-lens camera I had was a wedding gift from my wife, and I’ve shot pretty exclusively on Widelux cameras ever since.I started shooting on set during the filming of King Kong in the 1970s. My character had a Nikon strapped around his neck, so I thought I might as well use it. I guess it started out as part of my character but it became this passion.I used to get mad at myself for taking photos, or playing music, or writing songs, or pouring myself into any creative pursuit that wasn’t acting. I would berate myself that it was a waste of time, that I should focus on one thing. But I’ve come to realise that creativity feeds creativity – it’s all part of the same thing and that you should give yourself time to explore your passions.Shooting on set is a pretty amazing thing. First, because the lighting is spectacular. And second, you’re shooting people who know how to interact with a camera. For me and a lot of actors, even being around a camera changes something in your chemistry.I never intended to publish these shots. Originally, I did it so I could make little books for the cast and crew to remember the experience and time we spent together.

It centres on the fortunes – amorous and political – of Genji, the son of an emperor. The original manuscript of the story no longer exists, with the oldest versions of the story believed to have been transcribed by the poet Teika, who died in 1241.Until now, just four chapters of the 54-chapter story are confirmed to be Teika’s transcriptions, but now a fifth chapter, which depicts Genji’s encounter with the girl who becomes his wife, Murasaki, has also been identified as Teika’s. The manuscript had been kept in an oblong chest in a storeroom at the Tokyo home of Motofuyu Okochi, a descendant of the former feudal lord of the Mikawa-Yoshida Domain in Aichi Prefecture, the Japan Times reported.Experts at Reizeike Shiguretei Bunko, a foundation for the preservation of cultural heritage, have now confirmed its authenticity, with the handwriting of the text, and the cover of the manuscript, identical to other Teika manuscripts. The foundation said although the newly-found manuscript “mostly” matches the common version of the story, there are some grammatical differences.According to the Asahi Shimbun, family records show the manuscript has been in the hands of the Okochi family since 1743, when it was handed down from the Kuroda family of the Fukuoka feudal domain.Kyoto University professor Junko Yamamoto told the paper that previous research on the chapter has relied on manuscripts of The Tale of Genji that were completed about 250 years later. “It is very significant that this discovery of the manuscript edited by Teika will be available for researchers,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/347782798d6793001850078bd4e12de805f617cf/0_54_2440_1464/master/2440.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=67f9d2191eb8701bd052dbfc7986d3e7","title":"nobel prizes in literature olga tokarczuk peter handke 2019 2018","story":"The Swedish Academy announced laureates for 2018 and 2019, after scandal forced last year’s award to be postponedThe Polish novelist and activist Olga Tokarczuk and the controversial Austrian author Peter Handke have both won the Nobel prize in literature.The choice of Tokarczuk and Handke comes after the Swedish Academy promised to move away from the award’s “male-oriented” and “Eurocentric” past.Tokarczuk, an activist, public intellectual, and critic of Poland’s politics, won the 2018 award, and was cited by the committee for her “narrative imagination that with encyclopedic passion represents the crossing of boundaries as a form of life”. She is a bestseller in Poland, and has become much better known in the UK since winning the 2018 Booker international prize for her sixth novel, Flights. The Nobel committee’s Anders Olsson said her work, which “centres on migration and cultural transitions”, was “full of wit and cunning”.Picking Handke, who was cited for “an influential work that with linguistic ingenuity has explored the periphery and the specificity of human experience”, as 2019’s winner has already provoked controversy. The Kosovan ambassador to the US, Vlora Çitaku, called the decision “scandalous … a preposterous and shameful decision”.The Austrian playwright and novelist, who has Slovene roots on his maternal side, spoke at the 2006 funeral of Serbian war criminal Slobodan Milošević, declaring “I don’t know the truth. But I look. I listen. I feel. I remember. This is why I am here today, close to Yugoslavia, close to Serbia, close to Slobodan Milošević.” After widespread criticism, he turned down a nomination for the Heinrich Heine prize before politicians could withdraw it over his political views. His 2014 win of the International Ibsen award was met by protests in Oslo.Perhaps more gallingly for the Nobel committee, Handke also called for the prize to be wound up in 2014. “The Nobel prize should finally be abolished,” he told Austrian newspaper Die Presse, adding that though it delivered “a moment of attention, six pages in the newspaper”, he did not admire the choices. Recalling that Handke had called the prize a “false canonisation” of literature, the Slovenian philosopher Slavoj Žižek said this year’s award “proves that he was right”.“This is Sweden today,” Žižek continued, “an apologist of war crimes gets a Nobel prize while the country fully participated in the character assassination of the true hero of our times, Julian Assange. Our reaction should be: not the literature Nobel prize for Handke but the Nobel peace prize for Assange.”Handke, known particularly for the play Über die Dörfer (Walk About the Villages), the novel Die Wiederholung (Repetition), and the screenplay for Wim Wenders’ Wings of Desire, is, according to Olsson, “one of the most influential writers of contemporary fiction, and part of the literary debate since 1966”, who “with great artistry explores the periphery and unseen places”.The committee acknowledged the issues surrounding Handke in their citation for the award, admitting that “he has, at times, caused controversy”, but adding that “he cannot be considered an engaged writer in the sense of Sartre, and he gives us no political programs”.The permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, Mats Malm, said both laureates had been informed of their win. Handke was at home, and Tokarczuk was on a reading tour in Germany and had to pull her car to the side of the road when she received the call.Handke’s pro-Milošević stance has seen him condemning “criminal” Nato intervention in Serbia, and claiming that the Muslims had staged their own massacres in Sarajevo and blamed them on the Serbs.According to Fiammetta Rocco, culture correspondent of the Economist and administrator of the Booker international prize, the two winners should be seen “in context together”.“They have obviously very different writing styles but they do write about contested lands, about who owns memory, about the central human need to tell stories,” Rocco said. “Olga Tokarczuk of course is beloved by everybody except the hard Polish right, Peter Handke is not so beloved of everybody, except for the arch followers of Slobodan Milošević, but still they are both greatly admired for their formal work, for their imagination, for their use of language. There’s more in seeing them together than separately. The more I think about it the more I think it was a very conscious choice to pair these two writers together.”Speaking to the Polish television channel TVN24, Tokarczuk said she believes in the novel as a “deep way of communication across borders, across languages, across cultures”. She confirmed she had heard that the Polish culture minister Piotr Glinski had never read her books, adding that “there are readers for whom this can be boring or not fit their temperament. Not everyone needs to read me.” After the award, Glinski congratulated Tokarczuk, and said he will revisit her work.At Tokarczuk’s UK publisher, Fitzcarraldo, a small independent press which also published 2015’s Nobel laureate, Svetlana Alexievich, Jacques Testard was about to speak to his printers to rush through reprints of her books Flights and Drive Your Plow Over the Bones of the Dead. Tokarczuk had not been published in the UK for some time when he approached her about taking on her work – he had wanted to find a Polish writer to publish in English in the wake of the Brexit referendum, and the violence against the Polish community that followed in its wake. Tokarczuk, he said, was the clear choice.“She’s such a special writer – she has an incredible range,” he said. “She’s also a political activist and dissident, and a figurehead for a more progressive, feminist, environmental politics. She’s a public intellectual and doesn’t shy away from that.”In 2014, her Polish publisher had to hire bodyguards to protect her after she outraged right-wing patriots by saying Poland had committed “horrendous acts” of colonisation in the past, leading to her being described as “targowiczanin” – an ancient term for traitor.The selections of Handke and Tokarczuk follow an unprecedented two years of scandal at the Swedish Academy. Last year’s prize was postponed because of the “reduced public confidence” that followed rape accusations made against Jean-Claude Arnault, the French husband of academy member Katarina Frostenson. Frostenson and six other members ended up leaving the Swedish Academy amid bitter rows over how the accusations were handled, and Arnault, who was also accused of leaking the names of laureates, is now in prison for rape.The prize is given to, in the words of the will of Alfred Nobel: “the person who shall have produced in the field of literature the most outstanding work in an ideal direction.” There have been 116 literature laureates to date – of whom just 15 are women. English is by far the most common language for Nobel laureates, with 29 winners writing in English, followed by 14 in French, 14 in German, 11 in Spanish and seven in Swedish.Olsson, who is chair of the Nobel prize in literature committee, admitted earlier this month that: “we had a more Eurocentric perspective on literature, and now we are looking all over the world.” Olsson also admitted to a “much more male-oriented” perspective in the past, which he said was changing.The Swedish Academy has long tended to veil the process for choosing its candidates in mystery, with its 18 members elected for life, and nominations of candidates not made public until 50 years have passed. Told to show “greater openness towards the outside world” by the Nobel Foundation, and charged with restoring its credibility, it now allows members to voluntarily resign, and has appointed seven new members, with Malm taking over from former permanent secretary Sara Danius, who was forced out during the Arnault scandal."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b555dbae9a410d93b0d60c500b7177cda0545ac4/902_146_2428_1457/master/2428.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fc4fa6f7f8ebcac2a08d73837e1e6389","title":"new 20 note featuring jmw turner revealed by the bank of england","story":"Polymer note billed as ‘most secure yet’ against forgery enters circulation in FebruaryThe governor of the Bank of England has unveiled the new £20 polymer banknote featuring the artist JMW Turner as the Bank continues its switch away from paper money.Mark Carney revealed the note’s design in Margate at Turner Contemporary gallery, which is named after the painter. Carney was joined by the artist Tracey Emin, who grew up in the Kent coastal town.Turner, the first artist to feature on a British banknote, went to school in Margate and many of his paintings were of the local seascapes. Turner Contemporary is on the site of the lodging house where he stayed when he returned to the town.The £20 note follows the Bank’s launch of polymer £5 and £10 notes, which went into circulation in September 2016 and September 2017 respectively. The Bank is opting for polymer over traditional paper notes because it is cleaner, longer-lasting and harder to forge.The Bank said the latest note was its most secure yet with two windows and a two-colour foil, making it difficult to counterfeit. With more than 2bn £20 notes in circulation, it is Britain’s most used and forged banknote. The foil features Turner Contemporary, which opened in 2011 and helped revive Margate as an artistic centre, in blue and the town’s lighthouse in gold. The note will enter circulation on 20 February alongside existing paper £20 notes, which will be phased out.The new polymer notes feature images of historic British figures, with Winston Churchill appearing on the £5 note and Jane Austen on the £10 note. A £50 note featuring the mathematician and second world war codebreaker Alan Turing will follow in 2021.William Shakespeare was the first historical character to appear on a Bank of England note in 1970. Here’s the full list of the historical characters that have appeared on banknotes issued by the central bank in England and Wales over the last five decades.1970 William Shakespeare, playwright (£20) 1971 Duke of Wellington, soldier and statesman (£5) 1975 Florence Nightingale, founder of modern nursing (£10) 1978 Sir Isaac Newton, physicist and mathematician (£1) 1981 Sir Christopher Wren, architect (£50) 1990 George Stephenson, engineer (£5) 1991 Michael Faraday, scientist (£20) 1992 Charles Dickens, author (£10) 1994 Sir John Houblon, first Bank of England governor (£50) 1999 Sir Edward Elgar, composer (£20) 2000 Charles Darwin, naturalist (£10)2002 Elizabeth Fry, prison reformer (£5)2007 Adam Smith, economist (£20)2011 Matthew Boulton and James Watt, steam engine industrialists (£50)2016 Winston Churchill, prime minister (£5)2017 Jane Austen, author (£10)Carney said on Thursday: “Our banknotes celebrate the UK’s heritage, salute its culture, and testify to the achievements of its most notable iniduals. Turner’s contribution to art extends well beyond his favourite stretch of shoreline.“Turner’s painting was transformative, his influence ned lifetimes, and his legacy endures today. The new £20 note celebrates Turner, his art and his legacy in all their radiant, colourful, evocative glory.”The note features Turner’s 1799 self-portrait, which hangs in Tate Britain, as well as one of his most recognisable works, The Fighting Temeraire – a tribute to the ship which played a big part in Nelson’s victory at the battle of Trafalgar in 1805.The £20 note has a quote from Turner, “light is therefore colour”, and his signature taken from his will, which bequeathed many of his works to the nation.Emin said: “What is really fantastic about Turner being on this note is he was wild and he was a maverick. This note is going to go all over the world and wherever I go I can say: ‘This is where I come from.’ Not just Margate but art. I come from art.”She said if Turner Contemporary had been open when she grew up in Margate her younger years would have been transformed.“If this building had been here and I could have come and looked at art and thought I could be part of something, my adolescent life would have been very different. I might not have been as successful but it would have been very different.”Turner was selected in 2016 from a longlist of 590 painters, sculptors, fashion designers, photographers, film-makers and actors put forward by 30,000 members of the public. The list was whittled down to five and Turner was chosen by the Bank’s banknote character advisory committee.The new £20 note will be the first to feature the signature of Sarah John, the Bank’s chief cashier. She said: “The new £20 is an important part of our commitment to providing banknotes that people can use with confidence. With the £20 being our most common this marks a big step forward in our fight against counterfeiting.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b34f965ce5df67ba96214089e66f0f9be8434e36/52_8_1391_834/master/1391.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5e64054e125af8ab665759dc901c1d02","title":"a serious urban mistake why paris went sour on the new gare du nord","story":"As developers aim to turn France’s busiest train station into a gargantuan airport-style mall, Parisians fear for the local neighbourhood – and the station’s soul“When you tell people in Paris you live near the Gare du Nord, they usually grimace,” sighed Sarah, a French academic in her 50s who has lived on a narrow, traffic-choked street next to Europe’s busiest station for 30 years.“Architecturally, the station building is superb. But neighbourhoods around stations are never easy, wherever they are in the world.”Sarah is part of a local residents’ group that has found itself drawn into one of Paris’s biggest development battles in years. The state rail firm SNCF has joined with private developers and is poised to transform the Gare du Nord into a gargantuan €600m (£540m) shopping and office complex along the lines of an airport. The French government says the massive glass refit – which will chop up the station into walkways and mezzanine levels via 105 escalators – is the only way to cope with the staggering 900,000 passengers per day who will be using the rail hub by 2030.But top French architects and urban planners, including the award-winning Jean Nouvel, are leading a rebellion. In an open letter they slammed the plans as “unacceptable”, “indecent” and a “serious urban mistake”. Paris city hall, which is merely an observer of the project run by the state, has this month vociferously opposed the private commercial plans to add vast shopping space, pleading for it to scaled back. A planning commission verdict on Thursday will determine whether the plans can go ahead. Meanwhile, Paris is grappling with what the essence of station is and how residents should live around it.“They can argue all they like about what is going to be put inside the station, but if the area around the station isn’t taken into account and altered, with the thundering road traffic eased, the neighbourhood will never improve,” Sarah said.The Gare du Nord is one of the busiest rail hubs in the world, behind only the biggest Japanese stations. When travellers get off the Eurostar from London or the Thalys from Brussels and Amsterdam they are – unusually for an international terminal – stepping right into a frenzy of local, commuter and northern transport which sees the departure of 2,100 trains a day, with 500,000 daily travellers from the Paris banlieue (suburbs) alone.And yet the Gare du Nord occupies a comparatively small site wedged into one of the most built-up and densely populated areas of one of the most tightly-packed capitals in Europe. It sits in what was historically a working-class area with a large hospital right beside it, roads hemming it in and almost no green space in the surrounding streets. With trains already running for four storeys below ground, and traffic choking the chaotic and unusually small forecourt, there is precious little room to expand.For a decade, the 19th-century building, seen as an architectural and engineering masterpiece, has suffered from unflattering comparisons with the calm and gleaming St Pancras in London where Eurostar passengers alight in the UK. Andy Street, the former head of John Lewis who is mayor of the West Midlands, even had to apologise to France in 2014 after calling the Gare du Nord “the squalor pit of Europe” compared with what he called the “modern, forward-looking” St Pancras. But the Gare du Nord’s 700,000 passengers per day dwarfs the footfall of the airier London Eurostar terminal. St Pancras has discreetly tucked its shops beneath lower level arches, while the Gare du Nord has obstructed its main concourse with retail units plonked here and there – at the expense of seating for waiting travellers, who as a consequence are often reduced to sitting on the floor.The French state railway SNCF wants a gleaming new station for the 2024 Paris Olympics, even though many architects believe this deadline is too tight. But the giant scale of the project has led to soul-searching about the city’s future.Paris politicians on the left say private money has been allowed to dictate the project and threatens the very fabric of the station. France’s indebted state railway company now renovates Paris stations in partnership with commercial property giants, who stump up the cash and claw back profits by putting in large numbers of shops. The €600m plans for the Gare du Nord – drawn up with the supermarket giant Auchan – would turn the Gare du Nord into a gargantuan shopping and office complex along the lines of an airport. There will be separate spaces for arrivals and departures, which will push travellers up and down a striking number of walkways and escalators to get to and from the tracks while passing the maximum amount of shopping opportunity. Like an airport, there has even been discussion of putting up signs warning people how long it will take to reach their platform.Paris city hall – which is not in charge of the project – has for a year pushed for changes from the sidelines, saying there wasn’t enough space for bikes, not enough thought about rail-users and too much commercial focus, that the project was ridiculously big just to enable a private firm to make money. But suddenly this month, Paris city hall under Socialist mayor Anne Hidalgo, toughened its stance, arguing the “needless” shopping complex should be scrapped and instead the state should fund a much smaller and simple refit. The government and the state railway insists the full project must go ahead if France’s image is to be upheld for the Olympics.Politicians on the left have warned that the French business model of building vast flagship shopping centres is in decline. Several giant shopping complexes are currently struggling, including one in Aubervilliers on the northern edge of Paris and another near Charles de Gaulle airport. Plans to build a giant shopping and leisure complex north east of Paris called EuropaCity have sparked a huge political row, with business unions warning it will kill small shops in nearby towns. Just one stop away by the RER train from the Gare du Nord, the Forum des Halles at Châtelet is already home to a gargantuan shopping centre which was recently recently rebranded as a Westfield. Restaurants and bars dominate the streets around the Gare du Nord, doing a good trade, and many fear that the new station plans will hurt the neighbourhood economy.The row is so fraught because the Gare du Nord has always had a symbolic place in the social make-up of Paris and the region that surrounds it. It is the gateway to the banlieue and the packed local trains bring professionals to Paris as well as a large proportion of the city’s low-income workers doing crucial service jobs.“I just want to get straight to work and straight home at night and have a seat on the train,” said Maria 52, who lives on an estate north east of Paris and takes crowded trains to several different cleaning jobs each week.In 2001, during the last major renovations, a much-praised glass shed brought some light down into the dingy levels below ground. The architect, Jean-Marie Duthilleul, said: “Instead of looking at their feet, now people can raise their eyes.” But the station is still under pressure to rid itself of the sense it is some kind of border between the rich bustle of Paris and a young population discriminated against and pushed to the outskirts. In 2007, hundreds of youths fought running battles with riot police throwing tear gas inside the station after a man was stopped for fare evasion. The station now has the biggest police presence of any transport hub in France.Alexandra Cordebard, the Socialist mayor of the 10th arrondissement, which is home to the Gare du Nord, lives in an apartment between the Gare du Nord and the nearby, smaller, Gare de L’Est. “Historically, this was the heart of working class Paris, with factory workers and tradespeople with the only remaining large working factory in Paris, the Clairefontaine paper factory,” she said.She said the compact 10th arrondissement, with 100,000 people living in less than three square km of densely packed streets with no public parks, sees its population swell to 1 million people each day as passengers arrive at the two main stations. The patchwork of local apartments and small studios has a broad cultural mix, including students and artists as well as richer residents who have made money on larger properties.Three years ago, France’s first supervised injection facility for drug users opened on a street adjoining the Gare du Nord to allow addicts to inject with clean syringes and under supervision in order to curb overdose deaths and transmission of diseases spread by needle-sharing. Cordebard stressed its opening hours are soon to be extended. The station area has also become a focal point for homelessness. Residents groups insist there must be a post office in the new station as many local services near the station, including the old post office, have closed. Massive traffic jams in front of the station, with motorbikes parked up across pavements, mean it is often a challenge to even cross the road.Cordebard’s key concern is how the area will remain liveable with the climate crisis and rising temperatures. The station and the nearby hospital emit heat amid vast road traffic pollution, and virtually no green space to counter it.“If you look at the thermal map of Paris, the area around the Gare du Nord is the hottest part of the whole city,” she said. “It’s one of the hardest parts of Paris to cool down – we have to limit motorised vehicles and we have to find ways to plant trees.”She added: “For the Gare du Nord to suddenly have this huge extra shopping centre built on top, bringing dozens and dozens of extra lorries a day, bringing extra rubbish each day in a place which can already barely absorb its own daily traffic and activity, I think that’s a problem. It adds to the carbon count, energy consumption and rubbish when we’re already saturated here. Shouldn’t public powers contribute more and build something smaller and better?”In his office at city hall, Paris’s head of urban planning, Jean-Louis Missika said: “A station is about creating a sense of airiness and emptiness, allowing passengers to calmly connect to this monumental public space, it is not about stuffing it full of obstacles for them.” He wanted a return to “the feeling that stations were the big industrial cathedrals of the 19th century” – with the addition, above all, of more space for bikes and connections to public transport.At the Eurostar terminal, Florent, 24, a politics student on his way to visit his sister in London, looked out over bustle. “There’s too much privatisation of public space everywhere else already, stations should be for the passengers,” he said. “But I prefer St Pancras, it seems to have more of a link to history.”And yet the Gare du Nord is dripping in history. The 1864 building, with its striking facade by the German-born architect Jacques-Ignace Hittorff, was built to expand on a smaller earlier station, and was described in the 1920s by the influential architectural historian Henry-Russell Hitchcock one of the great masterpieces of 19th century architecture.It was built at a time when Napoleon III and his urban planner Georges-Eugène Haussmann were driving grand boulevards through the city’s slums and creating vast prestige projects. Hittorff, who would also be involved with planning the Champs Elysées and placing the Egyptian obelisk in Place de La Concorde, was praised for the technical skill of the Gare du Nord’s vast train-shed roof. His project was so ambitious that its giant metal pillars exceeded French capacity and had to be ordered in from Glasgow. The statues of women representing major and international city destinations on the station’s façade were created by leading artists of the time.“Hittorff is extremely interesting for his level of culture,” said the Paris-based architectural historian Karen Bowie, who signed the recent open letter against the latest renovation plans. “As well as an architect, he was an important archeologist, held to have made the discovery that ancient Greek temples were painted in colour. So there is very careful thought to how he used Greek-inspired ornamentation in the station.”Recent work by scholars in Cologne suggested Hittorff had planned to make more use of colour in the Gare du Nord, Bowie said, in order to “use reflected light to enhance travellers’ experience of the space”.She said it would be “a shame” to put up a series of heavy new walkways that would cut through Hittorff’s vast station space and mask the ornate back elevation. She was concerned that, unlike the current mezzanine for Eurostar passengers – designed to be temporary – the new additions could be hard to reverse.Jean-Baptiste Djebbari, the junior transport minister in Emmanuel Macron’s centrist government, insisted that the project was “necessary for the hundreds of thousands of locals and tourists who use the station daily.” He warned that Socialists at city hall were playing politics in the run-up to local elections next March.Claude Solard, of the SNCF railway company, wrote an open letter to detractors in Le Monde saying that the project would see the forecourt pedestrianised, with vast green planting on the roof, and would aim for a zero-waste policy. He said the funding model of private backers meant ticket prices would not go up.Michel Babut of the train-users association FNAUT, said that although there were some positives, such as the Eurostar area of the station being moved to the side and renovated, “this project will spend colossal sums but not improve travellers’ journeys and their experience of the station.”On the station concourse, Patrica, in her 60s, who used to work in a notary’s office in Etaples on the northern French coast, had been travelling regularly to the Gare du Nord for 40 years. “I love the station building, although it does need more toilets,” she said. “But I don’t think it needs more shops. People are so rushed these days, they just want peace and quiet.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4f0450b4cfd7dada3fa993fa211e804950f709e5/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a876a6493610937bdc5f8a5899df795f","title":"do you work for a fossil fuel company share your experiences","story":"If you work for a fossil fuel firm, we’d like to hear from you.

A century on, scientists have recreated his images to show the impact of global heating on the mountain’s glaciers.Dr Kieran Baxter and Dr Alice Watterson from the University of Dundee used a process called monoplotting to work out the precise locations from which Mittelholzer had taken his photographs. They returned to the spot in a helicopter and lined up their cameras using the alpine peaks as their guide. The scientists captured images of three glaciers that Mittelholzer had also photographed: the Bossons glacier, the Argentière glacier and the Mer de Glace, all on the northern side of the Mont Blanc massif.The resulting photographs show just how much ice has been lost from the region over the past century.Baxter said: “The scale of the ice loss was immediately evident as we reached altitude but it was only by comparing the images side-by-side that the last 100 years of change were made visible.“It was both a breathtaking and heartbreaking experience, particularly knowing that the melt has accelerated massively in the last few decades.”The Mer de Glace, the longest glacier in France, is the site of the biggest changes over past decades. In the 1800s, travel writers described how it could be seen from the resort town of Chamonix, but it has since receded more than 2km up the mountain’s slopes.The Mer de Glace “is now melting at the rate of around 40 metres a year and has lost 80 metres in depth over the last 20 years alone,” the glaciologist Luc Moreau told the  last year.Mittelholzer, who trained as a military pilot during the first world war, later became the director of a commercial aviation company that later became the Swiss national carrier, Swissair. He died in a climbing accident in 1937.Baxter said: “Mittelholzer played a key role in popularising commercial air travel in Switzerland, an industry which ironically came to contribute to the warming of the climate – and the detriment of the alpine landscapes.”The Dundee scientists said they were careful to keep their own impact on the environment to a minimum.“When working at these heights there is currently no viable emission-free alternative so airtime is kept as brief as possible and careful planning goes into getting the most out of a photography flight like this one,” said Baxter.“Luckily, clear weather allowed these repeat aerial photographs to be taken on the centenary year of the originals. Unless we drastically reduce our dependence on fossil fuels, there will be little ice left to photograph in another hundred years.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ed8732cd2b53f0429de6f8cbcf98a75dae36f6bb/0_371_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9b927d51194d48d34f28d4b7c47a88e8","title":"vested interests public against climate science fossil fuel lobby","story":"For decades fossil fuel majors tried to fight the consensus – just as big tobacco once disputed that smoking killsIn 1998 a public relations consultant called Joe Walker wrote to the American Petroleum Institute (API), a trade association representing major fossil fuel companies, with a proposed solution to a big problem.In December the previous year, the UN had adopted the Kyoto protocol, an international treaty that committed signatory countries to reducing their greenhouse gas emissions in order to avert catastrophic climate breakdown.Reducing emissions represented a direct threat to the profits of fossil fuel companies and the API was working on an industry response. has collaborated with leading scientists and NGOs to expose, with exclusive data, investigations and analysis, the fossil fuel companies that are perpetuating the climate crisis – some of which have accelerated their extraction of coal, oil and gas even as the devastating impact on the planet and humanity was becoming clear.The investigation has involved more than 20  journalists working across the world for the past six months.The project focuses on what the companies have extracted from the ground, and the subsequent emissions they are responsible for, since 1965. The analysis, undertaken by Richard Heede at the Climate Accountability Institute,\u0026nbspcalculates how much carbon is emitted throughout the supply chain, from extraction to use by consumers. Heede said: The fact that consumers combust the fuels to carbon dioxide, water, heat and pollutants does not absolve the fossil fuel companies from responsibility for knowingly perpetuating the carbon era and accelerating the climate crisis toward the existential threat it has now become.One aim of the project is to move the focus of debate from inidual responsibilities to power structures – so our reporters also examined the financial and lobbying structures that let fossil fuel firms keep growing, and discovered which elected politicians were voting for change.\u0026nbspAnother aim of the project is to press governments and corporations to close the gap between ambitious long-term promises and lacklustre short-term action. The UN says the coming decade is crucial if the world is to avoid the most catastrophic consequences of global heating. Reining in our dependence on fossil fuels and dramatically accelerating the transition to renewable energy has never been more urgent.Walker outlined a vision of a comprehensive, international campaign to change public opinion on the climate crisis by casting doubt on the scientific research, presenting it as unreliable when the overwhelming majority of scientists had reached consensus.The communications plan involved finding sympathetic scientists, identifying thinktanks to fund that would produce helpful reports, and working through supposed grassroots groups to hold debates questioning the consensus on global heating, along with a constant flow of media briefings manufacturing uncertainty.The plan sounded much like a 1960s PR campaign devised by the tobacco industry to delay controls by questioning the science showing that smoking killed. Some of the people involved were in fact tobacco campaign veterans.The fossil fuel industry had been making use of its lobbying group, the Global Climate Coalition, since 1989 to stress the uncertainties of climate science. But by the late 1990s companies such as BP and Shell were beginning to withdraw from it as public doubt about the problem became increasingly untenable in the face of the evidence.“Project goal: a majority of the American public, including industry leadership, recognises that significant uncertainties exist in climate science,” the 1998 Walker API memo began. A series of strategic goals was elaborated. It said “victory will be achieved when … recognition of uncertainties becomes part of the conventional wisdom” and “those promoting the Kyoto treaty on the basis of extant science appear to be out of touch with reality”.After the memo was leaked to the New York Times, the industry said the plan was only a proposal and was never put into effect.Climate campaigners such as Greenpeace say they believe a highly organised effort by the fossil fuel industry to question climate science, involving scientists and some thinktanks in receipt of fossil fuel industry funding, nevertheless succeeded in the following years in shifting public opinion away from urgent action.In 2010 the American sociologists Riley Dunlap and Aaron McCright identified conservative thinktanks, along with US conservative politicians, media and fossil fuel corporations, as crucial components in a “denial machine” that emerged in the 1990s.The activity of this machine would peak when the industry’s financial interests came under threat, most notably in the years after 2007 and the election of Barack Obama, who had pledged to regulate and cap emissions.Thinktanks, trade associations and front groups were a key part of the effort, he concluded, with their major funders including foundations affiliated to the fossil fuel magnates the Koch brothers, ExxonMobil, and the ultra-conservative Scaife and Bradley foundations.Brulle also found evidence of a trend to conceal the sources of funding once campaign groups such as the Union of Concerned Scientists, Greenpeace and the Climate Disinformation Database started tracking what they called dark money to climate denial from the mid-2000s.In the second half of that decade, Koch, Scaife, Bradley and ExxonMobil foundation funding to organisations involved in propagating doubt declined while donations to the same organisations via two anonymised vehicles, the Donors Trust and Donors Capital Fund, increased rapidly.Among the thinktanks most identified with spreading doubt are the Competitive Enterprise Institute, the Marshall Institute (which folded in 2015), the Cato Institute, the Heartland Institute, the Heritage Foundation and the campaign group Americans for Prosperity.Elsewhere the Institute of Economic Affairs and the Global Warming Policy Foundation have been prominent publishers of material questioning the consensus on climate science in the UK. These organisations fiercely dispute that any of their work constitutes organised climate change denial.Americans for Prosperity, which has received a very substantial part of its funding from the Kochs, helped make resistance to action on climate a feature of Tea Party rallies in the US.The counter-movement against action wound up to fever pitch in 2009 when it looked as though Obama and the US would sign up to UN climate protocols after the Copenhagen summit due at the end of that year.Before the summit, inidual independent climate experts found themselves subject to devastating attacks. Scientists at the University of East Anglia’s prestigious Climate Research Unit had their emails hacked. The contents of the emails were circulated, with the information they contained having been extracted in a way that suggested the scientists had manipulated their data. A police investigation failed to establish who the hackers were.The rightwing media labelled it “climategate” and several thinktanks promoted the story enthusiastically. Multiple inquiries would later exonerate the scientists but by then the damage was done the public’s faith in climate science had been measurably dented.Half a decade later some fossil fuel industry funding of climate contrarian science was exposed, when Greenpeace found out via freedom of information requests that a prominent academic at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, Willie Soon, had attracted more than $1.2m in payments over 14 years from ExxonMobil, Southern Company, the API and a Koch foundation, to the centre for his work. Soon doubted the scientific consensus that emissions were the principal cause of global heating.He is now an affiliate of the Heartland Institute. Soon strenuously denied that his industry funders had any influence over his conclusions and the Heartland Institute said he was not even aware of who some of the donors to the centre were, making a conflict of interest impossible.There has been a noticeable moderation of views from those previously involved in questioning the science of climate change. Several now acknowledge global heating is caused by human activity but have shifted focus to arguing that the market and technological innovation rather than government action or international treaties curbing emissions are the best ways to tackle it.The director of the Competitive Enterprise Institute’s (CEI) Center for Energy and Environment, Myron Ebell, for example, told the : “CEI believes strongly that the policies being proposed by climate alarmists to deal with global warming pose much greater threats to human flourishing than do the effects of global warming. Abundant, affordable energy is a necessary condition of human wellbeing but the global energy-rationing policies being pursued, like those in the Paris climate treaty, threaten to consign billions of people around the world to energy poverty and perpetual economic stagnation.”ExxonMobil, Chevron, Southern Company and the API all said they recognised the seriousness of the climate crisis and the need for business, governments and consumers to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The API said the industry as a whole had invested billions of dollars in zero- and low-carbon technologies. Chevron and Southern Company said they had ambitious targets to reduce their carbon footprints. ExxonMobil said its position on climate science in the past had been misrepresented, and that claims regarding what it knew and when had been debunked. None of the companies responded to questions on the communications plan and funding of organisations whose output included doubting the science.The Koch, Scaife and Bradley Foundations Donors Trust, Donors Capital Fund and Americans for Prosperity did not respond to requests for comment.The thinktanks said the criticisms levelled at them by climate activists and critics seriously mischaracterised their positions. They said the views they published were those of inidual affiliates rather than institutional ones. They added that they respected their donors’ privacy but the source of their money did not influence their research or output, which was completely independent. The Heritage Foundation said allegations it had denied climate science were “seriously inaccurate”. It accepted “the climate is changing, the planet is warming and that humans are playing a role”. Instead it described itself as “sceptics of climate catastrophism and costly policies that will drive energy prices higher”.The Cato Institute said it had never been in the business of “promoting climate science denial” it did not dispute human activity’s impact on the climate, but believed it was minimal."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/95df08c8ca920322b27c1614e9e7373835dadf16/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=980\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=03ed8f3877bee713892a346ac0434c40 1960w","title":"flour power meet the bread heads baking a better loaf","story":"Mechanised food factories demand ingredients that are standard, stable and easy to transport, and make products that are standard, stable and easy to transport. New wheats have been bred (and, in the US, genetically modified) for high yields and high protein content that require inputs of chemical fertilisers and pesticides. To increase efficiency, hedgerows and copses have been eliminated and farmland agglomerated into increasingly larger tracts of monoculture.From soil to plastic-packaged loaf, industrialised breads are the end product of 100 years of innovation in agriculture, manufacturing and transport, all of which prioritises efficiency and cost over nutrition and taste. Bread is the most-bought food item in the UK, but the supermarket loaf is just part of a basket of highly processed foods that we are now beginning to understand is making us fat, sick and allergic.While the big bakeries may market brown loaves under homely monikers such as farmhouse, wholegrain and multiseed, these are often distinctions without much meaning. The basic ingredient of highly processed flour is the same, even if bran or other sources of fibre are added back into the mix. More research is needed, but there is increasing evidence to suggest that gluten intolerance (not to be confused with coeliac disease, which means people cannot process gluten at all) could be caused by the extra gluten that is often added to mass-produced wholewheat products, and that the old-fashioned longer proving time – the resting time that allows yeasts to ferment the dough and make it rise – is a key factor in rendering wholegrains more digestible.Good bread needs no more than four ingredients: flour, yeast, water and salt. Wheats were once regional and adapted to the land grain was milled locally and often baked as wholegrain flour into dense loaves. In Britain and the US, most of us have not eaten this kind of bread in so many generations there is no longer even a folk memory of what it tasted like. The desire for lighter and whiter bread is steeped in history: finer, paler, sifted flour was more expensive and the province of the rich, and as such has been a enduring trend, even as flour became a bland and cheap commodity, often bleached to make it even whiter.But in the past couple of decades, new movements have begun to challenge the prevailing food culture. In the early 2000s, activist and journalist Michael Pollan wrote about how what we eat had lost its link with the land and the farmer. Leading the revolt against processed food, in 2010, Pollan came up with the line that became a catchphrase: “Don’t eat anything your great-grandmother wouldn’t recognise as food.” Dan Barber, a chef on a mission to bring back the links between sustainable farming and taste and nutrition, delivered a Ted Talk in 2008 in which he described modern industrial agriculture as “an insult to the basic laws of nature”. He and others have popularised the farm-to-table movement that is changing people’s eating habits, encouraging farmers to grow varieties for deliciousness over yield, efficiency of transport and shelf life.In 2011, the geneticist Steve Jones founded the Bread Lab in Oregon, bringing farmers, millers, brewers and bakers together to develop new grains that emphasised taste. In 2014, Jones suggested the supermarket loaf should be called “American” or “processed bread”, to distinguish its mass-produced identity and nutritional characteristics. He told me he does not like to be in the same room as white flour. Meanwhile, a sourdough movement bubbled up in San Francisco, championing the resurgence of the traditional method of leavening bread using natural starters that harness a complex web of ambient bacteria and fungi, rather than strong modern yeasts bred to inject air into almost anything.The great food writer Julia Child once said British white bread tasted “like Kleenex”. Maybe that is why we load our white sliced toast with so much jam and chocolate spread and peanut butter. Wholegrain, sourdough bread is a very different beast crunchy, crusty, chewy, with a complex taste that is rich, nutty and tangy. Quite often, I find a couple of thick slices, spread with a generous swathe of butter, a satisfying lunch.The revival of ancient varieties of wheat is inspiring a new movement of agronomists, farmers, millers and bakers in the UK. They are coming together to develop and grow new kinds of wheat that do not need dousing with chemicals, to mill the grain in such a way as to keep taste and nutrition intact, and to bake loaves that are delicious and healthy. In the process, these artisans want to challenge the dominance of chemical agriculture and the supermarket loaf, to establish a new kind of supply chain that links our diet to nature and creates healthy communities.Bread is a basic foodstuff. It is our land and our kitchen table, family tradition and religious celebration. Our daily bread is our daily life it is economics – breadwinner, breadbaskets, breadlines it is politics – upper crust, bread and circuses, grist for the mill. As this group of growers, millers and bakers are demonstrating, bread can be revolution, too.In the 1960s, while we were falling for the abundance of postwar produce and the convenience of the supermarket, one British plant pathologist was battling with mould. As a young researcher in East Anglia, Martin Wolfe specialised in barley mildew. At the time, the prevailing view was that science could improve on nature’s design agronomy focused on breeding grains that would produce the highest yields, and developing fertilisers and pesticides to encourage and protect them.Wolfe began to see that as soon as a new variety of barley was introduced, pathogens adapted to find a way to attack it as soon as a new fungicide was formulated, the pathogen reacted by developing resistance to it. He realised that nature was always going to win the race.He was single-minded, driven, almost obsessive his family complained that he was difficult to call away from his desk for dinner. He understood earlier than most that adding more chemicals was not a sustainable answer, and looked for different ways to grow healthy crops. He experimented with breeding varieties carrying different resistance genes. When he planted out his new varieties and mixtures, he found that infection levels fell.In the 70s, Wolfe worked with East German scientists who wanted to reduce their use of expensive foreign pesticides. By the end of the 80s, almost all their spring barley (an important crop, because the East exported malted barley to the West German brewing industry for hard currency) was being grown according to Wolfe’s techniques. But when the Berlin Wall came down, they were encouraged, like other farmers in western Europe, via subsidies and promises of high yields, to use chemical fertilisers.“I’ve always felt like a bit of an outsider,” Wolfe admitted in an interview. He was a scientist, and at first sceptical of the organic movement that emerged in the 80s, which he felt was turning back the clock. His priority was breeding new crops to tackle the environmental challenges of the future. Over the decades, Wolfe became convinced that ersity – the very thing that modern agriculture was eliminating with its herbicides and monoculture – was the key to resistance. When a pathogen attacked a genetically homogenous crop, it could wipe out a whole field.As he approached retirement, Wolfe wanted to put some of the new ideas about mixed farming practices into use. Agroforestry had begun to gain ground in the 70s when Phil Rutter, an American plant breeder, asked a big question: if nature’s dominant agriculture was trees – perennials – why had man spent 10,000 years developing annual crops? Rutter was convinced that trees such as hazel and chestnut could provide as much nutrition as cereals without having to be resown every year. His motto was: “The future of the world is nuts.”In 1994, Wolfe bought two meadows and a low-ceilinged long house in Suffolk called Wakelyns, which had a been a pig farm, then a dog-breeding site. Wolfe drew up elaborate plans for avenues of hazel, willow and a mixture of fruit, nut and timber trees. In the lanes in between the trees, he would grow annual crops: vegetables, cereals, legumes. Wakelyns was always imagined as an experimental agroforestry farm, “a rather expensive personal hobby”, as his son, David, put it, not a going concern. It soon became a centre for real research.At first, the saplings, planted in mud with protective plastic rabbit-proof sleeves, looked thin, vulnerable and unimpressive. Visiting farmers shook their heads, wondering why land was being wasted by planting trees on it. “No experiment ever fails,” Wolfe liked to say. As the trees grew and projects proceeded, visitors were drawn to Wakelyns to see for themselves one of the best examples of agroforestry in Europe. Wolfe walked them through his lanes of crops, his white hair glowing like a nimbus, backlit by the sun, explaining the how the trees, with their long roots, were able to draw nutrients from deep in the soil, which the annual crops also benefited from, via fungal networks in the soil. “There is an idea that crops suffer from competition with trees,” he told one interviewer, “but it is not true – they are sheltered and protected by trees.”In 2000, Wolfe created a very special crop. With the help of plant breeders and the scientists from the Organic Research Centre, Wolfe took 20 varieties of wheat that had been doing well under low-input conditions in the UK, half chosen for their quality – their high protein and gluten contents – half for their high yield, and cross-bred them every which way, resulting in 190 new crosses. Normally, a breeder would look at these plants and select for the traits they wanted. But this time seeds from all 190 were thrown together in a field, grown, harvested and reseeded together for several years. Wolfe called it YQ, for “yield” and “quality”.Whereas selection ordinarily narrowed the genetic pool, as with inbreeding dogs, this method maintained it. The genetic ersity in this crop meant the wheat was not only resistant to pathogens, but also tolerant of varying growing conditions. The yield of YQ was never going to match that of high-yield wheat in a good year, but over time, Wolfe showed, its yields through wet or dry or pestilential years, when whole fields of homogenous wheat could be wiped out, were compellingly consistent.Wolfe milled his YQ grain into flour in a small electric stone mill in his barn. His wife, Ann, made cakes and pastry with it, and everyone loved its rich, nutty taste. But Wolfe had not yet found a baker who would turn it into bread.Last February, I drove north to meet one of the foremost of a new generation of British artisanal bakers – Kim Bell, who started The Small Food Bakery in Nottingham five years ago and, in 2018, won a prestigious BBC Food and Farming award. I found Bell cleaning up at the end of the day. Hale, with floury hands, and her hair tied up in a cloth bandana, she gave me a bottle of house-made rhubarb kefir as she finished vacuuming the ovens. She is a proper baker – a mix of passion and exhaustion. When she finally sat down, I said: “One day you’ll have someone else to do the washing up!” Bell shook her head. “We don’t have anyone who comes in to do menial work. We all do it ourselves.” This, she explained, was deliberate, part of a policy to encourage autonomy and responsibility. She wanted each baker to be mindful of resources: energy, time and hot water.I ate one of her cinnamon buns: sticky, soft and crunchy all at once sweet from the chestnut honey and sour from the tang of the naturally fermented dough. Every mouthful was differently delicious.Bell had gone to art school but didn’t want to be an artist. For many years, she worked with her father in a contracting business, specialising in installing coffee shops and minimarkets in petrol stations. They were successful, but she found the world of mass-market retail depressing and wasteful. Bell is the kind of person who always has a dozen projects on the go and a large cast of collaborators. She was often cooking on the side, filling in at a friend’s pub, catering a wedding or baking for the Women’s Institute market. At one point, she got involved with helping a friend open a cafe.She also started reading Michael Pollan and Dan Barber, and discovered the US food movement linking sustainable agriculture and deliciousness. She went to listen to a talk by Andrew Whitley, the godfather of the British sourdough movement, who had opened the first organic bakery in the UK – the Village Bakery in Melmerby in Cumbria – in 1976. “Andrew was selling the idea of a bread revolution where we use wild yeasts and we know where our grain comes from.”Bell is a very good baker she is also a political baker. Learning about soil depletion and disease and social justice, she was appalled, and then galvanised. “It just all came together for me: there is a problem in our food system and we need to fix it.”Thoughts converged, and events conspired: a small kitchen-cafe came up for hire in an artists’ co-op in Nottingham, and in 2014, Bell found herself with a space and an oven. Opening a bakery seemed an obvious way to challenge all that she felt was wrong with the industrial food system, a sourdough gauntlet to throw down in opposition to the supermarket loaf in its plastic sleeve.“I flung my doors open one day with absolutely no fanfare,” Bell remembered. “I didn’t announce it. There was no sign. I had one customer the whole day. And she was gluten intolerant.” Bell had no formal baking training she did what most new artisan bakers do: she tried to copy the Tartine Bakery in San Francisco, with its much-lauded and Instagram-famous crumb (bread’s interior texture) full of big holes, and its sharply crunchy crusts.“You think flour is a stable ingredient,” Bell explained to me as she opened a few bags of different flours for me to feel and taste. “But if it’s done right, it’s living and alive.” I held some flour in my palm and saw how it clumped a little when I compressed it – the measure of its moisture. The flour I had unthinkingly always used is really only an inert powder of indefinable shelf life, whereas this kind of whole grain, containing the oils of the germ, lasts a few months before it can go rancid. Bell is one of the vanguard of bakers in the UK trying to make better flour and tastier, more satisfying loaves. Part of the taste comes from using different grains – the ancient progenitors of modern wheats, like spelt, einkorn and emmer, or cereals such as rye, buckwheat, barley and oats – and part from the lactic tang of the “starter”, the natural leavening ferment made from a flour-and-water paste and ambient yeasts.When Bell first started the bakery she used organic flour from Shipton Mill, a British miller that provides high-quality blends of flour. But she wanted to understand more about the products she was using, where they came from, how they were grown she wanted, as part of the mission and identity of the bakery, to source ingredients locally. She soon found someone who was milling organic flour in a windmill only 40 miles away.After working for years in the corporate world, Paul Wyman and his wife, Fari, bought the refurbished windmill at Tuxford 14 years ago, pretty much on a whim. The learning curve was steep. Wyman had to figure out the hard way the difference between “milling wheat” and “feed wheat” fit for animals (it has a different protein content a lot of bakers are used to working with higher protein contents because it creates a more open, structured crumb), and there were plenty of mechanical problems and sudden wind gusts, but, he admitted, “slowly, I became a pretty good miller”.His wife presides in the tea room, selling cakes and scones made with flour he has milled, to showcase how different the taste can be. (I bought two bags of his Tuxford Gold and made everything from pasta to pastry with them the difference in quality was clear – it was richer, more complicated, more interesting.)There is something quite extraordinary about the sheer physicality of a working windmill. The big canvas sails turned as gracefully and powerful as a tall masted ship. Inside the shafts and chains and pulleys and wooden toothed gears clanked and thumped as the iron spindle revolved, running through the centre of the two heavy grinding stones. People have been grinding grain into flour in this way for thousands of years.Jones convenes an annual symposium, the Grain Gathering in Oregon, which brings together bakers, breeders and millers from all over the world. Jones is a global leader developing new wheats and other cereals tailored to the varied needs of bakers, brewers, farmers and consumers. Recently, the Bread Lab launched a new sliced loaf developed to appeal to consumers brought up on soft and sweet American bread.Kim Bell met Jones several times at the Grain Gathering. For the past two years, she has organised a UK version, the Grain Lab, a two-day event bringing together 150 farmers, millers and bakers from 14 countries to discuss issues of marketing, transport and cost.A supermarket loaf might cost about £1, a loaf from an artisanal bakery three or four times that. Inevitably, the price of sourdough has given it an elite, middle-class foodie tag. Supermarket bread sells at wafer-thin margins, and big bakeries operate on giant economies of scale small bakeries have to contend with high rents and labour costs, expensive organic ingredients and a time-intensive process. Bakers defend the value of their loaves, their high satiety (one thick slice fills you up quite happily) and lower waste: supermarket bread is so undervalued that almost half of it is thrown away. Increasingly, we are beginning to understand the real costs of an industrialised food supply, not borne by the agro-food industry, but by the taxpayer. A study for the Sustainable Food Trust in 2017 suggested that when you have factored in the health costs of obesity and diabetes, environmental clean-up and subsidies, the real cost of our food is double what we pay for it in a shop.Bell and others are trying to put together local networks of supply, to create a new kind of grain economy inevitably, their efforts come up against the problem of how we value benefits that we can feel, rather than count. Bell told me that the connections she makes are often personal and unexpectedly moving (for example, when farmers taste bread baked with grain they have grown for the first time). For Bell, the quality of her relationships is as important as the quality of the ingredients.One day, more than three years ago, Josiah Meldrum, an organic farming activist, walked into Kim Bell’s bakery with a bag of YQ flour. Meldrum, co-founder of Hodmedod’s, a Norfolk company selling and championing British legumes, was a close friend of Martin Wolfe and keen to help him get bakers interested in YQ. He told Bell the story of YQ and asked her if she would try baking with it, explaining apologetically that YQ had a relatively low protein content. Most bakers would have been put off, but Bell smelled its toasty nuttiness and was intrigued.Her first efforts produced tough, dense loaves, or the dough became a puddle of unshapeable slop. Bell tried varying the proportions of starter, upped hydration levels, reduced the temperature, mixed it vigorously instead of gently. “It was just trial and error really.” She wanted to bring out the flavour of the wheat. Finally, she was satisfied and had a domed loaf with a dark umber crust and a russet interior of soft, pillowy crumb that she could take to show Wolfe at Wakelyns.Bell was nervous: “He’s a bit famous.” But they ended up spending all day talking. “He was delighted, because he had been working on this project for 20 years and scientists were fascinated by it, but he couldn’t seem to get a baker to bake with it.” Bell and Wolfe recognised in each other the other half of an equation. For Bell, the YQ wheat represented “everything we had been thinking about in the bakery, ersification and decentralisation, resonated back down to the seed.”Since the early 20th century, seeds that are sold commercially have had to be legally registered according to variety. In this way, buyers are protected and breeders can receive royalties on plants they have spent time and money developing. Accordingly, seeds and plant varieties must conform to certain criteria for uniformity and stability. But YQ is genetically thousands of different varieties of wheat, known as a “population”. As such, it could not be legally registered, or traded, in Europe.When Bell fell in love with YQ and its story, Wolfe had been growing it for almost 15 years. In the US, they were continuing to develop populations, as were a few agronomists in France, Germany and Italy. But generally, these were a new, untested type of crop. Between 2007 and 2013, YQ went on a tour around Europe, to see how it would grow in different climates. The results showed that even in varying weather conditions and soils the overall yield of YQ was remarkably stable.In the meantime, Wolfe went back and forth between Brussels and Westminster to lobby for an exception to the EU regulations that would allow YQ to be sold. Finally, in 2014, he was successful, and in July 2017 YQ seed, officially called the ORC Wakelyns Population, was the first population wheat to go on sale in Europe.Bell wanted to use YQ flour at the Small Food Bakery, but she needed to find a farmer to grow it. She asked Paul Wyman at Tuxford Mill if he had any ideas. Wyman sourced a lot of his organic wheat from John and Guy Turner, who had a family farm in Lincolnshire, 40 minutes down the A1. He suggested giving them a call.The Turner brothers at Grange Farm are fourth-generation farmers with 100 hectares (250 acres). Over the decades, they had watched other small farmers around them struggle and sell up. So, in 2001, they decided to go organic. “Basically, we’ve been holding on by our fingertips for the last 30 years,” John Turner told me. They had begun to send their wheat to Paul Wyman when they were looking for a way to sell a few tonnes of extra grain. When Bell asked if they would be interested in planting YQ the brothers said: “OK. Why not?”“Over the winter, we weren’t too sure about it at all,” Guy told me. “It was quite a spindly, thin crop. But then in the spring, when the weather warmed up, it just absolutely took off. You could almost sit at the edge of the field and watch it grow.”Bell continued to champion YQ to other bakers and gave baking demonstrations with it at her Grain Lab. Ben Mackinnon at E5 Bakery in London Fields, which mills its own flour at its premises under a railway arch, grew up on a farm near Wakelyns, knew Wolfe (he once spent a month digging up potatoes for him) and said he would take four tonnes. Turner was delighted. The only problem was how to get the grain to London. Turner suggested he take a load on a trailer hooked up to his 4X4. He soon got lost in the narrow streets. “I felt like a real hick from the sticks,” he said, laughing. I said he was doing something that probably hadn’t been done in 150 years: a farmer transporting his own grain into central London to be milled.When I visited E5 in April, they had almost run out of the Turner’s YQ and had begun to source it from another farmer in Essex. Word had gone around, artisanal bakers were excited by the YQ story and its flavour almost the whole 2018 crop had sold out.Martin Wolfe died after a short illness in March. We had been in touch and he had invited me to come to see his farm. Two weeks after his death, his son David and Josiah Meldrum kindly met me at Wakelyns. It was a brittle spring day, bright spots of sun in a cold wind.They showed me Martin’s office – a mess of papers, slides of mildewed barley leaves, a nest of wires on the floor, chainsaw parts. In the sheds and barns, there were tractors and combine harvesters and all sorts of Heath Robinson-esque machinery he had modified for his experiments. “There’s not much you can’t do with a Ribena bottle,” David laughed, pointing to plastic bottle taped to a stick. “Everything tied up with baler twine,” Meldrum added. “Martin would never let a good idea be stymied by not having the right equipment.”And here were the avenues of trees, and between them alleys of clover and blades of green YQ. The trees were splotched with green and white and pink blossom, 40 kinds of apple, multiples of pear, plum. There were the prints of muntjac deer and hares in the mud and thrushes warbling in the hazel.We walked through a hedge and came out on to a lane as a blast of raw wind, unchecked by trees, blew into our faces. Before us was a 40-hectare expanse of wheat on the neighbouring farm, as evenly green as a billiard table. The contrast between the variegated beauty of Wakelyns agroforestry and this conventionally farmed field could not have been more stark.We are only beginning to understand the importance of ersity and the complex systems that plants – and animals, and us – need to thrive. In an interview, Martin Wolfe once argued that value should be accounted not just according to the cash received for a crop, but to the effect of the plants on the soil and carbon sequestration, and wider effects “on mood, on beauty, on community”. The story of YQ spins a narrative from soil health to grain resistance to nutritious flour to tasty bread, and it also describes a group of people working together to create a local food network that nourishes a community.“Martin was always full of crazy ideas,” said his son. We walked to the end of a grassy meadow. His wife Ann’s grave was marked with a simple stone among stands of daffodils. In April, Martin was buried next to her.As a result of his lobbying, YQ wheat will receive legal status to be traded from the EU in 2021. Before he died, Bell told me: “I’m buoyed by Martin. Last year he said to me: ‘Kim, it’s happening, I’m seeing it for the first time in my life. It’s going to come. Things are changing.’”• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f25c15131251df2a3a7ab9007bf13109c04898a4/0_101_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9c06794d0b4c601f0e573bd4b7c83db5","title":"the gospel of mushrooms how foraging became hip","story":"Searching for fungi has long had an old-world mystique. But for generations coming of age during the climate crisis, the powerful organisms are more important than everCassandra Posey was a 25-year-old fashion branding consultant living in the Lower East Side of Manhattan when, in the spring of 2018, she and a girlfriend got into a near-stranger’s car bound for Baltimore. The driver was a friend-of-a-friend named William Padilla-Brown, a dreadlocked permaculturist who sold mushrooms and their cultures from his home in Asheville, North Carolina.He and Posey had recently begun exchanging messages on Instagram, where they bonded over a shared interest in plant-based medicines. When Padilla-Brown offered to drive Posey to a workshop he was giving on spirulina cultivation, she lied that her friend was going through a difficult breakup and would need to tag along, just in case the ride should warrant a wingwoman.“We hopped in the car,” Posey recalls, “and I’ll never forget, he was playing some creepy house music and I was like, ‘Oh, it’s going to be one of those rides’, you know?”But almost immediately, they became a couple about as quickly, Posey started a mushroom business of her own. Within a year, joined by Padilla-Brown’s four-year-old son, Leo, they would relocate to a farm in rural Lancaster county, Pennsylvania, to raise chickens, tend a garden – and spread the gospel of fungi.As far as hobbies go, mycology – the study, collection and cultivation of fungi – has never been wildly removed from the mainstream. Upwards of 90 local mushroom clubs exist throughout the US and Canada members host foraging walks and help each other tackle subtle taxonomical variants.Despite its quiet proliferation, mushroom hunting has, until recently, retained something of an old-world mystique. The age demographic associated with the activity has been, accordingly, not exactly young. But sometime in the last decade, there’s been a shift.On Instagram, hashtags like #mushroomhunting and #mushroomsofinstagram have been used more than a million times. The photos depict prized edibles on the forest floor – crinkle-capped morels or vase-like chanterelles – and, naturally, bright-eyed influencers proudly cradling armfuls of Technicolor chicken of the woods.As younger generations come of age in an era of climate catastrophe, more and more members of the Gen Z and millennial cohorts are turning to the earth for answers to their own wellbeing – and the health of the planet. Their burgeoning mushroom madness just might be the quintessential sign of the times.Posey, Padilla-Brown, and little Leo were among the more than 300 mushroom enthusiasts – most in their 20s and 30s – who recently set up camp on a tract of land in upstate New York’s Adirondack Park for the second annual New Moon Mycology Summit.The summit’s packed program included workshops on DIY mushroom cultivation and guided walks to identify medicinal plants. Environmental stewardship was a recurrent theme of conversation throughout, which was infused with the language of anti-capitalist activism and an emphasis on living more reciprocally with nature amid an economy of extraction.“People are seeking the return-to-the-land thing,” says Olga Tzogas, a co-organizer who runs Smugtown Mushrooms in Rochester, New York.Now 34, she was 20 when she got into mycology through a community college class. When she joined her first mushroom club shortly thereafter, she encountered few other fungi hobbyists under the age of 50. “But,” she notes, “with social media, it’s definitely changed and accelerated, with a lot more younger people.”The mass proliferation of social media coincides with resurgent interest in the medicinal potential of various wild mushroom species. The trend has been amplified by the Gwyneth Paltrow-approved Moon Juice proprietress, Amanda Chantal Bacon, whose line of mushroom-infused nutritional supplements (or “dusts”) sell SoCal yoga mom allure to the well-heeled masses. But those in the know would probably argue that contemporary mycologists like Paul Stamets, Tradd Cotter and Peter McCoy walked so that Bacon, with her Goop-ified potions, could run.“They really brought the world of medicinal fungi and permaculture, remediation, and things like this to the forefront,” says the New York Mycological Society president, Tom Bigelow, “which is really intriguing and appealing to younger people.” Since the group set up an online payment option for club dues in 2012, membership has nearly tripled and become visibly age-erse.Bigelow joined the New York City mushroom club in 2007, 45 years after its founding by a group of amateur mycologists that included the avant-garde musician John Cage. For the past two years, he and a fellow member have undertaken an intensive survey project cataloguing nearly 850 fungi species – and counting – across New York City.“There’s so much potential with fungi and what they’re able to do for the environment, the positive impacts they can have on us from a wellness standpoint,” says Bigelow. “It’s become really entrenched in popular culture now. People’s minds are blown by it, and they want to learn about it.”New biomedical research, while not yet definitive, is promising. Cordyceps, for instance, contain a compound that may boost cognition and memory. Studies suggest that other mushrooms, such as turkey tail and chaga, may even slow the growth of cancer cells.Of course, the medical use of mushrooms is far from new. Otzi, the Neolithic man whose frozen body was found in the Italian Alps in 1991, had birch fungus on his tool belt that may have been used to treat intestinal parasites. Penicillin and the first generation of the cholesterol-lowering drugs, statins, are among many pharmaceutical agents that derive an active ingredient from fungi.And yet, western society has until lately suffered what Tzogas calls “fungi phobia”. For centuries, people didn’t understand the biology of mushrooms, why they would show up without warning after a rainy day. Some you could eat, while others, if ingested, could produce visions of the devil.Therein lies the appeal. The study of fungi is fundamentally about the joy of mastery, of learning the taxonomies and ecology of a notoriously complex family of organisms. The stakes are thrillingly high: anything less than absolute certainty in one’s identification of a wild edible mushroom species can land its eater in the hospital – or, in some circumstances, the grave.Despite the risks, mycology offers a seemingly bottomless well of discovery. There is an inherent optimism in its pursuit. A recent memoir by the anthropologist Long Litt Woon details how the author’s obsessive mycological immersion helped her cope with the unexpected death of her husband. “Mushroom outings gave me the push I needed to get out of the house and take part in life,” she writes.Endlessly complex, mushrooms unlock a portal of exciting possibility – a future that utilizes regenerative, fungus-derived plastics and Styrofoam-like packing materials, and that even taps into mycelial networks to graft artificial organs. The growing discipline of mycoremediation has opened new windows for harnessing mycelia to filter environmental pollutants and, as Tzogas puts it, help “clean up the messes humans have made”.Then, of course, there’s the other kind of magic associated with mushrooms. Mounting interest in the psychotherapeutic and cognitive benefits of hallucinogenic psilocybin mushrooms came to a head last year with the author Michael Pollan’s paean to psychedelics, How to Change Your Mind, which became an instant bestseller.The podcaster Joe Rogan, a vocal advocate of psilocybin use and legalization, beat Pollan to the chase with a lengthy 2017 episode of The Joe Rogan Experience in which the mycologist Paul Stamets declared his belief that “psilocybin should be looked upon as a nootropic vitamin”.But the psychedelic piece of our fungal future may pose some of the most immediate questions about mushrooms’ relationship to social and environmental ethics, responsibility and the justice system. A keynote panel discussion at the New Moon summit considered how the recent decriminalization of psilocybin mushrooms in cities such as Denver and Oakland, California, might affect communities of color, cutting to the heart of the complex and intersecting societal implications just beneath the surface of fungi’s fascinating science.As has been true of the legal cannabis industry, those who stand to profit most from an above-ground psilocybin marketplace are unlikely to resemble the mostly racialized and, often, poor casualties of the country’s continuing war on drugs. (The PayPal billionaire and Gawker foe Peter Thiel stepped in last year as a major investor in the psychedelics startup Compass Pathways.)It is a cruel but maybe unsurprising irony that the biggest liability in mycological discovery is us, the human beings poised to put its possibilities into practice. Fungi may eventually offer some measure of environmental relief from the contaminants we’ve created, but it cannot make us stop contaminating. Medical discovery will not, in and of itself, ensure equitable access to mushroom-based therapies, nor will it guarantee the sustainable cultivation of associated species.To fully reap whatever riches may emerge from within the fungal kingdom, we will need to reconsider some of our most deeply ingrained habits as a species with a demonstrated knack for destruction. Our collective missteps are, of course, what have made the prospects so enticing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/742d3ed35fec7abf00e03bfab7a24f2fe57e7977/0_192_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=12aa24e09433b0e852b33db864b3b3b2","title":"who needs bananas how to blend a better smoothie","story":"There’s more to a good smoothie than a load of sweet fruit. With the right ingredients it can be a meal in a glassThe smoothie is a classic good resolution, right up there with eight glasses of water a day and trying to see things from the other person’s point of view. I’ll swap my croissant for a smoothie. Or my double espresso for a smoothie. Or my full English for a smoothie. Then, so long as I wash my blender straight after so I don’t immediately descend into kitchen entropy, I will be a better person, packed with vitamins and full till lunchtime.Like all good intentions, this remains more or less preserved in aspic if you never stick to it, you never need to update it. But nutritionists have fallen out of love with smoothies.Unlike juicing, blending fruit keeps most of the roughage. Smoothies still fell out of fashion a bit when it was established that it is better for satiety to simply eat the ingredients. However, while it might come naturally to eat an apple and maybe a banana, you are unlikely to want to sprinkle some kale over either, less likely still to spread them with cashew butter. These are the key elements for nursing smoothies back into favour: vegetation and protein. The Nutribullet website has a ton of recipes, and a fair number of them include protein powder, which I disapprove of. But there are other ways to boost protein, and that’s the fashion: lower sugar, higher protein, while still fitting through a straw and being an appetising colour, which is to say not grey.There are two main routes to making things less sweet but still palatable: nutty or zingy. Almond milk is mysteriously good. You can use it with a banana base, but it’s so silky in its own right, and has enough heft, that you don’t need to. (It’s good, if only for the soul, and the frail human need for variety, not to make all your smoothies with bananas.) A teaspoon of nut butter – peanut is tastier, cashew less assertive – rounds out the texture and makes it more filling. You’re missing a trick if you don’t add greens, since they pump up the healthiness without hugely changing the taste (if you want to change it, add rocket, but not until you get to zingy). Spinach is the favourite, though that tends to mean baby spinach, for mildness. Kale is particularly good with cherries, whose sweetness is quite fierce and distinctive (unlike strawberries, which have more of a cutesy flavour and taste like a mistake when set against a strong green vegetable). Blueberries are good with celery, like a married couple who seem incredibly different but who have elemental similarities that you only notice once they’re both dead. That isn’t a very nice colour, however, a kind of mauve that elsewhere in life would be discontinued and end up in TK Maxx. Beetroots are good but you have to steam them, which defeats the raw-purity agenda a bit beetroot greens are surprisingly good with almost everything.Zing is generated mainly by lime and ginger the theory, I think, is that they sort of blow your head off and you experience the smoothie more as a sensation than a taste. Apple, cucumber and parsley, ginger and lime is a hand-grenade start to a day.I retain a lot of affection for avocado in a smoothie, but if you have one ripe enough (it has to be perfect), it’s tempting just to eat it.The big newcomers to the scene are: cauliflower, which you have to keep to a low proportion otherwise it makes it mealy (the texture not “like a meal”) coconut water, which again, you have to keep to modest amounts, otherwise everything tastes of coconut (if you wanted it to taste of coconut, I would recommend actual coconut) flax seeds, which are satiating and good for vegans (mainly because of omega-3) ashwagandha – which literally means “smell of a horse” in Sanskrit, but in fact does not smell of a horse – is unobtrusive and apparently has a calming yet exhilarating effect that, I must admit, I did not notice and custard apples, which genuinely taste of custard.Never put turmeric in a smoothie, even though people will persistently tell you to. It’s just a fancy way of turning it the colour of turmeric."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/06f8f49dc653576b3c2eb754e53061e99006a97c/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=155d702e641f2328b6ff0702a7b9006c","title":"bulgarian football union president borislav mihaylov accuses england","story":"Comments by Gareth Southgate and England players such as Tammy Abraham about possible racist abuse in Sofia have been described as “offensive” and “derogatory” by the president of the Bulgarian Football Union.Borislav Mihaylov, a former national team goalkeeper, has written to Uefa to express frustration at comments made in advance of Monday’s Euro 2020 qualifier and called on European football’s governing body to sanction England if they go against Uefa’s three-step protocol by immediately walking off if there is racist abuse from the stands.The Bulgarian federation was hit by a two-match partial stadium closure for racist abuse during June’s home qualifiers against the Czechs and Kosovo. The second of those games will be against England.Mihaylov’s letter to Uefa’s general secretary, Theodore Theodoridis, began: “It is with a great feeling of regret that I find myself obligated to address you regarding a matter that I assumed to have been peacefully resolved at the end of last month.“I first raised awareness about the issue at hand following England manager Gareth Southgate’s comments on potential racial abuse in England’s visit to Sofia on October 14 comments that the Bulgarian Football Union, the Bulgarian general public and I personally find offensive due to unjust branding of the local spectators as people inclined to discriminatory behaviour.“Following the communication with English FA president Mr Greg Clarke I was informed that Mr Southgate’s concerns were mainly due to the fact that Bulgaria received a Uefa sanction for racist chants in 2011 – and even though I view these comments as disregarding of all the work that the BFU has done over these eight years, I truly believed that our federation’s immediate reaction would result in a more constructive handling of public and media matters in the eve of the game in Sofia.”Mihaylov added: “Please find attached references to articles in worldwide media platforms in which various players from the England national team openly discuss the possibilities of breaking the Uefa three-step procedure and all Uefa protocols and walking off the pitch in the case of discriminatory behaviour in the team’s upcoming European qualifiers against the Czech Republic and particularly against Bulgaria – an idea which, if executed, should be punishable according to the Uefa disciplinary regulations.”Abraham said this week that England’s players had discussed how they would respond to racist abuse and that “Harry Kane even said that if it happens and we’re not happy with it, we all come off the pitch together”.Uefa’s three-step protocol begins with an announcement over the stadium’s public address system ordering the abuse to stop. If it persists the referee will take the teams off for a reasonable period of time. If the abuse continues after that break, then the game is abandoned.England walking off before the protocol has been observed could result in them forfeiting the match, which under Uefa disciplinary regulations could see the match awarded as a 3-0 victory to Bulgaria.Mihaylov said he was “shocked” by the remarks from the England camp and said the accusations were “not only unjust but are continuous attempts to disrupt the atmosphere before a very much anticipated game of football”.He continued: “I, as president of the Bulgarian Football Union, cannot allow for such derogatory claims to continue being spread in the mass media and I strongly suggest that the Uefa administration take measures against the buildup of unnecessary tension in the weeks devoted to equality and to the celebration of football.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/076fdf7bee398f58faa543c2ec60029bddfa1e6f/414_27_2502_1501/master/2502.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=af7f45890dac97b184c4cb703378c798","title":"jose mourinho rejects lyon chosen another club","story":"José Mourinho turned down an approach from Lyon because “he has already chosen another club”, according to the French team’s president, Jean-Michel Aulas.Aulas is trying to recruit a successor to Sylvinho, who was sacked on Monday after only 11 matches in charge, and the 70-year-old said he had discussed the job with Mourinho.“We had some fairly flattering exchanges over SMS,” Aulas was quoted by Get French Football News. “It was nice for everyone.

The club’s pathetic 21-word statement deviated from the usual sacking cliches by saying it had “separated from Daniel Stendel with immediate effect”. On Wednesday night, Stendel and his assistant Chris Stern also deviated from cliche. Instead of packing their bags and swiftly doing one, they went down the local for a leaving party – where, by mutual consent, they and a load of Barnsley fans got happy on beer and tequila and sang songs about the good times.

The newspaper’s original “world exclusive” story, carrying the byline of reporter Nick Parker, has been removed from its online edition and replaced with a web address referencing legal issues, while tweets from the Sun’s account about the story have been deleted.News Group Newspapers, which also owns the defunct News of the World, is already being sued by Prince Harry over alleged phone hacking, while it is dealing with its role in the row between Coleen Rooney and fellow footballer’s wife Rebekah Vardy over the the alleged leak of private information to the Sun.The Sun’s original story described in detail events in New Zealand 31 years ago when Deborah Stokes’s ex-husband killed their two children before taking his own life. Ben Stokes, who is favourite to win BBC Sports Personality of the Year, said the article was “despicable” and, following a public backlash, the newspaper failed to follow up its exclusive with additional reporting.The legal proceedings were filed before photographs were published this week showing Stokes appearing to grab his wife’s face at an awards event, an incident she described as “nonsense”. Stokes is using the same legal firm who successfully defended him in his criminal case for affray last summer.At the time of publication the Sun defended the decision to publish the story about Stokes’s family, pointing out that the case had been widely covered by New Zealand media when it occurred 31 years ago and it had requested comment.It said: “The Sun has the utmost sympathy for Ben Stokes and his mother but it is only right to point out the story was told with the cooperation of a family member who supplied details, provided photographs and posed for pictures. The tragedy is also a matter of public record and was the subject of extensive front-page publicity in New Zealand at the time.“The Sun has huge admiration for Ben Stokes and we were delighted to celebrate his sporting heroics this summer. He was contacted prior to publication and at no stage did he or his representatives ask us not to publish the story.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0769c9c329ca78fa3e709975655defcc6d998e5b/0_95_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8aab37e007c264ba35460181c11e11d1","title":"rebekah vardy hires it experts over coleen rooney leak claims","story":"Vardy suggests someone else with access to her Instagram account could have leaked stories to the SunRebekah Vardy has said she is calling in forensic computer experts to examine who had access to her Instagram account following an extraordinary dispute with fellow footballer’s wife Coleen Rooney over the leaking of private information to the Sun.Vardy, who was on holiday in Dubai with her footballer husband, Jamie, when the story broke, has denied claims that she provided the stories to the newspaper – despite apparently being caught in an elaborate sting operation that involved Rooney posting fake updates to see which appeared in the media.She denies involvement, although her Instagram account already followed two of the Sun journalists who authored the disputed articles.The Sun has run dozens of stories about Vardy in recent months, many of them exclusive and some of which were bylined by the same reporters who wrote the stories about Rooney, which were allegedly based on false information.The paper has not officially commented on the stories, although it covered the row on its front page on Thursday and has emphasised that it followed standard journalistic practice in putting all the apparently fake stories to Rooney’s representatives before publication with a request for comment. One source at the newspaper insisted they had not paid Vardy for stories about Coleen Rooney, although this does not rule out the possibility of another arrangement.The dispute shines a light on tabloid practices at an unwelcome time for the Sun, which is already having to deal with its publisher, News Group Newspapers, being sued by Prince Harry for alleged phone-hacking offences. It also highlights how celebrities are increasingly able – and willing – to circumvent traditional media outlets and take them on directly.Rooney, the wife of footballer Wayne, has been dubbed “WAGatha Christie” for her role in the investigation, after the “wives and girlfriends” moniker that was given to the partners of England footballers at the 2006 World Cup.She published a series of fake news updates on her private Instagram account over the summer and slowly reduced their audience in a bid to identify the leaker. This led to apparently fake articles about Rooney seeking baby gender selection treatment in Mexico, a planned return to television, and a flood at her new-build mansion appearing in the Sun.On Wednesday Rooney went public, claiming the only account which had viewed the story about the water ingress at her new home belonged to Vardy.In response, Vardy has suggested that someone else with access to her Instagram account may have been responsible for passing on information.Her representative briefed MailOnline that she has hired “IT experts who can look at the forensics of her Instagram” to identify who else had access in an attempt to clear her name, although it unclear exactly what this forensic analysis would involve. Vardy’s agent did not return a request for comment.Model Danielle Lloyd, herself the former partner of a footballer, on Thursday told ITV’s Good Morning Britain that she had previously had run-ins “over similar things” with Vardy, also appearing to accuse Vardy of being the author of a Sun on Sunday column entitled “Secret WAG”.On Thursday Vardy called the new claims “bollocks” and said: “I’m not saying anything more until we’ve finished looking into this situation properly.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/900fa4f431a40a0cb05688f669b84cb65d0e255c/0_338_5068_3041/master/5068.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4153725c87802216f369e72e84629be2","title":"evictions cost private renters in england 70m a year","story":"Generation Rent says majority believe landlords should foot bill for making tenants movePrivate renters in England are losing out on about £70m a year when landlords kick them out as missed time at work, cleaning bills and moving costs stack up to £1,400 each on average, housing campaigners say.An estimated 146,000 households have been asked by landlords to leave their homes in the past three years, with rent arrears and an alleged lack of care for the property the most frequently cited reasons.The campaign group Generation Rent, which calculated the costs of moving out, said more than half the public believed landlords should foot the bill.“Tenants should not have to bear the costs of their landlords’ personal decisions and the wider public agrees,” said Caitlin Wilkinson, a policy and public affairs manager at Generation Rent, one of several campaign groups urging the housing secretary, Robert Jenrick, to reform the system.The government’s public consultation on scrapping no-fault evictions using section 21 notices closes this weekend. The Residential Landlords Association said on Thursday that any abolition of such evictions would threaten the supply of private rented homes, which it said were now relied on by 4.5 million households.The association said more cases would be likely to go to court and it would become almost impossible to evict antisocial tenants.Demand for private rented homes still outstrips supply, according to the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors, which is predicting that rents will rise faster than house prices in the next five years.Plans to reform the system were first announced by Theresa May as prime minister in April. She said landlords would still be able to end tenancies where they had legitimate reasons to do so, but they would no longer be able to evict families with only eight weeks’ notice.“Everyone renting in the private sector has the right to feel secure in their home, settled in their community and able to plan for the future with confidence,” she said at the time.Maddie Moore, 32, a renter in Malvern, Gloucestershire, told the  she was served with a no-fault eviction notice in July 2018, two weeks before she was due to give birth. She had to take seven days off from her self-employed sales job to find a new property and was faced with a £220 bill for professional cleaning.“I felt as though if you own your own home you can have a baby if you don’t own your own home you have no protection,” she said. “I couldn’t nest or do anything. It was a very difficult time.”Polly Neate, Shelter’s chief executive, said: “For too long England’s 11 million renters have been living with the threat of eviction looming large but just one more simple move in the right direction will give them the security they desperately need. The government has already done the legwork by setting up a consultation on how to scrap section 21. Now they need to see it through and prove that they really do care about our nation’s renters.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ef7836e7955bd890e7927ae2d65167b1361f42f8/0_6_5413_3248/master/5413.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=222d7879abc3e716737e3c06fbc7e845","title":"elbow giants of all sizes review polydor","story":"(Polydor)It’s a dislocated Elbow that you get on this proggy, restless record – but their sense of empathy is still strongHalfway through the eighth Elbow album comes a lyric that’s almost impossible not to home in on. “Who am I?” sings Guy Garvey on White Noise White Heat, a song that recounts the singer’s despairing reaction to the “unspeakable crime” of the Grenfell Tower fire. “Some blarney Mantovani with a lullaby when the sky’s falling in.”It sounds like a snarky critic’s dissection of the music that propelled Elbow to mainstream fame. Ever since their 2008 single One Day Like This became not just a hit, but an omnipresent part of British life – there was a lengthy period when no sporting achievement or victory in a TV talent show was allowed to be televised without it blaring buoyantly on the soundtrack – Elbow have enjoyed a decade as Britain’s leading purveyors of ballad-paced, bruised-but-warm northern optimism. In fairness, that’s rather a reductive view of their subsequent output, but equally, no Elbow album since has been allowed to pass without at least one song that fitted the bill: string-laden, stately paced, its central message essentially “come ’ere, you daft bugger, give us a hug”.Hearing them repudiate their most popular mode comes as a shock, but then, desperate times call for desperate measures, and the circumstances of Giants of All Sizes’ recording sound grim. Quite aside from events in the outside world, it was marked by a string of deaths among the band’s circle, including that of Garvey’s father. The result is a succession of troubled songs that frequently question Elbow’s USP. “How do you keep your eyes ablaze,” wonders Garvey, “in these faith-free, hope-free, charity-free days”? The answer often seems to be, you can’t.The music similarly plays against type, or at least the popularly held view of type. When they first started attracting widespread interest, one of the most frequently remarked upon things about Elbow was the band’s unabashed love of progressive rock – still a ballsy thing for a hotly tipped alt-rock band to admit 20 years ago. Its influence has never really left them – on any given Elbow album you’re never that far from a song that sounds shimmering, aching but uplifting and suggestive of long teenage hours spent listening to The Carpet Crawlers by Genesis on repeat. But it’s more prevalent here than ever. It’s telling that Giants of All Sizes is being released as a limited edition single track CD, as if it’s a suite of songs, rather than a collection of them.You can hear the influence in the complex but tightly woven mesh of instruments on Empires and the opener Dexter \u0026amp Sinister, which starts out driven by a distorted bass riff not a million miles removed from that on The Seldom Seen Kid’s Grounds for Divorce, but seems to turn into a different song entirely midway through. Moreover, if it never lacks melodies – Seven Veils and My Trouble are particularly lovely – Giants of All Sizes digs into prog’s more disruptive side, the wilful awkwardness expressed by its jarring time signatures, unpredictable shifts and knotty cramp-inducing riffs.The result is what you might call a dislocated Elbow, noticeably light on songs that might cause festival crowds to hug each other and raise plastic pint pots aloft, big on taking their signature motifs and upending them. “All together now,” offers Garvey midway through Dexter \u0026amp Sinister. What follows isn’t a singalong chorus, but a rambling piano solo. Guitar solos you expect to be soaring inducements to punch the air never quite achieve lift-off: they rasp too harshly, come sprinkled with moments of squeaky discord or are possessed of an ungainly, staggering gait. When the strings arrive on The Delayed 3:15, they don’t provide the usual stirring, epic swell: they follow a twitchy, scattered pattern played on a clarinet. The net result is as agitated and troubled as the song’s narrator, who’s watching the body of a suicide being extracted from beneath a train by “pale-faced kids in rubber gloves, dressed as cops”. Doldrums, meanwhile, features a very Elbow-ish lyrical sentiment – “all of this stuff in our veins is the same” – but it’s depicted as a sentiment only “desperate men” would suggest. The song’s climax repeats the line over and over again, but defies you to join in. One voice distractedly mutters it, another wheezes and pants the line between gulps of breath.It’s debatable whether Elbow’s patent brand of warmth and optimism really is redundant in the current climate. One of the striking things about Nick Cave’s rapturously received Ghosteen was how empathetic and hopeful its songs sounded, potentiated by the fact that empathy and hope are two things in short supply at the moment. But the galvanising effect on Elbow’s sound isn’t really up for question. Musically, Giants of All Sizes is richer and stranger than anything they’ve released since their commercial breakthrough. Even when it finally settles back into more comfortable lyrical terrain – My Trouble’s hymning of cosy domesticity, On Deronda Street’s paean to parenthood – the music strays beyond their usual comfort zone: ragged and underpinned by glitchy electronic beats. It suits them out there.The best recommendation you can offer the former Chairlift singer’s latest solo single is that its delicate, understated take on AutoTuned pop is as good as its title."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf39055f13e4c57a6502325d8f64eec5135f72df/27_675_1341_804/master/1341.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9d206c313667b754153507d4752c4027","title":"morton feldman piano review","story":"Philip Thomas (Another Timbre, five CDs)Thomas’s authoritative playing shows why Feldman’s keyboard music is some of the most important of the last centuryMorton Feldman wrote for the piano for most of his composing career, and the 46 pieces included in Philip Thomas’s collection – the most extensive survey of this music to date, including several works recorded for the first time – provide a thread through its changing emphases and stylistic shifts. The earliest here is an untitled piece from 1942, just one minute long and composed when Feldman was 16 the latest is Palais de Mari from 1986, the year before his death.Thomas has been studying and playing Feldman for a quarter of a century, and his lengthy essay accompanying these discs, in which, as well as the pieces themselves, he discusses different approaches to interpreting this fascinatingly varied music, is an essential addition to the performances. As he points out, recordings of both of the biggest works here, the 90-minute Triadic Memories from 1981, and the hour-long For Bunita Marcus, written four years later, already run into double figures, and he admits to having had doubts about adding to those numbers. But including them as part of a much more comprehensive set made sense, for it enabled him, as he writes, “to find out how one piece rubs against another, where the contrasts and points of contact are.” The pieces that Thomas has omitted, and his reasons for doing so, are clearly explained, too.What we have here, then, is an authoritative presentation of some of the most important keyboard music of the second half of the 20th century. If the works here from the late 1940s and early 50s reveal the importance of John Cage on Feldman’s music – it’s quite easy to imagine works such as the Illusions of 1949, or the Three Dances from the following year, being played on a prepared piano – then very soon after that Feldman’s personal voice becomes totally recognisable, in its restraint, fastidious voicing and meticulously calculated harmonies, whether the scores are indeterminate, or notated conventionally or graphically.Between 1964 and 1977, Feldman wrote nothing for solo piano, but the piece with which he broke that silence, baldly titled Piano, is one of the most remarkable in the whole set. Though it is far less well-known than the larger scale works that followed it, Piano seems to exploit every facet of the instrument – its range of tone and touch, harmonics and resonance – more comprehensively than anything else Feldman wrote. It provides a perfect demonstration of Thomas’s mastery and understanding of this music too, alive to every inflection and subtle change of colour, and to every challenge it presents."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/be1cd7b2349e74d49029d0f72b5f365c96a47d4b/2238_1224_3059_1835/master/3059.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=929aed1b355630d27c3a3c82f011e508","title":"eu nationals lacking settled status could be deported minister says","story":"Brandon Lewis says people who do not apply before 2021 may be removed from UKThe security minister, Brandon Lewis, has threatened EU citizens with deportation from the UK if they do not apply for settled status after Brexit.Home Office figures show a million of the estimated 3 million EU citizens in the UK have yet to apply for settled status, which will allow them to stay in the UK.In an interview with the German newspaper Die Welt, Lewis said these people risked being deported if they failed to apply by the end of 2020. “If EU citizens have not registered by then without an adequate justification, the immigration rules will apply,” Lewis said.Asked whether those who did not apply in the next 14 months would face deportation even if they fulfilled all legal conditions for a residence permit, Lewis said: “Theoretically yes. We will apply the rules.”Campaigners said the comments suggested the government was planning to renege on a promise to EU citizens.The3million, a group representing EU citizens living in Britain, said it was the first time the government had confirmed what would happen to those who did not apply for settled status.Because of Brexit, EU (excluding British and Irish citizens), EEA or Swiss citizens need to apply to the EU settlement scheme if they wish to continue living in the UK after 30 June 2021.Applicants are given given either settled status or pre-settled status. The status granted depends on how long they have been living in the UK. The government states that people\u0027s rights will be different depending on which status they get.Guidelines state applicants will usually get settled status if they’ve lived in the UK for a continuous five-year period. Pre-settled status will be granted to those who have not lived in the UK for five years, or cannot demonstrate that they meet this requirement.The government states that both settled and pre-settled status confer the right to:There are some significant differences though. Those with settled status will be allowed to stay in the UK as long as they like, and can spend up to five years in a row outside the UK without losing their status.Those with pre-settled status are allowed to stay in the UK for a further five years, which would allow them to apply to convert it into settled status.The status granted also affects any children people might have. With settled status, any children born in the UK will automatically be British citizens. With pre-settled status, the child would be born with pre-settled status, unless it qualified for British citizenship directly through one of the parents.The deadline for applying is 30 June 2021, or 31 December 2020 if the UK leaves the EU without a deal. Irish citizens, or those who already have indefinite leave to remain, do not need to apply.Maike Bohn, a co-founder of the campaign, said: “We have pressed the government for years on what happens to those who do not have a status in 2021. Today, after much wait, it is confirmed that hundreds and thousands of people will be punished with the threat of removal from their home. This is no way to treat people, let alone what was promised.”The3million said many EU citizens in the UK were unaware of the requirement to register for settled status, while others were refusing to, as a protest against Brexit.Bohn said: “Those people who miss the tight deadline will face the full force of the hostile environment. That is the grim reality of the UK government’s position, no matter how many times they repeat the phrase: ‘EU citizens and their families are our friends, neighbours and colleagues and we want them to stay.’”The3million is calling for changes to the EU settlement scheme to guarantee rights to EU citizens even if they do not apply for settled status.Lewis later tweeted that his remarks had been taken out of context.Until now Home Office briefings have consistently tried to stress that officials will do everything they can to grant EU nationals the right to remain, and steered away from focusing on what would happen to those who failed to apply on time.One of the civil servants leading the settled status application scheme said: “This is about trying to grant the right. This is not about trying to trip people up … We’ve set this up from scratch. All this is here to try to say yes to European citizens, to try to give them their rights.”The Home Office’s position has consistently been to stress that if someone has a good reason to explain why they failed to apply by the deadline then they will be reasonable. The Home Office indicated that if people persistently fail to apply, then they will have no lawful status in the UK.Campaigners have asked for clarity on this point, noting that there was no clear explanation of what would be considered a “good reason” for failing to apply by the deadline.There is concern from campaign groups such as The3million that there could be tens of thousands of EU nationals in the UK who will fail to apply in time they are particularly concerned by what will happen to older and more vulnerable EU residents who may not be aware of the need to secure their rights after Brexit and who may struggle with the digital application process.As well as encountering difficulties with the Home Office, people who do not secure settled status may encounter problems applying for work or renting property, because employers and landlords will need to check that they are living in the UK legally.A Home Office spokesperson said: “EU citizens are our friends, family and neighbours and we want them to stay.“The EU settlement scheme is a free and easy way for EU citizens to get the UK immigration status they need.“We have received 2m applications and are looking for reasons to grant status, not refuse, and EU citizens have until at least December 2020 to apply.“We’ve always been clear that where they have reasonable grounds for missing the deadline, they’ll be given a further opportunity to apply.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/364feba2031666c6a92119e3c366b488cc3d70e6/1103_69_2285_1371/master/2285.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8317b800b8e172277ebd42607b5294c9","title":"jeremy corbyn sets out labour election pitch and targets another upset","story":"Labour leader says he aims to tackle inequality and give young people hopeJeremy Corbyn has pledged to pull off another general election upset and recover from poor polling to deny Boris Johnson a return to Downing Street, as he effectively kicked off Labour’s campaign with a so-called alternative Queen’s speech setting out key policies.Speaking to party activists in Northampton, where both parliamentary seats are held by Conservative MPs with tiny majorities over Labour – Corbyn reeled off a list of plans in areas including Brexit, inequality, education, the NHS, housing, crime and the climate emergency.He said it was “the most transformative, radical and exciting programme ever put before the British electorate”.Corbyn ignored a separate question about whether he would step down if he did not win the election.In his speech he said Labour was seeking a radical transformation of the UK so that young people could “look forwards to the future with hope”.“It’s not easy, I get all of that,” he said. “But the one thing this country can’t afford is the level of inequality that we have.”He said that when an election was called, Labour would mobilise hundreds of thousands of supporters to push its message.“That atmosphere and that message that things can and will be done very differently. Do we want our country run by a party that has cut, sliced, diced and privatised our public services, or do we want the ambition, enthusiasm and imagination of the Labour party to create that different and better society?”To cheers from the crowd, he concluded: “I’ll take that message out there. I’m very fit, I’m very healthy, I’m very happy, and I’m very, very determined.”Corbyn brushed off a suggestion that the party should be pushing for a second EU referendum before an election.“A second referendum is what we propose under a Labour government, which would be, as I have said, not a choice between a no-deal cliff edge but between an intelligent arrangement with the European Union and remain.”Many Labour MPs are worried about going into a general election at a time when the party is trailing badly in the polls, and they would rather see the issue of Brexit put to bed, allowing them to campaign on domestic issues.Corbyn dismissed the planned Queen’s speech by the government as a “cynical stunt”, saying it was “full pomp and ceremony, setting out an agenda to parliament that it has no intention and no means of delivering”.The rest of his speech was largely a list of previously announced Labour policies, including its plans for a so-called green new deal, reshaping the economy towards skilled, sustainable jobs.Asked about the ongoing Extinction Rebellion protests in London, which Johnson and several government ministers have condemned, Corbyn praised the movement, predicting its leaders could even one day be commemorated on postage stamps, as earlier activists have been.“Their right to protest has to be upheld, that is what our democratic rights are all about,” he said. “Obviously protests must be conducted in a peaceful way, and every time anyone condemns people for protesting they should think for a moment where protest can lead.”He added: “Those women who stood up for the right for women to vote, the suffragettes, were condemned mercilessly by almost every newspaper in the country. They’re now on postage stamps.”Asked about the case of a US diplomat’s wife who left the UK after being sought in connection with a fatal road crash, Corbyn said the US should take action to return her.“I am alarmed and very concerned about that,” he said. “For somebody to be killed in our country and for the person who did it then to flee to the United States and then to claim diplomatic immunity is completely unacceptable.”He condemned comments by Donald Trump that US citizens sometimes drove on the wrong side of the road in the UK. “I just think that’s the most crass, insensitive comment that anyone could ever make,” Corbyn said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c2f88c106531df82aebfdbe23a249dd8b37adc78/0_448_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=73910d68e99309449a77f37fe477efed","title":"nissan no deal brexit would jeopardise entire european business model","story":"Imposition of WTO tariffs on exports could put Sunderland plant at risk, says chair"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f5fca6e3685824d8b9bba53fab53c341781ad774/639_1035_5479_3288/master/5479.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1958f04b1405ebc1a149c59f682d0cef","title":"brexit and the irish border is there a solution","story":"Lisa O’Carroll and Rory Carroll tell Anushka Asthana that solving the Irish border problem is still key to a Brexit deal.

It is every child’s right to live in a world that promotes, not harms, their health.”Among the recommendations are bans on promoting and advertising junk food, which would prevent deals such as that just struck between the England and Wales Cricket Board and KP Snacks. She also called for a ban on eating and drinking on urban public transport with exceptions for drinking fresh water and eating and drinking for medical conditions. In addition, she recommended price hikes through VAT changes on junk foods high in salt, sugar or fat, with the option of plain packaging as there is for cigarettes.Eating too much sugar contributes to people having too many calories during the day, which can lead to weight gain. Being overweight increases the risk of health problems such as heart diseases, type 2 diabetes, and some forms of cancer. Sugar is also one of the main causes of tooth decay.\u0026nbspThe NHS advises that most adults and children in the UK eat too much of a type of sugar called \u0027free sugars\u0027. These are the sugars added to food and drinks, found in biscuits, chocolate, breakfast cereals and fizzy drinks. But they are also found naturally in honey and unsweetened fruit juices.Her report, she said, “is aimed at politicians and policy makers, now and in the future”. It was intended to reframe the issue, she told the . Obesity is about children’s right to a healthy life, Davies said, adding that the public want the government to take action to deal with it and politicians need no longer fear accusations of nanny statism.She said: “I think the polling data is pretty clear. The public think it’s time that governments acted to protect their children. Overweight and obesity is because we are all in this flood of unhealthy food marketing and advertising. We need to close those floodgates.“It’s the right of children to live in a healthy environment and with proper nutrition. What we’ve done to date has not stopped the problem.”Ten in every 30 primary school children are now overweight or obese. Each week the equivalent of 13 school buses of children are admitted to hospital for tooth extraction under general anaesthetic because of decay caused by sugar, she said, adding: “That’s damaging children, costing the NHS.”In later life it leads to heart disease, cancer and type 2 diabetes.The report said England was “nowhere near” the government’s goal of halving childhood obesity by 2030. It proposes a lengthy list of radical taxation, legislative and other changes.Snacking on junk is common. Davies said: “It is now pretty normal to see people eating as they walk up the street. A couple of decades ago, it wasn’t. Portion sizes have crept up. £300m a year is spent on advertising unhealthy food and drink. Think about the cricket and what they’ve just agreed. It’s appalling.”Just as governments of the past protected children from working in the coal mines or sweeping chimneys, so they must now protect them from junk food and drink, she argued. There are 1.2 million children in need of medical help for clinical obesity. As many as 90,000 adolescents may be eligible for bariatric surgery – but fewer than 10 stomach-shrinking operations are done on this age group in a year.Davies said focusing on weight loss without changing the food environment “is like treating people for cholera and then sending them back into their homes where the water is still contaminated with cholera”.Companies have also reformulated soft drinks to escape the sugar tax. The report said: “Government must not shy away from regulation … the playing field is not level – it is too easy to make money from selling unhealthy food and too hard to make money from selling healthy food.” It recommends a shake-up of VAT after Brexit so the tax falls on junk food, while healthy foods would escape it and become cheaper.Davies hits hardest at government ministers. She said in the report: “The government has a duty as well as a moral responsibility to uphold children’s rights and therefore the quality of the environment in which they live. Ministers are in a unique position of influence to shape the environment.”In June, Boris Johnson told the Sun he was against extending the sugary drinks tax to milkshakes and in July announced a review of what he called sin taxes. Davies said her recommendations were for this government and those to come.Chris Askew, the chief executive at Diabetes UK, said it was “an urgent and ambitious call to action. The government have committed to halving childhood obesity by 2030, but their actions so far have been insufficient.”He added: “The bold and decisive recommendations outlined mean that this report cannot be ignored. Government must be brave and take urgent actions to affect the change we all want and need.”Sally Warren, the director of policy at The King’s Fund thinktank, said: “The government should make full use of all the levers at its disposal to tackle obesity. Some politicians may balk at the idea of the ‘nanny state’, but research suggests these types of intervention may enjoy stronger public support than they often assume. Around two thirds of adults support the sugar tax and restricting junk food advertising, so there is a real opportunity for the government to build on Dame Sally’s report and turn these ideas into action.”Katharine Jenner, at Action on Sugar, said Davies’s “brave call for bold action is a beacon of hope” and that there was an urgent need to take unhealthy food and drink out of the spotlight by restricting promotions and marketing. A move that she said could only be achieved through legislation.Kate Halliwell, the head of UK diet and health policy at the Food and Drink Federation (FDF), said the manufacturers should not be targeted. She said: “FDF member companies are committing time and resource to deliver the government’s various reformulation programmes – cutting salt, sugars and calories. In fact, FDF members are selling 57.3m fewer kilograms of sugars and 1tn fewer calories than they were back in 2015.“As Public Health England acknowledges, reformulating products takes time, and we must always take the consumer with us. We want government to support us in this work and not introduce punitive measures which might hinder it.”The health secretary, Matt Hancock, said: “Prof Dame Sally Davies has done more than anyone to promote the health of the nation over a decade as CMO. Her parting report is no different and we will study it closely and act on the evidence.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/58e641f4f9f10bca3bb8f6af2eaa15023aa82aac/0_331_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=81715285e3a6ecddd1086d889d915ab4","title":"in search of smart chewing gum to help women conceive","story":"University of Copenhagen students on a mission to create chewing gum that accurately predicts female fertilityConical flasks of green liquid jiggle in rotating trays while women in white lab coats study yellowing yeast samples. One has grown into the shape of a smiley face. On the other side of the laboratory, something important is happening with vials, pipettes and foil-covered bottles containing what looks a lot like urine.The aim is to produce a chewing gum that accurately predicts the female fertility cycle. “We need to see if the active ingredient survives in chewing gum, then we’ll add flavours,” says one of the researchers, Anett Stèger.A team of 13 students from the University of Copenhagen is on a mission to create a product to help women improve their chances of getting pregnant. Biotechnology and molecular bioscience students have been working together to create a “smart chewing gum” that will change colour to show where women are in their menstrual cycles.Ever wondered why you feel so gloomy about the world - even at a time when humanity has never been this healthy and prosperous? Could it be because news is almost always grim, focusing on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame?This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.Readers can recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@theThe plan is to replace baker’s yeast with human hormone receptors that can measure the oestrogen, LH and progesterone that are present in saliva when a woman is ovulating. The project, nicknamed “Ovulaid”, was started as a Danish entry into iGEM, the world championship in synthetic biology, which starts in Boston at the end of October.The researchers are an international bunch, with scientists from Nepal, India, Germany and Hungary as well as Denmark. Seven are women.“The competition can get quite intense,” says Stèger, who is Hungarian. “We’re working 40 hours a week on this, on top of our normal studies – so the drop-out rate is usually high. But we’ve only had one person leave. It’s a project we’re all really passionate about.”A fellow team-member, Hitesh Gelli Praveenkumar from India, first came up with the idea of a diagnostic gum when the group began brainstorming in February, before Benedicte Smith-Sivertsen, a Dane, suggested it could help women conceive.“My sister was going through fertility treatment at the time,” says Smith-Sivertsen, “and I was surprised by how hard it was – all these huge syringes and peeing on sticks every day. I just thought, why hasn’t anyone made this easier?”Most over the counter ovulation tests currently monitor LH levels, with higher end and more expensive ovulation tests measuring LH and oestrogen. “But we thought, what about a chewing gum that could do all of that, as well as measuring progesterone (which helps the uterus prepare for pregnancy) at a fraction of the cost?” says Stèger.There is clearly some work to be done. A prototype tastes a bit like wax.The researchers are working on a smartphone app to accompany the chewing gum for easy interpretation of the colour results and the gum is biodegradable.“The plan is that the gum will be very discreet in terms of packaging, available in supermarkets in a variety of flavours, and much, much cheaper than existing ovulation tests measuring LH and oestrogen that you pee on,” says Stèger.The hope is that Ovulaid will also have a developing world application. “We’ve conducted research with gynaecology clinics in rural India, where many hospitals don’t have the resources for regular fertility testing,” says Gelli, “so there’s a real excitement about the gum.”They’ve also looked into the impact it could have on areas such as Africa, where infertility is taboo. However, the market that may prove trickiest is Europe because the gum will contain a genetically-modified biosensor, and GM is tightly controlled in the EU.Dr Shabana Bora, a fertility specialist at the Lister Fertility Clinic in London not involved in the project, expressed cautious optimism about the work, saying “since many existing ovulation tests create a lot of plastic waste, a biodegradable gum could help be a more eco-friendly, cost-effective alternative.”This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

Being overweight increases the risk of health problems such as heart diseases, type 2 diabetes, and some forms of cancer. Sugar is also one of the main causes of tooth decay.\u0026nbspThe NHS advises that most adults and children in the UK eat too much of a type of sugar called \u0027free sugars\u0027. These are the sugars added to food and drinks, found in biscuits, chocolate, breakfast cereals and fizzy drinks. But they are also found naturally in honey and unsweetened fruit juices.“Every child has the right to grow up healthy, but this data shows the stark reality is that children are being overwhelmed by a flood of unhealthy food in our environment,” said Caroline Cerny of the Obesity Health Alliance, which speaks for a wide range of health bodies. “The number of children with a weight classified as severely obese is at an all-time high and this will damage their health now and in the future.“This is a problem that can be fixed with bold and comprehensive action from our politicians who have the power to shape the environment our children are growing up in. It’s time for the government to bring in the measures that we know will stem the tide of unhealthy food marketing and promotions, starting with the long overdue 9pm watershed on junk food adverts on TV and online.”Jo Churchill, the public health minister, said the government’s obesity plan would help families make healthy choices. “These data highlight once again how important it is for us to tackle childhood obesity, which has a devastating impact on the health of our children.

And the veteran No 8 Parisse has pulled no punches in criticising tournament organisers for not relocating the fixture or altering the match day, instead simply cancelling the encounter and awarding both teams two points.“It is difficult to know that we won’t have the chance to play a match against one of the great teams,” said Parisse. “If New Zealand needed four or five points against us it would not have been cancelled.“It is ridiculous that a decision of this nature has been made because it isn’t like the fans arrived yesterday. It is ridiculous that there was no plan B, because it isn’t news that typhoons hit Japan.“Sure everyone might think that Italy versus New Zealand being cancelled counts for nothing because we’d have lost anyway, but we deserved to be respected as a team. We had the chance to play in a big stadium, against a great team.“The alternative is plan B. When you organise a World Cup you should have one in place.”The hooker Leonardo Ghiraldini, who is 34, had to struggle to recover from a bad knee injury to make Italy’s squad and was due to be given his first action in Japan against New Zealand. It was to be in recognition of his 13 years and more than 100 Tests of commitment in the front row.Conor O’Shea described “horrible” disappointment among his players. Ghiraldini reportedly shed tears after a training session when news broke that the game had been cancelled.“I’m not saying we would have beaten them, but you want to finish on the pitch,” said the Italy coach. “Anything can happen and you’re very emotional especially for Leonardo Ghiraldini, who missed his last chance to play in an Italy jersey, and to hear that your international career is finished after training is tough to take.“These guys have given their lives to Italian rugby and their World Cup has ended on the training pitch, when it should be on the playing field.”The New Zealand coach, Steve Hansen, admitted he would have been frustrated had he been on the receiving end of the raw deal that Italy now find themselves lamenting.“If you want to be really ruthless, then it’s all about making sure you win the games on the way through because everyone knew this could be a possibility.“That’s pretty hard-nosed, though, because I know if we were in their situation we’d be disappointed not to have the opportunity to get there. So yes, there’s a lot of sympathy for them. But the right decisions are being made, because it’s all about safety.“It’s always a risk at this time of year with the typhoons, but this is when we play the Rugby World Cup. If you play it earlier, you run the risk of people dying on the footy field because it’ll be 40 degrees.“If you play it later, then that’s when we are finished for Christmas, so you’d have Santa Claus giving us the World Cup.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/346590d7a4de066751ff2ac9418b4a30f47a6961/0_292_5328_3197/master/5328.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=73a08a619b2105b38d7e3bc6e7f84db8","title":"losing by default to a typhoon scotland rugby fans braced for worst","story":"Scotland fans hope game against Japan can go ahead but anger and frustration at prospect of exit is giving way to pragmatismAs Scottish rugby fans contemplate the prospect of “losing by default to a typhoon”, initial anger and frustration at the threat of cancellation and lack of contingency planning is giving way to pragmatism.Tom Moore, who arrived in Tokyo on Thursday from the Scottish Lowlands village of Lochwinnoch, told the  that he would be “immensely disappointed” if Scotland’s match were cancelled, as has happened with the England v France game at the same venue in Yokohama on Saturday.But Moore, who has packed his uniform of a Loch Ness monster hat and kilt for watching the game, added: “If you follow Scottish sport, you’re used to saying the best thing is to get there early so you can have a good time before you lose. We’ve written the book on how to lose sportingly, but there’s not been a chapter yet on losing by default to a typhoon.”Moore, who is hoping still to get to the match with his son, questioned the fairness of drawing certain fixtures that can’t be played and what effect that will have on the overall integrity of the competition, saying: “It is a long tournament, and you would have thought there would be enough flexibility to delay until the weather improved.”Scottish Rugby has said that it fully expects contingency plans to be put in place to enable Scotland to contest for a place in the quarter-finals on the pitch, but online fans have vented their frustration at what they see as a lack of planning.Those watching from Scotland are also debating the different outcomes of cancellation versus playing. Craig Shearer, a Murrayfield season ticket holder from Dundee, explained: “We’re all being pragmatic here. I think the organisers have good procedures in place. Decisions are being taken in good time so fans are in no doubt as to what’s happening. When it comes down to it, this is about public safety and these guys are the experts.”But Shearer went on to raise a point that is being made by many: “The decision of World Rugby to give the World Cup to Japan in typhoon season is one to consider. The development of the Japanese (and tier two in general) is a big thing and this decision was taken as a very positive move. The risks of this happening must have been assessed.” Other fans also queried why World Rugby agreed to the rule that cancellation would be marked as a draw when it was likely to cause controversy.Meanwhile, the Scottish Rugby Union is advising supporters who are already in Japan to heed the advice of the Foreign Office, which is “to follow all official advice, stay indoors and do not attempt to travel on Saturday”. There is an official warning for a continuous risk of earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and tsunamis across the country, which may well also affect the qualifying for the F1 Japanese Grand Prix at Suzuka, which is also due to take place on Saturday.Cammy Black, the deputy editor of the Scottish Rugby Blog, said that the fans he is in touch with are keeping the drama in perspective. “Most fans have huge sympathy for Japan, it’s a massive tournament for them and they have really embraced the Scottish team. If it is cancelled it will be hugely disappointing for the players having worked up to this for four years, and the fans who have paid money to go out there. But we need to be level-headed when there’s a huge storm coming that’s going to affect lots of people’s lives and this is a game of rugby.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b2c14b1d5ee979af8caf66804bbc63dc3394a9bc/0_26_2901_1740/master/2901.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4910149a213f38c96d2dc8452de5bfd3","title":"world gymnastics championships 2019 womens individual all around final live","story":"Yet another remarkable set from Simone Biles on the beam.

I’m perfectly happy with it, except the keyboard needs replacing and batteries seem to lose their ability to charge within a couple of years. The keyboard and battery could be replaced for less than $100. Other than those factors, is there any reason to replace the machine? If I buy a Windows 10 machine, could I or should I continue to run Windows 7 on it? PabloThere is no universal answer to your first question. The time to sell, repurpose or recycle an old PC depends on a large number of factors. Some are technical, such as the specification, the build quality, and whether it will actually run Windows 10. Some are personal, such as what you use it for, how much money you can spare, and whether your time has any value.Circumstances alter cases. It might not be worth replacing a very old PC that’s only used for personal emails, especially if the user is short of cash. On the other hand, it could make sense for a company to replace a high-spec machine that is only a few months old if time is extremely valuable, as it can be in financial organisations.However, your second question is easy. Windows 7 was launched in 2009, and reaches the end of its supported life in January 2020. After that, there will be no more security patches except for the companies able and willing to pay. I understand that Windows 7 Extended Security Updates for Windows Enterprise Edition will cost $25 per device for the first year, $50 for the second year and $100 for the third year. Windows 7 Pro charges are twice that, but still only half the typical charges for extending Windows XP support.Given that Windows 10 Pro can be set up to look and work much like Windows 7 Pro, it makes no sense to pay to extend Windows 7’s life unless your business absolutely depends on it.Even if you disregard the security risk, it’s a bad idea to try to run Windows 7 on hardware designed for Windows 10. Manufacturers don’t test their machines with obsolete operating systems. Even parts on the QVL (Qualified Vendor List) are not guaranteed to work.I am not saying it can’t be done. I am saying you should avoid it as an unnecessary risk.I replaced my previous laptop and desktop PCs when they were six years old, and I think this is a sensible strategy. Old machines may still work, but usually they will have been left behind by technological advances. In your case, the T510 is missing the UEFI system that provides fast start-up, M.2 slots for faster SSD modules, USB-C or Thunderbolt for faster connections, better on-chip graphics with video support, a camera for Windows Hello face-recognition log-on, and so on. You’re also missing out on a touch screen with tablet and pen capabilities.Of course, you can improve the performance of your Lenovo ThinkPad T510 by adding more memory and swapping the original hard drive for a fast SSD. Not everybody can. We’ve all seen the trend towards sealed cases, soldered-in memory and storage chips, glued-in batteries and so on. These make laptops more expensive to repair or upgrade, and therefore more disposable.Old PCs also consume more power, which makes them more expensive to run. Mid-range processors have not become dramatically faster, though having (usually) more cores does mean they work more smoothly. For the past decade, Intel has focused on providing more performance per Watt, rather than more raw performance. A typical laptop processor now runs at a TDP of about 15W, going down to 6W, instead of 35W or 45W. These new processors generate less heat, so they can be used in thinner, lighter and more portable laptops. Lower power consumption also provides longer battery life.Incidentally, I don’t feel bad about retiring laptops after six years, partly because I used to retire them after three years. My laptops do a lot of useful work and generally cost about the same as or less than smartphones that do less useful work and only last half as long.Also, I value my time, especially as I get closer to my own end-of-life recycling point. Some people think they are saving resources by using old machines that can’t cope with dozens (or hundreds) of browser tabs, take ages to download bloated web pages, are slow to load programs or copy files or whatever. That’s a waste of human resources. I won’t waste mine.Sadly, even if your ThinkPad T510 runs Windows 10, it has a lot of limitations. These include the screen resolution (1366 x 768 pixels), slow USB 2 ports, the fairly slow drive speed (SATA 2 is 3Gbps not 6Gbps no M.2 slot), the lack of memory (8GB is the max), and the slow CPU.If you don’t want to spend a lot of money, put what you would have spent on your T510 towards a refurbished ThinkPad with a much more recent processor, such as the T440 or the X250.But anyone spending that sort of money could put off purchasing a new laptop for about a year or so, because dual-screen machines look like the coming thing. The Asus ZenBook Pro Duo UX581 is a stunning piece of work, while the 14in ZenBook Duo UX481 is a more portable, and more affordable, alternative. Last week, Microsoft previewed its own dual screen machines, the Surface Neo Windows laptop and the Surface Duo Android phone, due about a year from now.I’ve seen a lot of terrible machines, but the Surface Duo looks like the real deal. I expect all the leading manufacturers to launch their own versions, which will establish it as a new form factor, as happened with the Surface Pro. I wouldn’t be shocked to see a dual-screen iPad…Have you got a question?

While the film’s antique shop, Hobart and Blackwell, doesn’t actually exist, you’ll find the fabulous Manhattan Art and Antiques Center on 2nd and 56th. It’s a treasure trove of artefacts – from furniture (Hobie’s speciality) to porcelain, silver, fine art and more – spread over three floors. Furnish Green, on Broadway, is where to find mid-century modern pieces, art deco table lamps, and quirkier items such as classic comics.Without giving too much away, our young protagonist finds himself in the outskirts of Sin City, living with his father (Larry) and his father’s girlfriend (Xandra). There may not be much to do in the suburbs, but head to the Vegas Strip, where you can visit the Bellagio, one of Las Vegas’ most popular hotel casinos. Tourists flock to the impressive, daily fountain displays, but other draws include the magnificent collection of glass sculptures in the lobby by artist Dale Chihuly. If you want to try your luck at the tables, you can head over to the MGM Grand where you’ll also find 20 in-house bars and restaurants, including fine dining at Atelier de Joël Robuchon, and Wolfgang Puck’s Bar \u0026amp Grill. Theo and his new friend Boris clearly prefer steak – they steal one from a local supermarket. If steak is also your thing, make a beeline for somewhere classic such as the Golden Steer, one of the oldest restaurants in town, which serves up prime rib and filet mignon. Or treat yourself to melt-in-the-mouth Kobe beef at SW Steakhouse in the Wynn hotel. In search of a little culture in between the casinos? Centaur Art Galleries displays a range of works by artists as erse as Marc Chagall, Salvador Dali and Norman Rockwell.We won’t spoil how Theo Decker comes to be in a hotel in Amsterdam, but if the sight of the city’s signature canals appeals to you, there are several elegant waterside establishments worth checking into when you visit. Try the Pulitzer its bar was voted the best hotel bar in the city in 2019, with cocktails inspired by Ernest Hemingway. Or visit the Dylan, a stylish enclave in the hip, independent shopping area, the Nine Streets. The restaurant at the luxurious Waldorf Astoria Amsterdam is even named after the Pulitzer prize-winning book that the movie is based on the Goldfinch Brasserie serves elegant fare, including oysters and beef tartare.Chasers of The Goldfinch should be sure to visit some of the city’s magnificent museums and immerse themselves in the dramatic paintings adored by the film’s characters. The Rijksmuseum is possibly the greatest, where you’ll find Vermeer’s Milkmaid and Rembrandt’s The Night Watch. The Van Gogh Museum is home to Sunflowers, The Yellow House and several self-portraits. And, of course, you can visit the Mauritshuis in The Hague to see the title painting at the centre of the story.Based on the Pulitzer prize-winning novel, The Goldfinch is released nationwide on 27 September"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5555234efe6a4751ef29cd592adaf2385797382d/713_0_4200_2520/master/4200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=77d0c75794a4a38bb52e8e387f401080","title":"ansel elgort nicole kidman finn wolfhard whos who in the goldfinch","story":"Who do you cast in the movie adaptation of a Pulitzer prize-winning novel?

Mmm, tell me more. One that takes us inside a wealthy media dynasty flouting every moral and judicial law in order to consolidate power? Ok. Here’s the best bit – there are no likeable characters! Sounds about as much fun as eczema. So why do I, like so many others, currently love Succession more than any other show on TV?For a start, watching it feels like getting the gossip. Sons Roman and Kendall’s battle for dominance echoes that of James and Lachlan Murdoch, sons, of course, of Rupert Murdoch. Daughter Shiv is partly based on US executive Shari Redstone, who forced her ageing media tycoon father’s hand to take control of his company. The Trump name swirls around this world too, like flies on faeces. Stories of Donald refusing to pay his contractors are legion, just like the storyline in the show that resulted in a revenge raccoon being shoved up Logan Roy’s chimney (none of which is a euphemism). Though of course the character of Connor Roy - the moronic, incompetent, hooker-dependent son who thinks he can be president - is wholly rooted in fiction.Moreover, it is fun. Unreasonably so. Succession has a kind of spontaneous, semi-improvised anarchy in its DNA. Actors are given multiple takes to horse around, with writers lobbing in alternate comic lines. Jesse Armstrong’s opus is tightly written, though – at points almost a screwball comedy. ‘Screw-you-and-a-kick-in-the-balls’ comedy would be more on the money, in fact. The command of language is absolute, most often in the service of childish insults.We’ve seen this before in The Thick Of It – one of Armstrong’s previous shows – but it is stranger, more deeply rooted in character here. A recent episode featured “horse potatoes!” a cutting interjection from old-world matriarch Nan Pierce later the insult “mole-woman” becomes somehow flirtatious in the mouth of Roman Roy, Kieran Culkin’s compulsively rude, stupid-intuitive imp.His superb character portrait is one of many in the show, all of which get deeper this time around. Kendall, tied to his father by tragedy and blackmail in the first season finale, has become a lugubrious enforcer. He strides around acquiring then firing startups like Darth Vader in pinstripe. Their empathetic, liberal sister Shiv is a conniving chameleon, and her panicky husband Tom a social climber hampered by the lack of a spine. Best of all there’s Brian Cox as Logan Roy, mercurial CEO of media company Waystar Royco. Swinging from post-stroke confusion to boardroom satanism, he has more charisma to burn than there are trees in the Amazon. He was largely absent last season, an Ibsen patriarch haunting his offspring from offstage. This time round, he’s running the game.The show is so satisfying to watch, so casually masterful. The cinematography and score are biting and beautiful. The writing nails an extraordinary range of tones, each series commencing with a knockabout energy that tightens into tragedy by its close. But while it is very, very funny, what I love about the show is its cruelty. TV often trades in sentimentality: narrative sugar-pills, little engineered reversals of fortune that persuade us our own happy ending is around the corner. Succession isn’t about that. The only ‘journey’ we’re taken on here stops off at every circle of hell. I find it bracing. Like being slapped with the truth, not kissed by a lie.The Thick Of It showed us Westminster less as a parliament, more like a hard-play area for overgrown toddlers. Succession broadens the lens. Watching this wild west intersection of politics, media, tech and finance reminds us we are all collateral damage in a turf war between psychopaths. It’s Game of Thrones, but with real blood: ours."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/44618d821f6cf1dd1525b3c2f1e41b26e521fc34/110_0_1720_1032/master/1720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cf6b5910a53c48819e367b27501d3b37","title":"come on now why tv needs way more female orgasms big mouth fleabag gentleman jack","story":"Women masturbating on screen was once the stuff of taboo, but a new wave of refreshingly radical shows are closing TV’s pleasure gap at lastBeing introduced to Netflix’s Big Mouth has been such a thrill. My girlfriend’s 16-year-old daughter sold it to me, promising a talking vulva voiced by Kristen Wiig, a sassy hormone ‘monstress’ (Maya Rudolph) and a whole world of inclusive, body-positive bits about the messy reality of growing up. It is clever, pleasingly surreal and an absolute hoot. I was sold from the first watch.The new series focuses on the obstacle-strewn path young women tread when exploring their sexuality in adolescence. To me, it is the best yet. Watching episode six, How to Have an Orgasm, feels quietly revolutionary. In it, Jessi – a droll, whip-smart girl you wish had befriended you at school – learns how to come for the first time. Watching it feels new, exciting and radical because the business of female pleasure is rarely dealt with so centrally and without shame.It begins with Jessi’s vulva – a separate, talking entity – holding a microphone and hosting a game called “Do the Thing!” Connie (Rudolph’s hormone monstress) cheers her along with a rallying cry of “let’s touch our genitals” as she experiments under the covers with her hand. Pleasure is elusive. Her vulva offers continuous feedback: “That’s a little pokey, you’re not trying to squash a bug.”Turning to porn for inspiration, Jessi comes across a video called Bethany’s First Orgasm, in which Bethany uses a vibrator. Jessi goes to a shop with her friend Missy (Jenny Slate) to see what’s available. A talking Harry Potter vibrator falls off the shelf and buzzes across the floor. She doesn’t buy anything but the conversation between the two friends, in which Missy plainly states that “a glow worm and a bath faucet really gets the job done”, is striking, considering how much shame still exists around how women experience pleasure.Indeed, whether it’s humping a pillow, angling a shower head or using a vibrator, the idea of women young or mature putting their pleasure first has been historically controversial. I remember my heart sinking when Sally Draper was carted off to a psychotherapist for masturbating in Mad Men, but such was the pervasive attitude of the era. Women were pleasure-givers, not receivers or, if pleasure was received, it was incidental. Luckily, contemporary TV writers are now centralising female pleasure in both celebratory and matter-of-fact ways.Last year, Toni Collette claimed to be the first woman to have an orgasm on the BBC with Wanderlust a show that ruffled feathers with its scene involving her masturbating, screwed-up face and all, in front of her partner. We had Phoebe Waller-Bridge wanking over a Barack Obama speech on her laptop while her boyfriend sleeps in Fleabag. In Broad City, Ilana Glazer makes a meal out of masturbation with extensive ‘self-seduction’ rituals that include lighting candles, putting on lipstick and eating oysters. Bumping back to reality, Insecure saw Issa (Issa Rae) scramble round the house looking for batteries for her vibrator while, ironically, wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with the word ‘hump’.In Gentleman Jack, though nowhere near as racy a series as one hoped, it was quite thrilling to watch Suranne Jones’ Anne Lister timing and recording her lovers’ orgasms. I remember being taken aback watching the first series of Top of the Lake, in which Robyn’s boyfriend pulls her into a pub toilet to go down on her, because it is usually the other way around. It is telling that all these shows have female writers or directors.All these instances carry a little revolutionary spark because it has always seemed that when women come on-screen (if indeed they do) it is a quick, smooth and penis-centric affair involving penetration. This does not reflect most women’s realities. (At least two-thirds of women having heterosexual sex cannot come this way fingers, tongues and vibrators are much more effective.) We need to do more to educate young people about female pleasure. Jess Phillips was absolutely right when she said it was vital to discuss female pleasure in compulsory sex education to break down the culture of power imbalance between men and women. Heterosexual women orgasm less with a partner than any other demographic.The reasons for this orgasm gap are multifaceted. It is not down to biology, rather any combination of lack of anatomical knowledge, the indifference of a partner, not feeling safe enough to ‘let go’ or confident enough to self-advocate. Much of our confidence in sex will come from experimenting privately and, hopefully, being with a partner who wants to learn the language. We need to encourage this through awareness from a young age. As Phillips has said, we’re not teaching kids to masturbate – we’re talking to them about what they’re already doing.As of next year, the Department of Education is reforming sex education lessons for the first time in 17 years. Thank the lord. So much of the shame we carry as adults stems from what we experience when we’re pubescent. My mind would have exploded if I’d seen something as bold and right-on as Big Mouth at 14. If I were making the rules, I’d make watching this episode a compulsory part of the curriculum."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ead5572a39df954eddc8d2e835a09a8b70d7002f/0_0_3000_2000/master/3000.jpg?width=300\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ca1d78181c4f401a211715b7397707a2","title":"canada election doug ford ontario premier kryptonite conservatives","story":"Ontario premier, whose stock as an electoral asset has plummeted as the party struggles to build momentum outside their base, has been compared to TrumpWhen a brash businessman-turned-politician won a majority government in Canada’s most populous province in 2018, Conservatives in the country wondered if they could ride a similar populist wave to national victory in this year’s general election.In the weeks after his win, Conservative leaders flocked to his side, bathing in reflected electoral glory – and speculating that similar tactics might take them to victory over Justin Trudeau.But as the federal election draws near, Canada’s Conservatives have adopted a very different tactic: avoiding Ford at all costs.In less than a year, Ford’s stock as an electoral asset has plummeted: the Conservative leader, Andrew Scheer, hasn’t appeared at a single campaign event with the premier, even when canvassing in Ford’s own neighbourhood.Meanwhile, the Conservatives have struggled to build momentum outside their base. Scheer has failed to draw crowds to his campaign events, and has been forced to defend past remarks on same-sex marriage and abortion.And even after the prime minister became entangled in two scandals – ethics violations and images showing him in racist blackface, polls show Scheer and Trudeau locked in a dead heat. Conservative strategists worry that Scheer has failed to galvanize voters – and that Ford has become so toxic that he is hampering the party’s chances of forming a government.As recently as late spring, Conservatives were basking in poll numbers that put them comfortably ahead of Trudeau’s party.And in Ontario – where the Conservatives were overturning the legacy of an unpopular Liberal provincial government – the federal party was confident they had a strong ally.Ford was a relatively new face to mainstream conservative politics: his early political career was overshadowed by his younger brother Rob, the notorious former Toronto mayor who admitted smoking crack while in office.Despite several years as a city councillor, the elder Ford only entered provincial politics after his brother’s death, and his candidacy was initially viewed with skepticism.But his blunt language and appeal to “the common folk” soon drew comparisons with Donald Trump. And after he became premier of Ontario, Ford was quickly elevated to celebrity status within conservative circles, often appearing with Scheer at party events.“I’m putting the prime minister on notice,” Ford told a cheering crowd last year. “Justin Trudeau, you’re next.”In recent months, however, Ford has experienced a stunning reversal of fortune. His government has been dogged by protests over steep cuts to education, patronage scandals and looming labour strikes.“He came in really wanting to quickly undo a lot of the signature policies of the previous government,” said Omar Yan Khan, a political strategist in Toronto.Because of Ontario’s electoral weight, it is virtually impossible for a party to win a general election in Canada without success in the province.Conservatives have traditionally done well in the region’s rural areas, but the 21 October election is likely to hinge on the ethnically erse suburbs of Toronto, a suburban sprawl known as the 905 (for its dialing code).905 voters can be fickle: they granted the Conservatives a majority in 2011 – only to snatch it back in 2015, when Trudeau swept the province.Earlier this year, the Conservatives held a 10-point lead over the Liberals in Ontario – but that has now become a 10-point deficit, driven largely by Ford’s unpopularity, said Frank Graves, head of polling firm Ekos Research. “That’s an enormous transfer of seats from one side of the ledger to the other,” he said.The cold math of parliament suggests Scheer, who has no viable allies on the right, needs to win an outright majority to have any hope of forming a government.Anything short of this allows Trudeau to strike deals with left-of-centre parties to stay in power.“Ontario is now turning into something of a political proxy war,” said Shachi Kurl, executive director at Angus Reid. “And Scheer is dealing with the Ford factor, which is a drag on the Conservative’s political fortunes.”Before Trudeau swept to power in 2015, the Conservatives governed Canada for nearly a decade and they retain immense support in rural areas and the western heartlands of the country’s oil industry.But in an election taking place amid a climate emergency and rising income inequality, the party’s pledge to quash carbon pricing legislation and cut taxes have not resonated with voters. Meanwhile, Scheer, who narrowly won control of the party in 2017, has struggled to carve out a distinct identity, lacking the charisma – and name recognition of Trudeau.Eager to capitalize on Conservative weaknesses in Ontario, Trudeau has taken to mentioning Ford every at every opportunity – so much so that at the last leaders’ debate on Monday, Scheer accused the prime minister of being “oddly obsessed with provincial politics”.But in a tacit admission that Ford is electoral kryptonite, the Conservatives recently took the unprecedented step of parachuting in a different Conservative premier to campaign in Ontario. Over the weekend, the Alberta premier, Jason Kenney, toured the south of the province, stumping for Scheer. Ford was nowhere to be seen."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/117a9050bf5363417d6b382ee386446a78957c5a/0_23_4780_2868/master/4780.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3c52b7dd5c2a2a80c55ada1ef6464d09","title":"goldsmiths university to tackle racism after damning report","story":"Quarter of black and minority ethnic students say they have faced racism from white staff or peers Senior managers at Goldsmiths, University of London, have admitted that its record of addressing racism is unacceptable after a damning report found black and minority ethnic students feel victimised and unsafe on its campus.One black female student described how she was “fetishised” and sexually harassed due to her ethnicity by a member of staff, who has since been dismissed. Other respondents reported how white students glamorised the use of the n-word, using it as a greeting. The report, by the race equality specialist Sofia Akel, warned this put black students in particular “at risk of entering racially charged environments and subject to immense discomfort”.Many respondents described a “racial battleground” in lectures, with their white peers’ racism going unchallenged by white lecturers, who would also dismiss or suppress the voices of BME students and make racist assumptions about their knowledge and academic abilities.The study also highlighted Islamophobia on campus, with several female Muslim students reporting being afraid to wear their veil due to fear of reprisals for being wrongly perceived as extremists.Prof Elisabeth Hill, Goldsmiths’ deputy warden, said: “These findings are simply unacceptable and paint a clear picture, which cannot be ignored. This report demands a response from everyone at Goldsmiths and illustrates the amount of work we must all undertake to address these vital matters.”She said work was underway to meet the recommendations of the report, which included mandatory race-awareness training for staff, a review of complaints procedures and improving the number of BME senior managers.The report follows an occupation at the university by Goldsmiths Anti-Racist Action protesters, which ended in July after senior managers agreed to meet their demand for a series of measures to tackle institutional racism at Goldsmiths.Goldsmiths has previously appointed Dr Nicola Rollock to address the BME attainment gap at the university. She said: “What’s really striking about this report is that BME students are coming to an institution that looks mixed and edgy and radical but they are having to negotiate, fight and strategise every step of the way to deal with racism. This is not just happening in their dealings with white students but with white lecturers too. This report is damning but I’m struck by the preparedness of senior managers to acknowledge they’re not getting it right.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d44beee466cf04ae0939e90aa925df6ee5d61e1/0_238_3313_1986/master/3313.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4b891891fe5221c53cfc74b86a56478e","title":"homemade invisible ink earns ninja student an a for half an essay","story":"Professor was so impressed with Eimi Haga’s creativity, he didn’t reveal whole textA Japanese student aced an assignment on ninja culture by making her own invisible ink from soya beans in a stealthy move that impressed her professor.Eimi Haga, a member of Mie University’s ninja club, submitted an essay about the assassins with a message attached instructing the professor to heat it before reading.“I knew that I needed to take it home and put it above a stove,” said Yuji Yamada, who teaches Japanese history, including ninja culture. “She replicated what is written in records of ninja art. She strived to prove what was written actually works and went through a trial-and-error process. I was impressed.”When the characters of Haga’s essay revealed themselves in the heat, Yamada – who had promised his students extra marks for creativity – decided to award her an A.Haga, 19, made the ink by soaking soya beans overnight and then squeezing them into a paste. She said she had tested three different kinds of paper for the optimum effect.“If the paper is too thin, it burns when heated. If it’s too thick, it doesn’t absorb the ink very well,” she said. “I usually use pens and PC to write things. It’s been a while since I took a brush to write with an invisible ink.”Yamada said reports filed as scrolls or folded into throwing stars were the most creative he had seen from students until now. “We discussed the use of invisible ink but I was amazed that someone actually used it,” he said, adding that he didn’t read the entire paper because he wanted to keep some of Haga’s work invisible.“By learning about ninja … we can apply their knowledge and ways to modern society,” Yamada said.Ninjas were agents revered for their ability to combine stealth and violence in the service of their samurai masters during the “warring states” period in Japan from the mid-15th century."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Cork, Dublin South Central, Meath-Westmeath, Galway and Limerick face changeEamon Ryan suggests that a car-sharing scheme could operate in Irish villagesJoint statement issued by Taoiseach and prime minister after meeting in EnglandMan with suspected bowel cancer is \u0026lsquoextraordinarily vulnerable\u0026rsquo, court toldTraveller group says it is \u0026lsquoextremely relieved\u0026rsquo incident in D\u0026uacuten Laoghaire was not worseEamonn Quinlivan (71) involved with Irish Red Cross and Order of MaltaI BIKE campaign claim Government is not doing enough to support cycling and make it viable optionOrders include a permanent injunction preventing defendants from trespassing on siteLuxurious Thornton Manor in Wirral described as a \u0026lsquotruly unique\u0026rsquo wedding venueT\u0026aacutenaiste insists he was not personally aware of issue until this weekArmy bomb squad defused devices in Edenderry during two hour operationArrests as Extinction Rebellion activists target London City airportPlans to roughly double size of west Clare resort include new ballroomfunction room and 53 more holiday homesCommittee chair says tax should have been used to provide alternatives to coal and turfBrexit changed attitude and culture in Ireland around issue, says Sean Kelly MEPNational Transport Authority says Dublin Bus will pay \u0026euro280k for failure to operate as scheduledAlarm was raised in west Cork last night when man (20s) failed to return homeOmbudsman steps in to help nuns who cared for disadvantaged in Portugal for decadesDublin City Council official gave \u0026euro1,200 payments from contractor to criminal, Cab toldOffice of Public Works at loggerheads with builder JJ Rhatigan over \u0026euro3m extra charge"},{"url":null,"title":"brexit a day in the life of an irish border crossing","story":"Ambrose “Bo” McGurgan is checking the tyres on his six-axle lorry at the Applegreen truck stop near Castlebellingham, Co Louth, south of the Irish Border. It is the only check he will undergo before crossing over into Northern Ireland.From the end of this month all that could change with the UK’s exit from the EU on October 31st, the date British prime minister Boris Johnson wants Brexit to happen.McGurgan fears the return of the dreaded customs checks of more than a quarter century ago. He remembers the hard border when 300 or 400 trucks could be parked up for hours awaiting customs clearance.“It will be going back to square one, like in the 70s. It would be a disaster. You could be sitting all day in Dundalk waiting to get cleared,” he tells The .It is 11am on a Monday and the Armagh man has been working for six hours and has already lifted and “tipped” a trailer in Dublin and is heading across the Border for another delivery in Newtownards, Co Down.He is hauling a mixed load of food and industrial goods – sauces and engineering bolts – but requires no paperwork as he drives, unhindered, across an open border between two jurisdictions currently within the EU. A return to the border of the past, that McGurgan waited hours to cross. is very real again.Johnson’s government proposed to the EU last week to replace the contentious backstop guarantee to avoid a hard Irish border with a plan to impose a new customs border on the island of Ireland.The deluge of paperwork, the queues of lorries, the hours-long delays, the potential targeting of customs officers by people upset with the return of a visible border “would be a disaster,” says McGurgan.“People don’t realise how bad it is going to be. We, the older generation, we have done it all. We know how bad it is. There will be customs men shot. There will be. Everybody is fighting for a loaf,” he said.McGurgan’s truck was one of 6,639 goods vehicles to cross the Border on the A1 dual-carriageway between Dublin and Belfast last Monday. This is the busiest crossing on the Border between the Republic and Northern Ireland. Traffic counters operated by Transport Infrastructure Ireland, the agency monitoring the State’s roads, show that on average five goods vehicles crossed this point of the Border every minute on Monday.This is where the impact of the UK leaving without a deal has the potential to cause the most complications.Next to McGurgan’s truck is fellow haulier Brendan McParland, also a veteran Border-crosser. He is heading to Dungannon, Co Tyrone, with a load of peat after dropping plasterboard in Athy, Co Kildare.He usually hauls European steel, landed at Warrenpoint in Co Down, across the Border to Dublin, Kilkenny or Carlow. Normally he can complete two return runs to Dublin in one day from Warrenpoint.“If the Border was to come, you couldn’t guarantee you would even get one load done,” he said, munching on a sandwich in the cab of his lorry.Michael Harbinson is one of several lorry drivers stopped at Applegreen transporting Coca-Cola products from its manufacturing facility in Knockmore Hill outside Belfast to customers in the Republic.He believes an all-island economic unit is the way to avoid a hard Border. Not everyone wants this when it comes to both customs and EU single market rules north and south. The DUP also wants Northern Ireland to be able to vote to opt in to an all-island zone covering EU single market rules for goods every four years.“If the North takes a deal still tied with the South, it is the best of both worlds. It is the DUP who is ruining it. They just stand firm in their stance,” said Harbinson.At the last junction before the southern M1-N1 crosses the Border and turns into the northern A1 there is a fuel service station. It lies between Jonesborough, Co Armagh, and Carrickcarnan, Co Louth.Colin Byrne, one of the pump attendants of the junction 20 service station, has no clue how the UK and EU would manage this Border if Britain leaves without a deal.“That’s the six million dollar question. Sure how many back roads are there across the Border. It is not doable, simply not doable,” he said.Johnson has ruled out customs checks at or near the Border but has not specified in his plan where “designated locations” for some required checks might be. Byrne offers a foretaste of how checks might work: “every once in a while,” he says, the Garda and customs check vehicles at the southbound exit 18 off the M1 into Dundalk. “If you saw the mayhem that that causes,” he said.On the bridge over the A1 dual-carriageway next to the Carrickdale Hotel there is a constant drone of noise as an “artic” or smaller “rigid” lorry or a light goods vehicle is always coming or going.This is the north-south White Van Man highway.Between 5am and 7pm last Monday – the busiest period of the day – 5,722 goods vehicles cross the Border. That is one goods vehicle every eight seconds. This traffic is split 50:50 in either direction.“It shows trade is equally balanced going in either direction,” said Séamus Leheny, policy manager of the Freight Transport Association, speaking loudly to be heard over the hum of traffic on the bridge.“It is the artery of trade on the island of Ireland. It connects the two largest cities and to have any type of barrier on this, or ersions, or checks, it would inhabit trade and growth economically on either side of the Border here.”Interrupting the flow of traffic here would have a huge impact, he says lorries would “soon stack up” and could be waiting hours if they had to have paperwork inspected or their load physically inspected.The stakes on finding a fix to the Brexit-Border conundrum are high. Leheny explains that five times as much freight crosses the Irish Border than moves between Northern Ireland and Britain, the North’s biggest market, but it is lower in value because it is mostly ingredients and components, and not completed products.“What we make in Northern Ireland, it is comprised of bits and pieces sourced from every corner of the island of Ireland. If we have a hard border, the existence of those products that we make in Northern Ireland are jeopardised because you would have delays, tariffs and the sanitary controls as well,” he said.In the retail game, this Border crossing is an essential supply chain route for multinationals. Northern Ireland supermarkets are stocked from distribution centres in the Republic, and vice versa. Then there are the food products made with ingredients coming from both north and south of the Border.Aodhán Michael Connolly, director of Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, says that a supermarket chicken salad sandwich can have ingredients involving six border movements (north-south and east-west, between the North and Britain), while “the humble cottage pie” can have eight, including a cheese topping produced and processed on different sides of the Border. Each movement involves tariffs so the overall costs could be huge.“That border crossing isn’t just to move goods A to B. It is a lifeline to the supply chain and to those small and medium-sized enterprises right down to the farmers who are in our supply chain,” he said. “If there isn’t frictionless movement across that border, each of those costs will have to go down the supply chain and it is going to make things tougher for the Northern Ireland consumer.”Connolly sees Johnson’s plan as “unworkable” if it is the final deal because a customs border would amount to a hard border, but it is “progress” to open negotiations because it includes an all-island zone for goods.Driving one of his nine trucks across the Border on the A1, Declan Trainor, a cattle and goods haulier, believes the island of Ireland should be “treated as a whole and as one island”.He has no idea how the Border, just a few hundred metres from his office at Carrickcarnan, will look on November 1st, or how he will be able to continue transporting tiles from mainland Europe to Northern Ireland.“It is the unknown. That is the scary part. The Government hasn’t really said how to prepare for it. They are only guessing themselves now so how are you supposed to prepare?” he said. “You don’t know whether it is a dance you are going to or a war. Sure how do you dress for it?”Speaking a few days later, Trainor says Johnson’s “two borders for four years” proposal has left him even more confused. It has also made people who rely on free trade and free movement of goods across the Border “desperate,” he said.“Whatever concern we had, we are more concerned now,” he said.How busy is the M1A1\u0026nbspcrossing?The Border crossing on the M1 motorwayA1 dual-carriageway between Dublin and Belfast is the busiest thoroughfare along the 499-kilometre open frontier between the Republic and Northern Ireland.The four-lane crossing between Newry and Dundalk is about five times busier than the next busiest crossing over the Blackwater river between Emyvale, Co Monaghan, and Aughnacloy, Co Tyrone, based on traffic figures counted daily by Transport Infrastructure Ireland, the State agency that manages the Irish road network.The agency uses a system of counters under the surface of strategically important roads across the country that can differentiate vehicles by wheel axle lengths. This allows the agency to gather data and analyse the volume of traffic and type of vehicles passing on the road for every hour of every day.The counter at Junction 20 on the A1 at Ravensdale between Jonesborough, Co Armagh, and Carrickcarnan, Co Louth, showed that Monday, September 30th – a month before the UK’s scheduled exit from the EU – was a typically busy day for traffic for this major transport route on the island of Ireland.Some 25,301 vehicles crossed the Border over the 24-hour period: 18,175 cars, 6,639 goods vehicles (including the heaviest articulated lorries), 318 buses and 24 motorbikes. That means 17 vehicles crossed the Border on average every minute last Monday. One goods vehicle crossed the Border every 12 seconds.Hauliers, traders and businesses along the Border say any kind of delays stopping traffic on this corridor after Brexit would quickly result in heavy congestion and tailbacks.The busiest times of day are during the morning rush-hour between 8am and 9am, when traffic volumes peaked at 1,935 vehicles, and the late afternoon peak between 4pm and 5pm at 1,897 vehicles.The bulk of the traffic crosses the Border between the hours of 7am and 7pm when 19,625 vehicles were counted last Monday, or on average of 1,635 an hour.The traffic is evenly split between northbound and southbound vehicles. However, more than twice as many goods vehicles head southbound between 5am and 9am – making deliveries to the Republic or transporting goods to Dublin Port in time to make the 8am ferry departures to England out of Dublin Port.This route is a critical artery for goods travelling from Northern Ireland south into the Republic. Some 3,425 goods vehicles crossed the Border heading south into the Republic last Monday.This worked out an average of 143 per hour. In other words, one goods vehicle crossed the Border into the Republic on the main Dublin-Belfast road every 25 seconds last Monday.To put this in a national context, this part of the A1 is almost as busy or busier every day than the main Dublin to Galway M4 road at Kinnegad (26,400 vehicles on average a day), the main Dublin to Cork M7 road at Portlaoise (25,700 vehicles) and than the main Dublin to Wexford M11 road at Arklow (22,800 vehicles).Cross-Border workersTen minutes drive south of the Border, dozens of parked cars – nearly all Northern Irish-registered vehicles – line either side of the road off Junction 17 of the M1 near Dundalk in Co Louth.They belong to Northern Irish tradesmen, mostly from across the Border in south Armagh, who park and car-pool into the Republic for work. They are mostly construction works, plumbers and electricians.“There are thousands of people going to and from work every day, crossing the Border every couple of minutes. There are thousands and thousands of guys down south working and Dublin is most of where the work is,” said Neil Byrne, a plumber from Mullaghbane near Forkhill.The Armagh man usually arrives at around 5.50am to park his car and catch his lift to Dublin. He has worked “all over the south” including in Kildare and Athlone.Byrne says he and his fellow commuters to the Republic are concerned about a crash-out Brexit and the return of a hard border resulting in hours and hours of traffic delays crossing the Border.He doesn’t believe a hard border would work it does not make sense to have one, he says. “It is one small country in my opinion: it doesn’t matter whether you are north or south, Ireland is Ireland and you have to get to your work regardless,” he said.Delays and traffic jams are not his only worry.“If there’s a Border, it has the whole issue of the Troubles starting again because in my own personal opinion it is going to happen the exact same way it did back then: customs guys get attacked, then there is a police presence, then they get attacked and then there is a military presence,” he said. “It doesn’t take much to set it off.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Most of our cars are sitting in a car park for 95 per cent of the time.’. Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollinsGreen Party leader Eamon Ryan has suggested that a village of 300 people needs just 30 cars to operate.He believes the Government should incentivise car-sharing, and move towards a situation where a village would have a set amount of cars and there “would always be one available” through a collection and drop-off system.“We don’t all need to own a car. Most of our cars are sitting in a car park for 95 per cent of the time,” he said. “It’s only a short walk down to pick it up. You could cycle down to the local collection point.”Mr Ryan made his comments on Virgin Media’s Ireland AM programme where it was met by some scepticism by Donegal-born presenter Ciara Doherty. “On country roads at 8am in the morning, really?”He responded: “There are way we can do things that are better for the environment and better for our pocket. It is happening in other countries of the world. “It’s not rocket science. It’s using innovation to make a change for the better so you don’t spend money on something that is sitting idle for 95 per cent of the time.”He predicted that rural Ireland would embrace electric cars quicker than urban Ireland because it was easier to charge a vehicle if you lived in a detached house than in a terrace.“If you are a terraced house in the middle of the street it’s hard to get electricity from one of those houses. “The box outside with the ESB poll has a 15 volt capacity constraint. That constraint does not apply in rural Ireland.”Electric vehicles are “better cars. They don’t break down as much. They are cleaner, cheaper cars”, he added."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4046266.1570702251!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"kurdish man in ireland my dad is 85 last night until 1am he was packing his luggage","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA woman carries her belongings over her head as she flees  Syria’s northeastern town of Ras al-Ain   on October 9th. Photograph: Delil SouleimanAFPGettyA Kurdish man living in Ireland has said his elderly father has packed his bags and is planning to leave his home in northern Syria after Turkey began its military incursion into the region on Wednesday.Turkish ground troops crossed the border into northeast Syria last night following hours of heavy shelling of border towns. The offensive began after US President Donald Trump ordered the withdrawal of the approximately 1,000 American troops stationed in the region, following a phonecall with Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan.Ahmad Bekkî, originally from Kobanî, northern Syria has been living in Ireland for over ten years with his wife and their children.“My dad is 85 years of age. Last night, until 1am, he was packing his luggage. He has all his luggage and baggage in front of the main door and he doesn’t know when he’s going to head out of the city,” he said.“My two brothers already left. They saw the smoke and the dark clouds in the sky of city so they have to leave. My dad is an old man and he doesn’t want to leave until right up until the last moment.“Everyone is certain that a genocide is going to happen by Turkish troops. Turkish troops invaded part of northern Syria before, a city that was 99 per cent Kurds. They took their properties, put them in jails, abused them. We know this is going to happen.”Mr Bekkî said members of the Kurdish community in Ireland remain “positive” and is keeping in contact with family members in northern Syria.“Most of them are positive. Our history, especially in the last century, we have faced many, many massacres. We’ve been in this situation, we’ve got used to it. We’ve been treated badly, we knew that Mr Trump would withdraw. We knew this time was going to come.”Announcing the operation, code-named Peace Spring, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Turkey’s mission was to “prevent the creation of a terror corridor across our southern border, and to bring peace to the area”.Mr Erdogan, who spoke by phone to Russian president Vladimir Putin before the invasion, wants to establish what he terms a “safe zone” along Syria’s border with Turkey.It is expected the Turkish military may ultimately lay siege to the border towns of Kobanî, Tal Abyad and Ras al-Ayn.Read full coverage of events here"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons october 2019","story":"To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2018 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to telegraphmattprints or call 0191 603 0178.Thursday afternoon news briefing: Boris Johnson and Leo Varadkar \u0026#39see a pathway to a possible deal\u0026#39 after talks in the WirralComment: Europe\u0026#39s failure to act on captured Isil fighters is creating even greater challengesUkraine president denies Trump \u0026#39blackmailed\u0026#39 him to investigate BidenComment: Brexit will be the casualty of another bitter Tory civil war\tUnknown British soldiers finally laid to rest more than 100 years since they died after crowdfunded project recovers their bodies London\u0026#39s \u0026#39poisoned lungs\u0026#39 revealed: survey shows quarter of green spaces are now dangerously pollutedTiger to be fitted with prosthetic paw in world first operationComment: A conditional Brexit extension is the Eurocrats\u0026#39 latest slippery deflection tactic\tNicola Sturgeon praises \u0026#39excellent\u0026#39 Lord Provost who spent £8,000 of public money on clothes and shoesJeremy Corbyn refuses to commit to immediate election if Boris Johnson secures Brexit extensionArmy sergeant demoted after he punched and twisted the nipples of \u0026#39raw recruits\u0026#39 to toughen them up, tribunal hears  Blind Paralympian climbs onto roof of British Airways plane in Extinction Rebellion protests at London City AirportWhat do Extinction Rebellion want from their protests - and where in London are they taking place?Spice epidemic in jails exposed as prisoner dies after setting himself on fire while high on drugSpice epidemic in jails exposed as prisoner dies after setting himself on fire while high on drugInside al-Hol, the \u0026#39toxic\u0026#39 Isil prison camp where radicalised women have taken controlDenmark to impose controls at Swedish border amid crime waveEngland \u0026#39may well end up with mandatory vaccines\u0026#39 says top doctorAustralian state proposes two-year prison sentence for possession of Extinction Rebellion \u0026#39human lock\u0026#39Turkey\u0026#39s Erdogan threatens to send \u0026#39millions\u0026#39 of refugees to Europe if EU calls Syria offensive \u0026#39invasion\u0026#39We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/10/10/tim-cook.jpg","title":"apple glasses ar augmented reality iphone release date","story":"Subscribe nowSubscribe NowSubscribe NowSubscribe NowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Tech company will release glasses with third-party brands, report claimsApple is set to release a pair of glasses soon, according to a major new report.The company is gearing up to unveil the smart eyewear early next year. It will work with third-party companies to create glasses that take information from the iPhone and display it over people\u0027s eyes, according to various rumours.That is according to a new report from Apple analyst Ming-chi Kuo, who regularly accurately revealed information about forthcoming products from the company.Apple has long been rumoured to be working on an augmented reality headset or glasses, which would allow information to be projected in front of a person\u0027s eyes. The exact design has not been revealed, and it is still unclear whether they will work like normal eyeglasses or something like a virtual reality headset.Whatever form the glasses arrive in, they will come in early 2020, Mr Kuo said in a report first published in Chinese\u0026nbspand unearthed by 9to5mac. That could mean that it is unveiled as soon as this year, since Apple has often introduced new devices months before they actually arrive.Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Google celebrates its 21st birthday on September 27.

Of the 79p\u0026nbsppaid by shoppers for a\u0026nbsp100g\u0026nbsppack of black Assam tea in the UK, 49p goes to supermarkets and tea brands, 27p\u0026nbspto other firms such as packaging providers, while tea pickers collectively receive 3p. If workers on tea estates in Assam received just 5p\u0026nbspmore of the retail price, they could be paid a living wage of 330 rupees (£3.80) per day.Aldi, Morrisons, Sainsbury’s and Tesco confirmed to Oxfam that they source their own-brand tea from companies whose suppliers include the estates visited in Assam.As for the fruit farms in Brazil, Lidl and\u0026nbspSainsbury’s confirmed they source produce from the farms, either directly or through importers, while Tesco and Morrisons said they\u0026nbsppreviously did so.When contacted by Oxfam, Asda owner Walmart\u0026nbspdeclined to say whether it has links to the tea estates or the fruit farms.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We share the values behind Oxfam’s campaign and are in regular dialogue with them.”Sainsbury’s declined to comment, pointing instead to a statement issued by the British Retail Consortium (BRC) on behalf of its members.\u0026nbsp“Supermarkets in the UK are spearheading actions aimed at improving the lives of the millions of people across the globe who contribute to the retail supply chain. Our members are working hard to address existing injustices and continue to collaborate internationally with NGOs, business groups and government on this vital issue,” said\u0026nbspPeter Andrews, head of sustainability at the BRC.A Tesco spokesperson said: “We are a member of the Ethical Tea Partnership, committed to improving the lives of tea workers and ensuring minimum working conditions. But we know there is always more to do and we are working collaboratively with NGOs, trade unions and others to improve wages in the key produce, tea and clothing sectors and ensure working conditions are fair.”According to Oxfam, Tesco is doing most to protect human rights in its supply chain, although all six supermarkets still have a long way to go.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

You can change the order in which they appear, and even hide the ones you never use, to speed up your photo-sharing process. On the filters page, scroll to the end, tap Manage, then drag and drop the ones you want to reorder, and un-check the ones you want to hide. Instagram controversially ditched its reverse-chronological order feed for a new order determined by an algorithm, making it easy to completely miss some posts. To make sure you never miss a certain somebody’s updates, you can set up notification for them by visiting their profile, tapping the three dots in the top right-hand corner and selecting Turn On Post Notifications.If you’re worried about how much of your mobile data Instagram saps, you can limit it by sacrificing the speed at which the photos and videos in your feed load. Go to your profile, tap the three dots in the top right corner, open Cellular Data Use and choose Use Less Data.411 See your LikesIt’s easy to lose track of your friends’ old posts on Instagram, but if you know you Liked it, you’ll be able to track it down easily.

Take a look at everything you’ve bookmarked by tapping the same icon that sits near the top of your profile.Everyone knows you can expand the reach of your posts by using a number of relevant hashtags, but what those are aren’t always glaringly obvious. You can easily find the right ones for you by typing a keyword into Instagram’s search bar, selecting a hashtag from the list and swiping along the Related row that appears at the top of the screen.611 Clear your search historyWhatever your reasons are, you can clear your recent searches by going to your profile, hitting the three dots in the top right and selecting Clear Search History. To go a step further and hide your Suggested searches too, go to the search page, tap and hold the account you want to hide, and choose Hide from the pop-up window.Tagged photos on Instagram aren’t as prominent as they are on Facebook, but anyone can still browse through other people’s pictures of you by visiting your profile and tapping the photo of you icon.

Go to your profile, tap the three dots, open Two-Factor Authentication and toggle it on.911 Share lots at onceIf you want to upload a bunch of related pictures and videos without flooding everyone else’s feed, you can shared them all as one post. Hit the + icon, select Gallery, choose Select Multiple, pick out up to 10 of the pictures and clips you want, tap Next and reorder them by dragging and dropping.Instagram Stories has been a massive hit since it came out last year, but you might not know that you can record Stories clips without having to hold one of your digits on the record key. On the Stores screen, just swipe through the options at the bottom until you get to Hands-Free.

The trick that Rooney says she used to find out who had been passing on information from her private posts\u0026nbsprelies on a feature specific to Instagram stories, and not found on most other social platforms. When navigating through posts, you are not simply looking at the pictures and videos people shared – they\u0027re also looking at you, looking at their posts.Coleen Rooney accuses Rebekah Vardy of leaking her stories to The SunWhen someone posts an Instagram story, they can see a full list of the accounts that have viewed that story. Since it is not possible to look at stories unless a user is logged in, there is no way to see any post without being logged in.What\u0027s more, those stories can be locked down, ensuring that only specific people can see them. If an account is private – as Rooney says hers was – then someone has to request to follow it that means that only approved people can see stories or feed posts on a private account.Once someone is following an account – whether\u0026nbspit is private or public – people can also be blocked from seeing posts on a story. That means that people must be approved and also not blocked to see a post, which can be used to give very precise\u0026nbspcontrol over who is looking at Instagram stories.Rooney says she used this feature to find out who had been taking information from her posts. She says that she uploaded stories but restricted them so that they could only be seen by one specific account – Vardy\u0027s, she claims – allowing her to know where any information had come from.What\u0027s more, despite the fact that Instagram is unusually transparent about who has been interacting with stories, it importantly does not tell people who else has been viewing a story. That means there is no way to know if you are the only person who has seen a specific post, and therefore no way to know if only you know certain information.In short, there are three particular features of Instagram that make such a claim possible. It allows you to shut down your account so that only approved people can see it it lets you see who viewed your stories\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspyou can block specific people from doing so.When combined, those three settings can be used as a powerful trick to allow people to see information without knowing that only they are seeing it.It is rare that this\u0026nbspwill be used to work out who is passing on personal information to newspapers. But it could expose people in a variety of other, more pedestrian ways – and do so without the person using it even knowing.Similar features do exist on other platforms. Snapchat, which had the stories features before Instagram, also allows people to see who has been looking at their stories, and even when someone screengrabs one LinkedIn informs users when somebody has been looking at their profile.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Show all 34Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.134 34. Ciaran Hinds as Steppenwolf (Justice League)We were so distracted by the bad jokes and Henry Cavill’s computer generated upper lip that it’s easy to forget that the Justice League faced off against a horned CGI muscle man voiced by Ciaran Hinds. So bad it effectively got everyone but Gal Gadot dumped from the franchise. (AW)234 33. Mark Pillow as Nuclear Man (Superman IV: The Quest for Peace)Presumably hired because fellow “foreign, unconvincing muscle-man” Dolph Lundgren wasn’t available, Mark Pillow made for one of the worst DC movie villains. To be fair to him, Superman IV: The Quest for Peace is a famously abysmal film, but his Nuclear Man – a villain so blandly nefarious even his name feels like it came about via 30 seconds of brainstorming – doesn’t help matters. (AW)334 32. Cara Delevingne as EnchantressJune Moone (Suicide Squad)It’s not been plain sailing swapping the catwalk for the big screen for this aristocratic supermodel-turned-actor, specifically with her role in this puerile comic book film. She plays June Moone, an archeological boffin transformed into a bikini-clad witch by some haunted dust. The film got devastatingly bad reviews, despite doing well at the box office. It may well be a performance Delevingne would like to forget. (CC)434 31. David Thewlis as Ares (Wonder Woman)The one area of Wonder Woman we don’t like to talk about is its villain, as his appearance in the film’s final act turns a smart and funny movie into one just like all the others – namely with two superpowered beings throwing things at each other. (AW)534 30. Patrick Wilson as Ocean Master (Aquaman)It was always going to be tricky to make much of an impression in a movie in which Amber Heard, sporting an enormous red wig, catapults her way into underwater battle riding a dolphin. Which might explain why Patrick Wilson, playing Aquaman’s dastardly half-brother Orm, has fallen so rapidly out of memory. (AW)634 29. Faye Dunaway as Selena (Supergirl)The doomed Supergirl movie is a living testament to how badly Mommie Dearest impacted the career of Faye Dunaway, with her turn as a witchy supervillain with a dangerous love spell at her disposal secretly the nadir of her Eighties career. She may nail a certain level of camp here, whether deliberate or not, but Dunaway is certainly no good – it’s no surprise she was awarded a Razzie for her performance. (AW)734 28. Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor (Superman Returns)A big gulp in 2019 for obvious reasons, but also pretty regretful because it\u0027s an incredibly dull performance from an actor who was, whether we like to admit it or not, masterful at playing villains in his prime. Here, however, Spacey is just a snooze. (AW)834 27. Yahya Abdul-Mahteen III as Black Manta (Aquaman)About as threatening as a Power Rangers villain and just as stupid-looking, Aquaman\u0027s recurring nemesis is more a perpetual irritant than someone particularly enjoyable to watch. (AW)934 26. Liam Neeson as Ra\u0027s al Ghul (Batman Begins)Ra\u0027s al Ghul, or The Demon\u0027s Head in Arabic, jumped on the climate activism bandwagon nice and early. For him, the human race is a cancer poisoning the Earth, and he wants to eliminate people to save the world from environmental disaster. Neeson played the villain so well because he really believed in him. “It was quite a good argument he comes up with,” the actor said. Terrifying. (EH)1034 25. Arnold Schwarzenegger as Mr Freeze (Batman \u0026amp Robin)Arnold Schwarzenegger wasn\u0027t so much playing Mr Freeze in Batman \u0026amp Robin as he was The Pun King, few surviving his merciless deployment of woeful gags. Schwarzenegger is by no means good here, but he\u0027s absolutely captivating nonetheless. (AW)1134 24. Sharon Stone as Laurel Hedare (Catwoman)Only one of the worst DC villains because her evil plot was to poison Gotham City via killer face cream, Laurel Hedare at least allowed Sharon Stone to be devious, slinky and cartoonish for the first time since Basic Instinct. It\u0027s a very minor victory, though. (AW)1234 23. Jared Leto as Joker (Suicide Squad)It would be easy to pity Jared Leto, who was always going to be compared to the late Heath Ledger’s transcendent portrayal of the Joker in Christopher Nolan’s The Dark Knight, if it weren’t for how much hype he built up before Suicide Squad was even released. There were the tattoos, his green hair, a shiny grill in his mouth, and a ludicrous number of articles about his supposed bad behaviour on set. So it was downright embarrassing when it turned out Joker wasn’t even the lead villain in the movie, and instead just an annoyance who turns up to mock the lead cast every now and then. (RO)1334 22. Marion Cotillard as Miranda Tate (The Dark Knight Rises)Although many will purely remember Cotillard’s performance in The Dark Knight Rises for that awfully awkward death scene, she was great in the rest of the movie. She played one of Batman’s most interesting female adversaries with a slyness and a deception that was mysteriously alluring and effective. (EH)1434 21. Michael Shannon as General Zod (Man of Steel)The kind of role Shannon could play in his sleep, his General Zod is more angsty and human than his live-action predecessors playing the same character, but harmed by the relentlessly dank surroundings of Zack Snyder’s film. He’s also saddled with the most unflattering haircut in all of DC movie history, which couldn’t have helped. (AW)1534 20. Tom Hardy as Bane (The Dark Knight Rises)1634 19. Burgess Meredith as The Penguin (Batman 1966)Entirely unsubtle work from Meredith here, the actor grinding his teeth and chewing on the end of a large, thin cigarette to emphasise the Penguin’s dastardly villainy. But it’s a lot of fun to behold nonetheless. (AW)1734 18. Gene Hackman as Lex Luthor (Superman)The Oscar-winning actor was easily the most fun incarnation of Lex Luthor when he was cast in the 1978 Superman. As the hero’s arch nemesis, his light-hearted and theatrical portrayal came across as more comical than menacing. But despite the fact it was hard to take him as a serious threat, he was still a compelling villain to watch. He reprised the role in Superman II and Superman IV: The Quest for Peace. (CC)1834 17. Parker Posey as Kitty Kowalski (Superman Returns)One of the few bright spots in an otherwise drab and rapidly forgotten Superman reboot, Parker Posey very much plays to type here. But it\u0027s such a delicious, mischievous performance, all eccentricity and barely-concealed madness, that it\u0027s not remotely a problem. (AW)1934 16. Joaquin Phoenix as Joker (Joker)The role that, for better and for worse, Phoenix was born to play, his Joker is disturbing and brilliantly oddball. But it’s a performance that is also suffocating by nature of how present it is. Without any respite, in the form of a Christian Bale or a Michael Keaton, it ends up feeling a lot like Phoenix swallowing you whole, and that’s not the best of experiences. (AW)2034 15. Anne Hathaway as Selina Kyle (The Dark Knight Rises)Catwoman – the thieving, on-again, off-again love interest of Batman – was brought to life brilliantly by Anne Hathaway who deftly encapsulated her slinky, feline energy and gave an emotionally nuanced performance which offered a fresh perspective on the character after Michelle Pfeiffer’s turn in the Nineties. (EH)2134 14. Lee Meriwether as Catwoman (Batman 1966)The actor, who is now 84, is unforgettable in her portrayal of Catwoman in the 1966 film. Using feline movements when she walks, she winds up with one of the best scenes in any Batman: when disguised as a Soviet reporter called Miss Kitka, complete with Sixties Beehive hair, she seduces Adam West’s Caped Crusader so she can abduct him. They have a very passionate kiss, but when he figures out she is Catwoman, he is heartbroken. (CC)2234 13. Cesar Romero as Joker (Batman 1966)It may be an unpopular opinion, but Cesar Romero always had the best Joker laugh – a shrill, gleeful racket of purely mad joy. He’s also one of the few actors to play the character without a heap of exhausting off-screen intensity, too. With his white makeup merely painted over his moustache because Romero couldn’t be bothered to shave it off, there’s a blissful, unique ease to his work in the original Batman movie. (AW)2334 12. Uma Thurman as Poison Ivy (Batman \u0026amp Robin)Batman \u0026amp Robin may feature a vast ensemble of stars all acting in very different films, but Uma Thurman is the only one truly in keeping with the gaudy, camp vision that director Joel Schumacher (probably?) had in mind for it. Her Poison Ivy is basically a ludicrous, plant-groping drag queen dressed occasionally in a gorilla suit, and playing up the absurdity is arguably the smartest acting choice in the whole damn film. (AW)2434 11. Jim Carrey as The Riddler (Batman Forever)Released at the peak of Carrey’s Nineties fame, Batman Forever didn’t cast Carrey because he would be perfect for The Riddler, but because they wanted Jim Carrey – squirming, scenery-chewing, face-contorting and all. It ends up falling somewhere between genuinely brilliant and mildly awful, but on occasion becomes actually chilling. (AW)2534 10. Frank Gorshin as The Riddler (Batman 1966)Gorshin’s work on the original Sixties Batman series, and its 1966 film, has always been underappreciated. It’s partly due to The Riddler himself, a character notorious in Batman’s rogues gallery of villains, but always one that has struggled to be well portrayed on-screen. But Gorshin tried his best, morphing his Riddler into a sinister genius with a maniacal laugh and a fearsome, intimidating intelligence. (AW)2634 9. Tommy Lee Jones as Two-Face (Batman Forever)“I will not sanction your buffoonery,” Jones reportedly told his co-star Jim Carrey on the Batman Forever set. One of the most notorious examples of Jones\u0027s famed workplace grouchiness, his unhappiness working on the film at least wasn\u0027t visible on screen. He\u0027s fantastic here, all mad cackling and hysterical showboating. (AW)2734 8. Cillian Murphy as Scarecrow (Batman Begins)Cillian Murphy didn’t get the screentime he needed – or deserved – to really develop what could have been one of DC’s most intriguing villains: a corrupt psychopharmacologist testing his wares on the inmates at Arkham Asylum. What works is his understated manner and appearance Scarecrow didn’t need an outlandish costume because the terror he instilled was all in your head. (RO)2834 7. Christopher Walken as Max Schreck (Batman Returns)The true villain of Batman Returns, the tragic humanity of Catwoman and The Penguin entirely lacking in Schreck\u0027s capitalist, salacious and pro-gentrification business mogul. It\u0027s no surprise there have been Trump comparisons in the years since. But it\u0027s also important to not forget quite how brilliant Walken is in the role, too. (AW)2934 6. Aaron Eckhart as Two-Face (The Dark Knight)Less spoken about by nature of the stunning work by Heath Ledger elsewhere in The Dark Knight, Aaron Eckhart is also the film\u0027s secret weapon. His Harvey Dent is noble and well-intentioned and dripping with vaguely Kennedy-esque suave, which only makes his eventual transformation into Two-Face that much more tragic. (AW)3034 5. Danny DeVito as The Penguin (Batman Returns)3134 4. Terence Stamp as General Zod (Superman II)A villain played with delicious apathy and verve by Terence Stamp, General Zod is far and away the finest nemesis Christopher Reeve’s Superman ever had to face off against. Ruthless, menacing and dressed like the coolest cat on the Studio 54 dancefloor, he’s a blast. (AW)3234 3. Jack Nicholson as The Joker (Batman)The only thing lacking from Jack Nicholson’s Joker is an element of surprise. Even in 1989, there was something admittedly tried-and-tested about Nicholson playing insanity with such ripe conviction on screen. But regardless, his work here is terrifying – not quite Jack Torrance levels, but equally as captivating. It’s no wonder he got top billing over the guy who actually played Batman. (AW)3334 2. Heath Ledger as The Joker (The Dark Knight)The best of the best: Heath Ledger transformed himself completely and made the role his own opposite Christian Bale’s Batman in The Dark Knight. His performance was so outstanding that he has become the gold standard to which all other actors aspire when they take on a villainous role. It’s hard to believe there will ever be a better Joker. (RO)3434 1. Michelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman (Batman Returns)The mystery over Catwoman\u0027s moral allegiances has been alive almost as long as she has in comic book lore, but it also makes her the most captivating sort-of nemesis in all of the DC movies. Michelle Pfeiffer is a sensual, terrifying and incredibly funny presence throughout Batman Returns, her irresistible allure making her the most threatening inidual Batman has ever faced off against. She also gives one of the greatest performances not only in comic book movies but in all movies entirely, to whom all her successors, Catwoman or not, can\u0027t help but pail in comparison. (AW)134 34. Ciaran Hinds as Steppenwolf (Justice League)We were so distracted by the bad jokes and Henry Cavill’s computer generated upper lip that it’s easy to forget that the Justice League faced off against a horned CGI muscle man voiced by Ciaran Hinds. So bad it effectively got everyone but Gal Gadot dumped from the franchise. (AW)234 33. Mark Pillow as Nuclear Man (Superman IV: The Quest for Peace)Presumably hired because fellow “foreign, unconvincing muscle-man” Dolph Lundgren wasn’t available, Mark Pillow made for one of the worst DC movie villains. To be fair to him, Superman IV: The Quest for Peace is a famously abysmal film, but his Nuclear Man – a villain so blandly nefarious even his name feels like it came about via 30 seconds of brainstorming – doesn’t help matters. (AW)334 32. Cara Delevingne as EnchantressJune Moone (Suicide Squad)It’s not been plain sailing swapping the catwalk for the big screen for this aristocratic supermodel-turned-actor, specifically with her role in this puerile comic book film. She plays June Moone, an archeological boffin transformed into a bikini-clad witch by some haunted dust. The film got devastatingly bad reviews, despite doing well at the box office. It may well be a performance Delevingne would like to forget. (CC)434 31. David Thewlis as Ares (Wonder Woman)The one area of Wonder Woman we don’t like to talk about is its villain, as his appearance in the film’s final act turns a smart and funny movie into one just like all the others – namely with two superpowered beings throwing things at each other. (AW)534 30. Patrick Wilson as Ocean Master (Aquaman)It was always going to be tricky to make much of an impression in a movie in which Amber Heard, sporting an enormous red wig, catapults her way into underwater battle riding a dolphin. Which might explain why Patrick Wilson, playing Aquaman’s dastardly half-brother Orm, has fallen so rapidly out of memory. (AW)634 29. Faye Dunaway as Selena (Supergirl)The doomed Supergirl movie is a living testament to how badly Mommie Dearest impacted the career of Faye Dunaway, with her turn as a witchy supervillain with a dangerous love spell at her disposal secretly the nadir of her Eighties career. She may nail a certain level of camp here, whether deliberate or not, but Dunaway is certainly no good – it’s no surprise she was awarded a Razzie for her performance. (AW)734 28. Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor (Superman Returns)A big gulp in 2019 for obvious reasons, but also pretty regretful because it\u0027s an incredibly dull performance from an actor who was, whether we like to admit it or not, masterful at playing villains in his prime. Here, however, Spacey is just a snooze. (AW)834 27. Yahya Abdul-Mahteen III as Black Manta (Aquaman)About as threatening as a Power Rangers villain and just as stupid-looking, Aquaman\u0027s recurring nemesis is more a perpetual irritant than someone particularly enjoyable to watch. (AW)934 26. Liam Neeson as Ra\u0027s al Ghul (Batman Begins)Ra\u0027s al Ghul, or The Demon\u0027s Head in Arabic, jumped on the climate activism bandwagon nice and early. For him, the human race is a cancer poisoning the Earth, and he wants to eliminate people to save the world from environmental disaster. Neeson played the villain so well because he really believed in him. “It was quite a good argument he comes up with,” the actor said. Terrifying. (EH)1034 25. Arnold Schwarzenegger as Mr Freeze (Batman \u0026amp Robin)Arnold Schwarzenegger wasn\u0027t so much playing Mr Freeze in Batman \u0026amp Robin as he was The Pun King, few surviving his merciless deployment of woeful gags. Schwarzenegger is by no means good here, but he\u0027s absolutely captivating nonetheless. (AW)1134 24. Sharon Stone as Laurel Hedare (Catwoman)Only one of the worst DC villains because her evil plot was to poison Gotham City via killer face cream, Laurel Hedare at least allowed Sharon Stone to be devious, slinky and cartoonish for the first time since Basic Instinct. It\u0027s a very minor victory, though. (AW)1234 23. Jared Leto as Joker (Suicide Squad)It would be easy to pity Jared Leto, who was always going to be compared to the late Heath Ledger’s transcendent portrayal of the Joker in Christopher Nolan’s The Dark Knight, if it weren’t for how much hype he built up before Suicide Squad was even released. There were the tattoos, his green hair, a shiny grill in his mouth, and a ludicrous number of articles about his supposed bad behaviour on set. So it was downright embarrassing when it turned out Joker wasn’t even the lead villain in the movie, and instead just an annoyance who turns up to mock the lead cast every now and then. (RO)1334 22. Marion Cotillard as Miranda Tate (The Dark Knight Rises)Although many will purely remember Cotillard’s performance in The Dark Knight Rises for that awfully awkward death scene, she was great in the rest of the movie. She played one of Batman’s most interesting female adversaries with a slyness and a deception that was mysteriously alluring and effective. (EH)1434 21. Michael Shannon as General Zod (Man of Steel)The kind of role Shannon could play in his sleep, his General Zod is more angsty and human than his live-action predecessors playing the same character, but harmed by the relentlessly dank surroundings of Zack Snyder’s film. He’s also saddled with the most unflattering haircut in all of DC movie history, which couldn’t have helped. (AW)1534 20. Tom Hardy as Bane (The Dark Knight Rises)1634 19. Burgess Meredith as The Penguin (Batman 1966)Entirely unsubtle work from Meredith here, the actor grinding his teeth and chewing on the end of a large, thin cigarette to emphasise the Penguin’s dastardly villainy. But it’s a lot of fun to behold nonetheless. (AW)1734 18. Gene Hackman as Lex Luthor (Superman)The Oscar-winning actor was easily the most fun incarnation of Lex Luthor when he was cast in the 1978 Superman. As the hero’s arch nemesis, his light-hearted and theatrical portrayal came across as more comical than menacing. But despite the fact it was hard to take him as a serious threat, he was still a compelling villain to watch. He reprised the role in Superman II and Superman IV: The Quest for Peace. (CC)1834 17. Parker Posey as Kitty Kowalski (Superman Returns)One of the few bright spots in an otherwise drab and rapidly forgotten Superman reboot, Parker Posey very much plays to type here. But it\u0027s such a delicious, mischievous performance, all eccentricity and barely-concealed madness, that it\u0027s not remotely a problem. (AW)1934 16. Joaquin Phoenix as Joker (Joker)The role that, for better and for worse, Phoenix was born to play, his Joker is disturbing and brilliantly oddball. But it’s a performance that is also suffocating by nature of how present it is. Without any respite, in the form of a Christian Bale or a Michael Keaton, it ends up feeling a lot like Phoenix swallowing you whole, and that’s not the best of experiences. (AW)2034 15. Anne Hathaway as Selina Kyle (The Dark Knight Rises)Catwoman – the thieving, on-again, off-again love interest of Batman – was brought to life brilliantly by Anne Hathaway who deftly encapsulated her slinky, feline energy and gave an emotionally nuanced performance which offered a fresh perspective on the character after Michelle Pfeiffer’s turn in the Nineties. (EH)2134 14. Lee Meriwether as Catwoman (Batman 1966)The actor, who is now 84, is unforgettable in her portrayal of Catwoman in the 1966 film. Using feline movements when she walks, she winds up with one of the best scenes in any Batman: when disguised as a Soviet reporter called Miss Kitka, complete with Sixties Beehive hair, she seduces Adam West’s Caped Crusader so she can abduct him. They have a very passionate kiss, but when he figures out she is Catwoman, he is heartbroken. (CC)2234 13. Cesar Romero as Joker (Batman 1966)It may be an unpopular opinion, but Cesar Romero always had the best Joker laugh – a shrill, gleeful racket of purely mad joy. He’s also one of the few actors to play the character without a heap of exhausting off-screen intensity, too. With his white makeup merely painted over his moustache because Romero couldn’t be bothered to shave it off, there’s a blissful, unique ease to his work in the original Batman movie. (AW)2334 12. Uma Thurman as Poison Ivy (Batman \u0026amp Robin)Batman \u0026amp Robin may feature a vast ensemble of stars all acting in very different films, but Uma Thurman is the only one truly in keeping with the gaudy, camp vision that director Joel Schumacher (probably?) had in mind for it. Her Poison Ivy is basically a ludicrous, plant-groping drag queen dressed occasionally in a gorilla suit, and playing up the absurdity is arguably the smartest acting choice in the whole damn film. (AW)2434 11. Jim Carrey as The Riddler (Batman Forever)Released at the peak of Carrey’s Nineties fame, Batman Forever didn’t cast Carrey because he would be perfect for The Riddler, but because they wanted Jim Carrey – squirming, scenery-chewing, face-contorting and all. It ends up falling somewhere between genuinely brilliant and mildly awful, but on occasion becomes actually chilling. (AW)2534 10. Frank Gorshin as The Riddler (Batman 1966)Gorshin’s work on the original Sixties Batman series, and its 1966 film, has always been underappreciated. It’s partly due to The Riddler himself, a character notorious in Batman’s rogues gallery of villains, but always one that has struggled to be well portrayed on-screen. But Gorshin tried his best, morphing his Riddler into a sinister genius with a maniacal laugh and a fearsome, intimidating intelligence. (AW)2634 9. Tommy Lee Jones as Two-Face (Batman Forever)“I will not sanction your buffoonery,” Jones reportedly told his co-star Jim Carrey on the Batman Forever set. One of the most notorious examples of Jones\u0027s famed workplace grouchiness, his unhappiness working on the film at least wasn\u0027t visible on screen. He\u0027s fantastic here, all mad cackling and hysterical showboating. (AW)2734 8. Cillian Murphy as Scarecrow (Batman Begins)Cillian Murphy didn’t get the screentime he needed – or deserved – to really develop what could have been one of DC’s most intriguing villains: a corrupt psychopharmacologist testing his wares on the inmates at Arkham Asylum. What works is his understated manner and appearance Scarecrow didn’t need an outlandish costume because the terror he instilled was all in your head. (RO)2834 7. Christopher Walken as Max Schreck (Batman Returns)The true villain of Batman Returns, the tragic humanity of Catwoman and The Penguin entirely lacking in Schreck\u0027s capitalist, salacious and pro-gentrification business mogul. It\u0027s no surprise there have been Trump comparisons in the years since. But it\u0027s also important to not forget quite how brilliant Walken is in the role, too. (AW)2934 6. Aaron Eckhart as Two-Face (The Dark Knight)Less spoken about by nature of the stunning work by Heath Ledger elsewhere in The Dark Knight, Aaron Eckhart is also the film\u0027s secret weapon. His Harvey Dent is noble and well-intentioned and dripping with vaguely Kennedy-esque suave, which only makes his eventual transformation into Two-Face that much more tragic. (AW)3034 5. Danny DeVito as The Penguin (Batman Returns)3134 4. Terence Stamp as General Zod (Superman II)A villain played with delicious apathy and verve by Terence Stamp, General Zod is far and away the finest nemesis Christopher Reeve’s Superman ever had to face off against. Ruthless, menacing and dressed like the coolest cat on the Studio 54 dancefloor, he’s a blast. (AW)3234 3. Jack Nicholson as The Joker (Batman)The only thing lacking from Jack Nicholson’s Joker is an element of surprise. Even in 1989, there was something admittedly tried-and-tested about Nicholson playing insanity with such ripe conviction on screen. But regardless, his work here is terrifying – not quite Jack Torrance levels, but equally as captivating. It’s no wonder he got top billing over the guy who actually played Batman. (AW)3334 2. Heath Ledger as The Joker (The Dark Knight)The best of the best: Heath Ledger transformed himself completely and made the role his own opposite Christian Bale’s Batman in The Dark Knight. His performance was so outstanding that he has become the gold standard to which all other actors aspire when they take on a villainous role. It’s hard to believe there will ever be a better Joker. (RO)3434 1. Michelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman (Batman Returns)The mystery over Catwoman\u0027s moral allegiances has been alive almost as long as she has in comic book lore, but it also makes her the most captivating sort-of nemesis in all of the DC movies. Michelle Pfeiffer is a sensual, terrifying and incredibly funny presence throughout Batman Returns, her irresistible allure making her the most threatening inidual Batman has ever faced off against. She also gives one of the greatest performances not only in comic book movies but in all movies entirely, to whom all her successors, Catwoman or not, can\u0027t help but pail in comparison. (AW)Leto is also notably absent from the\u0026nbspupcoming Suicide Squad sequel, also. When making the original film, Leto reportedly sent\u0026nbspa dead pig to the first table read.Phoenix recently said he would be very interested in playing Joker again, following rave reviews of his performance in the film and its success at the box office.Joker is out now in\u0026nbspcinemas.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It’s expected to fetch between $200,000 and $300,000 (£163,000 to £245,000).Cobain was wearing the cardigan when Nirvana taped the appearance in November 1993 in New York City.The segment aired in November 1994, seven months after Cobain’s death.Cobain’s cardigan is described on Julien’s Auctions’ website as a Manhattan-brand\u0026nbsp”blend of acrylic, mohair and Lycra with five-button closure (one button absent) with two exterior pockets, a burn hole and discoloration near left pocket and discoloration on right pocket”.Created with Sketch.The best albums of 2019 (so far) Show all 67Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.It’s not uncommon for an artist to be influenced by the place they grew up in. Yet few are likely to have as much inspiration to draw on as India-born, Zimbabwe-raised and now Peckham-based artist Rina Mushonga.On Deerhunter’s eighth album, frontman Bradford Cox takes on the role of war poet, documenting the things he observes with a cool matter-of-factness, and heart-wrenching detail. Death is everywhere on Why Hasn’t Everything Already Disappeared?, as much as others may refuse to see it.After a period of tumult, Sharon Van Etten’s fifth album is a reinvention. But beneath its hazy synths and electronics are songs of endurance and inner peace, of settling after a flurry of activity. 467 Bring Me the Horizon  – AmoBMTH frontman Oli Sykes wants to assert the fragility of the boundary between love and hate. Amo is a way of exploring that, even down to the title itself.567 Nina Nesbitt – The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will ChangeNesbitt is back with her second LP, switching to a brand of soul and R\u0026ampB-fused pop that feels bang on time, and suits her far better. The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will Change has slick, polished production from Fraser T Smith (Adele), Lostboy (Anne-Marie), Jordan Riley (Zara Larsson), and Nesbitt herself.This self-titled record, a loose but beautifully crafted collection of folk-rock songs, explores the kinds of anxieties intrinsic to the modern age – the longing to be at once noticed and invisible the paralysing effects of limitless information, and the desire to do good versus the desire to be seen doing good.The album is packed with personal confessions for the fans – “Arianators” – to pick over. It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (Helen Brown)The perma-brilliant James Blake has flooded his fourth album – Assume Form – with euphoric sepia soul and loved-up doo-wop. His trademark intelligence, honesty and pin-drop production remain intact. But the detached chorister vocals of a decade in which he battled depression have thawed to reveal a millennial Sam Cooke crooning: “Can’t believe the way we flow, way we flow, way we flow...”While he recognises his roots and includes plenty of nods to grime, AJ Tracey\u0027s magpie’s eye for a good melody or hook extends far beyond that. With the help of stellar producers like Cadenza (Kiko Bun), Swifta Beater (Kano, Giggs), and Nyge (Section Boyz, Yxng Bane), Tracey incorporates electronic music, rock, garage and even country on his most cohesive work to date.The album title of the year gives us an image of Brexit Britain trashed by Old Etonians David Cameron, Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg, but the fifth studio work from the punk duo has more than social commentary to offer. There’s some of that, as vocalist Jason Williamson skewers documentary-makers who take advantage of the poor in “Kebab Spider” – “the skint get used in loo roll shoes” – but elsewhere this is a record that expands the idea of what Sleaford Mods could be.“Do you still have that photograph? Would you use it to hurt me?” asks Australian indie rocker Julia Jacklin, against the menacing throb of “Body”. The tension is stormy: imagine a mid-period Fleetwood Mac song, covered by Cat Power. It’s a masterclass in narrative songwriting.With praise from Kendrick Lamar, five EPs released by the time she was 21, tours with Lauryn Hill, collaborations with Gorillaz and two critically praised albums – including 2017’s excellent concept album Stillness in Wonderland – fans and critics alike wondered what else Little Simz could do to find the kind of mainstream success enjoyed by so many of her male peers.1367 Solange – When I Get HomeSolange Knowles has never been coy about the intent behind her music. Beautiful arrangements and seamless production notwithstanding, you get the sense, each time she drop a project, that it serves a distinct, zeitgeist-shifting purpose.1467 Foals – Everything Not Saved Will be Lost (Part 1)FoalsMerging their asymmetrical early math pop with the deep space atmospherics of Total Life Forever and Holy Fire, plus added innovations – ambient rainforest throbs on “Moonlight”, deadpan EDM on “In Degrees”, Afro-glitch Radiohead on “Café D’Athens” – they’ve created an inspired album of scorched earth new music that, in all likelihood, will only really be challenged for album of the year by Part 2. (Mark Beaumont)Tracks are at once astute and deeply personal in how they capture vignettes of everyday life and spin them into important lessons. “Black”, the most recent single from the record, considers what that word means to different people around the world, as well as to Dave. “Voices” has him singing over an old-school garage beat, fighting off personal demons.At her best, Sigrid throws out precision-tooled high notes like icicle javelins into vast, blue Scandi-produced skies. Then she growls like an Icelandic volcano preparing to disrupt western civilisation until we sort ourselves out.1767 Karen O and Danger Mouse – Lux PrimaLux Prima was born just over a decade ago from a drunken phone call from Karen O to Danger Mouse – real name Brian Joseph Burton – during which the pair vowed they would work on something together. It wasn’t until after O had given birth to her son, though, that recording finally began, and there is a beatific sense of contentment on songs like “Drown”, with its Kamasi Washington-like choirs and stately horns.This is an ambitious creation, meticulously crafted and assembled. For a start, the range of guest performers is a cornucopia of contemporary soul and hip-hop collaborators: vocalists Moses Sumney, Roots Manuva, Heidi Vogel, Grey Reverend and Tawiah strings player Miguel Atwood-Ferguson, and keyboardist Dennis Hamm – both of whom have worked with Flying Lotus and Thundercat.Rose – who found fame in the UK’s indie-folk scene as an unofficial member of Bombay Bicycle Club in 2010, only to walk away amid the band’s growing hype – is darkly compelling on No Words Left. Assisted by producer Tim Bidwell, who worked on Rose’s last record Something’s Changing, she sounds braver than she ever has before. There are moments that recall her Communion labelmate Ben Howard, on his latest album, Noonday Dream, and others that nod to the quiet stoicism of Joni Mitchell and Neil Young. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)The record is loosely conceptual insomuch as it’s punctuated with mock adverts for “WWAY HEALTH, our 247 care programme”. But don’t be put off: Miss Universe is a brilliant collection of songs, an expansive melange of indie, jazz, pop and trip-hop that flits between a lo-fi sparseness and something The Strokes would play. Yanya – who is of Turkish-Irish-Bajan heritage – grew up in London on a mix of Pixies, Nina Simone, The Libertines and Amy Winehouse, and this unlikely combination is certainly reflected in the sound. (Patrick Smith)2167 Jenny Lewis – On the LineHere, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (Elisa Bray)Comprising songs from Segall’s eclectic (that’s putting it lightly) catalogue and performed by him and the Freedom Band (Mikal Cronin, Charles Moothart, Emmett Kelly, and Ben Boye), the album is delightfully short and sweet. It is certainly a drastic switch-up from Freedom’s Goblin (2018), which had 19 tracks and ran for 75 minutes.If you want to know how hard it is to categorise Titanic Rising – the enthralling fourth album from Weyes Blood – look no further than the American musician’s own attempt to do so. It is, she says, “The Kinks meet the Second World War, or Bob Seger meets Enya.”Tension aside, there’s a great sense of fun here. The title track is pure euphoria, as restless synths of a Utah Saints or Orbital rave break into swelling bass and melody. And they create the full club experience with “Got to Keep On”, on which the four-to-the-floor beat, funky rhythm guitar, sweet backing vocals and chiming bells make way for the simple sounds of happy party-goers just as the anticipation builds, so does the instrumentation into a hypnotic crescendo. It’s masterful production. (Elisa Bray)Six months after the release of Oxnard, Anderson .Paak returns with another Dr Dre-produced record, Ventura. Where the former was overflowing with choppy, experimental sounds, guest appearances and clumsy attempts at Gil Scott Heron-esque revolutionary lyrics, the sequel – recorded around the same time – streamlines .Paak’s sound, making for a tightly packaged, melodic and danceable album.Two years after the release of his Mercury Prize-nominated debut Yesterday’s Gone, the south London hip-hop artist unveils its follow-up, Not Waving, But Drowning. And if any two records could portray how quickly someone can grow from a boy to a man, it’s these.2767 Lizzo – Cuz I Love YouNo one could accuse Lizzo of holding back. Not when it comes to her voice – which is raw and rowdy, so laden with personality even the vulnerable moments are a joy to listen to –  and certainly not when it comes to her message of unabashed self-love. That’s the predominant theme of the singer  rapper  flautist-extraordinaire’s hugely likeable third album, Cuz I Love You.It seems as likely as Old Man Steptoe dining with the Rees-Mogg, but this new tactic of burying their confrontational gruesomeness beneath a veneer of alt-rock respectability for album three works well for Fat White Family. Drenched in chamber strings and celestial harmonies, the plush yet sinister “Oh Sebastian” could be Pet Sounds selling its soul to the devil. “Fringe Runner” is so sleek and funksome it could be a New Romantic “White Lines (Don’t Don’t Do It)” “Kim’s Sunsets” is a piece of refined cosmic reggae resembling a blissed-out “Bankrobber”.2967 Cage the Elephant – Social CuesOn Cage the Elephant’s fifth album, Social Cues, frontman Matt Shultz reacts to the breakdown of his marriage and the loss of three close friends. He undergoes a kind of Jekyll and Hyde transition through the 13 tracks, the result of which is the band’s best work to date.SOAK reaches to outsiders once again on her new album. 3167 The Cranberries – In the EndThere’s a cruel irony that the release of The Cranberries’ final album should come just a week after journalist Lyra McKee was shot dead by the New IRA during a riot in Londonderry. “Zombie” was a protest song written by the band’s late frontwoman Dolores O’Riordan after two children were killed by IRA bombs – was released. She was deeply affected by the deaths, and would no doubt have been devastated by recent events in Northern Ireland as well.On her third record, Aldous Harding combines the gothic folk of her self-titled 2014 debut with the dramatically intimate tones of her follow-up album Party.Big Thief’s frontwoman Adrianne Lenker has an uncanny ability to make you feel like you’re in on a secret. Her whispering, spectral delivery and deeply personal lyrics are the key to this. Even on the band’s third album UFOF, with an audience that has grown exponentially in the past few years, the songs are still immensely intimate affairs.On his debut album, the 24-year-old Collard mixes sultry jams that recall the electronic funk of MGMT with nods to the greats: Prince, James Brown, Led Zeppelin and Marvin Gaye. Throughout, Collard exhibits his extraordinary voice, which swoops to a devilishly low murmur or soars to an ecstatic falsetto.   Dedicated covers the full, but generic, spectrum of relationships: dizzying love, lust, and break-ups. But whether she’s pining for the return of a former love in the funky disco banger “Julien”, or singing about masturbating post-break-up in lead single “Party For One” (“I’ll be the one If you don’t care about me Making love to myself Back on my beat”), the vibe remains positively jubilant.Getty Images for Spotify3667 Tyler, the Creator - IGOR“I don’t know where I’m going,” Tyler, the Creator begins on the song “I THINK”. “But I know what I’m showing.” The US artist’s words ring true throughout his fifth studio album, IGOR, where he adopts the dark and twisted mutterings of the Frankenstein character from which the record gets its name. It’s been a long wait for Flying Lotus’s new album. In fact, the LA producer has been masterminding Flamagra for the past five years – snatching moments between collaborating with Kendrick Lamar on To Pimp a Butterfly, directing and writing the comic horror movie Kuso, producing much of Thundercat’s Drunk and growing his Brainfeeder label.A heftier sound is never at the cost of melody, which shines through in Thomson’s vocals, the rest of the band’s backing falsetto, and the searing blues grooves stamped all over Future Dust. Those qualities are captured nowhere more satisfyingly than on “25”. “All Over Town” is their singalong anthem, neatly positioned in the middle to ease the pace.In keeping with the relatively restrained guest spots, it’s heartening just how much Skepta has rejected overloading Ignorance is Bliss with high-profile producers, preferring instead to burrow into his own aesthetic. There’s no attempt to chase someone else’s wave here no token drill, afroswing or trap beats to satisfy playlist algorithms. Instead, his cold grime sonics are rendered down to their no-frills essentials – brutalist blocks of sad angular melodies and hard, spacious drums.Bruce Springsteen seems to have told almost every tale in the grand old storybook of American mythologies, except perhaps one: a wide-eyed Californian dreamer finds the Golden State turns sour and flees back east, to some romantic speck of a town, to pine and rehabilitate. It’s the classic pop plotline of Bacharach and David’s “Do You Know the Way to San Jose?”, and it’s a tale Springsteen taps repeatedly here, on his sumptuous, cinematic 19th album, which is nothing short of a late-period masterpiece.A revolving door of female vocalists (A-listers, indie darlings like Angel Olsen and unsung songwriters) deliver heartbroken lines over big, shiny beats and synths. The emotional cohesion the record loses in its shifting cast of singerssongwritersgenres it makes up in DJ-savvy textural variety. Help Us Stranger reaches all corners of guitar rock: funky Detroit garage (“What’s Yours Is Mine”) country soul (“Somedays (I Don’t Feel Like Trying)”) psych (a cover of Donovan’s “Hey Gyp (Dig the Slowness)”) blues and bluegrass (“Thoughts and Prayers”). A cornucopia of instrumentation is woven into its brisk 42-minute yarn.4367 Hot Chip - A Bath Full of EcstasyWhen Hot Chip achieved chart success with their second album, 2006’s The Warning, it seemed more like a happy coincidence than a sign they were conforming to current pop trends. Since then, they\u0027ve released a string of consistently great albums, from 2008’s Made in the Dark (featuring their only Top 10 single to date, “Ready for the Floor”) to this, their seventh and best record, A Bath Full of Ecstasy. The record frequently switches in tone: Banks can be both formidable and vulnerable, accusatory or filled with regret. “Gimme” demands sex and refuses to be shamed for it “Contaminated” mourns a toxic relationship that can’t be saved and “Stroke” is a bitter riposte to a man emulating the Greek figure Narcissus – laid over a funk guitar riff.4567 Mini Mansions – Guy Walks into a BarMikey Shuman shares vocal duties with Tyler Parkford his voice falls somewhere between the sleazy drawl of his QOTSA bandmate Josh Homme and Alex Turner’s more adenoidal tone on opener “We Should Be Dancing”. With tracks that frequently dart from sprawling, psychedelic pop to scuzzy post-punk and rock references, the record has a superb dynamic that holds the listener’s attention, while the band navigate through a single, tumultuous relationship. By the end of all that, you feel like they deserve a pint. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)Hackman’s debut album, 2015’s We Slept At Last, was a gentle, unprovocative affair –  though if you listened closely, the dark, sexual energy that convulses through her current sound was already there. Her second, I’m Not Your Man, was scuzzier and more explicitly queer – a road she continues down with Any Human Friend, a blunt, bold album on which Hackman’s beatific voice sits atop methodically messy instrumentals.Frontman Corey Taylor, who had just emerged from a toxic relationship when recording this album, addresses feelings of belittlement and inadequacy with unflinching honesty and some of his best vocal work in years. Over the Celtic influences of “Solway Firth” (at one point, he seems to attempt some Cockney screamo) he issues a blistering riposte to the people he holds responsible for his negative mindset.There’s an increased anxiety, both corporeal and emotional, running through The Center Won’t Hold, a pent-up desire to break free from something – though they never seem quite sure what. “Disconnect me from my bones, so I can float, so I can roam,” sings Brownstein – her singular voice all yelps and creaks – on “Hurry On Home”. On “Reach Out”, Tucker begs, her voice a little sleeker than Brownstein’s but no less commanding, “Reach out and see me, I’m losing my head.” Quietly discordant piano ballad “Broken” pays tribute to Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused supreme court judge Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault: “Me, me too, my body cried out when she spoke those lines.”The overarching sound, production and instrumentation on Eve are outstanding. Produced by Rapsody’s long-time collaborator and mentor 9th Wonder, the record samples cuts from Herbie Hancock’s “Watermelon Man” (“Whoopi”) and Phil Collins’s “In the Air Tonight” (“Cleo”), offers a smooth R\u0026ampB joint with “Aaliyah” featuring the late singer’s ghostly backing vocals, and includes an interlude that is “an ode to the black woman’s body”. As on Laila’s Wisdom, Eve conveys Rapsody’s natural feel for funk – “Michelle” (Obama) bounces in on a jaunty piano riff – but other tracks, such as closer “Afeni”, are pure soul.  Swift has a habit of putting her worst foot forward. The album’s lead single, “Me!”, is peppy and poppy in all the wrong ways, a rictus grin of a song that rings hollow. Thank goodness that the rest of the album is nothing like that. Perky opening track “Forgot That You Existed” is a syncopated snigger, on which Swift shrugs off old grudges and breathes a sigh of relief in doing so. “Something magical happened one night,” she sings. “I forgot that you existed. And I thought that it would kill me, but it didn’t.” The title track, meanwhile, is poignant and unfussy, a reminder of Swift’s ability to distil infatuation into something specific and universal. (Alexandra Pollard)One could argue that there’s too much eclecticism here – that if this really is Crow’s final LP, she perhaps could have gone for something with a more singular sound. But then it wouldn’t be a Sheryl Crow album. She sings about the fear of the unknown on “Flying Blind” – her steely determination on this record has you believing that she’ll take the leap regardless. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)There’s more of a soul influence here – “HER Love”, the counterpoint to his 1994 track “I Used to Love HER”,  benefits from the gospel-like vocals of Daniel Caesar and Dwele, while “Memories of Home” skitters over a muffled bass and Common’s recollections of his past – including an incident where he was molested by a family member.This is Del Rey at her most assertive – personally, if not politically. Those hoping for a barbed protest record in keeping with Del Rey’s newfound public activism (last year she called President Trump a “narcissist” who “believes it’s OK to grab a woman by the pussy just because he’s famous”) will be disappointed. But it is gratifying to hear her take control. Aside from “Happiness Is a Butterfly”, that is. “If he’s a serial killer, then what’s the worst that can happen to a girl who’s already hurt?” she asks. Crikey.Assisted by veteran producer John Congleton (St Vincent, John Grant), he channels the spirit of David Bowie and Iggy Pop. He screeches over distorted “ooh oohs” via The Rolling Stones’s “Sympathy for the Devil” on opener “Calm Down aka I Should Not Be Alone”. “Transition from Nowhere to Nowhere” is sung in a Ziggy Stardust croon, while “Rated R Crusaders” shows Furman exploring his Jewish identity in the era of the IsraelPalestine conflict.If Brothers, their brawny album from 2010, turned the pair into serious rock contenders, then 2011’s El Camino cemented their reputation. Yet neither can claim to be as fiendishly catchy as Let’s Rock, a record that can scarcely sit still. On opener “Shine a Light”, the riffs are big, the momentum irresistible, with frontmanguitarist Dan Auerbach layering scabrous licks over ACDC-like chords. Backing singers Leisa Hans and Ashley Wilcoxson add texture to the grooving “LoHi”, while the languid “Sit Around and Miss You” is Stealers Wheels by way of the Deep South. Listen to the melodic harmonies in “Tell Me Lies” and it’s not just the lyrics that’ll remind you of Fleetwood Mac. The tones here are stark and bleak, compared to the claustrophobia of 2014’s Tomorrow’s Modern Boxes. You can hear his paranoia in the stuttering techno opener “Traffic”, which channels the heady grooves and pulses of electronic artist Floating Points (who, with his neuroscience background, seems like an entirely fitting reference point).There are plenty of surprises, like Swizz Beats singing on “Who Are You” against elegant violins that recall a Kamasi Washington composition. “Adult Film” features a gorgeous piano riff the Pete Rock-produced “The Art of It” has a delicious funk vibe “It Never Ends” comes full circle via a bright piano loop. Where a full album produced by Kanye West (2018’s Nasir) didn’t pan out – perhaps because West’s perfectionism was a bad fit for Nas’s penchant for procrastination – “You Mean the World to Me” sounds like it would have been a standout on that record had it not been abandoned on the cutting-room floor. Now it’s a standout on this album. For all the album’s eccentricities, the vibe is earnest fairytale rather than tongue-in-cheek – save for the sound of a strangled feline mirroring the lyrics “when you stepped on your cat” on “How Many Times”. Epic highlight “Electric Fire” and celestial album-closer “How Can a Head” capture Coyne at his most wistful. The latter is a wide-eyed, strings-laden gem, its childlike, questing lyrics poignant whatever your age. 5967 Bat for Lashes – Lost GirlsGiven our current preoccupation with the Eighties, you could argue that Lost Girls is hardly breaking new ground – and yes, nostalgia is a fairly generic formula. But listened to as a whole, the album positively thrums with sonic invention, managing to feel both fresh and full of intrigue. Khan once again demonstrates a knack for uncanny storytelling. Three of her past albums have been nominated for Mercurys expect this to make it four. (Patrick Smith)6067 MUNA – Saves the WorldMUNA might not be a household name yet, but their influence runs through the charts like a stick of rock these days. Listen to Katy Perry’s summer smash “Never Really Over”, or Taylor Swift’s feminist clap back “The Man”, and you’ll hear the same dense, sticky synths and brawny beats that the emo-pop trio have been honing for the past three years. Their debut album, 2017’s About U, was raw, poignant and just the ride side of melodramatic, queering the mainstream, one sad-pop anthem at a time.6167 Pixies – Beneath the EyrieTales of witchy curses (“On Graveyard Hill”) and spirit reincarnation (“Daniel Boone”) feel like they’ve been dug up from ancient folklore, and capture classic-Pixies menace and ghoulish spirit. Over the album’s 12 tracks, ghostly organs and minor-key guitar-picked sequences help to conjure this dark, Gothic vibe. Yet for all its darkness, Beneath the Eyrie is brimming with the kind of melody that we expect from these indie-rock giants from the late Eighties. “Ready for Love” is a melancholy ballad with harmonising vocals from bassist Paz Lenchantin (Kim Deal’s now-permanent replacement), while lead single “Catfish Kate” – a tale of a woman battling a catfish in a river told by Black Jack Hooligan – is a rock hit in waiting. (Elisa Bray)6267 Jenny Hval – The Practice of LoveThis endlessly fascinating artist’s seventh, full-length, album The Practice of Love is just as considered as 2016\u0027s Blood Bitch, examining one’s role in humankind and on Earth, and probing that favourite of pop-song themes: love. But where the 2017 Nordic Music Prize-winning Blood Bitch was packed with visceral imagery and disarming sonics, the themes of The Practice of Love are encased in a warm cocoon of poetry, blissed-out circling synths and trance-like Nineties beats. (Elisa Bray)This is nomy at their most ambitious and pleasurably weird. As with the dreamy “Upset My Girlfriend”, which speaks of a man about to propose to his partner despite the fight they’re in, it’s an album stranded somewhere between pure joy and unexplainable sadness like slapping on a false smile despite feeling miserable, and recognising how much it helps in the moment. (Adam White)Listening on headphones, I was reminded of the late French designer Janet Laverriere. Born in 1909, she was still a powerful, playful force when I interviewed her for this paper in her eighties. She banged a cast iron radiator with a spoon to celebrate the echoes and curves of essential pipework: “I put all the hard plumbing on the outside. In kitchens, in bathrooms, I am feminist, evidemment!”Fender drew plenty of early comparisons to Bruce Springsteen – on Hypersonic Missiles they’re entirely warranted, as much for the instrumentation as the lyricism and his vignettes of working-class struggle. There are sax solos (more than one), and pounding rhythms that make you want to jump in a car and drive down a highway at sunset, and blistering electric guitars next to classic troubadour acoustics. He has Springsteen’s rousing holler, and the early indications of someone who could be the voice of a generation – not because he wants to be, but because he sees things and understands. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)Why Me? Why Not. is enjoyably defiant, Gallagher embodying a settled and contented aura. “Gotta live for something besides yesterdays,” Gallagher snarls on “Be Still”. The downbeat “Once” forgoes easy Noel-bashing for a mournful glance at the years when the pair were still speaking (“I remember how you used to shine back then... but you only get to do it once”). And “Now That I’ve Found You” is even somewhat sickly-sweet in tone, a cheery tribute to his daughter Molly, whom he met for the first time when she was 21. “I know it’s late for lullabies, but the future is yours and mine,” he sings, alongside upbeat whoops and Radio 2-friendly guitars.The album takes a deep, contemplative breath on “Short and Sweet”, which is exactly what it promises, a Grace Jones-like ballad on which Howard’s voice takes precedent over inconspicuous guitar, and the background hisses like an old vinyl. On “He Loves Me”, she grapples with maintaining a relationship with God when she’s long since stopped going to church.  It’s not uncommon for an artist to be influenced by the place they grew up in. Yet few are likely to have as much inspiration to draw on as India-born, Zimbabwe-raised and now Peckham-based artist Rina Mushonga.On Deerhunter’s eighth album, frontman Bradford Cox takes on the role of war poet, documenting the things he observes with a cool matter-of-factness, and heart-wrenching detail. Death is everywhere on Why Hasn’t Everything Already Disappeared?, as much as others may refuse to see it.After a period of tumult, Sharon Van Etten’s fifth album is a reinvention. But beneath its hazy synths and electronics are songs of endurance and inner peace, of settling after a flurry of activity. 467 Bring Me the Horizon  – AmoBMTH frontman Oli Sykes wants to assert the fragility of the boundary between love and hate. Amo is a way of exploring that, even down to the title itself.567 Nina Nesbitt – The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will ChangeNesbitt is back with her second LP, switching to a brand of soul and R\u0026ampB-fused pop that feels bang on time, and suits her far better. The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will Change has slick, polished production from Fraser T Smith (Adele), Lostboy (Anne-Marie), Jordan Riley (Zara Larsson), and Nesbitt herself.This self-titled record, a loose but beautifully crafted collection of folk-rock songs, explores the kinds of anxieties intrinsic to the modern age – the longing to be at once noticed and invisible the paralysing effects of limitless information, and the desire to do good versus the desire to be seen doing good.The album is packed with personal confessions for the fans – “Arianators” – to pick over. It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (Helen Brown)The perma-brilliant James Blake has flooded his fourth album – Assume Form – with euphoric sepia soul and loved-up doo-wop. His trademark intelligence, honesty and pin-drop production remain intact. But the detached chorister vocals of a decade in which he battled depression have thawed to reveal a millennial Sam Cooke crooning: “Can’t believe the way we flow, way we flow, way we flow...”While he recognises his roots and includes plenty of nods to grime, AJ Tracey\u0027s magpie’s eye for a good melody or hook extends far beyond that. With the help of stellar producers like Cadenza (Kiko Bun), Swifta Beater (Kano, Giggs), and Nyge (Section Boyz, Yxng Bane), Tracey incorporates electronic music, rock, garage and even country on his most cohesive work to date.The album title of the year gives us an image of Brexit Britain trashed by Old Etonians David Cameron, Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg, but the fifth studio work from the punk duo has more than social commentary to offer. There’s some of that, as vocalist Jason Williamson skewers documentary-makers who take advantage of the poor in “Kebab Spider” – “the skint get used in loo roll shoes” – but elsewhere this is a record that expands the idea of what Sleaford Mods could be.“Do you still have that photograph? Would you use it to hurt me?” asks Australian indie rocker Julia Jacklin, against the menacing throb of “Body”. The tension is stormy: imagine a mid-period Fleetwood Mac song, covered by Cat Power. It’s a masterclass in narrative songwriting.With praise from Kendrick Lamar, five EPs released by the time she was 21, tours with Lauryn Hill, collaborations with Gorillaz and two critically praised albums – including 2017’s excellent concept album Stillness in Wonderland – fans and critics alike wondered what else Little Simz could do to find the kind of mainstream success enjoyed by so many of her male peers.1367 Solange – When I Get HomeSolange Knowles has never been coy about the intent behind her music. Beautiful arrangements and seamless production notwithstanding, you get the sense, each time she drop a project, that it serves a distinct, zeitgeist-shifting purpose.1467 Foals – Everything Not Saved Will be Lost (Part 1)FoalsMerging their asymmetrical early math pop with the deep space atmospherics of Total Life Forever and Holy Fire, plus added innovations – ambient rainforest throbs on “Moonlight”, deadpan EDM on “In Degrees”, Afro-glitch Radiohead on “Café D’Athens” – they’ve created an inspired album of scorched earth new music that, in all likelihood, will only really be challenged for album of the year by Part 2. (Mark Beaumont)Tracks are at once astute and deeply personal in how they capture vignettes of everyday life and spin them into important lessons. “Black”, the most recent single from the record, considers what that word means to different people around the world, as well as to Dave. “Voices” has him singing over an old-school garage beat, fighting off personal demons.At her best, Sigrid throws out precision-tooled high notes like icicle javelins into vast, blue Scandi-produced skies. Then she growls like an Icelandic volcano preparing to disrupt western civilisation until we sort ourselves out.1767 Karen O and Danger Mouse – Lux PrimaLux Prima was born just over a decade ago from a drunken phone call from Karen O to Danger Mouse – real name Brian Joseph Burton – during which the pair vowed they would work on something together. It wasn’t until after O had given birth to her son, though, that recording finally began, and there is a beatific sense of contentment on songs like “Drown”, with its Kamasi Washington-like choirs and stately horns.This is an ambitious creation, meticulously crafted and assembled. For a start, the range of guest performers is a cornucopia of contemporary soul and hip-hop collaborators: vocalists Moses Sumney, Roots Manuva, Heidi Vogel, Grey Reverend and Tawiah strings player Miguel Atwood-Ferguson, and keyboardist Dennis Hamm – both of whom have worked with Flying Lotus and Thundercat.Rose – who found fame in the UK’s indie-folk scene as an unofficial member of Bombay Bicycle Club in 2010, only to walk away amid the band’s growing hype – is darkly compelling on No Words Left. Assisted by producer Tim Bidwell, who worked on Rose’s last record Something’s Changing, she sounds braver than she ever has before. There are moments that recall her Communion labelmate Ben Howard, on his latest album, Noonday Dream, and others that nod to the quiet stoicism of Joni Mitchell and Neil Young. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)The record is loosely conceptual insomuch as it’s punctuated with mock adverts for “WWAY HEALTH, our 247 care programme”. But don’t be put off: Miss Universe is a brilliant collection of songs, an expansive melange of indie, jazz, pop and trip-hop that flits between a lo-fi sparseness and something The Strokes would play. Yanya – who is of Turkish-Irish-Bajan heritage – grew up in London on a mix of Pixies, Nina Simone, The Libertines and Amy Winehouse, and this unlikely combination is certainly reflected in the sound. (Patrick Smith)2167 Jenny Lewis – On the LineHere, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (Elisa Bray)Comprising songs from Segall’s eclectic (that’s putting it lightly) catalogue and performed by him and the Freedom Band (Mikal Cronin, Charles Moothart, Emmett Kelly, and Ben Boye), the album is delightfully short and sweet. It is certainly a drastic switch-up from Freedom’s Goblin (2018), which had 19 tracks and ran for 75 minutes.If you want to know how hard it is to categorise Titanic Rising – the enthralling fourth album from Weyes Blood – look no further than the American musician’s own attempt to do so. It is, she says, “The Kinks meet the Second World War, or Bob Seger meets Enya.”Tension aside, there’s a great sense of fun here. The title track is pure euphoria, as restless synths of a Utah Saints or Orbital rave break into swelling bass and melody. And they create the full club experience with “Got to Keep On”, on which the four-to-the-floor beat, funky rhythm guitar, sweet backing vocals and chiming bells make way for the simple sounds of happy party-goers just as the anticipation builds, so does the instrumentation into a hypnotic crescendo. It’s masterful production. (Elisa Bray)Six months after the release of Oxnard, Anderson .Paak returns with another Dr Dre-produced record, Ventura. Where the former was overflowing with choppy, experimental sounds, guest appearances and clumsy attempts at Gil Scott Heron-esque revolutionary lyrics, the sequel – recorded around the same time – streamlines .Paak’s sound, making for a tightly packaged, melodic and danceable album.Two years after the release of his Mercury Prize-nominated debut Yesterday’s Gone, the south London hip-hop artist unveils its follow-up, Not Waving, But Drowning. And if any two records could portray how quickly someone can grow from a boy to a man, it’s these.2767 Lizzo – Cuz I Love YouNo one could accuse Lizzo of holding back. Not when it comes to her voice – which is raw and rowdy, so laden with personality even the vulnerable moments are a joy to listen to –  and certainly not when it comes to her message of unabashed self-love. That’s the predominant theme of the singer  rapper  flautist-extraordinaire’s hugely likeable third album, Cuz I Love You.It seems as likely as Old Man Steptoe dining with the Rees-Mogg, but this new tactic of burying their confrontational gruesomeness beneath a veneer of alt-rock respectability for album three works well for Fat White Family. Drenched in chamber strings and celestial harmonies, the plush yet sinister “Oh Sebastian” could be Pet Sounds selling its soul to the devil. “Fringe Runner” is so sleek and funksome it could be a New Romantic “White Lines (Don’t Don’t Do It)” “Kim’s Sunsets” is a piece of refined cosmic reggae resembling a blissed-out “Bankrobber”.2967 Cage the Elephant – Social CuesOn Cage the Elephant’s fifth album, Social Cues, frontman Matt Shultz reacts to the breakdown of his marriage and the loss of three close friends. He undergoes a kind of Jekyll and Hyde transition through the 13 tracks, the result of which is the band’s best work to date.SOAK reaches to outsiders once again on her new album. 3167 The Cranberries – In the EndThere’s a cruel irony that the release of The Cranberries’ final album should come just a week after journalist Lyra McKee was shot dead by the New IRA during a riot in Londonderry. “Zombie” was a protest song written by the band’s late frontwoman Dolores O’Riordan after two children were killed by IRA bombs – was released. She was deeply affected by the deaths, and would no doubt have been devastated by recent events in Northern Ireland as well.On her third record, Aldous Harding combines the gothic folk of her self-titled 2014 debut with the dramatically intimate tones of her follow-up album Party.Big Thief’s frontwoman Adrianne Lenker has an uncanny ability to make you feel like you’re in on a secret. Her whispering, spectral delivery and deeply personal lyrics are the key to this. Even on the band’s third album UFOF, with an audience that has grown exponentially in the past few years, the songs are still immensely intimate affairs.On his debut album, the 24-year-old Collard mixes sultry jams that recall the electronic funk of MGMT with nods to the greats: Prince, James Brown, Led Zeppelin and Marvin Gaye. Throughout, Collard exhibits his extraordinary voice, which swoops to a devilishly low murmur or soars to an ecstatic falsetto.   Dedicated covers the full, but generic, spectrum of relationships: dizzying love, lust, and break-ups. But whether she’s pining for the return of a former love in the funky disco banger “Julien”, or singing about masturbating post-break-up in lead single “Party For One” (“I’ll be the one If you don’t care about me Making love to myself Back on my beat”), the vibe remains positively jubilant.Getty Images for Spotify3667 Tyler, the Creator - IGOR“I don’t know where I’m going,” Tyler, the Creator begins on the song “I THINK”. “But I know what I’m showing.” The US artist’s words ring true throughout his fifth studio album, IGOR, where he adopts the dark and twisted mutterings of the Frankenstein character from which the record gets its name. It’s been a long wait for Flying Lotus’s new album. In fact, the LA producer has been masterminding Flamagra for the past five years – snatching moments between collaborating with Kendrick Lamar on To Pimp a Butterfly, directing and writing the comic horror movie Kuso, producing much of Thundercat’s Drunk and growing his Brainfeeder label.A heftier sound is never at the cost of melody, which shines through in Thomson’s vocals, the rest of the band’s backing falsetto, and the searing blues grooves stamped all over Future Dust. Those qualities are captured nowhere more satisfyingly than on “25”. “All Over Town” is their singalong anthem, neatly positioned in the middle to ease the pace.In keeping with the relatively restrained guest spots, it’s heartening just how much Skepta has rejected overloading Ignorance is Bliss with high-profile producers, preferring instead to burrow into his own aesthetic. There’s no attempt to chase someone else’s wave here no token drill, afroswing or trap beats to satisfy playlist algorithms. Instead, his cold grime sonics are rendered down to their no-frills essentials – brutalist blocks of sad angular melodies and hard, spacious drums.Bruce Springsteen seems to have told almost every tale in the grand old storybook of American mythologies, except perhaps one: a wide-eyed Californian dreamer finds the Golden State turns sour and flees back east, to some romantic speck of a town, to pine and rehabilitate. It’s the classic pop plotline of Bacharach and David’s “Do You Know the Way to San Jose?”, and it’s a tale Springsteen taps repeatedly here, on his sumptuous, cinematic 19th album, which is nothing short of a late-period masterpiece.A revolving door of female vocalists (A-listers, indie darlings like Angel Olsen and unsung songwriters) deliver heartbroken lines over big, shiny beats and synths. The emotional cohesion the record loses in its shifting cast of singerssongwritersgenres it makes up in DJ-savvy textural variety. Help Us Stranger reaches all corners of guitar rock: funky Detroit garage (“What’s Yours Is Mine”) country soul (“Somedays (I Don’t Feel Like Trying)”) psych (a cover of Donovan’s “Hey Gyp (Dig the Slowness)”) blues and bluegrass (“Thoughts and Prayers”). A cornucopia of instrumentation is woven into its brisk 42-minute yarn.4367 Hot Chip - A Bath Full of EcstasyWhen Hot Chip achieved chart success with their second album, 2006’s The Warning, it seemed more like a happy coincidence than a sign they were conforming to current pop trends. Since then, they\u0027ve released a string of consistently great albums, from 2008’s Made in the Dark (featuring their only Top 10 single to date, “Ready for the Floor”) to this, their seventh and best record, A Bath Full of Ecstasy. The record frequently switches in tone: Banks can be both formidable and vulnerable, accusatory or filled with regret. “Gimme” demands sex and refuses to be shamed for it “Contaminated” mourns a toxic relationship that can’t be saved and “Stroke” is a bitter riposte to a man emulating the Greek figure Narcissus – laid over a funk guitar riff.4567 Mini Mansions – Guy Walks into a BarMikey Shuman shares vocal duties with Tyler Parkford his voice falls somewhere between the sleazy drawl of his QOTSA bandmate Josh Homme and Alex Turner’s more adenoidal tone on opener “We Should Be Dancing”. With tracks that frequently dart from sprawling, psychedelic pop to scuzzy post-punk and rock references, the record has a superb dynamic that holds the listener’s attention, while the band navigate through a single, tumultuous relationship. By the end of all that, you feel like they deserve a pint. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)Hackman’s debut album, 2015’s We Slept At Last, was a gentle, unprovocative affair –  though if you listened closely, the dark, sexual energy that convulses through her current sound was already there. Her second, I’m Not Your Man, was scuzzier and more explicitly queer – a road she continues down with Any Human Friend, a blunt, bold album on which Hackman’s beatific voice sits atop methodically messy instrumentals.Frontman Corey Taylor, who had just emerged from a toxic relationship when recording this album, addresses feelings of belittlement and inadequacy with unflinching honesty and some of his best vocal work in years. Over the Celtic influences of “Solway Firth” (at one point, he seems to attempt some Cockney screamo) he issues a blistering riposte to the people he holds responsible for his negative mindset.There’s an increased anxiety, both corporeal and emotional, running through The Center Won’t Hold, a pent-up desire to break free from something – though they never seem quite sure what. “Disconnect me from my bones, so I can float, so I can roam,” sings Brownstein – her singular voice all yelps and creaks – on “Hurry On Home”. On “Reach Out”, Tucker begs, her voice a little sleeker than Brownstein’s but no less commanding, “Reach out and see me, I’m losing my head.” Quietly discordant piano ballad “Broken” pays tribute to Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused supreme court judge Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault: “Me, me too, my body cried out when she spoke those lines.”The overarching sound, production and instrumentation on Eve are outstanding. Produced by Rapsody’s long-time collaborator and mentor 9th Wonder, the record samples cuts from Herbie Hancock’s “Watermelon Man” (“Whoopi”) and Phil Collins’s “In the Air Tonight” (“Cleo”), offers a smooth R\u0026ampB joint with “Aaliyah” featuring the late singer’s ghostly backing vocals, and includes an interlude that is “an ode to the black woman’s body”. As on Laila’s Wisdom, Eve conveys Rapsody’s natural feel for funk – “Michelle” (Obama) bounces in on a jaunty piano riff – but other tracks, such as closer “Afeni”, are pure soul.  Swift has a habit of putting her worst foot forward. The album’s lead single, “Me!”, is peppy and poppy in all the wrong ways, a rictus grin of a song that rings hollow. Thank goodness that the rest of the album is nothing like that. Perky opening track “Forgot That You Existed” is a syncopated snigger, on which Swift shrugs off old grudges and breathes a sigh of relief in doing so. “Something magical happened one night,” she sings. “I forgot that you existed. And I thought that it would kill me, but it didn’t.” The title track, meanwhile, is poignant and unfussy, a reminder of Swift’s ability to distil infatuation into something specific and universal. (Alexandra Pollard)One could argue that there’s too much eclecticism here – that if this really is Crow’s final LP, she perhaps could have gone for something with a more singular sound. But then it wouldn’t be a Sheryl Crow album. She sings about the fear of the unknown on “Flying Blind” – her steely determination on this record has you believing that she’ll take the leap regardless. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)There’s more of a soul influence here – “HER Love”, the counterpoint to his 1994 track “I Used to Love HER”,  benefits from the gospel-like vocals of Daniel Caesar and Dwele, while “Memories of Home” skitters over a muffled bass and Common’s recollections of his past – including an incident where he was molested by a family member.This is Del Rey at her most assertive – personally, if not politically. Those hoping for a barbed protest record in keeping with Del Rey’s newfound public activism (last year she called President Trump a “narcissist” who “believes it’s OK to grab a woman by the pussy just because he’s famous”) will be disappointed. But it is gratifying to hear her take control. Aside from “Happiness Is a Butterfly”, that is. “If he’s a serial killer, then what’s the worst that can happen to a girl who’s already hurt?” she asks. Crikey.Assisted by veteran producer John Congleton (St Vincent, John Grant), he channels the spirit of David Bowie and Iggy Pop. He screeches over distorted “ooh oohs” via The Rolling Stones’s “Sympathy for the Devil” on opener “Calm Down aka I Should Not Be Alone”. “Transition from Nowhere to Nowhere” is sung in a Ziggy Stardust croon, while “Rated R Crusaders” shows Furman exploring his Jewish identity in the era of the IsraelPalestine conflict.If Brothers, their brawny album from 2010, turned the pair into serious rock contenders, then 2011’s El Camino cemented their reputation. Yet neither can claim to be as fiendishly catchy as Let’s Rock, a record that can scarcely sit still. On opener “Shine a Light”, the riffs are big, the momentum irresistible, with frontmanguitarist Dan Auerbach layering scabrous licks over ACDC-like chords. Backing singers Leisa Hans and Ashley Wilcoxson add texture to the grooving “LoHi”, while the languid “Sit Around and Miss You” is Stealers Wheels by way of the Deep South. Listen to the melodic harmonies in “Tell Me Lies” and it’s not just the lyrics that’ll remind you of Fleetwood Mac. The tones here are stark and bleak, compared to the claustrophobia of 2014’s Tomorrow’s Modern Boxes. You can hear his paranoia in the stuttering techno opener “Traffic”, which channels the heady grooves and pulses of electronic artist Floating Points (who, with his neuroscience background, seems like an entirely fitting reference point).There are plenty of surprises, like Swizz Beats singing on “Who Are You” against elegant violins that recall a Kamasi Washington composition. “Adult Film” features a gorgeous piano riff the Pete Rock-produced “The Art of It” has a delicious funk vibe “It Never Ends” comes full circle via a bright piano loop. Where a full album produced by Kanye West (2018’s Nasir) didn’t pan out – perhaps because West’s perfectionism was a bad fit for Nas’s penchant for procrastination – “You Mean the World to Me” sounds like it would have been a standout on that record had it not been abandoned on the cutting-room floor. Now it’s a standout on this album. For all the album’s eccentricities, the vibe is earnest fairytale rather than tongue-in-cheek – save for the sound of a strangled feline mirroring the lyrics “when you stepped on your cat” on “How Many Times”. Epic highlight “Electric Fire” and celestial album-closer “How Can a Head” capture Coyne at his most wistful. The latter is a wide-eyed, strings-laden gem, its childlike, questing lyrics poignant whatever your age. 5967 Bat for Lashes – Lost GirlsGiven our current preoccupation with the Eighties, you could argue that Lost Girls is hardly breaking new ground – and yes, nostalgia is a fairly generic formula. But listened to as a whole, the album positively thrums with sonic invention, managing to feel both fresh and full of intrigue. Khan once again demonstrates a knack for uncanny storytelling. Three of her past albums have been nominated for Mercurys expect this to make it four. (Patrick Smith)6067 MUNA – Saves the WorldMUNA might not be a household name yet, but their influence runs through the charts like a stick of rock these days. Listen to Katy Perry’s summer smash “Never Really Over”, or Taylor Swift’s feminist clap back “The Man”, and you’ll hear the same dense, sticky synths and brawny beats that the emo-pop trio have been honing for the past three years. Their debut album, 2017’s About U, was raw, poignant and just the ride side of melodramatic, queering the mainstream, one sad-pop anthem at a time.6167 Pixies – Beneath the EyrieTales of witchy curses (“On Graveyard Hill”) and spirit reincarnation (“Daniel Boone”) feel like they’ve been dug up from ancient folklore, and capture classic-Pixies menace and ghoulish spirit. Over the album’s 12 tracks, ghostly organs and minor-key guitar-picked sequences help to conjure this dark, Gothic vibe. Yet for all its darkness, Beneath the Eyrie is brimming with the kind of melody that we expect from these indie-rock giants from the late Eighties. “Ready for Love” is a melancholy ballad with harmonising vocals from bassist Paz Lenchantin (Kim Deal’s now-permanent replacement), while lead single “Catfish Kate” – a tale of a woman battling a catfish in a river told by Black Jack Hooligan – is a rock hit in waiting. (Elisa Bray)6267 Jenny Hval – The Practice of LoveThis endlessly fascinating artist’s seventh, full-length, album The Practice of Love is just as considered as 2016\u0027s Blood Bitch, examining one’s role in humankind and on Earth, and probing that favourite of pop-song themes: love. But where the 2017 Nordic Music Prize-winning Blood Bitch was packed with visceral imagery and disarming sonics, the themes of The Practice of Love are encased in a warm cocoon of poetry, blissed-out circling synths and trance-like Nineties beats. (Elisa Bray)This is nomy at their most ambitious and pleasurably weird. As with the dreamy “Upset My Girlfriend”, which speaks of a man about to propose to his partner despite the fight they’re in, it’s an album stranded somewhere between pure joy and unexplainable sadness like slapping on a false smile despite feeling miserable, and recognising how much it helps in the moment. (Adam White)Listening on headphones, I was reminded of the late French designer Janet Laverriere. Born in 1909, she was still a powerful, playful force when I interviewed her for this paper in her eighties. She banged a cast iron radiator with a spoon to celebrate the echoes and curves of essential pipework: “I put all the hard plumbing on the outside. In kitchens, in bathrooms, I am feminist, evidemment!”Fender drew plenty of early comparisons to Bruce Springsteen – on Hypersonic Missiles they’re entirely warranted, as much for the instrumentation as the lyricism and his vignettes of working-class struggle. There are sax solos (more than one), and pounding rhythms that make you want to jump in a car and drive down a highway at sunset, and blistering electric guitars next to classic troubadour acoustics. He has Springsteen’s rousing holler, and the early indications of someone who could be the voice of a generation – not because he wants to be, but because he sees things and understands. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)Why Me? Why Not. is enjoyably defiant, Gallagher embodying a settled and contented aura. “Gotta live for something besides yesterdays,” Gallagher snarls on “Be Still”. The downbeat “Once” forgoes easy Noel-bashing for a mournful glance at the years when the pair were still speaking (“I remember how you used to shine back then... but you only get to do it once”). And “Now That I’ve Found You” is even somewhat sickly-sweet in tone, a cheery tribute to his daughter Molly, whom he met for the first time when she was 21. “I know it’s late for lullabies, but the future is yours and mine,” he sings, alongside upbeat whoops and Radio 2-friendly guitars.The album takes a deep, contemplative breath on “Short and Sweet”, which is exactly what it promises, a Grace Jones-like ballad on which Howard’s voice takes precedent over inconspicuous guitar, and the background hisses like an old vinyl. On “He Loves Me”, she grapples with maintaining a relationship with God when she’s long since stopped going to church.  It’s a size medium and was obtained from\u0026nbspJackie\u0026nbspFarry, a friend of the Cobain family who was once the nanny of\u0026nbspFrances Bean Cobain, Cobain\u0026nbspand Courtney Love’s daughter.The sweater was obtained from Jackie Farry, a close friend of the Cobain family, and is accompanied by both a handwritten letter and a typed, signed letter from Farry.“It’s very important that we don’t wash it,” Darren Julien of Julien’s Auctions told Rolling Stone. “The stains are still there. There’s even cigarettes burns that you can see on the sweater.”The cardigan is currently owned by a businessman who has preferred not to reveal his identity.The auction will go live on 25 October.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I tried, you know? But that’s not cinema,” he said.“Honestly, the closest I can think of them, as well made as they are, with actors doing the best they can under the circumstances, is theme parks.“It isn’t the cinema of human beings trying to convey emotional, psychological experiences to another human being.”Created with Sketch.Best films of 2019 (so far) Show all 41Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.“Macabre and fraught though The Favourite gets, this isn’t so much a film about sex or power as it is about plain mischief. It’s a hilarious, buffoonish pleasure, right down to the sets and costume design, and a breeze to spend 120 minutes with.” Christopher Hooton“Casting Chalamet as Nic was a very clever move. The young actor from Call Me by Your Name and Lady Bird has a natural charm and charisma. He still engages an audience’s curiosity and sympathy even when his behaviour is at its most selfish and erratic.” Geoffrey Macnab341 The House by the Sea“Guédiguian’s storytelling style is deceptive. At first, it seems as if this is low-key social realism in the Dardennes or Ken Loach mould, albeit set on the French Riviera. Gradually, though, we realise how stylised and theatrical his approach really is.” Geoffrey Macnab“Director Jon S Baird, whose previous film was scabrous Irvine Welsh adaptation Filth, wrings every last drop of pathos he can from his material. This is very much a case of the tears of the clowns.” Geoffrey Macnab“Vice is bravura storytelling. McKay isn’t only taking us through Cheney’s life and career but is giving us a whistle stop tour through US politics from the Nixon administration almost right to the present day.” Geoffrey Macnab“Playing Lee Israel, McCarthy manages something very special: she makes a character who is odd, obnoxious, difficult and alcoholic seem lovable and even heroic. The rest of the world is at fault, not Lee.” Geoffrey MacnabGreen Book flatters the audience about its own good sense and tolerance. It deals with racism and homophobia but still has a fairytale, fantasy feel to it. Whatever humiliations Don endures on their road trip, we know no real harm will ever come to him as long as Tony is at his side.” Geoffrey Macnab“The golden age of bonkers horror movies is gloriously evoked by Netflix’s latest feature length presentation. Beginning as a satire of the arts world, Velvet Buzzsaw swiftly and gleefully descends into a savage splatter-fest, smeared in paint, viscera and garishly-bright blood.” Ed Power“Written by Ben Elton and directed by its star Kenneth Branagh, the film plays so fast and loose with the playwright’s final years that they needn’t have bothered fitting Branagh with a prosthetic nose – accuracy is clearly not the priority here.” Alexandra PollardThe Lego Movie 2: The Second Part is the doomed progeny of a celebrated genius – brilliant but slightly stunted by the knowledge they will never live up to their predecessor.” Clarisse Loughrey“Nicolas Pesce’s sleek and stylish horror comedy is repulsive and funny by turns. In adapting Ryu Murakami’s cult novel, Pesce strikes just the right balance between humour and Grand Guignol-style shock tactics.” Geoffrey MacnabThe best moments here are remarkable. Labaki elicits an astonishing performance from her young lead. He’s an irrepressible figure with such an inbuilt sense of moral decency the film seems upbeat and optimistic, even at its darkest moments.” Geoffrey MacnabRalph Fiennes combines thriller elements with poetic flashbacks to ballet legend Rudolf Nureyev’s childhood and keeps a tight focus on the dancer. When he is most at risk, Nureyev makes decisions with his artistic future more in mind than his personal safety. As Fiennes reminds us again and again in what is his best film yet as a director, the \u0027white crow\u0027 will do anything to put himself in the limelight, the one place he is convinced he belongs.Border reverses the perspective taken by most other horror films. In more conventional genre fare, Tina and Vore would be portrayed as malevolent outsiders, but in the world conjured up by director Ali Abbasi, the humans are the monsters. Tina is the innocent – a visionary who hardly understands her own powers but who can sense human venality and corruption wherever it appears.1641 Fighting with My FamilyCertain scenes feel very trite and predictable but the film gets you in a choke hold early on and won’t let you go. It is far more gripping than its subject matter might suggest. Who ever would believe a story about a wrestling family from Norwich could have quite such heart and resonance?Doppelgangers abound in Jordan Peele’s weird, creepy and ingenious new horror film. As in his Oscar-winning 2017 feature Get Out, Peele leavens matters with ironic humour but the joking becomes increasingly uncomfortable once the main characters come face to face with dark shadows of themselves which wish them extreme harm.The Avengers cycle comes to a rich and very satisfying conclusion with Endgame, surely the most complex and emotional superhero movie in Marvel history. At 181 minutes, this is a veritable epic, but with so many characters and plot strands, it fully warrants its lengthy running time.It’s a rare and precious feeling when a film completely dismantles you. Eighth Grade – the directorial debut of US comedian Bo Burnham – breaks down every delusion we have about ourselves and burrows deep into those parts we’ve made such an effort to lock away. You may cry. You may shudder as every awkward social interaction that’s kept you up at night replays in your head all at once. You may feel the sharp pain associated with those moments when you feel completely isolated from the world. Burnham may have crafted a simple story about the most ordinary of teenage girls, but it speaks with the emotions of a true cinematic epic.Natalie Portman gives her fiercest, most memorable performance since Black Swan in Brady Corbet’s enjoyably subversive satire about a troubled pop star whose loss of innocence mirrors the fall from grace of the US itself. Portman’s character, Celeste, is certainly one of the most objectionable figures she has played: a pampered, hard-drinking drug-taking “floozy” whose appearance and high-handed behaviour rekindle memories of Liz Taylor and Joan Crawford at their monstrous worst.Robert Pattinson gives one of his most striking performances as Monte, the death-row criminal in outer space, tricked into making a voyage described at one stage as a “class-one suicide ride”. The former Twilight star makes his shaven-headed, gaunt-faced character seem hyper naturally sensitive and feral at the same time.Amazing Grace is as uplifting a film as you will see all year. It’s a concert movie filmed over two nights and featuring Aretha Franklin, the “first lady of soul”, performing gospel standards in a church in Los Angeles in 1972, with a huge backing choir and an enthusiastic congregation.Disney’s live-action remake of its 1992 animated feature is a rip-roaring, old-fashioned matinee-style spectacle that turns out far better than we had any right to expect.“Olivia Wilde is a visually inventive director, who keeps the tempo here so brisk that we hardly notice how glib the storytelling sometimes becomes. We can tell exactly how the film will end, but it still feels original both in its screwball energy and in the deft way it continually reverses stereotypes and gender clichés.” “Late Night is a caustic satirical comedy that turns into an unlikely tearjerker. It’s by turns snide and uplifting, and often very funny too. Its writerproducerstar Mindy Kaling makes vicious observations about the inanity, narcissism and corruption of the mainstream US media at the same time as she celebrates the professionalism of many of those who work within it.“Gloria Bell is somewhat exhausting – both unbearably intimate and at a constant remove – but it is endlessly pulled back into focus by Moore, who has a firm understanding of the delicate balance between contentment and yearning, joy and pain, recklessness and spontaneity. In a remake that could have felt indulgent in the hands of people less skilled, she more than justifies its existence.”The brilliance of the new film lies in the surefooted way it caters both for children too young to have seen its predecessors and for adults who’ve grown up (or grown older) watching the previous instalments. It takes some kind of genius for the Pixar animators to give such a searing emotional charge to a story in which one of the main characters is a single use plastic spork retrieved from the trash.Perhaps The Flood isn’t quite the urgent, profound film a crisis of this scale deserves, but in a culture where refugees are so rarely shown any empathy in mainstream media, maybe this is the film we need right now.Ari Aster\u0027s follow-up to Hereditary serves up much of the same: it’s a break-up movie wrapped up in pagan horror. It’s also bound to be one of this year’s most memorable films, proving that Aster is far from a one-hit wonder.The Lion King is undoubtedly a technological marvel that, much like Avatar, will come to be viewed as a milestone in special effects history, yet it’s just as interesting to see how all this innovation has been employed.3241 Varda by Agnès  For a film that’s almost entirely narrated by Agnès Varda\u0027s own voice, it doesn’t feel driven by ego, but by pure intellectual and emotional curiosity.Animals treats its subjects with patience and generosity. You’ll find no life lessons here. Its main characters are free to pursue their desires, to whatever end.3441 Blinded by the LightBlinded by the Light offers not only a reminder of Springsteen’s lyrical genius, but of how he’s always served as a beacon for the disenfranchised.Lined up against some of this year’s other more heartfelt offerings, including Booksmart, Good Boys offers further proof that putting a little humanity in our comedy always gets the best results. Hustlers is an electrifying response to the deluge of stories we’ve had over the years about very rich, very bad dudes. Finally, we can turn the tables on every film that’s used women, specifically strippers, as decorative accessories to drape over businessmen as they conduct their illicit backroom meetings. Or, failing that, to shake their out-of-focus tits in the background of a shot.For Sama is one of the most profoundly intimate depictions of the Syrian conflict ever put to film. It’s the push to help those on the outside process something so incomprehensible in the depth of its horrors.The real drama here is not whether or not apocalypse can be avoided but whether Brad Pitt’s character can reconcile himself with his father and overcome his own extreme emotional repression. In other words, in spite of all the jargon and the hardware, this is an intimate family melodrama at heart. Thanks to Pitt’s performance and Gray’s delicate direction, it turns into a very moving one.Wrapped up in all the intricacies of immigrant identity and family politics, The Farewell is a comedy of warmth and bracing honesty. Simply put, it’s one of the best films of the year.This is Renée Zellweger’s Judy. It doesn’t belong to Rupert Goold, its director. Nor does it belong to Tom Edge, its screenwriter. It’s a performance of such overwhelming force that it wrests authorship from every other hand that guided the film’s creation.4141 Ready or NotAs absurd and self-indulgent as Ready or Not can get, it doesn’t mess around with its social commentary. The class system is the game we never asked to play, don’t get a fair chance at, and have no hope of winning. It’s a timeless metaphor.“Macabre and fraught though The Favourite gets, this isn’t so much a film about sex or power as it is about plain mischief. It’s a hilarious, buffoonish pleasure, right down to the sets and costume design, and a breeze to spend 120 minutes with.” Christopher Hooton“Casting Chalamet as Nic was a very clever move.

Her novels are written in Polish and translated into English by Antonia Lloyd-Jones and Jennifer Croft.She caused outrage among right-wing Polish patriots after commenting that Poland, which likes to depict itself as a plucky survivor of oppression through history, had itself committed “horrendous acts” of colonisation. For a time she was given bodyguards by her publisher as protection, after being branded a “targowiczanin” – an ancient Polish term\u0026nbspfor “traitor” – by her detractors.Handke, who has been producing a number of works in varying genres for more than 50 years,\u0026nbspwas honoured “for an influential work that with linguistic ingenuity\u0026nbsphas\u0026nbspexplored the periphery and the specificity of human experience”.Explaining its decision, the Nobel Prize said that Tokarczuk “never views reality as something stable or everlasting. She constructs her novels in a tension between cultural opposites nature versus culture, reason versus madness, male versus female, home versus alienation.”Of Handke,\u0026nbspthe academy said: “The peculiar art of Peter Handke, awarded the 2019 Nobel Prize in Literature, is the extraordinary attention to landscapes and the material presence of the world, which has made cinema and painting two of his greatest sources of inspiration.”Created with Sketch.40 books to read before you die Show all 40Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.140 Pride and Prejudice, Jane AustenIt is a fact universally acknowledged that every list of great books must include Pride and Prejudice. Don’t be fooled by the bonnets and balls: beneath the sugary surface is a tart exposé of the marriage market in Georgian England. For every lucky Elizabeth, who tames the haughty, handsome Mr. Darcy and learns to know herself in the process, there’s a Charlotte, resigned to life with a driveling buffoon for want of a pretty face.240 The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole, Aged 13 ¾, Sue TownsendRead this one when you’re decrepit enough, and chances are you’ll die laughing. No-one has lampooned the self-absorption, delusions of grandeur and sexual frustration of adolescence as brilliantly as Susan Townsend, and no one ever will. Beyond the majestically majestic poetry and the pimples, there’s also a sharp satire of Thatcherist Britain.It’s not often an idiom coined in a novel becomes a catch-phrase, but Joseph Heller managed it with his madcap, savage and hilarious tour de force. War is the ultimate dead-end for logic, and this novel explores all its absurdities as we follow US bombardier pilot Captain John Yossarian. While Heller drew on his own experience as a WWII pilot, it was the McCarthyism of the fifties that fueled the book’s glorious rage.440 Tess of the d’Urbervilles, Thomas HardyA good 125 years before #metoo, Thomas Hardy skewered the sexual hypocrisy of the Victorian age in this melodramatic but immensely moving novel. Tess is a naïve girl from a poor family who is raped by a wealthy land-owner. After the death of her baby, she tries to build a new life, but the “shame” of her past casts a long shadow. Read this if you want to understand the rotten culture at the root of victim-blaming.A classic exposé of colonialism, Achebe’s novel explores what happens to a Nigerian village when European missionaries arrive. The main character, warrior-like Okonkwo, embodies the traditional values that are ultimately doomed. By the time Achebe was born in 1930, missionaries had been settled in his village for decades. He wrote in English and took the title of his novel from a Yeats poem, but wove Igbo proverbs throughout this lyrical work.The ultimate piece of dystopian fiction, 1984 was so prescient that it’s become a cliché. But forget TV’s Big Brother or the trite travesty of Room 101: the original has lost none of its furious force. Orwell was interested in the mechanics of totalitarianism, imagining a society that took the paranoid surveillance of the Soviets to chilling conclusions. Our hero, Winston, tries to resist a grey world where a screen watches your every move, but bravery is ultimately futile when the state worms its way inside your mind.A timeless plea for justice in the setting of America’s racist South during the depression years, Lee’s novel caused a sensation. Her device was simple but incendiary: look at the world through the eyes of a six-year-old, in this case, Jean Louise Finch, whose father is a lawyer defending a black man falsely accused of raping a white woman. Lee hoped for nothing but “a quick and merciful death at the hands of the reviewers”: she won the Pulitzer and a place on the curriculum.Dickens was the social conscience of the Victorian age, but don’t let that put you off. Great Expectations is the roiling tale of the orphaned Pip, the lovely Estella, and the thwarted Miss Havisham. First written in serial form, you barely have time to recover from one cliffhanger before the next one beckons, all told in Dickens’ luxuriant, humorous, heartfelt prose.940 The God of Small Things, Arundhati RoyRoy won the 1997 Booker Prize with her debut novel, a powerful intergenerational tale of love that crosses caste lines in southern India, and the appalling consequences for those who break the taboos dictating “who should be loved, and how. And how much”. Sex, death, religion, the ambivalent pull of motherhood: it’s all there in this beautiful and haunting book.In an astonishing act of literary ventriloquism, Mantel inhabits a fictionalised version of Thomas Cromwell, a working-class boy who rose through his own fierce intelligence to be a key player in the treacherous world of Tudor politics. Historical fiction so immersive you can smell the fear and ambition.1140 The Code of the Woosters, PG WodehouseIf you haven’t read PG Wodehouse in a hot bath with a snifter of whisky and ideally a rubber duck for company, you haven’t lived. Wallow in this sublimely silly tale of the ultimate comic double act: bumbling aristocrat Bertie Wooster and his omniscient butler, Jeeves. A sheer joy to read that also manages to satirise British fascist leader Oswald Mosley as a querulous grump in black shorts.Shelley was just 18 when she wrote Frankenstein as part of a challenge with her future husband, Percy Shelley, and Lord Byron, to concoct the best horror story. Put down the green face paint: Frankenstein’s monster is a complex creation who yearns for sympathy and companionship. Some 200 years after it was first published, the gothic tale feels more relevant than ever as genetic science pushes the boundaries of what it means to create life. 1340 Lord of the Flies, William GoldingAnyone who has ever suspected that children are primitive little beasties will nod sagely as they read Golding’s classic. His theory is this: maroon a bunch of schoolboys on an island, and watch how quickly the trappings of decent behaviour fall away. Never has a broken pair of spectacles seemed so sinister, or civilisation so fragile.The protagonist of Rushdie’s most celebrated novel is born at the exact moment India gains independence. He’s also born with superpowers, and he’s not the only one. In an audacious and poetic piece of magical realism, Rushdie tells the story of India’s blood-soaked resurgence via a swathe of children born at midnight with uncanny abilities.You will need a cold, dead heart not to be moved by one of literature’s steeliest heroines. From the institutional cruelty of her boarding school, the “small, plain” Jane Eyre becomes a governess who demands a right to think and feel. Not many love stories take in a mad woman in the attic and a spot of therapeutic disfigurement, but this one somehow carries it off with mythic aplombThis is a richly satisfying slow burn of a novel that follows the lives and loves of the inhabitants of a small town in England through the years 1829–32. The acerbic wit and timeless truth of its observations mark this out as a work of genius but at the time the author, Mary Anne Evans, had to turn to a male pen name to be taken seriously. Stick another log on the fire and curl up with this dark, peculiar and quite brilliant literary murder tale. A group of classics students become entranced by Greek mythology - and then take it up a level. Remember, kids: never try your own delirious Dionysian ritual at home. A subtle and engrossing look at racial identity, through the story of a charismatic young Nigerian woman who leaves her comfortable Lagos home for a world of struggles in the United States. Capturing both the hard-scrabble life of US immigrants and the brash isions of a rising Nigeria, Adichie crosses continents with all her usual depth of feeling and lightness of touch.An absolute unadulterated comic joy of a novel. Stella Gibbons neatly pokes fun at sentimental navel-gazing with her zesty heroine Flora, who is more interested in basic hygiene than histrionics. In other words, if you’ve “seen something nasty in the woodshed,” just shut the door.Dedicated to the “Sixty Million and more” Africans and their descendants who died as a result of the slave trade, this is a cultural milestone and a Pulitzer-winning tour de force. Morrison was inspired by the real-life story of an enslaved woman who killed her own daughter rather than see her return to slavery. In her plot, the murdered child returns to haunt a black community, suggesting the inescapable taint of America’s history.Evelyn Waugh bottles the intoxicating vapour of a vanished era in this novel about middle-class Charles Ryder, who meets upper-class Sebastian Flyte at Oxford University in the 1920s. Scrap the wartime prologue, and Charles’s entire relationship with Sebastian’s sister Julia (Dear Evelyn, thank you for your latest manuscript, a few suggested cuts…) and you’re looking at one of the most affecting love affairs in the English language. You can almost feel your mouth dry with thirst as you enter the world of Frank Herbert’s Dune and encounter the desert planet of Arrakis, with its giant sandworms and mind-altering spice. It’s the setting for an epic saga of warring feudal houses, but it’s as much eco-parable as thrilling adventure story. Rarely has a fictional world been so completely realised.Will there ever be a novel that burns with more passionate intensity than Wuthering Heights? The forces that bring together its fierce heroine Catherine Earnshaw and cruel hero Heathcliff are violent and untameable, yet rooted in a childhood devotion to one another, when Heathcliff obeyed Cathy’s every command. It’s impossible to imagine this novel ever provoking quiet slumbers Emily Bronte’s vision of nature blazes with poetry.The savage reviews that greeted F Scott Fitzgerald’s third novel – “no more than a glorified anecdote” “for the season only” – failed to recognise something truly great a near-perfect distillation of the hope, ambition, cynicism and desire at the heart of the American Dream. Other novels capture the allure of the invented self, from Stendhal’s The Red and the Black to Thomas Mann’s Confessions of Felix Krull, but Fitzgerald’s enigmatic Jay Gatsby casts a shadow that reaches to Mad Men’s Don Draper and beyond. From the moment we meet Alex and his three droogs in the Korova milkbar, drinking moloko with vellocet or synthemesc and wondering whether to chat up the devotchkas at the counter or tolchock some old veck in an alley, it’s clear that normal novelistic conventions do not apply. Anthony Burgess’s slim volume about a violent near-future where aversion therapy is used on feral youth who speak Nadsat and commit rape and murder, is a dystopian masterpiece.Banned from entering the UK in its year of publication, 1955, Vladimir Nabokov’s astonishingly skilful and enduringly controversial work of fiction introduces us to literary professor and self-confessed hebephile Humbert Humbert, the perhaps unreliable narrator of the novel. He marries widow Charlotte Haze only to get access to her daughter, 12-year-old Dolores, nicknamed Lo by her mother, or as Humbert calls her “Lolita, light of my life, fire of my loins. My sin, my soul.” Cloaking his abuse in the allusive language of idealised love does not lessen Humbert’s crimes, but allows Nabokov to skewer him where he hides.2740 Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, Philip K DickHere be Roy Baty, Rick Deckard and Rachael Rosen – the novel that inspired Blade Runner is stranger even than the film it became. Back in an age before artificial intelligence could teach itself to play chess in a few hours better than any grandmaster that ever lived, Philip K Dick was using the concept of android life to explore what it meant to be human, and what it is to be left behind on a compromised planet. That he could do it in 250 pages that set the mind spinning and engage the emotions with every page-turn make this a rare science-fiction indeed.2840 Heart of Darkness, Joseph ConradInspired by Conrad’s own experiences of captaining a trading steamer up the Congo River, Heart of Darkness is part adventure, part psychological voyage into the unknown, as the narrator Marlow relays the story of his journey into the jungle to meet the mysterious ivory trader Mr Kurtz. Although debate continues to rage about whether the novel and its attitude to Africa and colonialism is racist, it’s deeply involving and demands to be read.Whatever passed between Irish theatre manager Bram Stoker and the Hungarian traveller and writer Ármin Vámbéry when they met in London and talked of the Carpathian Mountains, it incubated in the Gothic imagination of Stoker into a work that has had an incalculable influence on Western culture. It’s not hard to read the Count as a shadowy sexual figure surprising straitlaced Victorian England in their beds, but in Stoker’s hands he’s also bloody creepy.3040 The Catcher in the Rye, J D SalingerIt only takes one sentence, written in the first person, for Salinger’s Holden Caulfield to announce himself in all his teenage nihilism, sneering at you for wanting to know his biographical details “and all that David Copperfield kind of crap”. The Catcher in the Rye is the quintessential novel of the adolescent experience, captured in deathless prose.Dashiel Hammett may have been harder boiled, his plots more intricate but, wow, does Raymond Chandler have style. The push and pull at the start of The Big Sleep between private detective Philip Marlowe, in his powder-blue suit and dark blue shirt, and Miss Carmen Sternwood, with her “little sharp predatory teeth” and lashes that she lowers and raises like a theatre curtain, sets the tone for a story of bad girls and bad men.All the teeming life of 19th century London is here in Thackeray’s masterpiece, right down to the curry houses frequented by Jos Sedley, who has gained a taste for the hot stuff as an officer in the East India Trading Company. But it is Becky Sharp, one of literature’s great characters, who gives this novel its enduring fascination. As a woman on the make, Becky is the perfect blend of wit, cunning and cold-hearted ruthlessness. Try as film and TV might to humanise and make excuses for her, Becky needs victims to thrive! And she’s all the more compelling for that. The only novel written by the poet Sylvia Plath is a semi-autobiographical account of a descent into depression that the book’s narrator Esther Greenwood describes as like being trapped under a bell jar – used to create a vacuum in scientific experiments – struggling to breathe. Almost every word is arresting, and the way that Plath captures the vivid life happening around Esther, news events, magazine parties, accentuates the deadening illness that drives her towards suicidal feelings. Plath herself would commit suicide one month after the novel’s publication in 1963.3440 Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Roald DahlHarry Potter may be more popular, but Willy Wonka is altogether weirder. From the overwhelming poverty experienced by Charlie Bucket and his family, to the spoilt, greedy, brattish children who join Charlie on his trip to Willy Wonka’s phantasmagorical sweet factory there is nothing artificially sweetened in Roald Dahl’s startling work of fantasy. Andrew Davies’s recent TV adaptation of War and Peace reminded those of us who can’t quite face returning to the novel’s monstrous demands just how brilliantly Tolstoy delineates affairs of the heart, even if the war passages will always be a struggle. In Anna Karenina – enormous, too! –the great Russian novelist captures the erotic charge between the married Anna and the bachelor Vronsky, then drags his heroine through society’s scorn as their affair takes shape, without ever suggesting we move from her side. The most deliciously wicked experience in literature, this epistolary novel introduces us to the Marquise de Merteuil and Vicomte de Valmont, who play cruel games of sexual conquest on their unwitting victims. The Marquise’s justification for her behaviour – “I, who was born to revenge my sex and master yours” – will strike a chord in the #metoo era, but emotions, even love, intrude, to the point where Laclos’s amorality becomes untenable. Sexy but very, very bad. 3740 100 Years of Solitude, Gabriel Garcia MarquezThe energy and enchantment of Garcia Marquez’s story of seven generations of the Buendia family in a small town in Colombia continue to enthrall half a century on. Hauntings and premonitions allied to a journalistic eye for detail and a poetic sensibility make Marquez’s magical realism unique.“Someone must have been telling lies about Josef K…” So begins Kafka’s nightmarish tale of a man trapped in an unfathomable bureaucratic process after being arrested by two agents from an unidentified office for a crime they’re not allowed to tell him about. Foreshadowing the antisemitism of Nazi-occupied Europe, as well as the methods of the Stasi, KGB, and StB, it’s an unsettling, at times bewildering, tale with chilling resonance.The second Mrs de Winter is the narrator of Du Maurier’s marvellously gothic tale about a young woman who replaces the deceased Rebecca as wife to the wealthy Maxim de Winter and mistress of the Manderley estate. There she meets the housekeeper Mrs Danvers, formerly devoted to Rebecca, who proceeds to torment her. As atmospheric, psychological horror it just gets darker and darker. Published posthumously in 1958, Tomasi di Lampedusa’s novel is set in 19th century Sicily, where revolution is in the air. The imposing Prince Don Fabrizio presides over a town close to Palermo during the last days of an old world in which class stratifications are stable and understood. Garibaldi’s forces have taken the island and a new world will follow. It’s a deep and poetic meditation on political change and the characters that it produces.140 Pride and Prejudice, Jane AustenIt is a fact universally acknowledged that every list of great books must include Pride and Prejudice. Don’t be fooled by the bonnets and balls: beneath the sugary surface is a tart exposé of the marriage market in Georgian England. For every lucky Elizabeth, who tames the haughty, handsome Mr. Darcy and learns to know herself in the process, there’s a Charlotte, resigned to life with a driveling buffoon for want of a pretty face.240 The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole, Aged 13 ¾, Sue TownsendRead this one when you’re decrepit enough, and chances are you’ll die laughing.

From the moment we meet Alex and his three droogs in the Korova milkbar, drinking moloko with vellocet or synthemesc and wondering whether to chat up the devotchkas at the counter or tolchock some old veck in an alley, it’s clear that normal novelistic conventions do not apply. Anthony Burgess’s slim volume about a violent near-future where aversion therapy is used on feral youth who speak Nadsat and commit rape and murder, is a dystopian masterpiece.Banned from entering the UK in its year of publication, 1955, Vladimir Nabokov’s astonishingly skilful and enduringly controversial work of fiction introduces us to literary professor and self-confessed hebephile Humbert Humbert, the perhaps unreliable narrator of the novel. He marries widow Charlotte Haze only to get access to her daughter, 12-year-old Dolores, nicknamed Lo by her mother, or as Humbert calls her “Lolita, light of my life, fire of my loins. My sin, my soul.” Cloaking his abuse in the allusive language of idealised love does not lessen Humbert’s crimes, but allows Nabokov to skewer him where he hides.2740 Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, Philip K DickHere be Roy Baty, Rick Deckard and Rachael Rosen – the novel that inspired Blade Runner is stranger even than the film it became. Back in an age before artificial intelligence could teach itself to play chess in a few hours better than any grandmaster that ever lived, Philip K Dick was using the concept of android life to explore what it meant to be human, and what it is to be left behind on a compromised planet. That he could do it in 250 pages that set the mind spinning and engage the emotions with every page-turn make this a rare science-fiction indeed.2840 Heart of Darkness, Joseph ConradInspired by Conrad’s own experiences of captaining a trading steamer up the Congo River, Heart of Darkness is part adventure, part psychological voyage into the unknown, as the narrator Marlow relays the story of his journey into the jungle to meet the mysterious ivory trader Mr Kurtz. Although debate continues to rage about whether the novel and its attitude to Africa and colonialism is racist, it’s deeply involving and demands to be read.Whatever passed between Irish theatre manager Bram Stoker and the Hungarian traveller and writer Ármin Vámbéry when they met in London and talked of the Carpathian Mountains, it incubated in the Gothic imagination of Stoker into a work that has had an incalculable influence on Western culture. It’s not hard to read the Count as a shadowy sexual figure surprising straitlaced Victorian England in their beds, but in Stoker’s hands he’s also bloody creepy.3040 The Catcher in the Rye, J D SalingerIt only takes one sentence, written in the first person, for Salinger’s Holden Caulfield to announce himself in all his teenage nihilism, sneering at you for wanting to know his biographical details “and all that David Copperfield kind of crap”. The Catcher in the Rye is the quintessential novel of the adolescent experience, captured in deathless prose.Dashiel Hammett may have been harder boiled, his plots more intricate but, wow, does Raymond Chandler have style. The push and pull at the start of The Big Sleep between private detective Philip Marlowe, in his powder-blue suit and dark blue shirt, and Miss Carmen Sternwood, with her “little sharp predatory teeth” and lashes that she lowers and raises like a theatre curtain, sets the tone for a story of bad girls and bad men.All the teeming life of 19th century London is here in Thackeray’s masterpiece, right down to the curry houses frequented by Jos Sedley, who has gained a taste for the hot stuff as an officer in the East India Trading Company. But it is Becky Sharp, one of literature’s great characters, who gives this novel its enduring fascination. As a woman on the make, Becky is the perfect blend of wit, cunning and cold-hearted ruthlessness. Try as film and TV might to humanise and make excuses for her, Becky needs victims to thrive! And she’s all the more compelling for that. The only novel written by the poet Sylvia Plath is a semi-autobiographical account of a descent into depression that the book’s narrator Esther Greenwood describes as like being trapped under a bell jar – used to create a vacuum in scientific experiments – struggling to breathe. Almost every word is arresting, and the way that Plath captures the vivid life happening around Esther, news events, magazine parties, accentuates the deadening illness that drives her towards suicidal feelings. Plath herself would commit suicide one month after the novel’s publication in 1963.3440 Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Roald DahlHarry Potter may be more popular, but Willy Wonka is altogether weirder. From the overwhelming poverty experienced by Charlie Bucket and his family, to the spoilt, greedy, brattish children who join Charlie on his trip to Willy Wonka’s phantasmagorical sweet factory there is nothing artificially sweetened in Roald Dahl’s startling work of fantasy. Andrew Davies’s recent TV adaptation of War and Peace reminded those of us who can’t quite face returning to the novel’s monstrous demands just how brilliantly Tolstoy delineates affairs of the heart, even if the war passages will always be a struggle. In Anna Karenina – enormous, too! –the great Russian novelist captures the erotic charge between the married Anna and the bachelor Vronsky, then drags his heroine through society’s scorn as their affair takes shape, without ever suggesting we move from her side. The most deliciously wicked experience in literature, this epistolary novel introduces us to the Marquise de Merteuil and Vicomte de Valmont, who play cruel games of sexual conquest on their unwitting victims. The Marquise’s justification for her behaviour – “I, who was born to revenge my sex and master yours” – will strike a chord in the #metoo era, but emotions, even love, intrude, to the point where Laclos’s amorality becomes untenable. Sexy but very, very bad. 3740 100 Years of Solitude, Gabriel Garcia MarquezThe energy and enchantment of Garcia Marquez’s story of seven generations of the Buendia family in a small town in Colombia continue to enthrall half a century on. Hauntings and premonitions allied to a journalistic eye for detail and a poetic sensibility make Marquez’s magical realism unique.“Someone must have been telling lies about Josef K…” So begins Kafka’s nightmarish tale of a man trapped in an unfathomable bureaucratic process after being arrested by two agents from an unidentified office for a crime they’re not allowed to tell him about. Foreshadowing the antisemitism of Nazi-occupied Europe, as well as the methods of the Stasi, KGB, and StB, it’s an unsettling, at times bewildering, tale with chilling resonance.The second Mrs de Winter is the narrator of Du Maurier’s marvellously gothic tale about a young woman who replaces the deceased Rebecca as wife to the wealthy Maxim de Winter and mistress of the Manderley estate. There she meets the housekeeper Mrs Danvers, formerly devoted to Rebecca, who proceeds to torment her. As atmospheric, psychological horror it just gets darker and darker. Published posthumously in 1958, Tomasi di Lampedusa’s novel is set in 19th century Sicily, where revolution is in the air. The imposing Prince Don Fabrizio presides over a town close to Palermo during the last days of an old world in which class stratifications are stable and understood. Garibaldi’s forces have taken the island and a new world will follow. It’s a deep and poetic meditation on political change and the characters that it produces.It was expected that the Swedish Academy, founded in 1786, would attempt to avoid any further controversy following reports of infighting and conflicts of interest among its 18 members, who are selected for life and are viewed as the country’s s of culture.\u0026nbspPoet Katarina Forstenson was among seven academy members to quit the body amid a bitter row about how to handle rape accusations made against her husband, Jean-Claude Arnault, who was also accused of leaking the names of several prize-winners. Arnault is currently serving a prison sentence for rape.\u0026nbspNobel Prize in Chemistry awarded to oldest ever winnerNobel Prize in Physics awarded for planet discoveriesNobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine won by UK scientistFollowing the scandal, seven new members have been appointed, while respected literature professor Mats Malm has taken over as permanent secretary.\u0026nbspMembers of the Nobel Foundation, which funds the Literature Prize, have said the academy still needs to do more to recover its reputation.\u0026nbspAcademy member Anders Olsson said the committee had sought a more erse shortlist this year and attempted to move away from a “male-oriented” and “Eurocentric perspective of literature”.\u0026nbspLars Keikensten, executive director of the foundation, commented that the academy needs to act “more openly than they have done in the past”.\u0026nbsp“Our reputation is everything,” he said. “Obviously it is important to avoid this kind of situation we have been in and of course it cannot be repeated.”Nobel Prize for Literature\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Of the 79p\u0026nbsppaid by shoppers for a\u0026nbsp100g\u0026nbsppack of black Assam tea in the UK, 49p goes to supermarkets and tea brands, 27p\u0026nbspto other firms such as packaging providers, while tea pickers collectively receive 3p. If workers on tea estates in Assam received just 5p\u0026nbspmore of the retail price, they could be paid a living wage of 330 rupees (£3.80) per day.Aldi, Morrisons, Sainsbury’s and Tesco confirmed to Oxfam that they source their own-brand tea from companies whose suppliers include the estates visited in Assam.As for the fruit farms in Brazil, Lidl and\u0026nbspSainsbury’s confirmed they source produce from the farms, either directly or through importers, while Tesco and Morrisons said they\u0026nbsppreviously did so.When contacted by Oxfam, Asda owner Walmart\u0026nbspdeclined to say whether it has links to the tea estates or the fruit farms.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

More than a third said they are not able to take a toilet break or have a drink of water when they needed it.The Independent\u0026nbspasked Aldi,\u0026nbspLidl, Morrisons, Sainsbury’s and Tesco for a comment on the findings.A spokesperson for\u0026nbspAldi\u0026nbspsaid: “We continue to work hard to ensure every person working in our supply chain is treated fairly and has their human rights respected. We share the values behind Oxfam’s campaign and are in regular dialogue with them.”Sainsbury’s declined to comment, pointing instead to a statement issued by the British Retail Consortium (BRC) on behalf of its members.\u0026nbsp“Supermarkets in the UK are spearheading actions aimed at improving the lives of the millions of people across the globe who contribute to the retail supply chain. Our members are working hard to address existing injustices and continue to collaborate internationally with NGOs, business groups and government on this vital issue,” said\u0026nbspPeter Andrews, head of sustainability at the BRC.A Tesco spokesperson said: “We are a member of the Ethical Tea Partnership, committed to improving the lives of tea workers and ensuring minimum working conditions. But we know there is always more to do and we are working collaboratively with NGOs, trade unions and others to improve wages in the key produce, tea and clothing sectors and ensure working conditions are fair.”According to Oxfam, Tesco is doing most to protect human rights in its supply chain, although all six supermarkets still have a long way to go.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

among EU nationals after appearing to suggest\u0026nbspthousands of people without settled status\u0026nbspcould be deported after Brexit.Brandon Lewis, the security minister, said European citizens living in the UK risked being sent home if they fail to apply for permanent residence\u0026nbspby the end of 2020.Asked whether people face deportation despite fulfilling all legal conditions for a residence permit, Mr Lewis said: “Theoretically, yes.\u0026nbspWe will apply the applicable rules.”Campaigners seized on his comments as a sign that EU citizens will “face the full force of the hostile environment”.Created with Sketch.Boris Johnson and Brexit merchandise for sale at the Tory conference Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A Boris Johnson

Instead of these threats, the government should enshrine people’s rights to stay in law so they are protected and not put at risk by failings in a bureaucratic process –\u0026nbspas the Home Affairs Committee has recommended.“It is clear that the government have not learned the lessons from the Windrush scandal, which showed how easily iniduals can fall through gaps in the system through no fault of their own, and how easily lives can be destroyed if the government gets this wrong.”Christine Jardine, the Lib Dem home affairs spokesperson,\u0026nbspsaid it was clear that Boris Johnson had no intention of automatically guaranteeing the rights of EU citizens.She said:\u0026nbsp“No one seriously believes the Home Office will have granted settled status to all 3.6 million EU citizens by the Conservatives’ arbitrary December 2020 deadline. “Thousands will inevitably be left effectively undocumented –\u0026nbspand now the government is saying it will deport them.\u0026nbspThat is totally unacceptable.”A Home Office spokesperson said:\u0026nbsp“EU citizens are our friends, family and neighbours and we want them to stay.“The EU settlement scheme is a free and easy way for EU citizens to get the UK immigration status they need.“We have received 2 million applications and are looking for reasons to grant status, not refuse, and EU citizens have until at least December 2020 to apply.“We’ve always been clear that where they have reasonable grounds for missing the deadline, they’ll be given a further opportunity to apply.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It’s been about all the hopes and dreams we have as iniduals and collectively in this city.”Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.This multi-exposure picture shows USA\u0027s Simone Biles performing on the beam during the women\u0027s team final at the Artistic Gymnastics World Championships in StuttgartExtinction Rebellion activists block an intersection in Melbourne, AustraliaProtesters hold smoke grenades as they gather in central Kiev to demand broader autonomy for separatist territories, part of a plan to end a war with Russian-backed fighters Anti-government protesters rush to an injured man during a demonstration in Baghdad, IraqFootage of a hugely rare polka dot zebra has been captured in Kenya.

Southern states voted to form the Confederacy\u0026nbspin Montgomery in 1861 and the city served as the unofficial republic\u0027s first capital.Last year, the Equal Justice Initiative opened a memorial and museum in Montgomery’s city centre to honour victims of lynching in the racially segregated era after the US Civil War.The city was the site of the pivotal bus boycott, a year-long civil rights protest sparked by black seamstress Rosa Parks, who was famously jailed after refusing to give up her seat to a white passenger as required by law in 1955.The US Supreme Court ultimately ordered Montgomery to end racial segregation on its buses, and Martin Luther King Jr, one of the boycott’s leaders, went on to emerge as one of the most prominent leaders of the American civil rights movement.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Despite this, they confirmed Ms Von der Leyen, though by a narrow margin.Other than the French candidate, the parliament has also asserted itself in recent weeks by blocking the Hungarian and Romanian candidates for EU commissioner.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Rebekah Vardy.Rebekah now plans to enlist the help of a forensic IT expert to clear her name after it was revealed she had sobbed on the phone to Coleen as she insisted she wasnt behind the leaks.And the fallout intensied today as Danielle Lloyd - the ex-we of Jamie OHara - claimed she wasnt surprised over the drama.Speaking on This Morning, she said: I wasn’t shocked, I have had run ins with Rebekah over similar things.Each of the stories provided to The Sun was put to Coleen’s representatives before publication, and on each occasion they declined to comment.A Sun Spokesperson said: Like all reputable media organisations, we dont comment on sources.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And hoping to hell she doesn’t suddenly draw Will Carling in that sandpit of hers.Which, mercully, she didn’t. There was just a hospice, a candle and two little heads who were probably William and Harry, but could just as easily have been Wayne Sleep and Simon Le Bon.It passed without major diplomatic incident, though. As did the rest of Britain’s Got Talent: The Champions’ final, where viewers were served up everything from Stavros Flatley and the Ukrainian sandpit woman to Twist And Pulse and the astonishing -year-old German dog dancing girl, Alex Lauenburger, who’s got those mutts of hers drilled like . . . like . . .Well, never mind what she’s got them drilled like. Let’s just say they’ve cocked their little legs all over Pudsey the dog’s grave. There were a couple of failures among the success as well, of course: magician Darcy Oake, who dropped his act in favour of a bereavement story, and American comedian Preacher Lawson.Brilliant, charismatic and funny during the semi-final, Preacher was rushed, confused and barely raised a laugh during the final. Not that any of the judges did him the favour of spelling out the truth. They don’t seem to do that on BGT: The Champions. What they get instead is OTT praise and  hope.Absolutely the oddest thing they did, though, during Saturday’s final, just before Cowell teed up daredevil Bello Nock as “certiably insane”, was getting Ant  Dec to introduce Britain Get Talking, an ITV mental wellness campaign sparked, apparently, by a “ per cent rise in anxiety and depression”.To counter that trend, proceedings were halted and replaced by an awkward silence inside Wembley Arena, so that viewers could communicate with their nearest and dearest, as they probably would’ve done during the following ad break anyway.Opinions on this stunt will, I realise, y wildly. Given there’s no shortage of shows dealing with mental health issues, though, it just looked to me like BGT had jumped on board the virtue-signalling bandwagon.It also flew in the face of light entertainment’s real purpose, to lt the human spirit and remove you from le’s harsh realities for a minute or two.The audience understands thisonly too well, and that’s why Saturday’s top two places were filled by acts who offered no sob stories, just entertainment.Twist And Pulse deservedly won and got the BGT trophy. Stavros Flatley came second, so Deme’s we doesn’t even get that new fridge. What happens to BGT: The Champions next  I’ve no idea and suspect ITV doesn’t either.All we do know for sure, in fact, is the next part of this weird Autumn Cowell trilogy is X Factor: Celebrity, a replacement for the civilian version which was, in part, dragged down by endless audience manipulation and accusations of favouritism.“Megastar” acts on this new show will include Max  Harvey. A new one on me but, lo and behold, turns out they’re managed by Simon Cowell’s mate Tim Byrne, who used to be Creative Director of Syco.ON Friday’s EastEnders Jean Slater said: “I can’t believe they’ve been pretending to like my sausage surprise all these years. It makes me wonder what they think of my fishy basket.”THANKS to Wednesday’s Cape Town jaunt on The Apprentice, I now know there are , shipwrecks off the coast of South Africa, rhinos are not to be confused with elephants and hippos enjoy mating. Even at the age of .Just don’t ask me to name safari’s “big five”, ’cos I’ve watched that episode three times now and my best guess is still lion, rhino, elephant, The Gruffalo and Thomas Skinner, the hulking great Charley Boorman lookalike from Romford, whose nose twitches uncontrollably whenever he’s just said something wrong.“Look, we ain’t a bunch of idiots, are we ” .Thomas, of course, was one of the stand-out performers on a brilliant first episode, along with Ryan-Mark Parsons , Carina Lepore, whose tour of the vineyard sculpture park was a bit wordy for my likingand Lottie Lion, who “worked in the best wine bar in the UK”, and is as fragrant and enticing as a broken bottle of Buckfast.It bodes well for the series, but almost certainly won’t stop the usual axe-grinders complaining “The Apprentice is past its sell-by-date”, even though there are other network fixtures and fittings that fit that description so much better.Andyou want a full and exhaustive list of all those BBC shows which deserve to be sent to the knacker’s yard long before Lord Sugar’s masterpiece, here goes. All of them.BBC, Wednesday, pm, The Apprentice. It does what it says on the tin, yeah.JUST a quick note about the incredibly intense two-minute, -second silence Eamonn Holmes maintained while he stared at the Greek Feast Phil Vickery was making on Friday’s This Morning.Who said the following last week: “There’s bile coming out of her and all this green crap ”A Cat discussing Morag’s stomach upset on Treasure Island with Bear Grylls B Emily Maitlis introducing Greta Thunberg on Newsnight Well I didn’t say it was hard, did I Channel  over-stepping the anti-Boris anti-Brexit line on Friday’s Gogglebox.The BBC appointing the host of Michael Jackson: The Live Seance, June Sarpong, as its new head of “Creative Diversity”.Sky Atlantic expecting us all to pretend Helen Mirren isn’t  years too old to be playing Catherine The Great.Sean Bean’s bus that never bloody moves on World On Fire.And The One Show’s Matt Baker asking: “Comedy, where did that all start, Romesh ”When, Matt. Not where. When does that all start Paul Merson: “This lad’s come in and not let them down once. Although he let them down at Old Trafford.”RICHARD Madeley has left The Circle and, given the impact he had on the Channel  reality show, it would have been understandableall the interest had gone with him. The fact it hasn’t is largely down to the discovery of a brand new television star.He’s Tim, the show’s -year-old theology professor, who, unlike all the millennials in that building hiding their insecurities behind a wall of tattoos and fake identities, is so comfortable in his own skin he works out in the gym wearing a three- piece, while reading a book.It’s an approach that can trip him up, quite literally, on the running machine. No one, least of all the other contestants, should mistake the most sweet-natured man on telly for a fool, though.He has sussed out almost everyone  on The Circle, including catfish Katie Jay, and knows exactly how they will react to his messages before he’s even sent them.I wouldn’t normally advocate a post-reality show career for any of these fame-chasers. But it’s a performance of such charm and wit that Tim deserves the ultimate Channel  accolade. Dictionary Corner.

It was a shining beacon. Somehow it made everyone, regardless of age or background, feel special.The menu was fresh and new. We had never even seen torn basil or dough balls. The restaurants were in cool locations. There was one above a recording studio in London’s Bloomsbury.When I was in Blur, we lived off those pizzas for years. I’d order two margherita pizzas at a go because they were so cheap.So it is sad to hear the chain, a British staple since , with  restaurants here and in Ireland, is struggling under a mountain of debt.Some p of every £. margherita it sells goes directly to paying off interest. That’s before salaries and rent costs.Social media is mourning its possible demise. Jokers quip that when it folds, it should be renamed Calzone Express.Yet the chain is far from alone. Jamie’s Italian had to close  restaurants this year and , staff lost their jobs. Strada has shut a third of its venues. Prezzo and Carluccio’s have undergone restructuring.Pizza, as a business model, is brilliant. It has the same ingredients as a cheese and tomato sandwich but you can charge £ for it.Yet times have changed. Services such as Deliveroo mean we can have our pick of restaurant food in the comfort of our own homes.Pizza Express is still somewhere wonderfully classless and unfussy. You can just as happily take a date there as a family.Its three-course meal deal for little ones is brilliant and the staff are always wonderful with picky children. My we and five kids love it . . . and so do my girlfriends. It has expanded its menu, with low-calorie options and vegan meals. Yet it still suffered a fall of nearly eight per cent in earnings over the first half of this year.Part of the problem is that until quite recently there were very few places you would really want to eat on the high street.Now we are overwhelmed with choice in the “casual dining” market, with everything from Japanese to Thai to Mexican, plus a lot more pizza options.What’s more, Pizza Express is owned by a Chinese private equity company, Hony Capital, which has greedily expanded the number of venues since it took over the chain in . There are branches everywhere now.That expansion has slowed, with just two new restaurants opening in the first half of the year. It is taking a more measured approach.I always felt the restaurants had a lot of personality and charm, as well as serving great food at affordable prices — all things that were hard to get in the brand’s heyday.Founder Peter Boizot probably never imagined how much the market would change. He fell in love with Italian food while working as a tutor in Florence before going to Cambridge University. Pizza was unusual here then.Movie director Mario Zampi opened a pizzeria called Pizza Express in Soho’s Wardour Street, central London in . But his film-star friends, including Sophia Loren, turned their noses up at such “peasant food”. Boizot was undeterred.He took over Zampi’s restaurant, including its £, of debt, shipped in Britain’s first pizza oven from Naples and sold his first square pizza slices for two shillings a pop on March , .His first chef was a Sicilian aged  who made the dough in the front room of the restaurant, so customers could see it taking shape.That led to the idea of the chain’s open kitchens, which were revolutionary. It was also responsible for introducing Peroni beer to the UK, an Italian classic.While you would usually have to stand in other pizzerias, Boizot brought in tables and proper metal cutlery.As an art collector, he wanted a stylish concept and hired Italian designer Enzo Apicella to work with him across  restaurants.He called his empire a “necklace of inidual gems” rather than a chain.His favourite pizza was a quattro formaggiwith chopped basil and extra green peppers.Boizot sold the business for £million in  and Hony Capital bought it  years later for £million, racking up debts now estimated to be £.billion.The annual interest is £million, wiping out its profits. Experts say the high street favourite is not in immediate danger, as it has until  to start paying back large chunks of this debt.We have seen what happens to similar chains before, though. If we don’t want to lose this one, action must be taken.Sadly, it is hard to see how our high street can survive without government incentives. Business rates are high and parking is often a nightmare.If you care about a business, the best way to support it is with your custom.And I reckon dinner out with the family is probably better value now, and tastier too, than ever before.

In the last three-and-a-half years, the opposite has ­occurred.It has been the British people — calm, patient, amazingly good-humoured — who have set the example to the foaming fools of our political class. It has been the elite that has been rioting and generally behaving like hooligans.Has there ever been a wilder time in the corridors of power, here and abroad  In the House of Commons we have had sit-ins and choruses of communism’s Red Flag anthem.Middle-class vegan eco-warriors — few of them seemingly poor enough to have to earn a living — have set up tents in Trafalgar Square and Whitehall and brought traffic chaos to working Londoners.Top civil servants and privy councillors have almost come to blows. And a prince of the realm and his new we have thrown a massive wobbly about their Press coverage, mere days after most newspapers had showered them in positive publicity.The clincher for me was Piers Morgan’s rivetingly bizarre ITV interview this week with Boris Johnson’s ex-crumpetJenner Arcuri.Here was a network breakfast TV show quizzing a dimpled dolly-bird in Los Angeles for the best part of an hour, feverishly trying to find outshe had had nookie with our Prime Minister.Up and down the country, families were trying to get some cornflakes into the kids before school, while listening to a blonde with a dirty laugh fight off persistent questions about whether or not she had been “intimate” with the head of our country’s government.Look, I’m no vicar. I don’t really care about politicians’ sex lives, though I happen to think people are happier — and lawmakers more trustworthy —they obey their wedding vows. I also thought Morgan did pretty well in the interview. But it was just such a vivid demonstration of the cartoon-ishness of our current predicament.Cartoon seems the right word because so much of what has been happening in British public le has been farcical and obvious to the point of caricature. Look at the behaviour of the Commons Speaker, John Bercow. His self-conduct in the chair of the Commons has been so maniacally biased, it really does belong to an episode of The Simpsons.Bercow has screamed abuse at MPs who have dared criticise him. He has ripped up centuries of procedural custom to bend the rules to the advantage of his Remain-backing friends. One of his family cars even sported a “Bollocks to Brexit” sticker.If someone tried to chair a parish council in such a blatantly preachy, lecturing way, they would be fired before the first item of business had been completed. Yet Bercow, who will finally quit his role at the end of this month, is going to walk into a six-figure pension for the rest of his le — and he is only .The recent party conferences saw ripe behaviour from our political class. The Liberal Democrats passed a motion vowing to ignore the result of our country’s largest ever public vote. Er, how is that “democratic” At Labour’s conference, the apparent result of a key vote was overturned on the blatant say-so of one of Comrade Corbyn’s key commissars. They didn’t bother to have any votes at the Tory con­ference — they never do — but we did have the spectacle of a parliamentary knight of the shires being kicked out of the premises after an alleged contretemps with a doorkeeper.And you should have seen the amount of booze being put away at those party conferences and at the TUC’s shindig a week earlier. Great lakes of alcohol were gulped down, much of it free. This from the same political class that loves to lecture the rest of us about watching our weekly units.Things are not much better where in our body politic. Top judge Lady Hale has been revelling in her notoriety after she and her fellow Supreme Court judges changed the law and thus made Brexit less likely.Judges once kept themselves away from the media fray. Hale, making jokes at Boris Johnson’s expense and giving quite unnecessary self-promotional interviews, has looked swollen-headed and has done nothing to allay fears the judiciary is as bent as Bercow.The police’s reputation is also in the mire after the mishandling of some plainly absurd sex-abuse allegations. The only other person who believed them was Labour deputy leader Tom Watson, who is now bleating about the dangers of a No-Deal Brexit.Why should we believe a single word he says  Talking of the police, why are the Met so timid about stopping the Extinction Rebellion protests in London  You can bet thatthose protestors had been massing in favour of a No-Deal Brexit, they’d have been baton-charged and loaded into the back of a Black Maria. And the public’s response to all this  You have, ladies and gentlemen, been magnicent.You have not rioted. You have not risen up in fury. You have found it hard to stomach, I know, but you have kept your humour. You have stayed loyal to democracy, voting in the European elections we were never meant to have.Opinion polls suggest that Euroscepticism is only growing, with more now wanting a No-Deal Brexit than not.You have, in short, shown the poise and maturity we once expected from our political masters.

She was found as a foal, collapsed and just hours from death. Heartbreakingly, she was infested with worms, covered in lice and had diarrhoea. But since she was taken in by the RSPCA at Potters Bar in Hertfordshire Hope has made an amazing recovery. However, the five-year-old thoroughbred cross breed bay has been cared for by the charity ever since and all she wants is a home of her own.    Hope is described as: A very loving girl, she does however have a huge amount still to learn and will need someone very caring and experienced to teach her. Hope has learnt to wear a bridle and be lead in hand during her stay with us. Hope can be a little nervous when being groomed but has gained confidence. Her ideal forever home will be an owner who has dealt with young horses before. Another horse who is also desperate for a new home in four-year-old Lily. The New Forest cross breed arrived at the same centre as Hope starving and fighting for her le.  She has now made a full recovery and loves being around people. The centre describe her as: Full of character, very cheeky and incredibly intelligent. She picks up new things very quickly, including how to open gates. She is a bit of a show off and loves to strut her stuff in the field, showung off her very flashy trot. She also likes to think she is a race horse when she races our tractor up and down the field. The two horses are part of a growing number who need rescuing each month. The RSPCA rescued more than , horses from neglect and suffering last year and many of them still need new homes. And the crisis, which has been caused by the high costs of vets bills, the rising costs of hay and feed and falling demand forsome kinds of horses, is showing no sign of slowing down.  The RSPCA has three specialist equine centres - Lockwood in Surrey, Gonsal Farm in Shropshire and Felledge in County Durham, and equine rehoming facilities at Millbrook in Surrey, Southridge in Hertfordshire and Leybourne in Kent. This month is the charityaposs Adoptober and while  horses and ponies were found new homes last year, hundreds more still need to be taken on. Dr Mark Kennedy, equine welfare specialist at the RSPCA said: Many people know how rewarding rescuing a dog or cat can be, and what a fantastic range of animals come into our care looking for new homes, and we really hope horse people will see that it’s the same for horses - we have some excellent horses and ponies just waiting for a chance in a new home.

Nicolas Willson, from Skewen, started singing with The Sound of Voices choir in November , just after he became old enough to join on his eighth birthday. The youth choir, formed in , is based in Neath and specialises in pop, musical and folk singing which they perform at events and festivals. Soon after Nicolas took a leading role singing one of his favourite songs, A Million Dreams from The Greatest Showman musical, at the Neath Music Festival in July  , his mum said she received an email from the choir’s committee.  She said it stated that because of “chaperoning and dressing room staffing dficulties,” Nicolas would no longer be able to sing in the choir as he was the only boy. The choir also claimed the separate, licensed chaperones required for boys and girls “don’t want to chaperone for every show as they like to watch their children perform.” A spokesperson for the choir said providing local authority-registered licensed chaperones to be with the children during all performances was a legal requirement. But Nicolas’ mum, Viktoryia Willson, claimed it felt like “basically discrimination,” and she had been left shocked by the decision. “He’s singing all the time and very musical, but now we’re struggling to find him somewhere to go, she said.    “It took a while to find this choir for him, he’ll just have to wait now until he can join an all-boys group. “I felt so betrayed when I found out, you shouldnapost just chuck someone out like that, she claimed. There is an all-boys choir in Neath, Only Boys Aloud, but it only takes children from the age of , meaning Nicolas may have a three year wait to sing locally.Within two weeks of telling Nicolas he could no longer sing with them, Mrs Willson claimed the choir changed their name and set up a new Facebook group as The Sound of Voices Girls Choir.A spokesperson for the choir, who wished to remain anonymous, said: “As a voluntary not for profit organisation we have a duty of care to all the children involved and also to their parents.  “We legally have to have local authority registered licensed chaperones to be with the children during all performances. “All our licensed chaperones are parent volunteers. When we hear that the local authority is running a course we let all parents know, but take-up is low because the courses and interviews are held on weekdays. “As a result, we only have a few licensed chaperones. Being parents of choristers, understandably they want to watch their children perform and so they chaperone on a rota basis.” They also added that because Nicolas was the only boy they were legally required to provide a separate dressing area, although Mrs Willson said she would always take Nicolas to concerts dressed to perform. “We were hoping to start a boys choir. We advertised this on Facebook during August but sadly there was no interest. They said thatthere was future interest in a boysapos choir they would welcome Nicolas with open arms. Neath Port Talbot Council uses the Welsh Government’s policy that when children of school age are in public performances they must be supervised at all times by a registered chaperone unless they are under the direct supervision of a parent.

Full of indiscreet tales about his friends – made up of the most famous names on the planet – the book called Me spares no egos, most especially his own as Sir Elton details his many ­misadventures and mishaps in a brutally honest and tongue-in-cheek fashion. From his unhappy childhood in Pinner, Harrow, to becoming one of he biggest stars on the planet, then nearly losing it all, and finally after  years of fame finding family contentment with David Furnish and their two boys, it’s all there in music’s most revealing read. Here’s just a few of the revelations from the extraordinary le of Elton... Children People think it was a boy called Lev at a Ukrainian orphanage that made Elton realise he wanted to be a father. But he’s revealed his paternal instincts first appeared in South Africa in  on a visit to a Soweto drop-in centre for orphaned children living with HIV. He says: “A small boy wouldn’t sit with the other kids. He just seemed to take a shine to me. He was called Noosa. He was adorable. I realised I felt something that wasn’t pity or fondness. There was a flicker of something more  there.” He discussed adoption with partner David Furnish. In the end they found he was living happily with his grandmother and a sister.    Later that year meeting -month-old Ukrainian Lev convinced Elton he really wanted to be a dad. It proved impossible to adopt little Lev but anonymously Elton worked with a charity to get him and his brother out of an orphanage and fund their lives with their grandmother. Elton adds: “When the Russians invaded Ukraine, we worked with the same charity to evacuate them to Kiev. We’ll always keep an eye on them.” When their oldest son was born at .am on Christmas Day  that visit to Ukraine was still close their hearts. Elton says: “We called him Zachary Jackson Levon. Everybody assumes the last name came from a song Bernie and I wrote, but they’re wrong: he’s named after Lev. He had to be. “Lev was like an angel, a messenger, who taught me something about myself. Lev was the reason we were there, on a maternity ward, holding our son, knowing our lives had completely changed forever.” Princess Diana  The pair were close friends until they fell out when she withdrew support for a book raising funds for AIDs. They reunited after the mxzurder of Gianni Versace, and there is one very famous photograph of the princess consoling the red-eyed grief-stricken singer during the service. But Elton says: “She wasn’t doing anything of the sort. She was leaning past me, reaching for a mint that David offered her. The warm words of comfort coming from her lips at that exact moment were actually: ‘God, I’d love a Polo.’... ...being hrs from death Elton has revealed he was close to dying after contracting a major infection following surgery for prostrate cancer. Touring South America in  the pain became so unbearable he was forced to fly back to the UK. Taken for a scan at King Edward VII’s Hospital, London, he was told he was suffering a rare condition that left fluid leaking from his lymph nodes. And it was so serious the hospital feared it didn’t have the equipment to cope. Elton says: “I lay awake all night, wonderingI was going to die. In the hospital, alone at the dead of night, I prayed, ‘Please don’t let me die, please let me see my kids again’.” He was in intensive care for two days but after doctors drained the lymphatic fluid and gave him with antibiotics he spent seven weeks at home recuperating and learning how to walk again. Rod Stewart    The two great contemporaries have pet names for each other – Elton is nicknamed Sharon and Rod is Phyllis. Elton writes that when people joked about his hair loss Rod sent him a helmet-shaped hairdryer women used to sit under in salons. In relation Elton sent his rival back a Zimmer frame covered in fairy lights. He recounts a story of when Rod was playing Earl’s Court and the promoters advertised the gig by flying a blimp with his face over the venue. Elton says: “I called my management, who hired someone to shoot it down: Apparently it landed on top of a double-decker bus.” The phone soon went. Rod was on the other end and he really did want to talk about it. “Where’s my f***ing balloon gone  It was you, wasn’t it  You cow! You bitch!’” John Lennon First Lennon was his idol, then another great friend. Elton was ­devastated at his murder in New York in . In the previous decade the pair had enjoyed drug-fuelled times. Elton relates one highlight when he and the Beatle were holed up in a hotel suite in New York working their way through a pile of cocaine and there was a knock at the door. Elton was terried it was the police but peeping through the spyhole he realised it was Andy Warhol and went to let him in. The knocking continued but Lennon was having none of it – askingWarhol had “that f***ing camera with him”. Lennon had to askElton wanted to be seen with “icicles of cocaine hanging out of your nose.” Elton obviously did not – and so the world’s most famous pop artist was left in the hotel corridor.  watching porn with his mum at , feet In the seventies Elton used the Boeing , which featured bar, an organ, dining tables, sofas and a TV with a video recorder. Once when travelling on board with his mother, she insisted on watching the pornographic film Deep Throat starring Linda Lovelace while she was eating her lunch. “Everyone’s talking about it, aren’t they  What’s is about then ” she said. Elton remembers the reaction, and his mum’s words: “Oh gawd, no, what’s happening now  Oh! I can’t look! How’s she doing that ” Pop judgment Elton’s manager John Reid played him a pressing of the hit song Bohemian Rhapsody which he described as the “campest thing I have ever heard in my le” thinking it would never be a hit. Shopping Don’t go shopping after a three-day cocaine binge, or: “You wake to a phone call informing you that you have bought a tram. A Melbourne W class drop-centre combination tram, that the voice at the end of the phone is informing you has to be shipped from Australia to Britain, where it can only be delivered by hanging it from two Chinook helicopters.”    Dancing The  song I’m Still Standing was a song requiring a confident video. Helicopter shots were planned with body-painted dancers and Elton cruising in a Bentley. Not only that but Arlene Phillips – later a Strictly Come Dancing judge – would choreograph the dancing. Elton was keen to show off his moves honed at Studio . But he says: “Visibly stunned Arlene went pale and suddenly scaled down my ­involvement in that side of things.” In the end all he was left to do was click his fingers...

I could just hear this woman screaming, and then I realised it was me screaming. I felt like my heart broke. I couldnapost believe what I was hearing. I was just absolutely shocked and devastated. I couldnapost believe she had died right at the very end when there had been nothing wrong. The -year-old, who lives in Overton, Hampshire, had a completely standard pregnancy and she and husband Sam couldnapost wait to meet their beautul baby girl. Their older daughter was very excited to be a big sister, and when Roxanne went into labour on Thursday, November  last year the countdown to become a family of four was on.    Speaking to mark Baby Loss Awareness Week, Roxanne told : I was thrilled when I found out I was pregnant. I had a completely textbook pregnancy, the same as with my first daughter. It was totally uneventful. When she went for her  week appointment her bump was measuring slightly smaller than the nurse would have liked so she was sent for tests, which were all healthy and normal. Roxanne said: She was absolutely fine. She was perfect. Her heartbeat was strong and they thought she was growing fine. Roxanne went into labour at home and starting counting down the hours until she got to meet her little girl. However she didnapost progress out of the early stages for more than  hours, and after two days she was fed up so the hospital told her to come in for a routine check up appointment.  The midwe did all the checks and everything seemed fine, until she tried to find the babyaposs heartbeat. Roxanne said: At this point I was thinking maybe itaposs just the equipment. I was starting to worry a bit but I didnapost think anything so terrible had happened. The midwe told her not to worry and went to get another machine, but that didnapost pick up a heartbeat either. It was then that I knew. I knew something bad had happened. They had always been able to find her heartbeat. She was sent straight down for an ultrasound which confirmed Roxanneaposs worst fears. I was having a complete breakdown. Sam just looked completely shocked. He just sat there silently, holding my hand.  I donapost really remember the bits that happened after that. Itaposs like I was looking at it through a fog. They were then taken up to the hospitalaposs bereavement suite, which gave them complete privacy and meant they were away from other pregnant women and newborn babies. Just after .pm, Roxanne gave birth to baby Kaitlyn. Iaposd had been through labour before so I knew what labour felt like, but with Kaitlyn my brain just couldnapost get involved at all. My brain was in a totally dferent place to what my body was doing. The pain was unbelievable. It was far worst than my first labour. It was just dreadful.  In the end Roxanne was given an epidural, which she was grateful for as it meant Kaitlyn could had a peaceful delivery. She said: She had the delivery that I always wanted for her. It was quite beautul. They askedI wanted to see her and I didnapost even hesitate. I couldnapost wait to meet her. I just wanted to have her and hold her in my arms. She was perfect. She looked like any other newborn baby, she just didnapost open her eyes or make a sound. I donapost think I let go of her that night. I cuddled her for hours. During the next few hours they gave Kaitlyn a bath, brushed her hair, took photos and made prints of her hands and footprints.  The hospital lent them a pram so they could go outside and organised for a professional photographer to go out with them to capture the special moment. I really wanted to take her for a walk. I just wanted her to see outside. Over the next few days they went back to the hospital to spend more time with Kaitlyn, introducing her to her big sister. It was really hard to explain it to her. She had no idea what aposdiedapos meant, it was probably the first time she had heard the word. It took a long time, we drip fed it to her over a number of days, probably weeks. She would ask questions and we would keep it very simple and keep repeating the same words.  We donapost talk about sleeping or being poorly as we donapost want her to be scared of those things. We donapost talk about dying in hospital as we donapost want her to be scared of going to hospital. We have to be honest, even though it hurts. The hospital gave them a book called aposPlayground in the Skyapos which they read to her to help her understand, and she still says thataposs where her little sister is now. On the Wednesday Roxanne ed to the hospital on her own to say goodbye to Kaitlyn. I just spent a couple of hours with her. I had written her a letter and bought her a pendant with the letter K on it. I made sure she was wrapped up in her cot with all her things and I left her with the midwe.  I had spent nine months growing her and speaking to her everyday, I felt like I needed to be the last person to give her a kiss and say goodbye and hold her. It was beautul but it really hurt. Every day that we walked out of that hospital without her just felt wrong. You walk past parents carrying their babies and I just thought aposthat should be usapos. It really hurt. Roxanne described the weeks that followed as horrendous. I could barely get out of bed. I cried all the time, just all the time in a way I have never cried before in my le. I couldnapost spent time with our oldest daughter. People kept saying at least youaposve got her to get up for, but it made me panic as I couldnapost spend time with her because every time I saw her I just saw a missing space where Kaitlyn should be.  They just looked so similar. I thought I was a terrible mum. Just a few weeks after losing Kaitlyn the family had to deal with Christmas. It was just brutal. I just felt like I was walking around in a glass box. I could see and hear people but I just wasnapost on this planet. I felt like a ghost. Roxanne and Sam decided to try a Sands support group, and ended up meeting a number of people who truly understood the pain they were feeling. The couple also both used the charityaposs helpline and say it gave them invaluable support when things got really, really bad.  Roxanne said: Iaposve spent hours just crying and talking to them about all the things in my head and theyaposre always there. The couple have also done a number of incredible things in Kaitlynaposs name to help other parents going through the same painful time. They set up a support group at their local hospital called Flutterbyes, offering support to anyone who needs it. One of the things that Roxanne found really helpful during the weeks after saying goodbye to Kaitlyn was a weighted memory bear, custom made to be the exact same weight as she was.

Each time Marcus Tisson takes to the stage, the tragedy that brought him there is at the front of his mind. Three years ago his mum Margaret unexpectedly took her own le by jumping in front of a train, tearing his family apart. Just two months later his dad Winston, who had battled schizophrenia all his le, passed away of what Marcus believes was a broken heart. His parentsapos deaths left the -year-old from East London with severe anxiety and PTSD, but he says comedy saved his le. In the aftermath, Marcus of Bow, East London, decided to channel his grief into making people laugh. He has shared his story for World Mental Health Day, and hopes he can help inspire others through dficult times.    Marcus said doing stand-up is therapeutic for him, and he tackles the tragedy head-on in his performances. He runs a campaign encouraging others to open up about their mental health, and believes laughter can help get this crucial message across. Suicide ruined my family, he said. When my mum took her own le it was a big shock to everyone around her, there were no signs of it. She seemed happy, even in the days before she took her le, we were talking about her birthday. Thataposs what really hurts. If someone is ill you can prepare yourself and say goodbye, but to go like this, there are no words to describe it. I will never get over it.  Marcus last spoke to Margaret, who was  when she died, the day before her death - and desperately wishes she had spoken to someone about what she was going through. I just wish she had reached out and spoken to someone, he said. We could have helped her through it. On August , , the worst day of Marcusapos le, he received a call from his aunt breaking the tragic news that his mum had died at Mile End station.  The tragedy, and his dadaposs death soon after, left him reeling, anxious about showing his grief to his young children and unable to leave his home. I had really bad anxiety and PTSD, he said. I didnapost want to be around my children, I didnapost want them to see me broken. Marcus, who teaches speech, language and literacy in a school, had long harboured a dream of going into comedy. Comedy saved my le, he said. It sounds strange, but it helps my anxiety. I always wanted to be a comedian, I was always the class clown, but taking to the stage is very dferent. Itaposs like therapy to me.  He started by cautiously going up onstage at an open mic night and telling a few jokes. Once I get my first laughs I was OK, he said. He gave his first solo show, named Donapost Call Me Crazy, at the start of October in London, and has more events lined up, including a set in Edinburgh. I want to be international, he said. I want to travel around the world and take this message about mental health. I was a bit worried about using my mental health as comedy, I donapost want people to thinking Iaposm laughing at mental health, but Iaposm telling my truth, Iaposm telling my story.

And while thereaposs always a tempting array of bread and cakes on offer, thereaposs one classic item we find ourselves going back for time after time - the jam doughnut.Filled with oozing strawberry or raspberry jam and covered in a light dusting of sugar, the jam doughnut leaves us licking our lips and wanting more.But weaposve just discovered something about the bakery staple that might shock you.    It turns out that some bakeries use an unexpected ingredient when making their jam doughnuts.Australian doughnut franchise Donut King, which has a branch in Essex, have just revealed the huge industry secret. Speaking to news.au, general manager Andrew Badcock confessed that some food brands donapost use real jam in their jam doughnuts at all.Instead they fill the tasty treats with coloured and flavoured apple paste or sauce.    He explained: Some food brands use apple paste or sauce as the core ingredient in their raspberry jam recipe. With its natural sweetness and no pips, apple sauce is widely used for its smooth and ‘jammy’ texture. He added: Many customers show a proclivity towards smoother and more consistent textures in their food choices as it’s a more familiar and comforting experience. Pips, seeds and smaller grains tend to get caught in teeth and a lot of people don’t appreciate that sensation.    So there you have it folks, the world as we know it, is in fact a lie. Ok, maybe thataposs a little bit dramatic, but weaposre still pretty taken aback by this food bomb that has been dropped on us.Just as we were very surprised when we discovered that fish and chip shops donapost serve proper vinegar. According to  YouTuber   Tom Scott,  many chippies instead use something known as a non-brewed condiment in place of vinegar.A non-brewed condiment is a malt vinegar substitute made from water, acetic acid and ious flavourings - yummy! Youaposve probably never been able to tell the dference between the two, as it looks very similar to the real thing and only tastes slightly dferent, but it takes less time to make and can be purchased in a concentrated form, so it lasts longer.

Luckily on this occasion the home side were able to clear.What the game needed was something special, something to get the fans on their feet and eventually McDaid would deliver exactly that.A -yard strike would fly past Derek Gaston, crash off the post and find the back of the net in what proved to be the perfect settler for both players and fans.It was at this point Dundee played some of their best stuff and Dorrans was involved when the Dee almost grabbed their second on the stroke of half time. He took a smart free-kick, finding McGhee in the middle of the box before he laid off to McDaid, his strike crashing off Ricky Little when it looked certain to go in.That’s the thing about this team, the philosophy manager McPake wants to use can cause impatience in the stands but when they get going, it can be easy on the eye.Especially with strong midfield players like Dorrans, Shaun Byrne and Paul McGowan pulling the strings.It was another well-worked set-piece which brought a second for Dundee and for McDaid.He found Sean Mackie on the byline who ed it to his fellow-winger before McDaid cut inside and rled a spectacular strike into the top corner to double his tally and better his previous long-range strike in the first half.Despite an attempted comeback from the visitors following the second goal, it was always comfortable for Dundee after they doubled their tally – and they could have had even morenot for some poor decision making.The real test lies ahead, though, as they look to follow this result up with another victory.Each league win so far has been followed up by two poor results – an average that simply cannot continueDundee are to have any hope this season."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/10/5d9464d32ed745.15718946-846x564.jpg ","title":"dad always said hed be teaching until his final day and he was tributes paid to much loved broughty ferry driving instructor","story":"A driving instructor who helped four generations of families in Broughty Ferry get behind the wheel has died aged .Bill Anderson, of Strome Terrace, who set up Broughty Ferry School of Motoring in , died on Monday having been admitted to hospital two weeks earlier.Bill had been taken in for bowel surgery but developed bronchitis and pneumonia which he was too weak to fight off.He leaves behind his we Norma, , two daughters Lorraine Kneebone, , and Lezley Cassidy, , and four grandchildren Nick, , Ross, , Jamie, , and Tamzyn, .Lorraine said: “Dad was a friendly gentleman, he had a great sense of humour and got on with everyone.“He loved his business.

The work he does defensively probably goes unnoticed.“If you ask the boys in our team about what he does going back the pitch, that’s why they trust him so much and why I trust him so much.“We have challenged him to be better up the pitch like everyone  and on Saturday he was.“I think he needed that wee boost because of his play over the course of the season, particularly going back the game in games when we’ve needed him.“In the Alloa game, Jack Hamilton made the penalty save in that game butMcDaid hadn’t ran  yards to clear the ball at the back post we draw that game and there’s further frustration at the football club.“That’s what he does going that way and we have seen what he can do going the other way on Saturday.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/10/5d9eee32af2d08.68303189-e1570712070257.jpg ","title":"teletots 2019 final chance to grab top prizes","story":"Time is fast running out for families to take part in our TeleTots photo contest for the cutest Tayside toddlers.A Tele photographer has been on hand to capture the smiling faces of hundreds of boys and girls free of charge in this year’s event at the Overgate shopping centre. vw, px\"  However, the competition draws to a close this weekend.

It has to be remembered that the manager has only had two weeks to work with the squad.“He had a week in the summer with two games and a week last timewith two games.“Relative to club football where a manager gets a full five or six weeks to embed his philosophy and get across what he wants to do, with the national team the manager gets the bare minimum amount of time.“At one point we did a double session when preparing for a game, that’s probably quite unheard of at international level.“But we need to make use of the time we’ve got without upsetting the intensity load on the players.“The manager has been getting his points across and with each the players are understanding what he wants and what is demanded.“Everybody is working well and delighted to be involved so I think the more time the manager gets the better it will be.”This is the fourth Scotland squad Devlin has been in, but he has still to make his international bow.The former Hamilton Accies player looked set to feature under previous boss Alex McLeish against Albania and Israel in the Nations League last November.However, an ankle injury sustained in training meant he missed out on a debut and ended up spending three months on the sidelines.Devlin ed to the Scotland squad in June, but didn’t make it off the bench against Cyprus or Belgium.At the start of this season he suffered a hamstring injury after playing in the - Pittodrie win over RoPS Rovaniemi of Finland in the Europa League first qualying round first leg on July .Devlin didn’tto the fray for the Dons until August .Following his solid display in a - home victory against Ross County he was called into the national squad for last month’s double header with Russia and Belgium after injuries to David Bates and Grant Hanley.Since then Devlin has started all of Aberdeen’s game, apart from Saturday’s - draw with Hibs where he was on the bench.He added: “It has been great to be involved in the Scotland squad.“But I’ve also got a job to do with Aberdeen. I hadn’t been playing and then got the opportunity against Ross County.“We won the game - which was good and then I have to try to keep myself in the team.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/10/5d962bc84a3f69.65008050-375x564.jpg ","title":"adopt a pet could rehome any of these animals06101","story":"Are you looking to get a new pet  Why not adopt one of these adorable pets from Mrs Murray’s Cat and Dog Home.One-year-old Marley is looking for a new home with no other pets.She can be a little stand-offish to begin with and is quite shy.She would do best in a quiet home where she can gain confidence and be pampered.She doesn’t like loud noises so wouldn’t be suited to a busy household.Can you offer Marley her forever home This handsome chap is Simba, He is two years old.Simba is still a big puppy at heart and has no idea about boundaries and his size.He will need an experienced owner with the time to continue his training and teach this clever boy some manners.He is not suitable to be rehomed around small children and is not the best behaved with other dogs.This sweet girl is two years old.Unfortunately Roxy is not fully house trained so will need a new owner who can work on this with her.She has so much love and affection to give and is really good with children.We have no history on her with other pets.Roxy is an indoor cat.Can you offer Roxy her forever home Mrs Murray#s Home for Stray Dogs and CatsTel:   "},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/10/5d9c2a43a44b37.91776522-848x564.jpg ","title":"north east health hub a model for country says nicola sturgeon","story":"A north-east health hub will offer an “example” to other parts of the country, the First Minister has claimed on a visit to the north-east.Nicola Sturgeon officially opened the Inverurie Health and Care Hub yesterday, telling NHS Grampian staff gathered for the occasion that the facility was “ground-breaking”.She added: “In all parts of the country the real focus is on making sure health and social care services are properly and effectively integrated and that means staff working together in more joined up ways than the past.“There’s no doubt it makes a huge dferencethere are fit-for-purpose, state-of-the-art facilities where dferent services and treatments are provided under one roof.“So both in terms of the scale of this hub and also the dferent services that are provided here, it definitely offers an example and a model for other parts of the country.

Now I am not saying this is the simplest or even healthiest of activities. All this crouching, hand staining, pricked fingers and even eye strain.Often when you reach for a large black juicy berry it seems to disappear. It’s like the behaviour of politicians. They offer so much but when you reach for it # it disappears. Do you remember the Scottish government passed a law guaranteeing one would be seen by an appropriate health specialist within a stated limited time  The SNP government daily breaks this law – be it on cancer, accident and emergencies, or mental health.Or what about the promises made to the people of Arran and the Outer Hebrides on improved ferry services. The Scottish government is responsible for Caledonian Maritime Assets, CMal, which own and manage ferries. MV Glen Sannox was intended to commence service to Arran in  but lies incomplete for all to see in the Ferguson Marine yard in Port Glasgow. Part of the delay is because of disagreement over the fixed-price design and build contract for the two vessels.The SNP seems obsessed with this type of contract which has adversely affected schools, colleges and community centres. Worse still, while the SNP ridiculed previous government public private partnerships they have introduced a system clearly no better. What about the £. million each month we the taxpayers have to pay for the unopened Edinburgh sick children’s hospital  Jeanne Freeman, the SNP Cabinet Secretary for Health and Social Care, stepped in so late that she does not know whether this much-needed hospital will ever open.The second part of the bramble experience is the delicious mouthwatering bramble crumble. A crumble which gives joy and stimulation. Not like the crumbling state of the SNP government which has a sour taste and clearly disappoints.Finlay Craig, CoveSir,Your readers may be interested to know that there are currently  people in need of a kidney transplant in Scotland whose diet will be restricted due to kidney disease.It is likely that they will be on fluid restrictions of around just ml of liquid a day # including liquid found in foods like sauces and ice cream.

Last year, it rehomed over , domestic pets and successfully released , wild animals back to their natural environment. The society now also delivers industry-leading animal welfare educational programmes to people of all ages.In my short time with the society I know of hundreds of examples of our dedicated people going above and beyond to do all they can for the animals and humans they come across. So, I can only imagine how many fantastic stories must be out there about the people who’ve worn our unorm since we were formed.As well as those who have had a positive experience with us in the recent past, we are hoping to uncover some long lost tales from descendants of those we’ve touched in decades gone by.The society wants anyone with any interesting anecdotes or memorabilia to get in touch via the website or by emailing .years@scottishspca.org.Kirsteen Campbell, chief executive, Scottish SPCASir,The likelihood of the UK exiting the EU has now shted from ‘possible’ to ‘probable’.That gives greater focus to our efforts to prepare and proof our farming industry from the impacts of no deal.Whilst it always has been  the position of NFU Scotland that the UK must secure a favourable deal on the terms of exit with the EU, we must also support our industry through any change in the operating environment.Many NFU Scotland members might think that their businesses won’t be impacted, but the reality is that there will be implications for all of us. Some will be direct and immediate, and others more indirect and emerging through time – but the one certainty is that these will be felt by all of us involved in the agri-food chain.There are a few things that would make a big dferenceapplied right across the board in the UK.First, the UK Government’s proposed import tarf schedule desperately requires revision. It would expose some produce # specically cereals, oilseeds, potatoes, eggs and horticultural produce # to a tarf going into the EU, but would allow that same product to come into the UK with no tarf.This is farcical.To apply asymmetrical tarfs on any products between us and the EU is to completely misunderstand the nature of food security in the UK and fails to recognise that trade is vital to both the UK and the EU.One thing that can be done, regardless of Brexit, is for our own governments to prioritise using our own products when it comes to public procurement.All our politicians like to talk about how good our agricultural industry is in comparison to others across the world in terms of standards and environmental benefits, but we don’t see near enough in the way of Scottish or British products being prioritised for use in schools, hospitals and other public services.Yes, it may add one or two pence to a meal – but I would challenge governments and public procurement buyers what the real cost is of bringing products in from other parts of the world.These products certainly don’t meet our standards – not to mention the impact on climate change with food miles taken into consideration.It’s only a couple of years since the kids in our schools were getting their chicken from Thailand. Things are improving, but it’s still not Scottish chicken.This is within the gt of both Holyrood and Westminster, but it might just be the catalyst for governments to work with local authorities to do the right thing when it comes to feeding those who use our public services.Martin Kennedy, vice president, NFU ScotlandSir,I read with interest the letter from Doctor Strain in the August  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.Might I suggest that to produce a meaningful logo for the GP practices the following criteria are applied:The logo will need to show:May I suggest there are better ways to provide a service to treat patients, without resorting to gimmicks.Name and address supplied.Sir,I was intrigued to read Finlay Craig’s ramblings in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser.Would he be willing to share the location of his magical bramble bush for it appears the fruits of this bountul bush, when mixed into a pie, contain mystical properties that can transport the diner to another world May I suggest he tries a cold slice of reality pie now and again which would snap him out of his biased reverie and bring him back to the reality of the UK parliament being suspended and the Scottish representative of the party responsible for that outrageous manoeuvre vacating her post in protest In contrast, the Scottish government is working, along with others, to stop Scotland being dragged out of Europe against its wishes. Or perhaps the suspension of democracy is okay in his dream world If Mr Craig or any of his friends eat too much of his prodigious pie, I am sure they will not hesitate to avail themselves of a free prescription for their malaise and, should they need it, free bus travel to the chemist to pick it up, all supplied by the Scottish Government. If they live on one of our beautul islands, they can soon jump on one of the new ferries being completed as I write, again thanks to the Scottish Government.All this aside, when he rejoins us on planet earth, Mr Craig might think of entering his mysterious pie in the baking section of next year#s Mid Argyll Show, though I think by that time we may all be in need of something a little stronger from Scotland’s political larder to extract us from the bitter reality of Brexit Britain.Charles Ambrose, Lochgilphead.Sir,The National Autistic Society wants to find exceptional people, schools and services making a huge dference to autistic children and adults and their families.

It keeps its money as close to home as possible so that, amid historically drastic cuts, the amount spent locally has gone up as featured inon January ,  which notes #where other authorities privatise, Preston grows its own businesses#.Preston ensures that its resources prioritise local providers and businesses wherever possible. Argyll and Bute Council#s Procurement Strategy   falls some way short of this. Its stated aims commendably include:There is no particular emphasis, however, on using its resources to grow Argyll and Bute businesses, to reduce carbon emissions and food transport miles or to foster healthy eating strategies that would benefit our local farmers through #joining up the dots# of local supply and demand.The climate emergency demands a bolder and more innovative respond, and demands it now.Mary MacCallum Sullivan, ArdrishaigSir,I wish to comment on Mr Henderson#s  open letter to Brendan O#Hara in the September  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.The expression #crash out# of Europe is used by Conservative members of parliament, the BBC and the press. While emotive, this is what many people directly affected by Brexit feel is happening.For example, on the matter of Germans buying our fish without a trade agreement the tarf will be  per cent on our fish exports to the EU. The Germans will no longer buy our fish.We can all read about other examples of the harm being done in the press every day. The cost of implementing a no deal exit will be borne by all of us, through further austerity , increased taxes , increased national debt or a combination of all three. To my mind, such measures will indeed cause serious economic and social harm.While Brendan O#Hara received a minority of the votes in Argyll, the present government was elected  by less than  per cent of the  electorate.David Inglis, Ardrishaig.Sir,During this, National Air Ambulance Week , may I draw readers# attention to the amazing work of the country#s only charity-funded air ambulance service # Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance .Since  this le-saving service has been flying help and hope to communities all across Scotland in response to serious illness and injury.From our base at Perth Airport, we have responded to more than , time-critical emergencies and impacted on the lives of thousands # and the need goes on.The recently-established Scottish Trauma Network has seen four key major trauma centres created at hospitals in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee.

Two men were paid to accompany Patrick the Fool on his journey from England to provide entertainment for the King and his guests while residing at Tarbert.Also recorded is a figure for #making a suit for the King at Tarbert#.  Bruce visited Tarbert on many occasions. His final visit was in the year of his death.Tarbert is believed to have been one of the earliest Royal Burghs in Argyll. An early reference as such was made in . It is also said to have had one of the earliest paved streets in Scotland.King James IV also had a close connection with Tarbert. The addition of the #keep# to the castle, part of which still stands today, was constructed at his direction. Whilst this work was underway, James summoned parliament to meet him here to discuss matters local to the area. This meeting took place on July  .Over the years, many travellers of note have passed this way and commented on Tarbert and its scenic surroundings.In  Thomas Pennant arrived by sea at East Loch Tarbert and described the scenery as #picturesque#.CGS Teighnmouthpassed through the Kyles of Bute in  and commented that #it offers no scenery worthy of notice#. He continued to note that #the romantic little harbour of East Loch Tarbert – with the overhanging keep of its ruined castle # form a scene singularly picturesque#. He became a frequent visitor to Tarbert.In  Lord Cockburndescribed the Kyles as #rugged and picturesque# but, arriving at his destination, exclaimed: #But Tarbert! East Tarbert!

Argyll and Bute Council imposes restrictions on works likely to have a visual impact on its appearance.But the council has apparently raised no objection to this visually damaging proposal. Similarly, Visit Scotland is reported as having raised no objection as well as closing all its tourist offices in Cowal, Mid Argyll and Kintyre in the past year.With the recent decline in the Loch Fyne fishing industry, Tarbert is increasingly dependent on tourism to provide employment.Other issues include the sterilisation of ground under the proposed line of overhead wiring. Opportunities to extend social housing will be restricted under the present plan.OFGEM administers a £ million fund set up to mitigate the impact of electricity infrastructure on national parks and #scenic areas#.Tarbert, along with its harbour and the isthmus linking it with West Loch Tarbert, without doubt, constitutes a #scenic area#.Reconsideration of this proposal is essential."},{"url":null,"title":"accordion and fiddle club back in tune","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe new season of Inveraray and District Accordion and Fiddle Club gets underway on Wednesday October .Guest artistes for the opening night are accordion maestro Gordon Pattullo from Coupar Angus, with Malcolm Ross on drums making a welcometo the club.Margaret Mather encouraged supporting players to join for a tune: #Without you there would be no club, so why not look out your accordion or fiddle and head for the Inveraray Inn.#This season, the club has opted for a new starting time of .pm for each session."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column october 4 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsTo an observer, it seems that Argyll and Bute Council is, at best, confused over its approach to autism.The people who know this best are those affected by the condition and their families and their view of senior council officials was made crystal clear when Autism Argyll gave up banging its head against a brick wall a year ago.Little seems to have changed since then.A council Autism Strategy Group is apparently being bypassed in the formulation of a strategy, yet the councillor in charge of health and social care says the strategy is the responsibility of the HSCP.Yet again, it is people affected by autism who are losing out.

Assisted by Scott Souden’s low cross from the left flank, the substitute striker guided a delightful flick into the net beyond the Glynhill keeper. Taking on the role of target-man with gusto, Radecki played a big part in the Feathers-sponsored Pupils’ fourth goal, when he held off a defender down the right wing and crossed to substitute Calum McKillop, whose back-heel flick found Souden at the penalty spot, and the -year-old winger, making the journey home from Edinburgh for a game, passed the ball into the net with ease to complete the scoring.The game became a procession in the closing minutes with man-of-the-match Crossan, the midfield linchpin alongside the impressive Liam Renton, orchestrating some controlled possession football, but there was some trouble on  minutes when a malicious foul on ex-Dumbarton man D McCallum sparked into a melee with players from both sides involved. It resulted in a second booking for Kenny Kerr, a yellow for J McCallum, and a red card for the original Glynhill culprit, as well as yellow for the visiting keeper from referee Jimmy Litster, after charging from his own goalmouth to become involved.Undeterred, the Pupils settled back down to seal a richly deserved victory,achieved through a disciplined and determined performance.The Kintyre Park side will now enjoy a free week, with ato action scheduled for Saturday October , opponent to be confirmed.For fixture updates, and to see second-half action and goals from last Saturday’s match, see Campbeltown Football on Facebook, or @PupilsAFC on Twitter."},{"url":null,"title":"weather wont play fair for men","story":"Strong winds, for most of the players, deflected several balls into the severe rough and out of bounds and pushed scores upwards.Robert Shaw, one of the first out in the morning ballot, had an excellent round to finish on a nett  from Ken MacMillan on nett .The wind continued in the afternoon but didn#t deter John Docherty from the best scratch score of the day.

However, it was the home side that took the lead on the nd minute when Ashfield’s centre forward cut in from the left before sending an unstoppable shot in to the top corner.A test of character was required from the boys as they fell behind and with five minutes of the half remaining they were rewarded after a corner dropped to Stuart Phillps in the box. The young forward adjusted his feet quickly to send a beautul curling shot past everyone to make it -.Fteen minutes into the second half the Pupils took the lead. New signing Raphael MacLachlan, playing in only his second appearance for the s, sent in a delightful whipped corner that brushed off the Ashfield centre-half into the goal to make it -. The Clachan youngster can be proud of his impact on the game and is already proving to be a valuable addition to the team.As the Pupils pressed for their third of the game a long ball evaded the defence to allow the Ashfield number  in again to equalise with  minutes remaining.As the game drew to a close, it looked like both sides would share the points until a dramatic final minute. A long clearance by Ashfield was misjudged by the Pupils defence to allow Ashfield’s player in with a chance of his hat-trick but the youngster scuffed his shot into thankful hands of Pupils goal-keeper Lorne Paterson.Knowing it was the final minute, Paterson tried to kick the ball up the field as quickly as possible only for it to cannon off the back of Euan O’May’s head! It landed back in Paterson’s hands and he quickly dispersed the ball, long up the field where the ball bounced high over everyone, only for Calum Ellis to nip in front of the Ashfield centre-half, run in on goal, calmly round the advancing goal-keeper and stroke the ball home to make it - to the Ardshield Hotel-sponsored side – much to the delight of his fellow team mates and coaches.Ellis who has now scored seven goals in the Under s# opening four games.This weekend the team will enjoy a free fixture due before playing at home to Glasgow Boys Club on Sunday October ."},{"url":null,"title":"mcfadyens amam a tremendous days golf","story":"It was one of sponsor McFadyen Contractors Ltd#s own teams that won the trophy with a tremendous score of  # a mighty  under par.

have been sent to schools and the councilrsquos head of development, Douglas Proudfoot, told the Courier at the launch of the naming consultation earlier this month that pupils were ldquofree to choose whatever name their wish.At the same launch, Councillor Willie Innes, the council leader, said that Blindwells ldquomay well appear on the [final] shortlistour young people feel the name should be retained.Yet the Courier has learnt that in letters sent out to headteachers, Mr Innes has made it clear that the council wants a ldquofresh, new name for this new town.This has called into question just how much ldquofreedom pupils really have in the naming process.And the packs sent out to schools say that ldquothe mine was called Blindwells, but we [the council] donrsquot think that fits with all the great new facilities that are going to be in the new town.Harry Cairney, honorary president of Prestonpans Labour Club and president of Scotmid, worked at the mine from  until its closure in .He was saddened that the Blindwells name was not deemed worthy of the town in future.ldquoBlindwells was such a large employer itrsquos unfortunate that they donrsquot want to stick with the name, he said.ldquoIrsquod love to know why. Everyone calls it Blindwells and they use the name with affection.ldquoTheyrsquoll probably end up calling it some long, drawn-out name that no one has any connection to, and everyone will keep calling it Blindwells anyway!Tranent and Elphinstone Community Council has written to East Lothian Council chief executive Angela Leitch stating that it wants the name Blindwells to appear on the final shortlist of names.Brian Weddell, Prestonpans Community Council chair, had similar views. He said: ldquoThis is an issue that will be raised at the next meeting, but I would be very surprisedthe community council didnrsquot decide to write and request Blindwells be added to the list in the final consultation.ldquoWe donrsquot want to lose our industrial heritage. Names like Meadowmill, Bankton and Blindwells are important to us. Irsquom surprised to hear that Willie Innes is pushing this ndash hersquos been a long-standing and supportive councillor in this area.Mr Innes told the Courier previously that ldquoin talking to local people there seems to be a strong wish to have a fresh new name for this important new town.And when the Courier asked Mr Proudfoot at the launch of the consultation process whether there was a desire for the Blindwells name to be consigned to the history books, he said: ldquoI donrsquot really know where this is coming from.But there is now clarity ndash this viewpoint is coming from the council itself.Each primary school is to put forward three possible name choices which would then help form a shortlist for the public to vote on.The deadline for the schools to submit their suggestions is tomorrow .Mr Innes and Mr Proudfoot were not available to speak to the Courier this week.But Tranent councillor Gordon Mackett said: ldquoI appreciate that this is a rare and exciting opportunity to name a new town however, I feel that the original name holds a lot of history.ldquoI personally feel the Blindwells name has great meaning to a lot of local families. It would be a pity to lose part of our local heritage.ldquoI feel that it is wrong to disregard the name Blindwells due to the amount of local history attached to the name.Councillor Lachlan Bruce added: ldquoI think itrsquos important that the students have as much freedom as they want when thinking about what to call the new town and that should include Blindwellsthey want to suggest that.Work on building the first homes at Blindwells could get under way at the beginning of next year.More than , houses ndash as well as a school and ious community facilities ndash have the go-ahead, with many more homes expected in the future."},{"url":null,"title":"pub-hairdressers-prestonpans-broken-night","story":"The first incident happened at am on Wednesday at the Railway Tavern on High Street, where damage was caused but nothing was stolen.Police are also investigating a break-in at the nearby  Hairdressers, which took place at about.am.

What exactly fostered it I cannot say, but for sure the stories of lsquoMadam Butterflyrsquo, a teacher at Preston Lodge, was part of it, and perhaps also the history that I was visibly surrounded by when I left Prestonpans and moved to Edinburghrsquos Old Town as a teenager.What I do remember from these times is a powerful feeling that I was lucky to have this interest. It kept me going when I was having bad times, because there was always something that interested me or stimulated my fascination.I have realised now that part of historyrsquos appeal is the images it creates for us, of a time that is dferent to ours. No matter how many lsquofactsrsquo there may be, itrsquos our imaginative interpretation of them which makes this information interesting or fascinating.This is why archaeology can also be particularly interesting. Itrsquos a tantalising glimpse into the past but leaves lots of scope for our own imaginative recreations. This connects to the fact that we often hold fascination for things we have lost because we cannot physically experience them anymore.For me, this is the case every time I travel through the Hardgate in Haddington. Until the s, a building stood on the east side of the street, where now there is a small grassy park. Locals nicknamed the building Bothwell Castle, although it wasnrsquot a castle in the real sense, but an impressive town house owned by the Cockburns of Sandybed, hence its original name, Sandybed House. Old photos of it show it in a rundown condition even a hundred years ago, but still looking magnicent.Nobody now will remember what it looked like inside before its dilapidated state. A drawing of the interior from the s shows it had wooden ling, described as ldquoexcellent examples of native craftsmanship.The most prominent feature from the street was perhaps the circular stair tower, which also had the original entrance. It was this feature that made the building look like a castle, I reckon. Inside there was a sunken floor, two upper floors and an attic. It enclosed a courtyard and the building ran eastwards to the banks of the River Tyne.There is a scarcity of historical information about this building, which was demolished to widen the road, after ious attempts to save it failed.But there is at least one story which lights my imagination whenever I am standing in the small green park where Bothwell Castle once stood.It involves the notorious James Hepburn, th Earl of Bothwell, the man who murdered Mary Queen of Scotsrsquo husband Darnley and then married her himself, after seemingly abducting her.But the story takes place before all this, during the time when Maryrsquos mother, Mary of Guise, was fighting the Protestant Lords of the Congregation. Despite being a Protestant, Bothwell was on the side of the Catholic queen. He was young but one of the most powerful nobles in the land.In , Bothwell received information that a huge sum of money was being sent by an English nobleman called Sir Ralph Sadler to help the Lords of the Congregation. He lay in wait and attacked the carrier of the money, both robbing and wounding him.This act enraged the leaders of the Protestant cause and some time afterwards the leaders, the Earl of Arran and Lord James Stewart, headed for Haddington to capture Bothwell.The house he was staying in was close to the River Tyne. But he saw the soldiers approaching just in time and fled. He got to the river and waded along its banks until he reached Sandybed House.He knew he had likely been spotted and his pursuers were hot on his heels. So he entered Sandybed House by the back door. He could hear the shouts from the soldiers outside and knew he had little time to hide, but where He ran into the kitchen, where a spit boy sat turning the spit. There was not a moment to lose.ldquoQuick, gie me yer claes tae wear, Bothwell commanded. The young lad, unable to refuse an order from such a powerful noble, immediately obeyed. Bothwell, being a slim young man himself, was just able to slip them on.Then Bothwell sat by the fire and began to turn the spit, pretending to be the spit boy, whom he commanded to leave and to take his clothes. We have no account of the moment the soldiers entered the kitchen. It will have been a tense one. Bothwell will have felt the heat, both of fear and of the fire on his face and hands just a small and very short taste of the harsh le of a spit boy.The soldiers did not recognise that the spit boy was actually Bothwell sitting in disguise in the half dark flickering light of the kitchen. Servants with such a lowly status were barely even noticed anyway by the noble class. They were almost like part of the furniture to them.There is a story that he then fled to his castle at Hailes dressed as a woman. It is said he later rewarded Cockburn of Sandybed for not giving him away, but one wondersthe spit boy was also rewarded.I suspect not. However, I like to think he was somehow able to keep Bothwellrsquos clothes, and I wonderthe woman got hers back.No doubt the spit boy often told his story as he turned the spit, cooking it as much as the meat.Sadly, the kitchen where this took place has gone now, of course. But is it In , a community archaeology project was undertaken, part funded by the Peter Potter Gallery Monument project. Archaeologist David Connolly explains in a fascinating YouTube clip that the dig revealed parts of Bothwell Castle. He shows that the lintel above the door into the kitchen lies just under the ground. In fact, the remains of the kitchen are just part of a mass of archaeological finds in the Hardgate, going back to Medieval times.These finds are covered up now, butyou venture yourself to the wee park in the Hardgate you can still see the disturbed ground where they took place.And look closely at the wall by the road, next to the southern entrance. There is a strange curve in the wall here. Thatrsquos because the lower section of this part of the wall is in fact the remains of the circular stair tower of Bothwell Castle.A buddleia butterfly bush was growing by it when I visited last week, but my long-suffering family waited as I ventured under the bush to take a photo of what I believe to be the old stonework of the stair tower.I then told them the story of the spit boy as we sat on the location of the kitchen. The river is just beyond and as we left the park I couldnrsquot get an image of Bothwell dressed as a washer woman out of my head.As I say, history can be fascinating because it stimulates our imaginative interpretation!"},{"url":null,"title":"pipers-become-movie-stars-bands-unusual-new-calendar","story":"Haddington Pipe Band launches its  calendar this weekend, with this yearrsquos taking on a movie theme.The launch is at the townrsquos The Loft Cafe today , where the  shots that were taken for the calendar by photographer Paul Bock will be on show until January.Alastair Bruce, from Haddington Pipe Band, said: ldquoWe decided on a slightly dferent approach this time round and wersquove certainly had a lot of fun putting these shots together.ldquoOur inspiration was iconic film posters so, working with Paul, we have recreated and re-interpreted  well-known posters and given them all a piping and drumming twist, with band members taking the starring roles.ldquoWersquove also put a spin on the titles and the other text which featured on the originals.The group are recreating posters from popular movies including Braveheart, Trainspotting, Harry Potter, Chariots of Fire, The Sound of Music and Pirates of the Caribbean.Alastair added: ldquoItrsquos a pleasure to pay tribute to Paul Bock, who has done an absolutely fantastic job with the shots his creativity was unbelievable.ldquoAimee Colley of Shaw Marketing and Design also did a terric job creating the artwork and Lori Walker was a huge help in turning band members into film stars with her make-up skills.ldquoOf course, the real stars are the band members themselves!ldquoWe are also extremely grateful to the many businesses and organisations who have kindly sponsored the production.

We are told there is a two week wait when all the anecdotal evidence is that it is at least threenot four weeks.A spokesperson from Riverside said: ldquoIn East Lothian, as in many parts of Scotland, people are living longer with increasingly complex health and care needs.ldquoIn response to this growing challenge, Riverside Medical Practice has been working hard over the last few years to transform the way our patients are being cared for, working closely with a wider range of healthcare professionals to ensure the right care is provided by the right person at the time help is needed.ldquoThrough this, the practice has made signicant improvements in providing lsquosame dayrsquo appointments for those whose health concern may be urgent. In addition, through making these positive changes, Riverside has been able to provide more and longer advance bookable GP appointments.ldquoRiverside is growing our team of GPs and has successfully recruited seven new GPs over the last two years.ldquoThe practice is currently going through a period of signicant telephone and clinical systems upgrades that will not only address the limitations patients at the Riverside practice have experienced but will introduce a new low-charge  number.ldquoOnce complete, the upgrades, in line with the new way of working, will provide long-term benefits for all patients in the area.

And the decision has brought angryreaction from the local community, who opposed the substation plans in the first place but were overruled by the Scottish Government.Scottish Ministers called in the substation plans after ruling the project to be of ldquonational importance last year, taking the decision out of the hands of East Lothian Council, the planning authority.Despite local representations opposing the substation, Scottish Ministers gave it the go-ahead in February amid claims it was necessary to move quickly to meet the deadline for the UK Government funding.But the UK Government announced its grants late last month and ICOL was not included in the list of successful projects, leaving the firm to rethink its future.East Lothian MSP Iain Gray said it appeared Scottish Ministersrsquo decision to ldquoride roughshod over local feeling ldquomight all have been for nothing.The former power station site was bought by the council last year and the local authority is marketing the land for economic development.However, the council was forced to reach an agreement with ICOL over a section of the site after the Scottish Government gave the substation the go-ahead.Mr Gray said: ldquoThe immediacy of the UK Government funding decision was the Scottish Governmentrsquos justication for riding roughshod over local decision-making and calling in the substation application in the first place.ldquoI opposed that decision to call in the application as unnecessary and anti-democratic and made the case for it being left in the hands of local people and their representatives.ldquoHowever, having put the local community through such uncertainty, it now appears that the Ministerrsquos heavy-handed interference in the sitersquos future might all have been for nothing. Guy Madgwick, CEO of Red Rock Power, which owns Inch Cape, said:ldquoWe are naturally very disappointed that our Inch Cape Offshore Wind Farm project has not secured a CfD award.ldquoThe development is a culmination of over  years of hard work and signicant investment and could play an important role in both achieving the countryrsquos green energy targets and supporting economic growth.ldquoWe will now liaise closely with our supply chain to consider how best to move forward with the project, and hope to share an update as soon as possible.Brian Weddell, chairman of Prestonpans Community Council, which is pushing for a ferry and cruise terminal to be investigated for the site, said the decision raised questions about Scottish Ministersrsquo decision to call in the application.He said: ldquoThis is a very worrying announcement and puts a large question mark overRed Rockrsquos planned substation at Preston Links.ldquoAt the planning enquiry last year, Red Rock placed considerable emphasis on securing a funding subsidy from the UK Government and this decision also brings into question the wisdom of the Scottish Government calling in their planning application and bypassing the local democratic planning process.East Lothian Council said it had held talks with ICOL regarding the site following the announcement and further meetings would be arranged.A spokesperson said: ldquoWe understand [Inch Cape] are considering all options to allow the project to progress.ldquoWe will hold a meeting with them in the near future to discuss a way forward."},{"url":null,"title":"charity-embezzlers-sentence-deferred-tries-sell-faside-castle","story":"Ian Brash, , stole more than pound, from the student charity the Dr Robert Malcolm Trust while he was a trustee of the organisation.He pleaded guilty to the offence at a court hearing last year and is awaiting sentencing.The hold-up in the case has been Brashrsquos inability to sell the listed castle on the outskirts of Tranent so he can pay the charity back before sentence is passed.But last Friday, Edinburgh Sherf Court was told that the sale of the castle, currently on the market for offers over pound.m, had still not materialised.Sherf Frank Crowe was also told that the forensic accountant employed by the Crown to go through all Brashrsquos finances had taken ill and would need replaced.Sherf Crowe allowed the Crown motion to further defer sentence to allow them more time to delve into Brashrsquos finances.The case will now call again for sentencing on November .Brash pleaded guilty last year to embezzling pound, from the Dr Robert Malcolm Trust charity between August , , and September , .The father-of-two is currently selling the historic Category A-Listed Farsquoside Castle, a th-century four-storey castle with six bedrooms, four reception rooms and a great hall, through a leading Edinburgh estate agent for offers over pound. million."},{"url":null,"title":"long-awaited-port-seton-sports-hall-works-last","story":"The new facility will be part of the Port Seton Centre on the area currently used as the childrenrsquos play area it will allow the community hub to offer a wider array of activities, including indoor basketball, badminton, tennis, football and gymnastics.Some of the existing outdoor play equipment is being removed from the area to facilitate the building works, though this will be relocated to a new play area where within the park, along with the installation of some new play equipment.Tom Reid, head of infrastructure with East Lothian Council, said: ldquoWe are all very excited about the construction of the new sports hall, which will be an excellent new facility for the people of Cockenzie and Port Seton, complementing existing activity areas within the Port Seton Centre.ldquoWe do appreciate that there will need to be an element of disruption associated with the construction work, particularly as the new extension requires to be sited where the current childrenrsquos play park is located.ldquoWe expect to relocate elements of the existing play equipment where possible to the new area and this will be installed to coincide with the arrival of other play equipment in the coming months.ldquoWe recognise this means that there will be a temporary reduction in the amount of play equipment available within the park and we are grateful for the patience and understanding of park users at this time.

An assiduous promoter of gender equality, Professor Belch pointed out that despite the wealth of opportunities open to women in medicine, when it comes to the most prestigious areas, such as heart surgery, men are still top dog.ldquoThese are jobs where you may be required to work from six in the morning to  at night, she said, ldquoand most women decided that they prefer to work part-time rather than commit to that. Not that she blames them: ldquoAfter all, we fought for their right to choose.Part-time employment is now the main obstacle in the campaign for women to be on a par with men. When a female doctor first hooks a stethoscope around her neck the future looks,not precisely plain sailing, then navigable.However,at some point she starts a family, or has older relatives to care for, opting to work part-time creates an unsolvable quandary. You could call the shorter working week a womanrsquos wrecking ball, the destroyer of youthful aspirations.Speak to thirtysomething medics, who started out intending to become heroic surgeons and physicians, and you will detect a weariness, and also a resignation to the fact that the conditions in which they are expected to perform are incompatible with any kind of normal le, let alone raising a family.As a result, an essential tier of the health system voluntarily removes itself from the full-time rota. And while hospital-based medicine is undoubtedly at the extreme end of professional expectations, given the prolonged, intense and erratic shts, what goes for medicine is also true of other careers: the advocate who must work into the small hours and over weekends to keep on top of her case load the head teacher who is in the school before breakfast, and once back home works until bedtime the farmer who labours every day of the year the journalist who cannot clock off until the late-breaking story is filed.No wonder people in these occupations wondertheyrsquove been put on the rack, as they are slowly stretched to breaking point. Yet when doctors, and other high-fliers, decide to go part-time, it is a self-inflicted slow puncture. All the training, expertise and experience they have acquired, all the momentum they have gathered, begins to deflate. Friends and family feel secretly disappointed that a seemingly stellar career has lost its stardust. Worse, the part-timer often feels she is in some unfathomable way to blame for not being able to juggle everybodyrsquos expectations, including her own, yet still have a le worth living.By drawing attention to the part-time glass ceiling, Professor Belch highlights how complicated and protracted the business of reaching true equality remains. The effort to increase the number of women entering medical school, which was once seen as the solution to the predominance of males, succeeded years ago. Indeed, that hurdle has been so successfully overcome there are sometimes more girls in class than boys.The problem is that, in the early years of feminism, none of us looked far enough ahead. Lacking imagination, perhaps, or brimming with optimism, we did not give a thought to the lelong path ndash more accurately a tight-rope ndash on which working women must keep their balance. Once aloft, they need to stay upright not merely when they are young and full of energy, but as their lestyles change, their commitments grow, and their attitudes mature.Belchrsquos comments are a long overdue corrective to the notion that the ward ndash or boardroom, laboratory, lecture hall ndash is as welcoming for women as men. In so doing she has also pointed to the unrealistically tough regime in which many professionals are expected to survive. Itrsquos not just women who have a family to raise, or other caring responsibilities, and itrsquos not just women who feel they must clone themselves in order to get through everything the working day ndash and the action-packed weekend ndash demands. Singletons, or those with partners but no children, can still find employersrsquo expectations excessive and debilitating. The dedication and single-eyed focus required to keep on top of the most responsible roles takes a toll on everyone.Doubtless burn-out existed in Edwardian times, it just didnrsquot have a label. Today we have inherited a pitiless culture in which status is calculated by how visibly gruelling your job is. The more punishing your hours and the less time you have at home, the higher your place on the ladder of awe. The employee who can be home shortly after five, and has all evening in which to help their kids with homework or go to the gym, is unlikely to score impressively on the Richter scale of professional achievement. Yet she, or he, might have a really well thought-out le, with their priorities in the right order.The dilemma facing society is not simply how to help part-time women reach the very top but how to recalibrate these Alpha workplaces. The challenge for employers who do not want talented staff to drt off or grow disheartened is to come up with ways to make these all-consuming roles desirable, but also manageable, for a far wider range of iniduals.At the moment, physical and psychological stamina are almost as essential as professional excellence for someone to thrive in such an environment. Yet how many does that automatically exclude  Instead of a place that resembles the trenches, we need to restructure hospitals, banks, or the courts, so that they properly value ambitious and able part-timers. Far from discriminating against their promotion, they should encourage it.

The Prime Ministerrsquos chief adviser might or might not have been the author of an  word note to a Spectator journalist setting out the dire consequences for anyone who dared to scupper the UKrsquos exit from the EU on October , but several Tory MPs, including former Minister Amber Rudd, thought they saw his fingerprints all over it. Eight hundred words, eh  Someone was quite the demented woodpecker.Complaints were made in the Commons about intemperate language from Number , and fevered brows were duly soothed by Michael Gove, Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. Mr Gove knows Mr Cummings well. When the Scot became Education Secretary he brought him into Government as his adviser. Their ties go back even further, some  years, to when they were both starting out in their careers.Mr Gove is in a select club of those who can claim familiarity with Mr Cummings. Others look to his blog for clues, which is where they will find quote after quote, from TS Eliot to From Russia With Love , to back up his philosophy of government, the universe and everything. If you have an extremely high boredom threshold, and a liking for the kind of macho guano contained in the business section at airport bookshops, I can thoroughly recommend it.: Civil court delays decisionThe Number  aide is not the first adviser to provoke interest. From Marcia Falkender and Alastair Campbell to Nick Timothy and Fiona Hillthere is a special circle in political anorakdom reserved for those unelected iniduals who serve elected politicians.The latest data on special advisers in the UK Government puts their number at . Their salaries, which can range from pound, to pound,, cost the taxpayer pound million. But they are everywhere where politicians gather, from Bute House to the White House, and rarely will you know them by name. Lobby journalists know them, they know each other, and the civil servants know them, but generally speaking the special adviser, or Spad, is the man or woman standing out of sight of the cameras. Like journalists, when they become the story it is time to go. Think Jo Moore, the Labour adviser who will forever be known for saying   was a ldquogood day to bury bad news.Every so often, as in the Moore case, or when a question is asked about the number of advisers and their cost to the public purse, Spads will come under the spotlight, only to fade away again when something more interesting turns up. Mr Cummings has changed that. From sacking a member of staff and having them marched off the premises, as happened with an aide to the Chancellor, Sajid Javid, to ramping up the political temperature, Mr Cummings is rewriting the rules as he goes. Such is Boris Johnsonrsquos reliance on him that he is less a mere aide and more a de facto deputy Prime Minister.Special advisers are nothing new. From the first time someone claimed power over others, courts have had their courtiers. Whether in government or out, their tasks are many and ied. They are supposed to be their bossrsquos eyes and ears, there to pick up on things in advance. They think ahead in other ways, planning the direction of policy, the subjects for legislation or other action. Crucially, they have some control over access to the politician and cling to it for dear le. If anyone can have the ear of the minister, why do they need you : Iain Macwhirter on the blame gameSpecial advisers stayed for the most part behind the curtain until Harold Wilsonrsquos resignation honours of . The ldquolavender list of recipients, some of them highly questionable, was said to have been drawn up on coloured notepaper by Wilsonrsquos chief aide, Marcia Falkender. She denied doing so.Lady Falkender, who died earlier this year, was valued by Wilson for her insights into the minds of so-called ordinary voters she was a tireless planner and she was not afraid of making enemies in the party or in the civil service, especially the latter. The agenda, Wilsonrsquos agenda, had to get through. Remind you of anyone Labour politicians seem to have a thing for the adviser as enforcer. Though neither inidual will relish the companion, this yearrsquos Dominic Cummings was yesteryearrsquos Alastair Campbell. Tony Blairrsquos spokesman wielded extraordinary power, right up to and including putting a case together for war that turned out to be entirely wrong. Campbellrsquos chief asset, as far as Blair was concerned, was his willingness to be an attack dog on the bossrsquos behalf.One can understand why political leaders like to surround themselves with special advisers. As many a memoir sets out, it is tough and lonely at the top. A bad day at the office for most folk is just that, a bad day. For a leader it can be a catastrophe. The stream of questions is relentless, the need to make a decision always pressing. Who would not want to turn to a friendly face, someone you knew was in your corner, at such times  Before the special adviser came along there were such people. There still are such people. They are called civil servants. They can give impartial advice because their tenure is not tied to any one politician or administration.: Brexit deal on brinkAnother argument in favour of special advisers is that they bring new voices and viewpoints into government. Exceptyou had ever met one you would know they did the opposite. The special adviser is a symptom of the wholly unhealthy professionalisation of politics. They look like the politicians they serve, they think like them, and they want the same job eventually.But where is the ultimate harm, you might think, particularly given the modern Spad has to abide by a code of conduct. The power and influence exercised by Mr Cummings, which seems to be above that of a Cabinet Minister, suggests the need for a new code. Better still, there should be a review of paid aides in general and a presumption against employing them.As for Mr Cummings, he knows, as a student of politics, that the ultimate job of an adviser is to act as a shield to their employer. Shields can always be replaced."},{"url":null,"title":"uk-brexit-plan-not-shown-snp-govt","story":"The Brexit Secretary will chair the first Joint Ministerial Council on EU Negotiations to be held in Edinburgh with UK and Welsh ministers.The gathering comes as relations between the UK and devolved governments hit a new low after Boris Johnson submitted his Brexit deal plans to the EU without consultation.Mr Russell yesterday told MSPs there had been ldquono correspondence between the UK and Scottish governments in advance of the proposals.He said: ldquoThe Scottish Government has not been treated as a trusted partner.

The resulting material can also be used as a fertiliser for soil to help grow more food, more sustainably. Iain Gulland, chief executive of Zero Waste Scotland, said: “It wasn’t just fantasy when the Doc and Marty were discovering how they could power the DeLorean to time travel – they hit upon an idea that over  years later could make a signicant dference in how we combat the climate emergency.“Time is running out as we look to tackle the climate emergency. “The good news is that inedible food waste has huge potential as its energy can be used to make sustainable fuel and we can harness this by simply using our food recycling caddy. “You could provide enough power to watch the entire Back to the Future trilogy from the food held in nearly two and a half food recycling caddies.”Around  per cent of the , tonnes of food waste produced by households in Scotland every year is unavoidable.

Spending on these ads, often targeted to specic groups, has totalled more than £. million since last October.And while much of the attention has focused on the big parties and pressure groups on either side of the Brexit ide, the data also reveals the thousands of adverts placed at a local level, often seeking to influence constituents on what can appear to be seemingly mundane neighbourhood issues.Under new rules Facebook introduced in October , anyone placing a political advert must declare who paid for it.Our investigation identied around  ads on the pages of local politicians and councils which were run without these disclaimers – including  placed on behalf of sitting MPs.There is no suggestion that any of the adverts had been deliberate attempts to deceive constituents. They were all found and removed by Facebook.Most adverts placed by or on behalf of Scottish MPs from October  to September , , were for amounts less than £.There were a few exceptions – £ spent by Gordon Conservatives, £ by Lib Dem leader and East Dunbartonshire MP Jo Swinson, £ by Angus Conservatives, £ by the Perth and Kinross Conservative Association, £ by Linlithgow MP Martyn Day, and £ by the Conservative Party.For MSPs, the majority also spent sums less than £ promoting material on Facebook.The exceptions were former Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson , Anas Sarwar , Johann Lamont , Liam Kerr , Alex Rowley , Alexander BurnettPeter Chapman , Beatrice Wishart , Richard Leonard , and West Lothian Courier Partners .Two Scottish local authorities spent money with Facebook – City of Edinburgh Counciland the SNP Group on North Ayrshire Council .data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"\"  Nicola Sturgeon: the Scottish Parliament’s greatest achievements viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Two Scottish politicans each had a Facebook advert removed as it appeared without a disclaimer – Cumbernauld, Kilsyth and Kirkintilloch East MP Stuart McDonald and Martin Docherty-Hughes, MP for West Dunbartonshire.Unsurprisingly the biggest spenders on Facebook over the past year have included ious Brexit campaigns – People’s Vote UK , Best for BritainandBritain’s Future .Production company Slainte Media spent £, promoting former First Minister Alex Salmond’s televisionchat show.A Westminster Government spokesperson said: “There should be greater transparency in political advertising, which is why we have already pledged to introduce the requirement for digital election material to be clearly branded.

It neither meets the needs of the local community nor the standards people in Orkney have a right to expect from their leline service.“I have raised these concerns with the First Minister and Transport Secretary in the past, highlighting the impact on constituents. I was given assurances that it would be addressed in the new contract.“Given the announcement that Serco Northlink has been chosen as the preferred bidder, it is important that the Scottish Government now claries what the arrangements will be for the forthcoming refit period.#The new contract needs to address the failings of the current contract and ensure that this leline route is served during the refit period by a vessel that is fit for purpose”.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Cllr Macinnes said the pre-construction work has allowed the council to ldquoexamine every possible detail of the construction process.The time-frame has allowed contractors and the council to undertake ground and site investigation works to determine conditions along the route as well as dialogue with residents and conducting a comprehensive survey of traders needs. She said: ldquoThat period has allowed us to do an enormous amount of complex partnership work with the contractors to examine every possible detail of how we proceed.ldquoIrsquom well aware of how complex the process has been in the last six months and how hard our contractors and our tram team have worked to get us to this stage where we can go into this construction stage with a great deal of confidence.Leith Walk to go down to one lane in April Project director Rob Leech added that during the lsquoenabling workrsquo on Leith Walk will have traffic travelling in both directions during the work.It means Leith Walk will not go down to a single lane until April next year.

He always had his eye on the ious strands of the problem faced by the people in Northern Ireland - whether it was their identication with the politics and culture of the United Kingdom, or with the politics and culture of Ireland.“And in the backdrop of all that was the existence of the European Union, which saw a pooling of sovereignty on a consensual basis - which Hume was a major advocate of.”The documentary, In the name of peace: John Hume in America, features interviews with Bono, President Bill Clinton and Sir John Major.After the screening, which begins at .pm, there will be a question and answer session with Fitzpatrick, led by journalist David Clegg.“I would hope that within the film, people can see how political problems can be addressed in a contemporary environment,” Fitzpatrick continued.“The most salient aspect of Hume’s political le was the seriousness with which he undertook his work. He was utterly dedicated and concentrated in his approach. He understood he had to relate these concepts to people of all stripes and descriptions.”Asked what positives could be taken from the film in the current political climate, the director added: “When confronted with utter misery and devastation, with the near impossibility of doing politics, when all of these things occurred during the Troubles, John Hume hammered home the message: we need to sit around the table and thrash out a deal - a programme of government that will work and be accepted by the majority.“People from dferent parties, and with dferent outlooks, did go there in the end. “Hume’s unique ability to marshall support from the highest levels in Washington, and to bring together the central strands of political settlement in , is truly inspiring.“At a time when we are in a state of advanced political failure - Belfast springs to mind, but also London - there is a great lesson to be gleaned from Hume’s perseverance and his integrity, and the nobility he brought to politics.”©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"first look at the jarls squad ","story":"Plenty of onlookers were already on the streets as the squad made its first procession of the day from Islesburgh Community Centre, past the galley shed on St Sunniva Street and on to the Toll Clock Shopping Centre.In the gloom, the ranks of the Jarl#s Squad looked the part wearing emerald green kirtles with dragon mots underneath simple brown leather breastplates embossed with the same mot.

It also has the support of Burra History Group for the Burra Noost Project and is partnering with Bressay History Group to support their recording of Bressay noosts this summer.Costs such as the website, room hire, resources for free school visits and insurance have so far been financed by the directors. Money is slowly trickling in via donations, sponsorship, and profits from workshop ticket sales. The next workshop is being held in Unst on Saturday st June.The first step of applying to the National Lottery Heritage Fund has been successful, allowing Moder Dy – named after the dialect phrase for the mother wave – to apply for a pot of £, to run the Burra Noost Project.However, at least £, needs to be raised to match this grant funding.

It states that rural and remote areas, especially those in The Highlands and Islands, have signicant populations at risk from the fallout of leaving the EU – with or without a trade deal.The report considers community access to services, working-age population, income deprivation, workers in #Brexit-sensitive# industries, EU worker migration and how many EU payments are received.Highlands and Islands representative Ms Todd said: “We always knew that Brexit would be damaging to Scotland but this new analysis really hits home the devastating impact that Brexit will have here in the Shetland Islands.“Families across Shetland will feel the impact of Brexit, with up to  per cent of the local population most vulnerable to the potential economic shock.“The SNP government will continue to do what it can to mitigate and minimise the impact on our most vulnerable communities, but this study lays bare the recklessness of the Tories in their blind determination to pursue Brexit at any cost.“Scotland never voted for Brexit and certainly not for the reckless extreme version now pursued by the UK government. It’s essential that we stop Brexit and go back to the people.”Ms Todd added that a report by the Institute for Fiscal Studies , also published this week, #found the UK is already £ billion worse off as a result of Brexit before we have even left the EU – with the UK economy .- per cent smaller than it otherwise would have been.#Over a million voters in Scotland voted for BREXIT, % of Shetlanders voted to leave, are their votes to be ignored  As a UNITED Kingdom we operate as a single unit well we did during two world wars. I find that Maree Todd’s concern about the potential economic effect that BREXIT could have upon Shetlanda bit of a cheek, coming from a party that currently has chalked up a deficit of £ billion for Scotland, due to irresponsible spending policies.Brexit, is nothing more than for the Tories to distance themselves from the EU, and to have a trade deal with the USA, and the, most likely, mass privatisation of most government responsibilities and duties of care going to US companies, where the Tories will benefit as shareholders of such companies. It is so typical of the Tories to put themselves first regardless to the devastating consequences of their policies and selfish agenda#s onto the people of the UK, especially those in society who struggle as it is. It will be a society of those who have and those who do not have. Where profit is the dominating principle which governs and controls those in power. Brexit, will make the UK, very much an unfair, unjust society for the majority of people. It will also have a great impact on smaller communities where the work-force is from the EU, and the economic circumstances putting many jobs and businesses at risk.Brexit, in all its forms, will cause more harm than good####not to mention poking the fires of xenophobia and racism in its wake.If Shetland is #among the most vulnerable to Brexit#, then presumably, it will also be #among the most vulnerable to Scexit# as we are guaranteed to be out of the EU with No Deal, should the SNP#s policy of Scottish independence ever become reality .."},{"url":null,"title":"kelso council keen to see borders railway s return to town","story":"More about the railway latest here: https:www.thesouthernreporter news people confidence-high-that-borders-railway-extension-now-a-certainty--"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_0594.jpg","title":"rag tag extend broadford","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineSkye-based social enterprise RagTag celebrated the official opening oftheir new building in Broadford last week.Christened ‘Little Tag’, the new seven-metre long wooden cabin isdesigned to give the award-winning charity another workshop space so theirstudents can undertake additional crafts # such as pallet-based furniture andbird boxes # and textile work.

Dave McClure, along with his we Colleen, recently spent three days in the town on the hunt for information about his great great grandparents William James McClure and Sarah Montgomery McClure. William was born in  and died in  and Sarah was also born in  and died in .The couple, believed to be from the Ballymena Ballymoney area, had a son Robert Montgomery McClure who was born on May , .Robert, Daves great grandfather, emigrated to America in , and died on December ,  in Illinois. His passage to America was paid by a James Gillan who emigrated to Illinois and is believed to have lived in the Ballymena Ballymoney area. Robert worked for James for  years, married his daughter Sarah, and bought his own farmland nearby. Dave explained that during his search for information he hit a “dead-end” and so he decided to visit Ballymena in the hope of finding out more about his family tree.The couple stayed at the Tullyglass House Hotel and Dave’s first port of call on Wednesday of last week was the Ballymenaoffice.He said: “I really wanted to come to Ballymena to try and find out more about my ancestors. Im here for three days so I plan to try and find some McClures in the area and see where that takes us.“I was in Belfast checking the records there but I didnt find much so I am hoping we might get a bit closer to finding out something here in Ballymena.”Before leaving tohome Dave explained that he had not uncovered much more about his McClure ancestors, however, in the past few days he “met such wonderful people in my search”. Dave continued: “The librarians in Ballymena sent me to Clough, where I met Norm the postmistress. She sent me to Glarryford where I visited the Killymurris Presbyterian Church cemetery before heading to Ballymoney where Daniel Gillan at the Tower Pub sent me to the town hall museum where Paul put me in touch with genealogist Kathleen by phone. “After a twenty minute conversation I decided to continue conversing with her by email when Ito the States. “I didnt uncover any new facts about my McClure ancestors but I believe I have walked where they trod and looked upon the land they once viewed.

Heads round him nodded. It seemed surreal.A few minutes later there was an update from the union official who, having spoken to the administrator, said there was still potential for a deal despite in his words, Jeffchanging the goalposts. As far as he could tell them the deal was still hanging by a thread.The response this time was clear and uneqivocal. Not surprisingly there was a great deal of exasperation and the TV cameras will be well to blot out the round of expletives which greeted the news.In a statement Jeff Wright said the sticking point was farmland which he does not consider to be part of the factory site.He said failure to complete a deal is deeply regrettable, especially after the exhaustive efforts all of us involved have gone to in providing every possible support.The Ballymena business was placed into administration and put up for sale in September.The Wrightbus premises are owned separately from the manufacturing business and held in a company called Whirlwind Property Two, which is not part of the Wrights group and is therefore not under the control of the administrator.The property company is controlled by Jeff Wright, the former owner of Wrightbus.English industrialist Jo Bamford wants to buy the Wrightbus business and the factory through his Ryse Hydrogen company.Mr Wright said that he hopes the firms administrator, Deloitte, have not been side-tracked by the Bamford engagement and can now put their energies into delivering a deal by working with the remaining bidders to secure the future of Wrightbus and the jobs in Ballymena. DUP MP Ian Paisley told the BBCs Good Morning Ulster programme that: Today is decision day.If the answer is that we cannot get the deal consummated, in terms of the land sale deal, then Im afraid the worst of all situations prevails and were left with liquidation of assets of the company, he said.Its either the continuation of building the best buses produced in the world or its the end of bus building in Ballymena.The North Antrim MP said Mr Bamford told him on Tuesday that jobs would be created within two weeks,a deal is made.The Wright family have made a mammoth contribution to Northern Ireland over three generations and this maintains that rich history, said Mr Paisley.Everyone needs to put their shoulder to the line and get this deal over the line.In his statement Mr Wright said Mr Paisleys role as North Antrim MP had been unhelpful to say the least and advised that he left the business of deal making to the professionals at Deloitte.UNITEStatement released from Unite the Union, Northern IrelandWrightbus workers await their fate in the rain as horse-trading over sale continues. Unite the union has received no response to request to meet with former Wrightbus owner Jeff Wright. Conflicting reports leave workers standing at factory gates bewildered about their futureUnite Regional Officer for Wrightbus, George Brash, challenged both sides in the ongoing negotiations surrounding the sale of the stricken bus builder to move quickly to reach an agreement that would safeguard the livelihoods of the workers.“This morning hundreds of Wrightbus workers and their families are standing in the rain outside the factory gates. They are standing in the hope they will hear that a deal has been done that will guarantee their jobs.“These are workers who are already having dficult conversations with their children about what Christmas will bring.“As these negotiations are being dragged out by horse-trading, the feeling of indignation among these workers, whose sole objective is to get back to work, is rising.“We understand that an outline deal had been arrived at yesterday but that this morning further changes were made by Jeff Wright which threw the entire negotiations into uncertainty.“For our part Unite has sought to engage directly with Jeff Wright but as yet our request for a meeting has gone unanswered. We are calling on all sides, in particular Jeff Wright, to do the right thing and adopt a sensible approach that will open the door to a future for these workers”, Mr Brash concluded.

There has been a lot of work done already with a lot of preparation and education about culture in South Africa.“It is once in a letime opportunity and will give the students more of a clear direction of what they want to do in le when they come back.”Student Ryan McCarthy explained more about what the trip will entail.“We had to do a lot of fundraising which involved bag packing and setting up pages on Facebook to raise the £, required for cover our travel and donate towards dferent projects out there,” he said. “The first seven days we will spend in homeless shelters before moving to work in villages and towns outside Durban. We will be fully integrated in the community and there will be no luxuries.“We will live with local people and their families and help build houses and other things to help the community and work on dferent projects.“It will be very much a hands-on experience. It is not a holiday for us. We have also been learning the Zulu culture which is everything from song, language, games and dance, which we will use to communicate with the children who don’t speak much English. We want to respect their culture and integrate ourselves into theirs.”Another student, Holly O’Neill, believes she will take a lot from the experience.“I think the trip will teach us a lot about how we take for granted how we live back at home,” she said. “These people in South Africa are poor. We will feel lucky to live here. People complain about all the bad stuff in the news here but it is nothing compared to over there. People have nothing compared to us. The whole experience so far has given us all more confidence. We were all shy and didn’t talk much to each other but now we are all talking more and working together as a team.“The travel is daunting – around  hours – but we are all looking forward to it and want to make the most out of it. I remember the feeling when I got picked for this le changing experience, I was speechless.“The amount of dedication that has to be put in is crazy, but working as a team I know we can get through it.“Something that has really been outstanding for me has definitely been the Monday night groups that I look forward to for a good laugh and good craic.“I’m just so thankful to have been chosen for this le changing experience.”Paddy Doyle from Connections Youth Project added: “I wanted to change the project a bit and develop young leaders within a school environment.“The young people have worked really hard in their preparation so far and I know we are going to have a successful trip.

This is now a dysal system,” she said.“At the heart of this is the refusal of those with the biggest mandates to take the responsibility for governing which comes with those mandates. They know well a deal has long been available but decisions which are unpopular in the short term will need to be made for the long-term good of the healthcare system and public health.“We must never stop being shocked by figures such as these, which are unacceptable and show a decline in planning for the future, going back many years. It is time for comprehensive transformation or there simply will not be a public health service for the next generation # and it is time those with the big mandates took responsibility for delivery of it.”SDLP Deputy Leader Nichola Mallon called the waiting times for a first neurology outpatient appointment “unacceptable”.The North Belfast MLA said that staff are working tirelessly to manage demand while also coping with the biggest patient recall in history. “Neurology patients, people living with conditions like Parkinson’s disease, Motor Neurone disease or multiple sclerosis, should not be forced to endure the pain, worry and uncertainty of waiting over a year to be seen,” she said. “That’s the cruel reality for over , people who understand the seriousness of their condition and desperately want to be seen and treated as quickly as possible.“These patients and the staff working in neurology units deserve better. Aside from the immense challenge of having almost , people on the neurology waiting list, doctors and nurses are trying their best to cope with the biggest patient recall in our history. It must feel overwhelming.“We have had reviews of neurology services before. I have no doubt that the final report will reach similar conclusions with similar recommendations. They cannot be allowed to sit on a shelf gathering dust while real people suffer on hospital waiting lists. This is a scandal and we all have to commit to addressing it.”"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38573258.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/_109142883_constabledowney.jpg","title":"10k for psni officer discriminated against","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

clean-shaven.He later brought an employment tribunal case against then-Chief Constable George Hamilton claiming he had been discriminated against, a view which was supported by an employment tribunal.The PSNI has said it is aware of the tribunals findings and said it is currently examining the detail.Speaking to BBC News NI, Constable Downey said: \"To be turfed out of the unit, with little or no notice, for refusal to shave off a moustache, which doesnt affect the equipment Ive been issued with, is total madness.\"Read MoreMoustache would have to be a ‘belter’ to impair PSNI mask, tribunal toldPSNI ponytail rule not enforced like one for beards, tribunal toldPSNI firearms officer tells tribunal of his face mask concernsNew rules outlawing beards and facial hair were implemented in  for some units in the PSNI due to health and safety concerns.The updated policy required these officers to \"remain clean shaven whilst on duty\" for health and safety reasons.The case centred over whether respiratory masks used in certain police units, and which are supposed to be airtight, can be used safelythe officer has facial hair.Expert advice to the tribunal  previously claimed men would need \"a moustache like a walrus\" for the equipment not to work properly.\"The policy itself was being enforced against men under health and safety grounds, and yet females within our unit had hair in contravention of the same policy, not facial hair but head hair, where there was a grab risk,\" Constable Downey said.\"So the policy was being enforced against men and not against female officers.\"Constable Downey said he tried to accommodate the policy by shaving his beard to a moustache but was also asked to remove that.\"As an older person with a receding hairline and alopecia who is slightly overweight all I can do is grow a bit of fur on my top lip, and to have that removed for absolutely no reason is wrong,\" he said.The unanimous decision of the tribunal was that Constable Downey was discriminated against contrary to the Sex DiscriminationOrder .He was awarded over £, for hurt feelings and loss of earnings.Niall McMullan from Worthingtons SolicitorsNiall McMullan from Worthingtons Solicitors, who represented Constable Downey, said it was an important ruling.\"This is a signicant ruling by the industrial tribunal, because it has essentially declared that the current PSNI policy is discriminating indirectly against males, in as far as the application of the policy is concerned,\" he said.\"I would like to see serious steps taken by the PSNI in relation to this decision.\"The tribunal were unequivocal in so far as they want the PSNI to review this decision and to ensure it has a less discriminatory effect on not just my

Films in the UK are awarded ratings by the British Board of Film Classication based on content raging from U which means suitable for all to  which means suitable only for adults.Joker is rated  and contains scenes of strong bloody violence including murder and language while It was also given a  rating due to strong gory violence, horror and language. Mr McAdam, who runs Movie House Cinemas across Northern Ireland, said that cinemas were being forced to turn young people away due to age classications.\"Its not just ourselves, its every cinema in the UK,\" he explained.\"Its becoming a major problem, parents are bringing their children to the cinema to see a film and then being challenged over their age.

Other members carried a coffin with ‘NHS’ and ‘DIGNITY written on the side of it.Other messages on fake gravestones signied the death of human rights, mental healthcare, funding in education and health, and the loss of housing and welfare rights.It most certainly caught the attention of weekend shoppers who seemed confused as to whether or not it was a real funeral until they read the messages.At the Guildhall an excerpt from the film I Daniel Blake was played. It is from the funeral scene where his friend Katie reads the eulogy, including the speech Daniel had intended to read at an appeal for his jobseeker’s allowance.The speech describes his feelings about how the welfare system failed him by treating him like a dog instead of a man proud to have paid his dues to society.AAC member, Kat Healy, took to the steps of the Guildhall first to thank those who turned out for the march. In the spirit of the original civil rights march people were taking a stand against injustice, she said.People Before Profit Councillor, Shaun Harkin, also reflected on the march in  which “changed history here in the North of Ireland”. He said the numbers turning out to protest at present don’t accurately represent the depth of “anger” in the local community which is “growing and growing”.Cllr Harkin added that it is important to put pressure on “leaders” to address the devastation felt by local communities.‘Direct Action’googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshAnother AAC member from Strabane, Michael Mclaughlin, told the crowd that he has been fighting against welfare reform for the best part of a decade.“The system is broken,” he said, and is part of an “ideological attack” on the working class. He referred to a research paper published by a university in Sheffield which studied the impact of welfare reform in the UK.A table included in that report which took in all  local authorities in the UK at the time, shows that people living in Derry and Strabane will be impacted the most with working age adults anticipated to be £ worse off per annum. Blackpool sits at the top of the table, Derry is second, Strabane third and Belfast is fourth.Mr McLaughlin said people can point the finger at Stormont but also need to look “closer to home”. It is time to “inject radicalism into activism”, he said, by getting working class people out on the streets and occupying offices were these cuts are being implemented.“We need to organise a direct action campaign against neo-liberalism, against austerity and expose and call out the parties that have let everybody down.”Member of the Irish Travelling Community, Martin McDonagh, said he was proud to be taking action and made clear that his community has felt the impact of cuts more than most.Becca Bor of Alliance for Choice slammed the two-child policy and benefit cap which she said have “massively increased” child poverty. Although primarily campaigning for free safe legal and local abortion in Ireland, the group has also fought “tooth and nail” against welfare reform, she said.She added that families are having to “scrape” money together essentials and said there is a need to fight so that women and families “have what they need”.The final speaker on the day, Goretti Horgan, of Derry Trades Union Council said large families have been impacted most by benefit caps and self-employed workers such as taxi drivers.She urged people to join a trade union, saying weekends off, holiday pay and sick pay wouldn’t exist without trade unions. “Don’t believe the hype when the Tories say they’re bringing in a living wage, read the small print, they’re saying it will happen in five years by which time normal wage increases will have brought it to that level,” she concluded."},{"url":"https://img.resized.co/derrynow/eyJkYXRhIjoie1widXJsXCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL3MzLWV1LXdlc3QtMS5hbWF6b25hd3MuY29tXFxcL3N0b3JhZ2UucHVibGlzaGVycGx1cy5pZVxcXC9tZWRpYS5yaXZlcm1lZGlhLmllXFxcL3VwbG9hZHNcXFwvMjAxOVxcXC8xMFxcXC8xMDE2NDg0N1xcXC9HcmFkZS1BLW9mZmljZS1zcGFjZS1FYnJpbmd0b24ucG5nXCIsXCJ3aWR0aFwiOjY0NyxcImhlaWdodFwiOjM0MCxcImRlZmF1bHRcIjpcImh0dHBzOlxcXC9cXFwvY2FjaGUucmVzaXplZC5jb1xcXC9uby1pbWFnZS5wbmdcIixcIm9wdGlvbnNcIjpbXX0iLCJoYXNoIjoiY2RlMmYyZjIyZWUwODc0M2UzZWEzMzJhY2EzNjFmNzA2Mjc2NjA3ZSJ9/grade-a-office-space-ebrington.png","title":"construction ebrington office blocks track commence next month","story":"Construction of Grade A office space at Ebrington is set to commence next month, The Executive Office has confirmed.The buildings will provide ,ft² of office space and are due to open in mid-.

The popular presenter has a close affinity to the Down side, having been brought up in Burren, and will bring plenty of fun and laughter to the proceedings.Louise Kearney, part of the organising committee, said excitement is building in the area on the countdown to the historic night in the club on Saturday, October .She added: ldquoWe are delighted the Down legends are coming to spend a special evening in our clubrooms. It will be a wonderful opportunity to reminisce with All-Ireland winners. We are very proud to have two Loughinisland men who gave so much to the county, and continue to give so much to our club and community.Itrsquos a night not to be missed as this is a landmark year for the Down side who created history when they brought Sam Maguire across the border for the fth time.Louise said: ldquoIt may be one of the last times the squad will be together in a club in this capacity for a number of years and we are grateful they are spending that time with us. We will have a relaxed but enthralling evening as we look back at the glory days.While the spotlight will be on the Down legends, families from the Loughinisland Justice Group will be special guestsat the event and their loved ones will be remembered during the night.Louise added: ldquoWe will also take time to remember that  was such a dficult year for Loughinisland. A quarter of a century on from the massacre, we will think back on the impact of the Down win on the community, the uplt that the team brought and the footballing spirit which helped people through the darkest days. We have a lot of stories to hear.The organisers have secured the Sam Maguire and Anglo-Celt cups for the event so there will be opportunities on the night to get photographs taken alongside the Down greats and the legendary silverware.Former Down and Loughinisland player Alan Molloy, who is also one of the organisers, said it was a remarkable feat that a small rural club like Loughinisland had three medals from the great teams of the s and their achievements had brought much joy and prestige to the club.He added: ldquoThis will be a wonderful opportunity to reminisce with these All-Ireland winners, including Loughinisland men Gary Mason and Gerard Colgan, who gave so much to the county and continue to give so much to our club and community.ldquoGary Mason is the proud owner of two medals, from the victories in  and . Whilst Gerard Colgan was playing for An Riocht in , he spent the last of his playing days with Loughinisland. Both players are now passing on their valuable knowledge to the future generations through coaching our underage teams.ldquoThe club is very grateful that so many legends of the  team are ing to spend this evening with us.

There was a clearly much debate from the competitors about how muddy it was going to be andthey would have enough wet weather gear.As it turned out, the sun would appear and the rain would disappear leaving Lurgan Park looking beautully tranquil.The first race up was the U- race with Fiadh Kellett, Hugh and Conor Hetherington flying the flag for Dromara CC and more importantly loving the mud. Great to see them enjoying it.The U-s boysrsquo race saw young Oscar McBride loving the mud as he battled through the crown to claim eighth place in a competitive race.Aoe Kellett was in a tough U- girlsrsquo race that saw her put in a tremendous effort to claim third place with second place not far away. A great start to her league campaign and pressure on dad to produce in his race.James Armstrong has had a great summer of cycling and has taken this rich vein of form into the cyclo-cross. Curtis McKee, from Maryland Wheelers, would keep James from the top spot of the podium, but only by a mere six seconds.With junior members having set the scene at the cyclocross it was time for the senior team to get on their bikes.In the MTB Support race Mick Foley, fresh back from injury and claiming to be unfit, tore through the mud to claim a top  finish leaving expectations that he can only get better and better.The club had a large representation in the B race which saw  riders competing.It didnrsquot last long for Gibson Chambers as he got caught up in a crash at the start.This left Paul Hamilton taking the honour of first Dromara man home in sixth place, not far behind was Richard Cowan in eighth, Brian Kellett managed to take th and hold off Darren McCann, just.Adi Booth took the bragging rights as he finished ahead of Bryce Hetherington and Mike Barton finishing st, rd and th respectively.

We believe he is still finding out the additional things he can do with his new hand and therersquos still improvements ahead.Mr Moore said Alfie learnt to write with his left hand and still does but there is hope that over time, that he might be able to write and use his prosthesis hand for everything he normally does with his left hand.He says that Alfiersquos classmates and other pupils have accepted the new addition to the P pupil very well.Mr Moore added: ldquoWersquore never have had any problems with other children understanding about Alfie.

It is set to remain a key feature of the proposed redevelopment project.Council officials insist that the former police basersquos listed building status is not an impediment to the development of the site and while they concede that preserving the building will be a challenge, it is also presents an opportunity to something exciting with it.The heritage value of the site, which extends as far back as St Patrickrsquos Avenue, is something council officials are not only keen to preserve, but build upon as they work with the Department for Communities to maximise the potential of the site.The government department, which has already acquired the former PSNI base, is working in partnership with the local authority to help bring new investment to Downpatrick town centre.Leading brands such as Marks and Spencer and Home Bargains, along with several other big names, are keen to invest in Downpatrick, but at present cannot identy suitable accommodation to meet their respective needs.Those behind the Irish Street plan hope that a redevelopment scheme can act as a catalyst for additional town centre investment, increasing footfall and providing a boost for existing businesses which have been at the backbone of the townrsquos economy for many years.Councillor Dermot Curran has welcomed confirmation that work on the development brief could be completed shortly.He believes that the transformation of the former police base and adjacent land can provide Downpatrick with a signicant economic boost, creating new retail space and much-needed jobs.Cllr Curran reiterated the importance of the townrsquos business community being asked for its input into the redevelopment plan which has the potential to attract more shoppers to the town.He said many will be looking forward to seeing the detail of the development brief and the potential options for a hugely important development site in the heart of Downpatrick.ldquoThere has been no signicant retail investment in the town for quite some time. The Irish Street proposal has the potential to transform the town centre, providing additional business for existing traders, Cllr Curran added..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th October 2019 By.jpg","title":"By George he’s got it as Bright come good  ","story":"THE long wait is over. Bright finally got their hands on the JFC trophy after a pulsating victory over Aughlisnafin at Pairc Esler on Sunday.Despite having lost the previous six finals they have appeared in, the Ballynoe-based club went into the clash full of confidence and it showed as they broke Aughlisnafinrsquos hearts with an expansive display.The game ebbed and flowed throughout with fortune favouring the brave.Aughlisnafin seized the early initiative before the departure of Mark Stratton to a straight red card threatened to derail their challenge.However, Bright were unable to take real advantage and just when they made their move, Seamas Tumelty joined Stratton for an early shower.The game opened up at this stage with Bright showing a greater composure to prevent Aughlisnafin from completing the double in a thrilling finale to the game.Oran Flanagan and Cailean Toner exchanged early scores in a positive opening to the game before a long range point from the impressive Adam Garland and a good effort from Shane McCann sent the lsquoFin into a - to - lead by the sixth minute.The action was hot and heavy all over the park, but Stratton saw red in the th minute and Bright took full advantage.Sam Dinu reduced the deficit to a single point before the accurate Flanagan converted a free to restore the lsquoFinrsquos two-point lead.Dinu and Breannain McComiskey swapped scores before two Flanagan frees stretched Aughlisnafinrsquos lead to four points, despite being down to  men.Kyran Smythrsquos side held on grimly to the lsquoFinrsquos coat tails and just before the break Gareth George helped breathe new le into Brightrsquos challenge when he pointed from a rsquo to leave his side trailing - to - at half-time.The second half was in its infancy when Bright lay down their marker.A blistering spell of attacking football yielded unanswered points from Declan Trainor, Kevin Groves and the ubiquitous George to draw level.There was only one team in it at this stage, but Bright went and shot themselves in the foot when Tumelty fell foul of the referee and was shown the red card.Brightrsquos heads were now down and Flanagan punished the indiscretion when he pointed the lsquoFin into a - to - lead after  minutes.Smyth sent for the cavalry at this stage and it duly arrived in the shape of Matt McKiernan.The rangy forward was on hand to steer the ball past Calum Croskery and when Toner quickly tagged on a point, Bright suddenly and from nowhere, were three points clear, - to -.Driven on remorselessly by Donagh Steele, Aughlisnafin battled back and points from Sean Fitzsimmons and two from Flanagan had it all square again with  minutes gone.The game was still being played at a hectic pace and with  minutes gone, Garland pointed the lsquoFin into a deserved, but precarious - to - lead.Dinu held his nerve to level matters, but Aughlisnafin went back in front thanks to a point from Shea Croskery. Corey Ranaghan quickly levelled matters, but that man Croskery gave his side a - to - lead with less than eight minutes remaining.Fingernails were being bitten to the quick as Bright went in search of the equaliser and it arrived less than a minute later via a Kevin Groves free.It was now a case of who dares wins as the game hurtled to a conclusion and points from George, Dinu and Matthew Burns had Bright literally home and hosed.Aughlisnafin refused to capitulate and they knew that only a goal would do, but all they could muster in added time was a point from Flanagan as Bright held on for an historic win.Bright: Michael Farrand, Barry Mageean, Marc Burke, Seamas Tumelty, Freddie OrsquoConnor, Nicholas OrsquoConnor, Jack McLaughlin, Corey Ranaghan , Cailean Toner , Sam Dinu , Kevin Groves , Declan Trainor , Owen McEvoy, Gareth George , Rian Tempany.

The exercise is expected to take around  months to complete.Council officials will examine each community centre in detail with the exercise looking at the population they serve, the number of young people in their area, crime statistics andthe facilities are located in so-called neighbourhood renewal areas.One area the review will examine will be Crossgar where local people are keen to see new community centre provided.A major feasibility study was carried out a number of years ago with a site adjacent to St Colmcillersquos High School in the village identied as the preferred location for a new community and sports centre. While a new facility was never constructed, the forthcoming review will examinethe need for it remains.The idea of the community centre probe is to determine potential under provision and where new facilities may be required moving forward.Council officials will also look to seethere is over provision in any areas but insist there are no plans to close any existing centres. They argue that the main driver is about increasing and improving community provision across the district.While itrsquos still early days, council officials say they will work through the process over the next year and will keep ratepayers fully informed about consultation meetings which will be held across all seven district electoral areas to ensure everyone has an opportunity to have their say.Described as a ldquosignicant piece of work, the review will also include discussions with community groups and associations.Insisting that the review is not about closing community centres, council officials say the examination of current provision will focus on where they are located and local need. And they have suggested that the exercise could potentially throw up issues which surfaced during the playground strategy which resulted in some play parks amalgamating.Council officials say while the intention is not to close any centres at this stage, the review will focus on potential gaps in current provision to help form strategic decisions about where to build new centresthis is required.The review will also examine which community centres may require refurbishment and potential extensions to allow them to meet increasing demand.Council officials have confirmed that a number of the districtrsquos community centres are part-funded by the Department for Communities with a number also run by local groups and associations.Ahead of the community centre review, council officials have been conducting an exercise looking at the user figures and the number of programmes that the respective centres deliver. Part of the forthcoming review will also take a critical look at funding streams to help increase centre usage.Council officials say the parks and open spaces strategy will identy those that need upgraded and those which are not necessarily adding any value. It will examine those that can be improved with the review rolled out over the next  months.When the community centre and parks and open spaces review has been completed, initial reports will be debated by the local authorityrsquos Active and Health Communities Committee which will then make recommendations to the full councilto agree a new strategy moving forward..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th October 2019 C Diary.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C October 9%2C 1979  ","story":"STRANGFORD LOUGH mdash Police have still not recovered the body of the second man drowned on a fishing trip to Strangford Lough at the weekend.At Downpatrick police station mdash from where the search operation was co-ordinated mdash police say there is no hope that  year-old Carrickfergus man, Mr John Craig, is still alive.They believe that Mr Craigrsquos body has been swept out into the Irish Sea and search has now been stretched to the Isle of Man.Mr Craig went in a -foot fibre glass cabin cruiser to fish for mackerel bait on Saturday afternoon, along with with Peter Johnson , from Woodcroft Rise, Braniel, Belfast.In the early hours of Sunday morning police were alerted by the relatives of the two men, anxious that neither had ed.

Radar is regarded as an aid to navigation, and not as a means of piloting the vessel through dense fog.NEWCASTLE mdash Scouting activities in the Newcastle district received a tremendous boost recently when local cub scout packs and venture units cleaned up at the Co Down rally held at Crawfordsburn.The nd Newcastle Cub Scout pack brought home the Dora Baxter Challenge Flag, the st Castlewellan cub scout pack were runners-up and the Donard Venture Unit won the Roden Shield.The leaders of the Newcastle pack are Mrs Connie Bailie, cub scout leader, Miss Mildred Ferguson, assistant cub scout leader, and Mrs Doris Crawford, and they were congratulated by the parents committee at the special meeting on Tuesday night in Newcastle.The committee congratulates the pack, too, and presented them with chocolate The leaders received silver necklets.COURT mdash Thursdayrsquos sitting at Ballynahinch Court was the last in the town, for Ballynahinch cases will now be heard at Downpatrick Courthouse.The first sitting of the court at Downpatrick will be later this month, but it will still be known as Ballynahinch Court.Announcing the transfer on Thursday, the RM, Mr John Petrie, said that the court would still sit on the second and fourth of the month, at last in the immediate future.DOWNPATRICK mdash The wraps are off the long-awaited Department of Environment proposals for Downpatrickrsquos town centre.On Tuesday afternoon Downpatrick councillors were given a private peep at the plans and had informal talks with Divisional Roads manager, Mr Joseph Kirk.The informal get-together was held at the council officers and, although no details have been given, they represent a major breakthrough in the attempts to provide a plan to ease Downpatrickrsquos traffic congestion.The informal private meeting with local councillors was held as preliminary to a full-scale debate with Down Districtrsquos  councillors and that is expected now to take place within the next fortnight..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th October 2019 Kilcoo.jpg","title":"Kilcoo to the ‘Point  ","story":"ONLY a thin blue line stands between Kilcoo and a league and championship double.Its not officers of the law, though, who will battle it out with the Magpies at Pairc Esler on Sunday in an eagerly-awaited Morgan Fuels SFC final, but the blue of Warrenpoint.Kilcoo will be appearing in their nd final since the Frank OHare Cup was first played for in  with Warrenpoint taking part in their showdown for the ninth time, having won the competition on three occasions.The last time Warrenpoint contested the final was in  when they lost out - to - against Pat Oakes star-studded Downpatrick side.Coincidentally Downpatricks winning point on that occasion was scored by my younger brother Joe, although the local newspapers at the time gave the score to his twin brother, Fred. I am now glad to put the record straight after all these years.The sides have met twice in the league this season, drawing - to - at Pairc Eoghan Rua and Kilcoo won thegame in Warrenpoint - to -.The mood music in Kilcoo this season has been good.Their - to - win over Clonduff in the league last Wednesday night clinched the ACFL Division  crown, last lted by Mickey Morans side in  and they are even more intent on adding the Frank OHare Cup on Sunday.Losing out to Burren in last years decider was a big blow to Kilcoo, but they have put that reversal behind them with the exact same squad of players.What you see with Kilcoo is what you get.They have a unique work ethic and everything revolves around the team as a unit. No one player has a bigger or more important job than anyone .They are in this together and they have an unfaltering belief in their own ability and work on the motto thatyou fail to prepare, prepare to fail.Martin McCourt has dislodged the experienced Niall Kane in goal for the last few games and could well hold on to the number one spot for the final.One thing for certain, bar injury, is that the five Branagan brothers will start, four in defence, with Eugene lining out at corner forward, but given a licence to roam.They epitomise everything good about Kilcoo. Honest, resolute, determined and committed.Ryan McEvoy, Dylan Ward and Aaron Morgan should be tasked with winning the ball in the middle of the park and supplying Paul Devlin, Conor Laverty and the Johnston brothers Ryan and Jerome mdash not forgetting younger brother Shealan when he is called upon.Kilcoo also have serious strength on the bench and in addition to Johnston the younger, they can call on Anthony Morgan, Paddy Devlin, Sean OHanlon, James McClean and Felim McGreevy,.Warrenpoint have made their way through some tricky ties unbeaten and along the way have accounted for An Riocht , Ballyholland , Longstoneand Ballyholland in the semi-final, - to -.Manager Niall McAleenan has the nucleus of the squad that won the IFC title in  and has also introduced some talented teenagers.He will rely on Adam Lynch, Pat Murdock, Ryan McAleenan, John Boyle, Eoghan Byrne and Ciaran McCartan to keep the Kilcoo attack quiet, bit few defences ever manage it.The Point cant afford to play in a defensive manner come Sunday. They must attack Kilcoo and utilise their magical set of forwards.McAleenans men have shipped a lot of scores in the league and to invite Kilcoo on to them would not be advisable.Thats why going at Kilcoo from the off and getting top scorer Ross McGarry involved early on is essential.McGarry is the one player who has the ability and temperament to unsettle Kilcoo.He is not the biggest full forward in the game, but he has pace, bravery and rarely misses in front of goal.He is undoubtedly Warrenpoints ace in the pack and along with the Boyle brothers adds a touch of class to the Points challenge.McGarry relies heavily on Donagh McAleenan, Ruairi McCormick, Aaron Magee, Ryan Mallon and Ryan Boyle and this unit must be firing on all cylindersWarrenpoint are to cause a shock win.Kilcoo are red hot favourites at   with a generous   being offered on Warrenpoint.

The key issue we have to address is the presence of a wet weather centre in the resort which I would suggest includes a fun-type family pool, he said.ldquoI believe that alongside this there needs to be a few swimming lanes to accommodate the needs of local people who have not had access to modern leisure facilities for some considerable time.Cllr Clarke said this issue needed to be flagged up as part of the consultation process on the way forward.He said it was important that elected representatives highlighted the needs of local people during the process.ldquoWe are talking about a once in a generation opportunity to deliver a modern leisure facility in Newcastle and we will not be settling for less. The location is good and while there may be issues with parking, these are not insurmountable.ldquoWe are talking about a complete new build which will maximise the large area of space at the rear of the existing centre and I would be keen to see a high quality design, comprising wood and glass, he said.Cllr Clarke added: ldquoI would like to see an eco-friendly building, which is both sustainable and carbon neutral..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th October 2019 Planners.jpg","title":"Planners recommend expansion at Newcastle’s Barbican supermarket  ","story":"A LEADING Newcastle business is in line for a major extension.Planners are recommending that mdash subject to a number of conditions mdash an amended proposal to expand the Barbican filling station at the Dundrum Road in the resort should be given the green light.The approval recommendation is due to be discussed at a meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos Planning Committee on Wednesday of next week.The proposal includes the redevelopment of the existing petrol station and forecourt and extending the storersquos retail space.

outfit were the form team over the second half of last season and having recently clinched the Leinster Senior League title, were heavy favourites with pundits and bookmakers prior to kick off.They were also almost at full strength, while the home side were patched up in midfield after losing Rory Butler to injury. Veteran centre Stuart Morrow was again pressed into service with Aaron Cairns ing on the wing following concussion.Up front Ben Cullen earned the starting loose head spot and hugely influential number  Conall Boomer ed from injury. However, with eight players involved in the Ulster A Celtic Cup game on Friday night and four more in South Africa with the Pro squad, Brian McLaughlinrsquos options were limited.Tom Stewart and Connor Rankin were released to take their places on the bench, but the team that took the field was largely drawn from the squad which had been under-performing over the pre-AIL period.A few honest words on Tuesday night and an exceptional week on the training paddock clearly made a big dference as the home side tore into their opponents from the whistle.Playing away from the clubhouse and into the wet and gusty conditions, they drove into the Terenure half and were rewarded for an excellent scrum with a penalty to allow Sean OrsquoHagan to give his side the lead.Some indiscipline from a visibly fired up home forward pack allowed Terenure the chance to gain a foothold in the home half, but a superb turnover from Boomer on former lsquoHinch prop Campbell Classon allowed Ryan Wilson to clear.Cairns was doing his best to keep the home support involved and after skinning his opposite number twice in quick succession, he proceeded to drive him almost into the home dugout with a massive hit which got the home crowd even more fired up.However, a three point lead was scant reward for Ballynahinch after  minutes and Terenure began to turn the screw.They had a clear scrum advantage with referee Kieran Barry taking umbrage with Cullenrsquos angles and following a scrum deep in lsquoHinch territory, they went through the phases and eventually drove prop Liam Hyland over for a try at the posts to take a - lead.Moments later a superb long grubber kick forced Cairns back over his own line and Terenure won another penalty from the resulting m scrum.Declining the shot at goal they opted for another scrum and another infringement led to a penalty try, taking the lead out to - after  minutes.Undaunted, Ballynahinch finished the half strongly when a trademark Rhys OrsquoDonnell show and go sent him flying up the left touchline and almost over in the corner. Stout defending from Terenure averted the immediate danger, but a penalty for offside allowed OrsquoHagan to kick another penalty and cut the gap to - at half-time.As conditions worsened there was belief around the ground that this was not an insurmountable deficit, but disaster struck early in the first half when replacement Rankin elected to move the ball from deep.His long pass to a flying Ross Adair was only inches off target, but allowed the prolic Jake Swaine to hack through and win the race for the line to take his side  points clear at -. Ballynahinch refused to lie down and used the conditions to dominate field position.Blindside Aaron Hall put his injury nightmare behind by driving Terenure back at every opportunity and OrsquoHaganrsquos deadly boot dragged them back into the game with two penalties. When the under pressure Terenure outfit conceded another penalty in their own , almost everyone in the ground expected another three points.The ever-alert OrsquoDonnell had other ideas as he took a quick tap penalty and weaved his way over to score at the posts.OrsquoHaganrsquos conversion made it  all and as the weather really closed in, the home side were the clear favourites as they piled on the pressure in search of a win.Terenure defended well and were handed a leline when Cairns elected to run a speculative clearance instead of launching it back downfield.The ball was knocked on in the centre of the pitch and with heavyweight lock James Simpson off, the field Terenure once again exploited their scrum superiority to milk a penalty.Swaine held his nerve to nail the kick which, although central, was made tricky by the grim conditions.Ballynahinch threw everything at a tiring Terenure defence as the game entered injury time and after more than  phases of hammering away around the m line OrsquoHagan called for thegoal.The slippery conditions and heavy pressure meant his kick was a little rushed and it dropped short and wide to allow the away side to mark the ball and kick it out for a hard-earned win.The locals will reflect on a game they probably should have won, but will take an enormous amount of positives from the performance after visibly stepping up their physicality.Small margins will make a huge dference in this league and the fixtures come fast over the next few weeks. lsquoHinch travel to UCC this weekend to take on a student side buoyed by their demolition of much-fancied Trinity at the weekend and with the squad still thin due to Ulster Arsquos involvement in the Celtic Cup final, skipper John Donnan will have to lt his men for another big effort. However, he will be a happier man after his team showed that they belong in this company.Ballynahinch: Ben Cullen, Conor Piper, Johnny Blair, James Simpson, John Donnan , Aaron Hall, Olly Loughead, Conall Boomer, Rhys OrsquoDonnell, Sean OrsquoHagan, Aaron Cairns, Ryan Wilson, Stuart Morrow, George Pringle, Ross Adair.

We want to turn them into respectful iniduals with good values and an understanding of issues across the whole spectrum le has to offer.The school encourages pupils to voice their ideas, and shape their own education to a degree. They are asked what additions and activities they would like around the school, push for pupil engagement with a range of le experiences, and emphasis the development of their social skills to help them interact with others in dferent settings.The idea works well in practice. The students are friendly, confident, and respectful to the teachers. They smile, wave and say hello to the teachers in the corridors.ldquoThis is my eleventh year here, said Ms Lewis. ldquoI feel privileged to work in Fairfield. Itrsquos a school with a wonderful ethos and atmosphere, and skilled staff who know the children well, ensuring theyrsquore getting the best possible.ldquoThe children really exude enjoyment and enthusiasm for their learning.One classroom was filled with children learning their times-tables by singing and dancing, grins from ear to ear. In the schoolrsquos on-site nursery, youngsters concentrate on their basic arithmetic, rolling modelling clay into a single sunflower, or a pair of bananas.The nursery is the most recent addition to the school, having been opened in January of last year. Itrsquos the sort of place you can hear long before you see, as smiling toddlers enjoyed their break time.The nurseryrsquos addition to the school site would allow for an improved transition for pupils from nursery to reception.ldquoChildren benefit from being challenged with their learning at an earlier stage, explained Ms Lewis. ldquoWe want to make them feel safe and comfortable at the school, and make it as easy as possible to move up to reception.ldquoWe also give our older pupils a chance to experience both Stanwell and St Cyres secondaries around here to give them a smooth move into secondary education.Therersquos plenty on offer at the school, as well.Opportunities for extracurricular activities is vast, with local community groups using the hall throughout the week, for gym, dance fitness, karate, football and music tech.The introduction of a lsquoMid-week Muddle-Uprsquo allows pupils to work across age groups on half-termly projects, which use staff expertise in particular areas for a project that they collectively work on such as working on the environment in their own conservation area, or lsquoPizza Mathsrsquo combining elements of maths and fractions with cookery.Pupil groups cover School Council, Sports Council, Creative Committee, Sgwad Cymraeg, Eco-Committee, Team Captains, Digital Leaders, while other groups focus on global issues and the impact of their actions internationally.Jake Kidby, Ahmed Maher and Georgia Tomalin-Reeves are on the school council.Though each had a dferent focus for their enjoyment of the school site, they all agreed they were very happy at Fairfield.Jake said: ldquoI absolutely love my football and therersquos loads of chances to play that here. The new gym trail outside is great too.Ahmed said: ldquoI prefer maths and challenges. We thought school council would be a fun responsibility to look after the school, help people and share ideas.Georgia said: ldquo As part of school council we decided to build a lsquorelaxation stationrsquo for anyone who feels down. They can bring paper and pens and books. Itrsquos just a wooden den. But wersquore putting in shelves, posters. And therersquos lot of free space to run around front and back.The school has been lauded for its environmental efforts, securing a Bronze Welsh Charter Award last term, and earning a Platinum Flag for their approach to ecological and sustainability issues.Pupils Isaac Eley and Sophie Wilford were at the schoolrsquos conservation area.They explained to me that the area was first started around  years ago, but they had begun pushing for more lessons to be held outdoors.They hope to add tables, chairs and more outdoor classroom equipment, so they can take lessons in the open air.ldquoThe staff go above and beyond here, said Ms Lewis. ldquoWith increased pressure on funding for schools staff, governors and parents have to really put  per cent effort in.ldquoThe PTA has raised an incredible amount for us over the years and have done wonders for our IT departments.ldquoParents have helped out in raising money for the new gym trail.ldquoOne father built our relaxation station shed by himself, and the stage on the playground for singing and dancing was also built with parentrsquos help.ldquoThey ensure we can continue and we can be excellent for all the childrenrsquos learning.ldquoAttainment is high and all pupils make good progress specic to them, and this achievement is something of which we are extremely proud.Therersquos an underlying feeling of positivity in Fairfield, off the beaten path but quietly proud and it seems thoroughly well-earned. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ministers have attacked our independent judges. The Government is spending millions on an advertising campaign that appears to conflict with an Act of Parliament and all the meanwhile jobs, security and stability are put further and further at risk.Boris Johnson is playing Russian roulette with all of our lives over Brexit, and we cannot stand by and let him do it.The last three years have been a shambles, and it is clear we will now need to go back to the people for them to have the final say.That is why the case for a Peoplersquos Vote, where a credible deal is put to the British people, with the option to Remain, provides the best and most democratic ways of ending this crisis.Readers will know I think Brexit is a disaster for our jobs, security and international standing ndash and so would campaign resolutely to Remain in that scenario.Either way, I believe we need to heal some of the isions in this country and get back to focusing on the issues we all want to talk about.Despite the Brexit chaos, Irsquove continued to work hard on lots of other issues locally.It was a real pleasure to attend the Penarth Picnic at the weekend, and I want to thank Penarth Town Council, Production  and all those involved for a great event ndash showcasing the best of Penarthrsquos wonderful community spirit. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Yet, too many people across the UK ndash and here in Wales ndash are going hungry.It is shameful that in the sixth richest country on the planet people are struggling to put food on the table.A recent report by the South Wales Food Alliance has shown that  per cent of  to -year-olds ran out of food in the past year and , children in Wales are living in households for whom a healthy diet is increasingly unaffordable.In addition, the Trussell Trust has reported record numbers of people accessing its services. Last year, it provided over , emergency food parcels to people in crisis in Wales, , of them to children. A No Deal Brexit will be catastrophic for the countryrsquos most vulnerable households and would be an act of economic self-harm impacting many generations to come. This is why I am supporting the campaign for Food Justice.There can be no doubt that the causes of rising hunger are rooted in a decade of austerity, tax and welfare changes, and an economy that no longer provides a fair dayrsquos pay for a fair days work for too many.The food crisis that the UK is living through is likely to be signicantly worsenedwe leave the EU without a deal. The recently published government documents on Operation Yellow Hammer predict shortages of some fresh foods and an increase in the price of food by up to  per cent, as a likely scenario.The papers make for grim reading for the many hard pressed families who are already struggling to put food on the table.In Wales we are committed to eradicating food poverty but we need UK-wide action.The Co-operative campaign is calling on the UK Government to commit to zero-hunger by  and incorporate it into UK law.While many of the solutions to food poverty are the responsibility of the UK Government there is local action that we can take that can make a real dference.The campaign is encouraging councils across Wales to commit to playing their part by designating a lead member for food poverty, to draw up a food action plan, and to take inspiration from emerging community responses to food poverty.The good news is that there is a huge amount of work already going on in our communities by councils, churches, charities and food banks.For more information or to get involved in the campaign please visit www.party.coop campaign food-justice article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This compares to five per cent of the population in , when  per cent of adults smoked.However, there has also been an increase in the numbers of ex-smokers who now vape.:The National Survey for Wales shows that, in ,  per cent of e-cigarettes users also smoked cigarettes. This fell to  per cent in  .Across the UK the number of vapers who are ex-smokers reached . per cent in  with the main reason given for using e-cigarettes being to help them quit.Of those surveyed by ASH Wales,  per cent of e-cigarette users cited health as their main reason for vaping.Suzanne Cass, chief executive of ASH Wales said: ldquoThe rise in the numbers of ex-smokers who now vape in Wales shows that many smokers are using e-cigarettes to quit.ldquoIndeed, when coupled with behavioural support e-cigarettes have been shown to be one of the most effective ways to give up smoking, enabling thousands of smokers in Wales to break a habit that destroys lives.ldquoHowever, with more than double the amount of people in Wales smoking compared to vaping, we still face a major challenge when it comes to changing peoplersquos behaviour and de-normalising what has become an entrenched habit in many of our most deprived communities.Despite the increase in the number of people vaping, the survey also revealed perceptions of the relative harm of e-cigarettes compared to tobacco cigarettes have worsened.Now almost a third of people in Wales believe e-cigarettes are equally or more harmful than tobacco cigarettes.Suzanne Cass said: ldquoThere is work to be done when it comes to raising awareness of the relative harm of e-cigarettes compared to tobacco cigarettes and addressing concerns about the safety of vaping.Since the survey was carried out, reports of a possible link between e-cigarette use and deaths from lung disease in America have led some medical experts to warn of the dangers of vaping.According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention many of those vapers affected had used products with liquids containing cannabinoid products.E-cigarettes are regulated in the UK in line with a set of European-wide rules by the medicines regulator, the MHRA. The MHRA also monitors adverse reactions through its yellow card system, which to date has not identied serious respiratory problems similar to that found in the US.Meanwhile vapers in the UK are urged by ASH to only ever purchase e-cigarettes from reputable suppliers. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We were a mix of young people, parents and other concerned citizens of Penarth, and met outside Grfin Books.ldquoWe joined the young people who have been striking from school. In a year this movement has grown from Greta Thunberg by herself to millions worldwide.ldquoThe evidence on climate change is clear. Our actions through burning fossil fuels and demands for continued economic growth cause global warming and climate change. People are already suffering and nature, upon which we all depend, is collapsing. Governments need to be honest about this and act upon the crisis.ldquoWe were over the moon with the response from Penarth residents, who walked with us or cheered us on, the day really gave us hope that the message is seeping in and change can happen. Myself and others had been feeling quite down because climate change is scary, we are worried about our childrenrsquos futures.

Any proposals would be subject to full consultation, meaning all interested parties would have an opportunity to share their views before any decision is made.ldquoShould proposals progress, they would also be subject to separate planning consultation.ldquoThis would include consideration of highways and traffic concerns. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

But our role as judges in this case is limited.\"The wider issues raised by the claimants, about whether these choices were right or wrong or good or bad, are not for us they are for members of the public and their elected representatives.\"There was no direct discrimination on grounds of sex, because this legislation does not treat women less favourably than men in law.\"Rather, it equalises a historic asymmetry between men and women and thereby corrects historic direct discrimination against men.\"In a statement after the ruling, Unison general secretary Dave Prentis said: \"This is a terrible blow for the millions of women who will have been hoping for a very dferent outcome today.\"The decision to hike the state pension age with next to no notice didnt just throw their retirement plans up in the air, it also left many women on lower incomes really struggling to make ends meet.\"Campaigners have now called on the UK Parliament to intervene on their behalf.A DWP spokesman welcomed the judgment, adding: \"It has always been our view that the changes we made to womens state pension age were entirely lawful and did not discriminate on any grounds.\"The court decided that arguments the claimants were not given adequate notice of changes to the state pension age could not be upheld.\"This follows the extensive communications that DWP made to publicise these changes over many years.\"He added that raising the state pension age in line with changes to le expectancy had been the policy of successive governments over many years. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Armagh crossroads, plagued with a high level of accidents, is to get a reduced speed limit after intense lobbying by residents.Local MLA William Irwin has been at the forefront of the campaign to have traffic calming at Ardress crossroads.The DUP MLA welcomed additional signage and awareness works at the notorious junction.Crash after crash has beenhighlighted by the MLA and he has echoed the warnings by local residents that ‘sooner or later someone will get killed’.Mr Irwin has been consistently lobbying for improvements and he welcomed what he called a “very focused lobby” from residents in the vicinity in assisting in relaying real concerns over safety at the crossroads.Mr Irwin said: “These additional works including the implementation of a mph speed limit and extra signage and road markings is very welcomed and I thank Transport NI for their continued efforts in this regard.”He continued: “There has been a high level of collisions at this location and I know that residents and road users generally have been really concerned that sooner or later a fatality will occur. “A number of improvements have been made in recent times however, worryingly, accidents still occur at an alarming rate. “Residents have been very proactive in their lobby and I have joined fully with them in continuing my lobby for improvements. “This is seeing results which is pleasing to see from a safety point of view,” said the DUP MLA.Mr Irwin said:“Additional signs have been erected including a speed limit and there are more warning markings etc to be added to all approaches to the crossroads.“And I am hopeful that this will help in alerting drivers to the fact that they must stop at the junction and wait until the route is clear. “I will continue with the residents to monitor this issue and continue to raise their concerns going forward.” PSNI probe ‘serious’ assaults which left victims hospitalisedThieves ransack woman’ home while she was out on volunteer community work

What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career. I never underestimate the dficulties facing working parents with young children who deserve all the credit and support that they can get. A strong support network is also very important in the office and I am lucky to have the benefit of some great lawyers around me to whom I can turn to for help when needed. How would you like your business to be remembered  As a leading commercial law firm in Northern Ireland that is independent and innovative provides high quality legal advice to its clients conducts business in a socially responsible and ethical matter has a strong commercial awareness and specialist legal professionals. What piece of advice would you give to a -year-old you  Believe in yourself, be flexible and above all when opportunities present themselves to you, grab them.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/jo-control-room_.jpg","title":"m green energy plan for northern ireland","story":"Posted on Thursday  September  by Ulster Business Northern Ireland’s electricity operator has outlined a major £m five-year investment plan for a green energy system here.

The Top  Northern Ireland Companies  dinner, with AL Goodbody, brought together some of top business chiefs making the list, to the grand backdrop of Queen’s University’s Great Hall. The event heard renewed calls for securing a deal on Brexit, and the restoration of Stormont, as we approach , days without a devolved government here. John Mulgrew, editor of Ulster Business, told those gathered: “On the precipice of Brexit, the voice of business has never been stronger or more important – further enforcing the need for a deal. Avoiding a hard exit. And retaining a strong trading relationship across the island. “But we should also take this opportunity to clearly note, that we are approaching , days since having a devolved government – up and running. “It affects you and your businesses, and it’s cited as the key reason putting off investment from overseas, and our own local companies, from making key investment decisions.” The Top  edition is an annual showcase of the leading and largest companies, located right across Northern Ireland. This year sales rose by almost %, approaching a combined figure of £bn. And for the eighth year in a row, poultry processing giant Moy Park has come in at the number one spot, with turnover of £.bn. Michael Neill, head of Belfast office at AL Goodbody, said: “What the Top  companies have achieved in the past  months in what can only be described as capricious circumstances is truly remarkable – but imagine what could have been achieved had we some semblance of ‘normality’. “My hope is that we find ourselves doing so in a Northern Ireland that is embarking on a new and positive era of opportunity, rather than picking up the shattered pieces of a ‘no deal’ Brexit for many years to come.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"firms must prepare for no deal as economic forecast revised down","story":"Posted on Tuesday October  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland firms must prepare for a ‘no deal’ Brexit – a bank chief economist has warned – as it downgraded its forecast for the economy to .%.

Possibilities included a no-deal exit, a withdrawal agreement being reached, an extension of Article  period or a general election.

Ulster Business speaks to Northern Ireland managing director Ian Sheppard, and learns more about how colleagues are being empowered to play an active role in the local communities where they live and work Bank of Ireland UK sees developing its colleagues and helping customers and communities to thrive as part of its DNA, according to Ian Sheppard, managing director in Northern Ireland.From key charity partnerships, to fundraising, volunteering, sponsorship and more, Ian says the desire for Bank of Ireland UK is to make a positive impact by empowering colleagues to make a dference.“When I speak to my colleagues, I hear how really active and involved they are in their own community,” Ian says. “There are so many examples and I never cease to be amazed by their passion and commitment.An important partnership for the bank is with Alzheimer’s Society, its flagship charity for the last two years. In that time around £, has been raised in Northern Ireland, but as Ian explains it’s about more than fundraising.“We realised that not only can we help them financially, but there are resources we can share and opportunities we can offer which can help to signicantly raise the charity’s profile and raise much needed funds.”One example in which the bank has supported Alzheimer’s Society in this way is through its own long-running partnership with Ulster Rugby.“We donated our advertising and promotion activity for a televised game at the Kingspan Stadium making the charity ‘Sponsor for a Day’. This included using their logo on the back of the Ulster Rugby jerseys, taking over the pitch side boards and inviting a group of people living with dementia, their family and carers to the game – helping to get their brand message out to not only a stadium with capacity of , people but to a much wider TV audience.”Alzheimer’s Society sees some fantastic people giving their time to help others. That’s no clearer than its Side by Side programme, which Bank of Ireland UK helps to fund.The photograph on the front of this edition of the magazine taken at the Grand Opera House in Belfast features Mary Dalzell a Side by Side volunteer, alongside Hazel Whiteside, who has been living with dementia for two years.They share a love of music, theatre and cinema and the Side by Side programme, which re-connects people with dementia to their communities by doing the things they love, has not only put a smile on both their faces but has had a positive impact on their lives.There are so many people impacted by dementia and Alzheimers in our local communities, and its touching so many people’s lives, taking this as our motivation, the bank now has almost , staff trained as Dementia Friends.The bank’s ‘Give Together’ programme means staff can take one day a year to spend the time working with a charity or community organisation of their choice. “This day can involve anything from gardening work to painting a youth centre,” Ian says“Beyond Alzheimer’s Society, colleagues are helping many other organisations such as Macmillan Cancer Support, Cancer Research UK through its Relay for Le Legenderry, the Wooden Spoon children’s rugby charity, and Space NI, which offers support services in health and social care sectors to the local community.” You canabout some of the good work colleagues have done further on in this feature.“We are also committed to reflecting the community by developing a erse and modern workforce – which is part-and-parcel of a progressive company,” Ian says. “It’s something that current and future employees expect in their employer. For us its part of our DNA, something that’s always been there but we are now putting a clear and visible structure around it,” Ian says.This has included being a founding member of FuSIoN – the Financial Services Inclusion Network which drives to support and promote LGBT+ professionals across the sector, becoming JAM Card members – allowing staff to knowcustomers with a communication barrier need ‘just a minute’, as well as recently being awarded the Diversity Charter Mark.“Our community involvement is something we are very clear about - something I’m passionate about and it’s an easy ask to get staff engaged. It’s very natural, and it has always been developed from the ground up,” Ian says.He believes this contributes to the huge numbers of staff doing their bit – enabling their own local communities to thrive.  ALISON MITCHELLA customer service manager for Bank of Ireland UK in Londonderry, Alison has worked for the bank for  years, but her motivation for fundraising and support for Alzheimer’s Society began in , following her mother-in-law’s diagnosis with dementia. Alison trained at her local hospital to become a dementia volunteer and learned so much she asked Alzheimer’s Society to run similar sessions in her own branch to enable staff to better assist customers with dementia.Sadly, Alison’s mother-in-law passed away in May of this year but to mark her passing and to raise vital funds in her memory, Alison took part in Alzheimer’s Society Cupcake Day. Initial plans to simply sell cupcakes within her own branch changed rapidly as colleagues from nearby branches heard of the event and wanted to support both Alison and the charity.  Faced with orders for more than  cupcakes, Alison requested a Give Together day, which is time given by the bank to both iniduals and teams to give back to their communities. Alison says: “I was in the kitchen from am to pm baking and icing but it was worth it. The event raised £, which Bank of Ireland UK matched doubling the amount raised to £,. “I could not have achieved that without the support of family, colleagues and the wider business. I was proud to raise the funds in my mother-in-law’s memory and I am proud to work for an organisation that not only values our role in the wider community but supports it too.” CHRISTINE GRAHAMChristine Graham has helped to raise funds for Cancer Research UK through the Relay for Le “Legenderry” event held in St. Columb’s Park, Londonderry.The Derry-based senior business manager for Bank of Ireland UK has personally been touched by cancer as she lost two close family members to the disease. Her young great niece was also diagnosed with a rare form of cancer in  and is now doing well, but seeing the impact a cancer diagnosis has on a family inspired Christine to get involved with the Relay for Le event.“Our event truly is ‘legenderry’,” she says. It is a -hour relay race that brings the whole community together to celebrate the lives of cancer survivors, to remember those lost to the disease, to fight back by increasing our knowledge of cancer and by raising money to fund le-saving cancer research.”In just three years the event has raised over £, for Cancer Research UK with Christine helping to raise £, in  – not only the most successful Relay for Le event in the UK this year but all funds raised in Northern Ireland stays here.  Christine values the support she has had from the bank who promote the event to the wider community and from her colleagues who enter teams.“Relay for Le is for all ages and stages, all shapes and sizes,” she says. It’s cross community and intergenerational and the atmosphere every year is electric.”Plans are already underway for Relay for Le  which promises to be another massive event. PAUL MAGEEPaul Magee, associate director of the corporate banking team, became involved with the Ulster Region Committee for Wooden Spoon, the Children’s Charity of Rugby, five years ago after he successfully completed the charity’s Four Peaks Challenge, reaching the summits of the UK and Ireland’s highest peaks. He is now an active committee member for Wooden Spoon, helping to raise funds to provide le-enhancing experiences for disadvantaged and disabled children. “All funds raised in Ulster stay in the region and benefit the children here,” Paul says. “For instance, we provided £, to the Mae Murray Foundation to buy specialist equipment for the first fully accessible beach in Ulster at Benone Strand. When we created the access to the beach, one parent was very emotional as he watched his teenage daughter in the sea for the first time. It’s those occasions where we’re responding to a need within the community that makes the effort worthwhile.”Wooden Spoon has funded numerous charity projects, most recently £, for a new multi-sensory room at Parkview Special School in Lisburn and purchasing a horse for Riding for the Disabled Association in Coleraine, a charity that enhances children’s lives every day.  With his passion for and involvement in Wooden Spoon, Paul is grateful for the support Bank of Ireland has given him in his role with the organisation, specically the corporate banking team who value his dedication to making a dference. He says: “The bank has been fantastic – I appreciate the flexibility the team offers in the lead up to events and my colleagues often attend Wooden Spoon fundraisers. I’ve also benefited from the bank’s Give Together initiative, which offers days of paid leave that employees can use for volunteering. The bank’s support has helped facilitate my commitment to Wooden Spoon, where I can really see and be a part of the impact the charity has on the local community.” SALLY IRVINEOver the last  years Sally Irvine’s coffee mornings have become a highlight in the office calendar, in turn raising more than £, for MacMillan Cancer Support and funding  days of specialist nursing care for cancer patients across Northern Ireland.Sally, a business lending and credit governance manager at Bank of Ireland UK, arranged her first Macmillan Coffee Morning in  following a colleague’s cancer diagnosis. She found herself wanting to do something to help people living with cancer and so took the plunge and decided to be a host as part of Macmillan’s biggest coffee morning fundraising event. From the outset, Sally had tremendous support from her team members and the wider business, and this has contributed to the ongoing success of the event.The bank plays a huge part in ensuring Sally can deliver the event each year by giving her support through their Give Together scheme.Sally says: “The coffee morning has become a very special occasion and a great day of fun where people from across the bank come together to have a wee cuppa and a cake and take time to catch up while raising money for a really important cause. One in two of us will face cancer at some time in our lives and I am passionate about continuing to fundraise to provide the specialist nursing care that’s so vital for those living with cancer.”Plans are already underway for this year’s Macmillan Coffee Morning and Sally is hopeful the annual fundraiser will continue to hold a special place in the office calendar. PAUL SLEVINBranch manager at Bank of Ireland UK in Newry, Paul Slevin is someone who embodies the bank’s ethos of community involvement through his role with the charity Space NI.  Space NI offers support services in health and social care sectors to the local community. Through its service Home to Hospital, the organisation has helped  elderly people travel to crucial hospital appointments, while its Family Support Hub offers vital assistance to families in distress. Paul joined the charity in  and has just completed five years as chairman of the Board of Directors.
