DIY store owner Surinder Josan explains the steps that he has been taking to keep his family and his customers safeAll non-essential retailers – including clothes, shoe, toy, book and electronics shops, tailors, auction houses, photography studios and indoor markets – in England were able to reopen this week, provided they had followed UK government guidelines to make them “Covid-secure”.That means reopened shops should have carried out a risk assessment using guidance from the Health and Safety Executive. Employers also had a duty to consult staff about the safety measures required. Businesses were expected to inform all staff about the findings of their assessments, and those with more than 50 employees should have published the results on their websites.Shops should now have hygiene procedures in place to keep staff and customers safe, for instance by providing hand-washing facilities and regularly cleaning surfaces, including self-checkouts, trolleys, or devices handled by staff. Employers will also need to help those with visual impairments or disabilities to navigate these measures.It’s not only shop owners tasked with keeping customers safe. Shoppers have also been urged to protect each other by, for example, not trying on clothing or testing goods. Fitting rooms should be closed wherever possible. If they are open, contact between customers and staff should be limited. They should also be cleaned frequently, typically after each use.For many it is all new. But not for Surinder Josan who has been implementing safety measures for the past few months. Josan owns two family-run businesses in Smethwick, West Midlands: a hardware store, All Seasons DIY, started by his parents and Seasons Palace, a banqueting venue for weddings and parties.The 55-year-old grew up helping in the DIY shop and appeared to be heading down a different career path after a degree in electronics and studying for a master’s in IT. But when his father developed a heart problem while Josan was studying, he took the reins, streamlining the way the DIY shop ran and developing two thriving businesses.The whole family has been involved – including his wife, his mother, his father until he died a few years ago, and even his children when they’re not studying. “We like to be right in the thick of things so we run them both. With the venue it’s actually pretty easy – we just take the bookings and direct people to our suppliers like caterers, DJs, the people who do the decorations.The detail is taken off our hands. Plus, the main use of that is at the weekend and evenings when the shop isn’t open, so I can jump from one to the other.” When Josan started hearing about the coronavirus in late December, he admits to being scared.“The first thing that came to mind was that the banqueting venue was not going to work in those circumstances.” So, in late Januaryearly February, he took the decision to close the 200-person venue, persuading customers to move their bookings to 2021. While the loss of income was a hit, he decided the move was in the best interests of everyone’s safety.He was then faced with deciding what to do about the shop. “The biggest problem is that my mother’s DNA is part of the shop, and asking her to step away from it was a big no-no. The only way to get her away was to close. So when they announced that pubs and schools were all closed we bit the bullet and shut it too.”Putting the time to good use, he decided to carry out a shop refit, but put notices up saying if anyone needed hardware items for repairs or urgent work, he would help. It started with a few phone calls, he says, but soon there was a steady stream of people wanting to buy things. “It also dawned on us that hardware stores were allowed to remain open, so we thought: ‘If we’re going to do this, we will have to do it properly.’”That decision prompted Josan and his family to put an array of measures in place to keep both themselves and their customers safe. “We put lines outside the shop. We also barricaded the area by the till so customers come in one by one, tell us what they want, then we go and get it. We reduced the contactless payments minimum from £5 to £1 to make it easier for people to limit contact. We also started cleaning the money using wipes.”The measures weren’t necessarily easy, but were well-received by customers filled with confidence that Josan was doing everything he could to keep them safe. “It was hard work – we were constantly going backwards and forwards – I think I did 17,000 steps in one day and that was just in the shop.“It was so tiring that we cut down our hours, so instead of opening from 9am to 7pm we opened from 10am to 4.30pm. The number of customers who’ve come in and complimented us is unbelievable. They say that when they come here they feel really safe. We did it because we wanted to be safe, but it works for everyone.”While many businesses will be getting used to new practices and ways of working, Josan and his family have few changes planned for the immediate future, being happy to continue with the safety measures they’ve been using for the past few months.“We’re going to carry on doing exactly what we have been doing up until now,” he says. Despite that, he remains concerned that not everyone is as careful with their safety as he and his fellow retailers are.“People have calmed down and there’s less panic-buying, but they aren’t observing the 2-metre rule. They’re just a bit absent-minded about it,” he adds.And while he plans on keeping things as they are for the DIY store, potentially until the end of the year, Josan admits the future is less clear for the banqueting venue.“If the government says we can open, I have thought about how I would do it and keep people separate. You could do it with the tables, with the toilets, and the kitchen and even the stage. But how do you do it on a dance floor? Unless you draw circles and tell people to stay inside them.“So the only way I can think of is that instead of having 200 people you have 60-70, and use more of the outdoors as opposed to the indoors. These are some of my thoughts, but I have got to do it so we are safe and whoever is with us – the caterers, the guests – are safe too. The last thing I want is for there to be an outbreak.”In the meantime, he plans to offer the space to a local school free of charge if it needs more room in order to welcome children back. With so much adjustment needed for the “new normal” when it comes to our shops and venues, Josan acknowledges that it can be confusing. But he says there is a lot of information available, both from the UK government and other organisations, to help business owners put the right measures in place to keep themselves, their staff and their customers safe. And while he is confident that he’s been doing his bit to make sure his customers aren’t put in harm’s way, he admits the future is uncertain.“This is a new normal – we’re not going to go back to what we had for some time yet. There are still so many unknowns. At the end of the day, this virus is going to take out people who are close to us. It isn’t good enough to only think of our businesses and economy.”This advertiser content was paid for by the UK government.

With women only allowed to have one birth partner and home births restricted for a time, I spoke to women and men about how having a baby during lockdown has been for them and their new families. The project is ongoing.”Misgalla lives in south London and has been a doula for 4 years. She’s currently supporting Cath, who has undergone solo IVF, via Zoom.“I’ll be Cath’s birth partner, I’ve been supporting her since November. Sometimes doulas don’t do very much at all, but just seeing someone else’s face is enough, especially while pregnant women are in self-isolation.”Rooney lives in south London but is currently self-isolating in Bedford with her sister and brother-in-law and their three sons.“I was 42 when I started talking about IVF with friends. Once I’d decided, it all happened pretty quickly. A friend and I got pizza and a bottle of prosecco one night and went through the website.“Michele and I did a lot of the preparation together and she was there during the birth, looking after me.“Gaspar looks just like his cousin Jude when he was a baby, he feels like a total Rooney. Grandma and granddad are besotted. We Zoom with them every few days.”Kara has been a doula since 2017, supporting Becky and her daughter Silver, four weeks old, who live in Wirral.“I started supporting Becky on the day of her C-section, from when she went to hospital to immediately after the birth. Mums need a lot more support in the first week, then it gradually tapers off. Hopefully I’ll get to visit when lockdown’s over. It’ll be lovely to see them in person.”Thando has been a doula for seven years, supporting women around London and Bristol and attending hundreds of births.“It was horrible not being able to attend Colleen and Joe’s birth. I spoke to them on video call, but environment is everything in birth – you need intimacy and privacy. I haven’t met James and Juliet yet, we’ve had a telephone chat and a video chat instead of meeting face to face. I’ve been working with them since March.“We mother the mothers. Birth is really simple, we just overcomplicate it. Being a doula is such a beautiful thing.”Colleen McKeever, 39, and Joe Weber, 36, with baby Mae, born 26 MarchFrom the US, McKeever and Weber relocated from New York to north London three years ago. Thando has been their doula since February. McKeever and Mae were in hospital for eight days following her birth.Weber: “Mae was in intensive care for the first few days because she had jaundice. We’d meet up in NICU during the day, then Colleen would go back to her room and I’d come home and play Nintendo. I delivered supplies to Colleen in the days after. We could meet downstairs but not with Mae. Colleen held her up to the window for me.”Emily de Groot and Rashid Ariori with twins Maya and Joshua, born 21 March“My mum was going to come for a couple of weeks to help – that’s been hard because our families haven’t met them yet. My brother might come on Sunday and wave through the window.”Leah Bedwood, 35, south London, whose baby is due at the end of June‘I am determined to have a home birth with the sisterhood around me, women who are experienced birth keepers who’ve had their own children – my mum, my sister, my aunt – and my partner. At the moment my local hospital have suspended their home birthing service. They should be up and running again by the end of June, so hopefully the baby waits!“I had a socially distanced baby shower. I saw balloons and then suddenly this convoy of cars started coming down the road! We played games, everyone was guessing the sex of the baby, we had a bit of music, sweets. That was probably the nearest to having a social connection with people. It was a surprise, I really appreciated it.”Reyhan Akyıldız-Gladstone, 31, Jack Gladstone, 30, and Aphra, born 16 MarchAkyıldız-Gladstone: “We had Aphra at home 10 days before they shut down the local home birth team. She was born at 9am on the day everyone started working from home. I was quite aware that everyone was around in their houses! I went into labour at 4.30am and by 10am we were in bed and everyone had gone. Everything happened at a crazy pace.“We have no idea when our parents are going to meet her. My dad lives in Turkey – he had flights to come over but they were cancelled.“It’s had advantages, getting to know her and her getting to know us. The three of us have our little routine.”James Dow, 36, and Juliet Cochrane, 34, east London, who are expecting a girl on 21 JuneCochrane: “It’s definitely going to be different. The grandparents and siblings will have to self-isolate for two weeks when she’s born, and even then they might not be able to hold her. They might, it’s so hard to know what the right thing to do is. There’s a real plus side in slowing down and having time to really plan and get things organised. It’s quite good for us as a family.”Nilufar Anwar, 35, Johan Bjerke, 38, and baby Alma, born 13 AprilAnwar: “At hospital, my midwife’s name was Rachel. I wouldn’t be able to recognise her again as she wore a mask the whole time. It’s strange to go through such an intimate, intense, life-changing experience with someone you can’t really see. I would have loved to have given her a hug. But the pandemic has given us time to do nothing but adore every move and sound that Alma makes, and slowly grow into our new role as parents.”Raquel Ruiz Tognetti, 40, with baby Leonardo, born 20 April“I’m a solo 40-year-old mum, and had a complicated delivery in the worst weeks of the pandemic. My parents were supposed to come and help, but they were stuck in lockdown in Venezuela. In hospital you could feel the fear in everyone. Since the delivery, things have been much better, but I’ve been weighing my baby at home as the midwife visits stopped. Sometimes I think Leonardo thinks I’m the only human on earth.”Helen Ward, 35, and Oli Evans, 37, with daughters Emily, 4, and Erin, born 19 MarchWard: “We feel a lot calmer now. the start of this was insane. I was so anxious, crying all the time, really stressed. Now Erin’s putting on weight, I feel better about things. Emily has been remarkably fine. So far only Oli’s sister has met Erin, no one else. Friends have come for distanced drive-by drinks and cuppas so they’ve only seen her from afar. The experience has been otherworldly at times. Erin isn’t registered with a birth certificate yet, so coupled with no one meeting her, it’s almost as if she doesn’t exist.”“It’s nerve-racking taking the bus to maternity appointments. Even though you have a mask on and other people have a mask on, you still feel on edge. My partner can’t come to any scans, so we’ve booked a private 4D one so he can see her.“I’ve mostly been worried about the baby when she’s here, I’m not worried about myself. I think her grandparents can meet her with a mask, not touch. Maybe everyone can meet her around Christmastime. Hopefully it’s over by Christmas!”Sherica Spence, 34, and baby Caleb, born 4 March“The morning we checked out of hospital, I heard them say they had two confirmed cases of coronavirus. I just wanted to go home. We saw family and friends for the two weeks before lockdown, but after that we couldn’t see anyone. Everyone made sure we had food in the house: toilet rolls, nappies and wipes.“That was weird, having to rely on people. I’m a person that does everything myself. Celeb’s dad thought he might have the coronavirus, so he was at his house, doing video calls, making sure we were OK. I’m just lucky that he’s a peaceful child. He’s so good!”Lena Buhler, 31, and Johnson Aboaba, 27, due 1 SeptemberBuhler: “We were supposed to travel for work over March, April and May, but that was all cancelled. The hardest thing is not having a routine – that can make you feel a bit lost. My mum would have come over from Switzerland during this time but instead she’s been ordering baby stuff to the house. After the initial worry and anxiety subsided, I’ve found this to be good for us as a couple. Johnson’s been good. It’s a strange time for him but he’s been very calm.”Nissa Moger, 36, with baby Indy, born on 8 April“Indy was born in hospital and we were home 12 hours later. We were planning a water birth at home, but at that time they’d stopped the service, so we went in. It wasn’t what I planned, but the midwives were brilliant.“I work at St Thomas’ on the labour ward as a midwife and I teach hypnobirthing. All the classes moved online in March as soon as they said mums were at risk. It’s worked really well. I think initially my clients were more anxious because it was the unknown, but they seem more settled now.”Tammy Woodhouse, 30, and Adam Woodhouse, 28, due 9 AugustTammy: “They announced the lockdown the night of our 20-week scan, so off we went to our appointment. There were signs up, but we didn’t really read them, we just went up, and they told Adam he couldn’t be there. We had no idea. I just sat in the waiting room crying! It was a shock.“They let me FaceTime Adam in the appointment, but it turned out I had my hand over the microphone the whole time! In the first trimester I was sick quite a lot, but the second one’s been an absolute dream. I’m a little bit sad I had to spend it indoors.“I’ve deleted all my news apps – that was probably the best thing. I think it was just watching the numbers go up and up and feeling completely helpless.”Esther and Shahin Najafipour, both 31, with baby Milo, born 21 MayEsther: “I was in hospital for two days when I had him. No visitors were allowed. I work as a costume maker for film and had made 85 pairs of scrubs for the local hospitals while I was on furlough. Some of the nurses were wearing ones from the same batch. The midwife that delivered him was wearing some.”Shahin: “Normally, I would get two weeks’ paternity leave, so I’d go back next week, which doesn’t seem that much. It was kind of a blessing to be home as well and help where needed.”Farah Habibi, 28, and Faisal Imadi, 27, two-year-old Araaz and baby Zaayan, born 6 MarchHabibi: “Zayaan was born two weeks before the lockdown. My mum stayed for two weeks, then I sent her home. She would usually have stayed with me a lot longer. We FaceTime with her and my sister everyday.“My sister’s been dropping food outside the flat for us. We were self-isolating with him, but I’ve started going in the garden now. Today was the first proper walk I did with Araaz – he mostly goes out with his dad.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d834340831f71ea75533925dd01ff25c0208fb4d/0_168_5143_3086/master/5143.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b86489ef9764c4f5df5be1ee4c296157","title":"crushed cast constructed review gagosian gallery london","story":"Gagosian Grosvenor Hill Gallery, LondonMasked and slathered in hand sanitiser, our critic ponders new realities, proximity and space at the reopened gallery’s sculpture show Crushed, Cast, ConstructedLife during lockdown has meant that we have had to make our own amusements. How about some clay? We could model something. Or some old boxes to muck around with – we could build a hidey-hole, an obstacle course or a space ship. Or how about a truck, or some kind of tractor? We could go on a pretend drive around a make-believe farm. Look at the cows and the fields or take a nice splattery ride through the silage and the manure and send the chickens squawking. But, like a kid wanting a toy, I need a thing, a thing in person, the real thing. Preferably something that someone has made. A thing in space and me there with it, something I can relate to with my body as well as my eye.Sitting quietly through lockdown untouched by anything but a feather duster, there are only five things in Gagosian’s delayed sculpture show that opened last week for limited hours until the end of July. Everything is grey. Not exactly fun, is it? Fun times are over, but I’m more than up for it.Masked-up as if I’m about to rob the stagecoach and slathered at the gallery entrance in hand sanitiser, I am counted in. The American painter, wit and aphorist Ad Reinhard once said that sculpture was what you bump into when you back up to look at a painting. We know objects can hold a trace of the virus, but it isn’t the sculpture that worries me, it is other people. Everything has an aura now, and not just the art. I think of Alberto Giacometti, all those sculpted figures, paintings and drawings with their invisible force-fields made visible and somehow tangible, that snare the space around them and draw us into their gravitational fields. Making proximity and distance their measure, they attract and resist us.I would like to say how great it is to wander among artworks in a gallery once again, to encounter things made with purpose, things that were made before the current threat was apparent. But we see things in the here and now, whenever they were originally made, and here we are. A heightened awareness of the proximity and distance of others inevitably leads us to an amplified sense of spatial awareness, of our being bodies and minds in space and time, subject to gravity, to air currents, to light and shadow, as we calibrate safe distances and dangerous proximities, sniffing and sweating and breathing our shared air.A definite psychological distancing takes place in front of the teetering, extruded and squeezed forms that lean and bulge over you in the room occupied by Urs Fischer’s formless and vaguely cloacal aluminium cast forms. The Swiss artist likes playing with clay, all that atavistic squeezing, kneading and slopping about – the feel of its wetness and slipperiness, its squidgy baseness, its resistance and flow, its plasticity. Fischer’s group of sculptures take these base lumps, all formed with the hand, as their starting point. Scanned and enlarged and finally cast in aluminium, these lumpen shapes tower almost to the ceiling, their surfaces bearing the imprints of the artist’s fingers and palms, the haptic traces of fingerprints and creases also enlarged to scale. The last time I wrote about these sculptures, more than a decade ago, I was immune to them. Now I think they work best in a smaller space, as here. I also think I have changed.There is a nice circularity in the fact that clay itself is formed from water and complex molecular networks of aluminium silicates. These sculptures’ titles are taken from French Symbolist poet Stéphane Mallarmé’s 1874 Le Dernière Mode, a strange hybrid between art project and fashion magazine. Writing most of the articles under pseudonyms, Mallarmé’s magazine invented as much as commented on the burgeoning French fashion industry. Fischer has used the pseudonyms Mallarmé took – Zizi, Ix and Miss Satin – as names as much as titles. These sculptures, then, are personages, of a sort. Sometimes bone-like – and recalling Henry Moore – or reminiscent of fossilised faeces or solidified lava, they are anything but the fictive fashion writers of Mallarmé’s invention. Made between 2006 and 2008, Fischer’s sculptures chew at space, blunder and bulge and withdraw as you move among them. Their intimacy feels threatening. They invade my space to a degree I might not have been so alive to before. Another fear is that someone else might suddenly appear at any moment, up close, too close, from around the corner.I admit, I get nervous these days when I venture into the world, take a walk or a train or a bus even in the most familiar places I am constantly calculating proximities between myself and others, and aware of the space that contains us and that we occupy, aware of airflows, surfaces, barriers, aware of funnelling and dispersal. I am sure I am not alone in this. I imagine the enlargement of Fischer’s sculptures – which began as fist-sized gouts of soft clay – as solidified yet porous envelopes of space, within each of which the movements and turns of a human being, perhaps one wearing the voluminous fashions of the 1870s, is constantly being mapped and registered. This, surely, is going too far. I imagined it for an instant and then it was gone. We must be careful what we project. These are, after all, lumps of recast clay with drag names, and none the worse for that.A 1938 Cleveland Tractor Company farm tractor stands alone in an empty room. Its working days are over. One of the caterpillar tracks is incomplete and the radiator grille is hanging off. Various other vital parts appear to be missing. For a long time it stood rusting in a field, a plaything for kids to climb on or throw rocks at, till Charles Ray found it and removed it to his studio and took it apart.Every component – every spring, every gasket, every grommet and every fuel pipe, every nut and every bolt – the entire assembly was taken apart, reduced to its components, which were then inidually cast by hand before being reassembled. The tractor sits alone in a room, going nowhere. It already had a second life as a rusted, cobwebby kid’s plaything, a pretend tractor. Ray had the whole thing dismantled and even cast all the mechanics, including the crankshaft, hidden inside the tractor, before welding and screwing everything back in place. This is an anatomical replica of the insides as well as the outside. All his work is more complicated than it looks. Even Ray finds it more complex than he thought he might. At one point he almost retitled this Philosophical Object. It is a conundrum.A galvanised steel box sits on another, shallower one, which sits on a third, white-painted box-like plinth. The larger box of the three has been twisted and crushed, like a cardboard box you’d crumple and crush to get it to fit into the recycling bin, rather than opening it up and folding it down. Sculptor John Chamberlain is best known as a sculptor of car-body parts, creasing and crushing them somewhat in the manner of abstract expressionism. But there’s no colour here, only greyness, and rather than the hood of an old Chevy or a Pontiac, his chosen box here might once have been – I was told, uncertainly – a box minimalist sculptor Donald Judd had fabricated and which then, after Chamberlain had had his way with it, ended up in the collection of Cy Twombly.All this adds a certain frisson to Chamberlain’s 1967 sculpture. It also makes me think of Robert Rauschenberg’s Erased de Kooning (De Kooning gave Rauschenberg a particularly hard-to-erase drawing but, to the delight of both artists, Rauschenberg managed to rub it out almost entirely) and, rather more distantly, Martin Creed’s ball of A4 paper, an unlimited edition of a balled-up piece of paper which, like Chamberlain’s box, usually sits on a plinth. Like all the works here, Chamberlain’s leads in all kinds of formal, historical, metaphorical directions. I think of certain folded steel works by Basque sculptor Jorge Oteiza, I think of some Picasso cubist portraits. I see Chamberlain’s sculpture as a bust on a plinth, a human head with all its sheerings and folds and compressed and hidden interiorities. And last of all I think of leaving the gallery wearing a cardboard box over my head, to protect me from the world.• Crushed, Cast, Constructed: Sculpture by John Chamberlain, Urs Fischer and Charles Ray is at Gagosian Grosvenor Hill, London, until 31 July."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0dcf768a223c91bd85f4e120aae15dbf17b663c5/0_492_3477_2086/master/3477.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fdb19955ec6b00fe94619693695695e2","title":"victoria coronavirus cases spike covid 19 community transmission hotspots melbourne","story":"Premier Daniel Andrews says ‘an army’ of health workers will door-knock in Covid-19 hotspot suburbs in MelbournePremier Daniel Andrews has warned that Victorians can be “certain” there will be “some significant community transmission” of Covid-19 as a result of a spike in virus cases in the past week.On Tuesday Victoria recorded its seventh consecutive day of a double-digit increase in cases, with Andrews confirming 17 new cases had been identified overnight.“One is from hotel quarantine,” he said. “Two are associated with known outbreaks. Three are the subject of routine testing, and 11 are still under investigation. So what we can be certain of is that there will be some significant community transmission within those numbers. As we said on Saturday, and indeed again yesterday, this is still with us. This is not over.”The priority for the state’s health department will be contact tracing to find all of those who may have come into contact with people infected, and where those infected may have contracted the virus. People living in the local council areas most affected are being urged to get tested no matter how mild their symptoms may be.But Andrews acknowledged the uptick in cases was putting pressure on testing services. However, he encouraged Victorians not just to rely on pop-up clinics at shopping centres and to also call their local GP to see if testing was available there. In the meantime, “an army” of public health workers would be door-knocking in suburbs most affected to ensure people were aware of when to get tested and current restrictions.He said while the strategy in Victoria was not to achieve zero cases – that task would be nearly impossible without complete shutdown – there were still more cases than the government would feel comfortable with.“There is an acceptable level of new cases,” he said. “We’re not at that point now. The amount of community transmission that we’ve got is too high. We’ve got a really good handle on where it’s coming from, and it is, principally, families, larger families often, making decisions that are not in accordance with the rules and are not the right thing to do.”Just because restrictions had been lifted to allow up to five visitors to a household, Andrews said this did not mean families should be visiting each other multiple times a week, and they must not visit anyone if they were sick or awaiting the result of a test.Victoria’s deputy chief health officer, Dr Annaliese van Diemen, said there was no evidence Victoria was experiencing a more infectious strain than in other states. “Our overall hospitalisation rates, intensive care unit numbers, and death rates per numbers of cases are one of the lowest in the world, which indicates that we are finding a pretty good proportion of our cases,” she said.“So, we are somewhat in a bubble here, and that’s fantastic, we’re really lucky, but this hasn’t gone away.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6b704141fe27ec6006d6cd593011a4abe9a2745b/0_72_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=f5495dc33cfe042d7a56463c877f251a","title":"charles dickens webchat kathryn hughes","story":"The author of acclaimed books about eminent Victorians will join us on 29 June at 1pm (BST) to discuss the subject of this month’s reading group.

They have announced that they will interrogate the place of portraits and statues, provide money to redress inequalities, and be more inclusive in their practices.It has been a long time coming. The scale of the George Floyd demonstrations, and the toppling of Edward Colston’s statue, alongside public recognition of the disproportionate number of the deaths of south Asian and black people due to Covid-19, have compelled responses from institutions and companies that have had the information available as to their shameful histories for years, but have chosen to ignore it.The Legacies of British Slave-ownership (LBS) database was made public by University College London in 2013, and we have been adding material to it ever since. The database invites the nation to actively engage in reparative history, by which we mean exploring and understanding wrongs of the past in order to address the ways in which injustices may be acknowledged and put right.The initial research concerned the £20m paid in compensation to slave owners when their human property – enslaved men and women across the British Caribbean, Mauritius and the Cape – were emancipated in 1834. Slave owners were paid a proportion of what was deemed to be the market value of these 670,000-plus persons. People who had been bought and sold were now for the last time priced as commodities, and the money went to the owners. They invested their spoils on a whole range of economic, political and cultural activities – from building railways and developing merchant banks to buying artworks, some of which now grace our national collections (helping to refurbish country houses preserved by the National Trust and English Heritage). They also invested their capital, both human and mobile, in the development of the new colonies of white settlement in Australia, New Zealand and Canada. Emancipated men and women, meanwhile, struggled with their varied degrees of freedom.Our subsequent research has focused on the Britons who owned property in land and people in the Caribbean from the mid-18th century to 1833 – opening up the long histories of white families who lived off the exploitation of enslaved people over generations. Our aim has been to provide unequivocal evidence of the ways in which white Britons have benefited from the slavery business, and how practices of racial injustice are historically embedded in British society and culture – how the past lives on in the present.We use the term the “slavery business” to encompass the range of economic activities associated with British slavery. There is confusion in many people’s minds between the slave trade – the capture of men, women and children, mainly in west Africa, their sale to European traders in exchange for guns, textiles etc and their terrible forced crossings of the Atlantic and sale in the New World – and slavery. The latter refers to the condition of being enslaved, regarded as property, with that status passed on generationally. It meant working on plantations, in stock-breeding pens and as urban workers in the Caribbean, producing the sugar which had become part of British life, treasured not least for that iconic English cup of tea.Both the slave trade and slavery were supported by a host of other activities which were crucial to the development of the British economy in the late 18th and early 19th century. Merchants provided the credit lines for both traders and plantation owners the metal industries produced guns, fetters, bolts, nails, and all manner of iron work necessary for the plantation economy the famous engineering firm Boulton and Watt sent some of its earliest steam engines to Jamaica the shipbuilding industry, the dockworkers, the sailors the sugar refining industry the grocers who sold to the consumers – and so it went on.None of this stopped after emancipation, when British capital moved into cotton and fed the massive expansion of slavery in the US south, the extensive use of indentured labour on the tea plantations in India and for sugar in the Caribbean. Contrary to the myth, Britain’s economy became more dependent on slavery after emancipation than it was before.In 1836, he established a leading London merchant house dealing in colonial goods and shipping. His son Benjamin Buck Greene, who spent time in St Kitts and was a successful planter, married the daughter of a prosperous merchant trader in Mauritius and set up a partnership with him. Greene gained recognition as a respectable entrepreneur and philanthropist, and was appointed governor of the Bank of England in 1873. Meanwhile the brewery flourished under the management of Benjamin’s third son Edward Greene, and the Caribbean estates continued to be profitable up to the 1840s.Another son, Charles, was dispatched to St Kitts aged 16 to look after the estates but died three years later having fathered, it was believed, 13 illegitimate children. The novelist Graham Greene, his great-nephew, wrote in his autobiography, A Sort of Life, of encounters with his “coloured Greenes”, one of the many legacies of British slave ownership. His family’s activities as slave owners and merchants, buttressed by inheritance, strategic marriages and partnerships, had secured their fortunes for generations. The “coloured Greenes”, as he called them, alongside the descendants of the enslaved and the indentured on their plantations, bear witness to the unequal legacies of racial capitalism as it was practised across the empire.In the next phase of our work, LBS aims to document the enslaved of the British Caribbean in the last decades before emancipation, tracking connections between named men, women and children, the slaveholders, and the estates and properties between 1817-33. Who knows what connections into the present will emerge from this work, and what demands it will be possible to make on the basis of new evidence?• Catherine Hall is emerita professor of history at UCL, and chair of the Centre for the study of British Slave-ownership"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7cf0e59ec019e41f0787afcbabcff0ffbf9b6fa6/951_260_1456_874/master/1456.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9811e3e9746712168506b5eb6b41b8c6","title":"fringe 1980s communist faction no 10 attitude racism munira mirza","story":"Munira Mirza is in charge of the UK’s inequality commission. But her past comments do not inspire confidenceWith pressure mounting from the global Black Lives Matter protest movement, Boris Johnson has put forward his adviser Munira Mirza to lead a new commission on racial inequality. However, her appointment undermines the commission before it has even started. Mirza has previously expressed scepticism about the existence of institutional racism in the justice system and has suggested that anti-racist “lobbyists and activists” have corroded public trust. She has also suggested that Britain does not have a “serious problem” with racism. This comes as no surprise: Mirza has long been associated with Spiked, an online magazine increasingly well known for its contrarian takes on current events and for its writers popping up in various places across the media landscape with rightwing views.Infamous for its right-libertarian and iconoclastic style, Spiked has gained notoriety for arguing against numerous progressive positions, but using a rhetorical style indebted to its earlier incarnation as a Trotskyist group in the 1980s-90s, the Revolutionary Communist Party (RCP). With a combative tone, the magazine’s writers have routinely sought to dismiss many political actions as not dealing with the “real” issues and put forward their own solutions, which often correlate with a populist right position. Previously dismissed as a fringe group on the outer limits of political discourse, more recently Spiked has become an influential force in shifting the Overton window to the right in the UK.To understand how it has come to occupy this space and its rhetorical style, particularly concerning issues of race and racism, it is worth looking at the long road from the RCP to Spiked, via the journal Living Marxism (later titled LM). The RCP began in 1977 under the leadership of the sociologist Frank Furedi, and presented itself as the true vanguard of the British working class. The party made a name for itself for taking positions that rankled with others on the left. Among theses were enthusiastic support for the armed struggle in Northern Ireland and calling for a national ballot during the 1984-5 miners’ strike. Party members also criticised gay activists and were accused of undermining the message of safe sex during the HIVAids crisis.At the end of the cold war, the RCP pronounced that class-based politics was a dead end, with ideas now being the key battleground. The party eventually dissolved in 1997, which left Living Marxism as the primary vehicle for its former cadre. It acted as a halfway house for former leftwing activists now increasingly interested in libertarianism. The journal itself was wound up in 2000 after losing a libel case against ITN over claims made about reporting during the Balkan wars in the 1990s.Its successor was Spiked, under the helm of the former LM editor Mick Hume and involving many prominent RCP members. At the same time, many of the same members were involved in establishing the thinktank the Institute of Ideas, led by Claire Fox, a former RCP member and most recently an MEP for the Brexit party. This is where Mirza entered the orbit of Spiked and its various offshoots, writing semi-regular pieces for the magazine since 2001.The crossover of many of these iniduals between the journal, the website, the thinktank and other endeavours has been referred to as the LM network. It has gained attention not just because many of its members occupy a significant media and political profile, but also for the trajectory of its cohort from the far left to the hard right. While the story of former leftwingers becoming rightwingers is not new, the fact that the leadership of the RCP seemed to transition en masse makes it a compelling story. Some commentators have suggested that this is a coordinated case of entryism (although the end goal of this is unclear). But it is more likely that the politics and activities of the network have a certain appeal (and notoriety), which has seen a number of former members be willing to shift with the changing agenda, from revolutionary communism to a mixture of contrarianism and right libertarianism. In many ways, this owes something to the Leninism of the former RCP and an ideological coherence, even in the absence of the vanguard of the party.In recent years, Spiked has been at the forefront of perpetuating the idea of the free-speech “crisis” on university campuses and elsewhere. Some at the magazine also disagree with laws against racial discrimination (particularly against racist speech) and with the Equality and Human Rights Commission, viewing both as overreach by the state into people’s lives. This approach to racism, free speech and the state are intertwined, and can be traced back to the days of the RCP.Throughout the 1980s, some at the magazine opposed the “no platforming” of fascists and racists, stemming from an objection to state bans and censorship. Furthermore, use of racial discrimination legislation was seen as a call for state intervention in working-class and migrant communities. In reality, this meant that while the RCP (and its front, Workers Against Racism, or WAR) were involved in a number of anti-racist campaigns, it denigrated the work being done by other activist groups. One of the constant tropes of the RCPWAR was to argue that while the rest of the left concentrated their efforts in one area, they really should be concentrating in another (which coincidentally was where the RCP dedicated their attention). This notion that everybody else is wrong and just tilting at windmills persists in the writings of Spiked today.Actions against non-state racism in the 1990s, such as those by anti-fascists against the British National party, were often dismissed or framed as attacks on the legitimate concerns of the (white) British working class. The end point of this rhetorical stance has seen a writer in Spiked dismiss the threat of the far right, suggesting that the BNP could appear “moderate” and “level-headed” when compared with the anti-fascist left and the magazine publish an article titled The Myth of Bigoted Britain. Simultaneously, while its predecessor had abandoned class politics in favour of ideas in the 1990s, Spiked has also criticised the rise of identity politics as pure ideology and an attempt to ide the working class.These preoccupations have proven to be well suited to a moment in which the right has reduced racism to a component of a “culture war” being waged by the “woke” left. Mirza’s previous comments on Spiked about institutional racism, ersity and multiculturalism reveal the mindset in which this new proposed commission on racial inequalities has been cast. They also reveal how the fixations of a contrarian, right-leaning, libertarian website, established by disillusioned leftists, has become part of the mainstream discourse in the UK. • Evan Smith is a research fellow in history at Flinders University in Adelaide, Australia.

But a deadly clash with his most powerful neighbour shows his rhetoric has limitsThe Chinese assault on Indian troops near the Galwan Valley, along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) that serves as an unofficial international frontier between the two countries, is, for India’s political elite, a reminder of an awkward reality. India’s control over its border with China is contingent on China’s geopolitical priorities, not India’s own military capacity. This has been true for more than half a century. In 1962, 15 years into India’s life as an independent nation, a dispute over Aksai Chin, the north-eastern “ear” of Kashmir, led to a short war with Mao Zedong’s China and a humiliating defeat for India. China’s military edge along this huge disputed frontier has kept successive Indian governments on tenterhooks ever since.Dealt a poor hand, India has played it reasonably well. The 20 military casualties in the recent violence is its largest death toll in relation to China since 1967. Keeping the peace has involved some imaginative diplomacy. After a border confrontation in Arunachal Pradesh in 1986, India’s then prime minister, Rajiv Gandhi, visited China in 1988 to thaw out a relationship that had been in deep freeze since the 1962 war. His visit led to a peace agreement signed in 1993 by his successor, Narasimha Rao, which made the LAC the basis for a stable and relatively peaceful status quo.In the 30 years since Gandhi’s visit, the asymmetry between the two countries has grown. China is now an economic superpower that has completely overhauled and modernised its military since Xi Jinping became the general secretary of the Chinese Communist party in 2012. Despite India’s economic progress since it liberalised its economy in the early 90s, the gap between it and China in terms of per capita income, infrastructure, both military and civil, and science and technology has a grown at a rate that embarrasses India’s political elite and demoralises an otherwise bullishly nationalist middle class.Narendra Modi came to power promising to abandon India’s posture of military restraint in the face of border violations by its neighbours. This was mainly directed at Pakistan but he also indicated that India would take a harder line with Chinese expansionism. But like all Indian heads of government, Modi was acutely aware of the need to manage relations with China: Xi was favoured with a state visit in the first year of Modi’s prime ministership. Xi arrived but, in a striking example of the brutal realpolitik that has characterised his time at the top, his visit to India was shadowed by a Chinese military incursion into Ladakh. It was as if Xi was personally putting Modi on notice.Since then Modi has had some political success in selling himself as a proactive  of India’s borders, particularly in relation to Pakistan. India’s “surgical strikes” in 2016 in response to Pakistan-sponsored terrorism in Kashmir burnished the prime minister’s reputation for breaking with a timorous past even if the military damage done by these strikes was disputed. The air strikes on Balakot in 2019 in retaliation for a suicide bombing that killed Indian soldiers in Kashmir helped Modi win an absolute majority in last year’s general election. Despite the air strikes reportedly missing their targets and India having a fighter plane shot down, Modi’s willingness to take on a nuclear-armed country won him political acclaim at home.This muscular response wasn’t confined to Pakistan. In June 2017, Indian troops entered territory disputed by China and Bhutan to prevent Chinese soldiers from building a road there. India claimed locus standi as a treaty ally of Bhutan and the confrontation ended in August when both sides withdrew. Encouraged, perhaps, by the success of the Doklam intervention, India’s home minister, Amit Shah, declared in parliament in December that Ladakh, one of the two centrally administered union territories carved out of the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir, would be an integral part of India. He clarified that Ladakh would include Chinese-controlled Aksai Chin, the territory over which the catastrophic 1962 war was fought. “We will,” declared the home minister repeatedly in the course of his speech, “give our lives for it.”On Wednesday, the Indian government announced that several of its soldiers had, in fact, given their lives in a horrific border confrontation. After weeks of denying reports that the Chinese military had encroached on Indian-controlled territory in Ladakh, the government admitted that 20 soldiers, including a colonel, had been killed. The grotesque footnote to this news was that this death toll had been achieved without a shot fired in anger. Indian troops had tried to monitor a mutually agreed withdrawal without provoking a shooting war. Then, in unexplained circumstances, they had been outnumbered and bludgeoned to death by Chinese soldiers armed with clubs wrapped in barbed wire.The prime minister broke his silence on the stand-off by making a televised speech where, without mentioning China once, he said that India’s soldiers hadn’t been martyred in vain. He tried to balance India’s traditional wariness about escalating a no-win conflict against a more powerful enemy with his need to assuage the outrage of his domestic audience, accustomed as it was to his stance about aggressively defending “Mother India”.He said that India sought peace but if provoked was capable of delivering an appropriate reply. Invoking India’s essentially peaceful nature was, perhaps, the pragmatic path, but coming in the wake of the murderous Chinese buffeting that had left a score of Indian soldiers dead, it was hard, even for an orator such as Modi, to argue that suing for peace was a “befitting” response. Confronted with the unchanging reality of China’s massive military superiority, India’s prime minister had run out of rhetorical road.Modi needs to choose. He can either talk to China as Gandhi and Rao once did, to negotiate a new mechanism for sorting out border disputes or he can explicitly commit India to an American-led alliance designed to contain China. Neither will be easy. A bullying China led by Xi might want unsettled borders to keep India off balance. An inward-looking US might not be a reliable ally when push comes to shove in the Himalayas. But these are, at least, real policy choices swearing to defend India’s territorial integrity against an enemy that you dare not name, or denying that the Chinese encroachment happened at all (as Modi recently did), are not.• Mukul Kesavan is an essayist and author who teaches history at Jamia Millia Islamia university in Delhi"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e4d999f9ae90acc1d82b96135a66594d6d1f8524/71_93_3573_2144/master/3573.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6ec5f0443e99b5757ebe4448f2fde721","title":"museums galleries and cinemas to reopen in england from 4 july","story":"Boris Johnson to announce further easing of coronavirus lockdown measures on TuesdayMuseums, galleries and cinemas will be allowed to reopen from 4 July, alongside pubs, restaurants and hairdressers, Boris Johnson will announce on Tuesday in a decisive but potentially risky easing of lockdown measures in England.Two days later, millions of people with underlying health issues will be permitted to leave their homes and mix with groups for the first time in three months, it was announced on Monday.But as Downing Street hailed the “opening up”, doctors, unions and charities voiced concerns over the shift away from lockdown and the planned halving of the 2-metre distancing rule that has been in place since March. The change has been billed by Downing Street as ultimately a political decision based on balancing health concerns and economic wellbeing.Unions representing shop and hospitality staff complained of a lack of consultation by the government over the reduced distance rule, set to be formally announced by Johnson in the Commons on Tuesday. All the changes apply to England only, and are dependent on continued lower infection rates.On the gradual pull-back of shielding rules, which start on 6 July and by August will see all 2.2 million people classified as “clinically extremely vulnerable” allowed to return to work, charities and the Royal College of Physicians said those affected would be anxious about their safety.The much-anticipated cut in the minimum physical distancing measure from 2 metres to 1 metre was set to be formally approved by the government’s Covid-19 strategy committee, chaired by Johnson, on Monday evening. It was then due to be rubber-stamped by cabinet on Tuesday, and presented to the Commons.The government is also set to confirm 4 July as the date for the reopening of pubs, cafe and restaurants, as well as cinemas, museums and galleries, expected to involve measures such as one-way systems and pre-booked tickets to limit numbers.Later this week, ministers will publish a bill setting out ways it can help businesses remain viable. This will focus on ideas like making it easier for them to expand into outdoor seating, and ease restrictions on selling food and drink to take away.But ahead of the change, unions said they still had deep concerns about the downgrading of the 2-metre rule, with one senior official describing it as a “nightmare” for workers and customers.Usdaw, which represents shop staff, said changing the rule would be confusing and expensive, considering the amount of signage and plastic screens that have been invested in to keep people safe at 2 metres.Doug Russell, health and safety officer for Usdaw, said: “A lot of hard work has gone into figuring out how you could get the message across for 2 metres and to be honest it’s not perfect but a sudden change of direction through the process would be a nightmare.“Already one of the key triggers of arguments and fights is over physical separation, if you get a situation where half the population thinks social distancing is over, and the other half are very scared about getting too close, then this could lead to problems.”Ian Hodson, national president of the Bakers, Food and Allied Workers Union, said: “This potential change feels sudden and trade unions haven’t been consulted and there’s a huge risk to working people. There should be a discussion about this, and not just among the backbenches of the Conservative party.”The Unite union, meanwhile, said downgrading from 2 metres risked causing more outbreaks of coronavirus within the meat processing sector, which has already been hit.While Sir Patrick Vallance, the government’s chief scientific adviser, and Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer for England, would attend the Covid committee to approve the distance change, Johnson’s spokesman said it was ultimately up to the government. “It’s for the committee to determine the next steps,” he said. “It’s obviously for ministers to take policy decision, as has always been the case.”Under plans announced by Matt Hancock, the health secretary, from 6 July, those in England ordered to shield due to medical vulnerabilities can gather outdoors with up to six people, and form a “bubble” with another household.Government support for the 2.2m who are shielding will continue to the end of July. After that point, people in the group will be able to return to their jobs if their workplace is considered “Covid-secure”.Hancock thanked those who have been shielding since the lockdown began. “I know this has been incredibly tough. Shielding has involved not leaving your house for months, not seeing people you care about, not being able to wander to the park for some fresh air, or even pop to the shops for something you need. This sacrifice has been for a purpose, and I want to thank every single one of you,” he told the Downing Street press briefing.The Royal College of Physicians (RCP), which represents many of the consultants who look after the most vulnerable, said the announcement would be met with mixed emotions.“The past few weeks and months have been challenging and we know that many patients will be unsure about what lies ahead,” said Prof Donal O’Donoghue, the RCP registrar.“It is crucial that the government builds trust by regularly communicating and engaging with those who have been shielding up to now. Patients are likely to have many questions and we need to ensure that frontline NHS staff are equipped with the detailed scientific evidence base to be able to support patients to make their shared decisions based on inidual assessments of risk and their personal priorities.”Chris Askew, chief executive officer at Diabetes UK, said: “The government has again given little to no acknowledgement of the impact that these changes will have on thousands of people living with conditions such as diabetes, or detailed the support and protections they can expect. By allowing lockdown to continue to ease without specific and enforceable safeguards in place, they are allowing people with diabetes to fall through the cracks.“Thousands of people with diabetes are telling us that social distancing at work is not being made possible, and that employers’ risk assessments are failing to protect them. Without more robust guidance, employers will continue to decide their own ‘acceptable risk’ with no safeguards for inidual staff, or consequences for non-compliance.”A No 10 source said: “We are only able to move forward this week because the vast majority of people have taken steps to control the virus. But the more we open up, the more important it is that everyone follows the social distancing guidelines. We will not hesitate to reverse these steps if it is necessary to stop the virus running out of control.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0e6044ab6ff58358bb7d40640f76b32f2498d9c0/0_120_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=aba6c70c4b160f05c35c3528dfca2e01","title":"three ways for uk schools to improve their race relations now","story":"Instead of empty slogans, schools should treat racism like safeguarding and health and safety and be on high alert.

When schools do this, Kriel says, they unwittingly reveal, however well meaning they are, that they may not be listening, running the danger of becoming what Kriel calls “laminated, not living practice” for the purpose of ticking a box. A statement is fine as long as concrete measures follow. Instead of making megaphone announcements saying racism is wrong, headteachers should reflect on how their school structures may have allowed inbuilt institutional racism to arise. Jeffrey Boakye, a teacher and author, says school leaders should treat racism like safeguarding or health and safety. “Who is trained to tackle it? What precautions have been put in place? Are you ready to accept that your school is always unsafe?”For Kriel, schools must first work on their ethos. A good place to start is in shifting from an autocratic style of leadership that produces change through fear to a collaborative model enabling open and difficult conversations about race and unconscious bias. Without this, a culture of silence pervades in which important discussions about racial inequality and discrimination are shut down.Emmanuel Awoyelu, a teacher and Senco at a special school, New Rush Hall in Ilford, east London, says schools must create safe spaces for teachers and pupils to explore their experiences of racial inequality. For students, it can look like afternoon “golden time”, where children discuss their experiences in small groups. In secondaries, pupils can meet during break or lunch to talk through their experiences.And for teachers, are clear policies in place for them to report instances of racial discrimination without fear of repercussion?  “Schools must emphasise the need for staff and governors to be reflective of prejudice and stereotypes they have,” says Awoyelu. Doing something once a year won’t cut it either. As the Runnymede Trust’s latest report on Race and Racism in English Secondary Schools argues, schools must embed racial literacy for all.Allana Gay, headteacher of Vita et Pax preparatory school in north London and founding member of the BAMEed Network, says school leaders should question the alienating nature of the British value of “tolerance” in their school. Who wants to be tolerated, rather than accepted and understood? Tolerance suggests an agreement to let sleeping dogs lie. Acceptance, Gay says, shows that “I recognise your differences and appreciate you.”But what of schools that largely have white pupils? If scenes of far-right rioters in London have taught us anything, it is that these settings are where values of ersity and inclusion are most needed. Schools can reflect principles of acceptance and openness to dialogue in building relationships of exchange and collaboration with schools made up of very different communities.Dr Lorna Cork, a leadership consultant, says change can only be sustainable when school leaders are willing to question every stage of their recruitment processes, from what is written in the advert, to where those ads are placed. This applies to the recruitment of teachers, senior leaders and governors.But for Cork, once schools hire black and minority ethnic teachers, they must ask themselves how they are supporting and retaining them. This is not to ask for special treatment, she says. Rather, it is that black teachers want to be given the same support their white counterparts have, whether that be with behaviour management as newly qualified teachers, or mentorship and coaching for progression. The Runnymede report found BAME teachers tended to be more isolated and lacking in support from colleagues.Schools are often full of excuses as to why their curriculum is not more reflective of erse communities. Nick Dennis, director of studies at an independent school in Hertfordshire, says, however, that the capacity to broaden the curriculum has always been there. What is needed is for teachers to “go beyond what is to hand”. Schools should link up with innovative university departments, academics and research students keen on demonstrating a wider social impact, he says.Sonia Thompson, headteacher of St Matthew’s Church of England primary school in Birmingham, says it is normal for her school to reflect the ‘‘full ersity of human histories”, as described by the Royal Historical Society in 2018. A head for 10 years, she says BAME pupils, in particular, are sometimes considered “empty vessels” for their teachers to fill up. Schools often undervalue such children and inhibit what they are able to display intellectually, she says, but all children are “funds of knowledge who bring a lot to the table”. Thompson says schools can begin with a careful audit of their curriculum before harnessing the “rich repository children and their parents bring”. A strong believer of a “knowledge rich curriculum”, she says what is considered the best knowledge is itself subjective, and schools must question this.In her school, which serves a large Somali community, reception children begin with a unit on family histories entitled “our lives, our families”, as part of what the head called “sharing literacy lives”. From here, they explore the history of traditional Somali food and clothing. Black and Muslim inventors, philosophers and leaders are studied and celebrated so pupils view them as change-makers in their own right.Headteachers have the power to create open environments where BAME staff can raise issues of discrimination and racial inequality without being deemed troublesome. Everyone needs to be prepared to feel uncomfortable and resolve to move past this. If your school is in a largely white area, recognise that issues of race are as much your concern as colleagues in metropolitan hubs. See it as your business to teach inclusivity and acceptance.Recruit more BAME teachers. Offer them the early career support often lacking, so the profession can retain them. Recognise their talents by promoting them into leadership positions. Be prepared to view BAME families not as problems to be solved, but partners in the communities you serve. Diversify the curriculum. In short, make space."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fb99b26bf18f30041654a6bc4e3c66d7757ef52d/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=959633dc753902cca1aafa2a7f815521","title":"the science of shorts how to pull off this summers toughest style","story":"It’s boom time for short trousers – just make sure you swerve the ‘Boris Johnson out for a jog’ look This week’s dress code can be summarised in one word: shorts. There is a heatwave incoming, for a start. Plus, this weekend would have been Glastonbury, so the spirit of imaginary Worthy Farm is in the air, conjuring up the ghosts of Kate Moss and Alexa Chung in hot pants and wellies.Look around you. It is boom time for shorts: perfect with trainers when you are walking or cycling rather than taking public transport ideal for impromptu frisbee games. Also, the are-they-office-appropriate problem is, well, not an problem. (Marks \u0026amp Spencer reported that nine out of the bestselling menswear items in the first days after it reopened were shorts.)The past three months have relaxed our standards of wardrobe formality. Not getting dressed up for work events, weddings or parties has dialled down our wardrobes to the point where what used to look scruffy now looks acceptable – and what once looked like a baseline level of public-facing polish reads as if you have made a tremendous effort. Something has shifted, also, for those who have tended not to be “brave” enough to wear shorts. The past three months has pushed us outside our comfort zone in so many ways. Getting hung up about whether other people are looking at your knees? Maybe we can leave that one in the old normal.The shorts vibe of 2020 is one part Paul Mescal owning lockdown London in his O’Neills Gaelic football shorts and one part Carrie Bradshaw tapping at her laptop on a hot Manhattan night in a stretchy tank top and a pair of boyish athletic shorts. (Carrie Bradshaw at her laptop is a bluechip working-from-home icon, of course.) The loose, boxer-style shorts Rachel Green wore to hang out at home with Monica in Friends two decades ago are now turning up on Instagram: see Teen Vogue’s fashion editor, Michelle Li, who has been chronicling her at-home athleisure during quarantine in New York.Leggings were ideal when we wore our athleisure in the sleek, minimal aesthetic of a yoga studio, but when your exercise class is an Instagram Live in the kitchen or tricep dips on a park bench, the lo-fi, games-kit mood of what are essentially PE shorts hits the spot. Cut-off denim Daisy Dukes are a touch too poseurish for this moment. Culottes, which are basically shorts pretending to be midi skirts, are a little unnecessarily fiddly and formal. Cycling shorts are still going strong, buoyed by Lizzo and their usefulness when riding a bike, and long, tailored Bermuda shorts would probably have been more of a hit had this summer involved more urban commuting. There is a niche revival for the buttock-hugging micro boxer short in its 70s-retro mode – think Barbra Streisand in the 1979 film The Main Event – but the loose, athletic style short is where it’s at.\u2028Do not be fooled by the air of pull-on ease, however, because this is not a straightforward look to pull off. Too saggy and scruffy and you inch perilously close to “Boris Johnson out for a jog”. You need a wide waistband and enough fabric to give a standalone, slightly A-line silhouette – not a million miles from the paper-bag waist silhouette, in fashion terms. You need to accessorise, to make the point that this is fashion. (A bumbag will do the trick nicely.)

At age 12 it was becoming clear my survival would depend on seeing more films. I tried to do my own “ni”, but Chris noticed my pitch was off. “It’s from Monty Python,” he said.I went home and looked into this man, who turned out to be six men: Michael Palin, John Cleese, Graham Chapman, Eric Idle, Terry Jones and Terry Gilliam. My mum already owned one of their films on VHS, Monty Python and the Holy Grail – which I’d ignored, obviously, because it was from the past. The film was already 30 years old, but even in 2006 I’d never seen anything as daft as this one. Nothing could top that opening image of King Arthur galloping through a damp field on foot, his squire in tow, knocking two halves of a coconut together in lieu of a horse.The Holy Grail is a parody of Arthurian legend in the form of a narrative sketch show, where each episode is twisted into increasingly absurdist situations. If you haven’t seen it, someone has probably quoted it at you: the Black Knight who won’t surrender a duel after losing all his limbs (“’Tis but a scratch”) the taunting Frenchman (“Your mother was a hamster”) the Knights Who Say Ni (“Ni”) – and yes, I was one of those people.Before Monty Python, I’d been raised on children’s franchises by Spielberg, Disney and Pixar. Films were supposed to be warm and comfy experiences designed to transport you to another world. But while The Holy Grail appears to offer a twee little universe of its own, with its castles and swords, there’s an occasional lurch as the fourth wall caves in, and the film seems to implode in service of one gag. My favourite of these was when Arthur and his knights run away from the “Black Beast of Aaaarrgggh!” in an animated sequence that ends with a cutaway to the film’s animator dying of a heart attack.I wasn’t keen to rewatch The Holy Grail for this article, though I assume returning to anything I loved more than about four years ago will be painful, as if I’m travelling back in time to meet my younger self, only to realise he’s a moron, like Biff in Back to the Future II. But The Holy Grail is still infectious. There’s a breeziness to everyone’s performances. Although Eric Idle and John Cleese were funniest to me as a kid, I can appreciate the whole team now: none of it works without Graham Chapman as Arthur the straight man. And it could be a side effect of two months indoors, but I lost it when Terry Jones thrust his hands into a puddle of mud, yelling, “I’ve found some lovely filth!”Yes, some of the sketches are tighter than others, and the whimsy levels will test the patience of hard-hearted adults by the time we meet Tim the Enchanter. I’d forgotten it doesn’t really have an ending, either. Arthur is about to besiege a castle when modern-day police arrive on set and arrest the whole cast – and the credits roll. The scene almost shocked me as a kid. Films were really allowed to just stop like that?For all this, it doesn’t feel too throwaway the world has a sense of depth, despite the low budget. It’s validating to see critics discuss how great the film looks today, unironically. As director Terry Gilliam once said: “Add a little smoke and filth to a scene and it starts to look more artistic.” (This was back when his interviews were fun.)Though I arrived late, The Holy Grail seemed to find me at the right moment. It certainly complemented the other aesthetic choices I was making at the time – namely Runescape and Warhammer models. I like to think The Holy Grail would be my favourite regardless of the year, though, even if I’d been born a smartphone child of 2020, with some innate fluency in absurdist internet memes. It may seem quaint nowadays, but it still feels subversive. Maybe 12-year-old Monty Python fans do still exist somewhere, quoting Roger the Shrubber, and laughing nasally. I don’t see why they shouldn’t."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d5d525ea13d4b9ab96ce40360b353aaa80dc44c/0_982_5098_3059/master/5098.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=20396cacfd01d86f79ca098fe6c684ee","title":"nigel slater recipe bruschetta tomatoes and herb cheese","story":"A crisp and crunchy, soft and succulent swift little treat for midweekA substantial “something on toast”, with thick-cut sourdough or ciabatta under a mound of herb-flecked cream cheese and grilled tomatoes.Finely chop enough parsley to give you 2 heaped tbsp, then do the same with basil, and then mix them together and put them in a bowl.Add 200g of mascarpone to the herbs, then stir in 2 tbsp of white wine vinegar and 1 tsp of capers, and set aside.

Overthinking pasta is never a good idea, so channel your inner nonna by mastering the dough and regional sauces with those who’ve spent a lifetime making them: the Pasta Grannies.

A Cypriot-inspired breakfast spread is the ultimate in holiday vibes: olives, pickles (green peppers, caper leaves, beetroot), hummus, feta roasted with olive oil, lemon and oregano, tomato and radishes tossed with sliced onion, red-wine vinegar, pomegranate seeds, extra-virgin olive oil, Greek basil and parsley, eggs scrambled into slow-cooked tomatoes (strapatsada), koulouri bread or pitta, and the usual breakfast suspects (Greek yoghurt, honey, fruit).Sambals sit front and centre of Indonesian meals and are a good starting point for your south-east Asian travels.

Here, three stars of social share what they’ve learnedMost businesses these days will have some form of social media presence, but many may not be making the most of the opportunities it provides. Not only does it open up a huge potential customer base – half the world’s population is now on social media – it also gives companies the perfect opportunity to build and retain loyalty among existing customers.Like all aspects of technology, social media is constantly evolving. So while a small business may have set up a Facebook or a Twitter account a few years back and thought that was a case of “job done”, new social media platforms such as TiKTok have been developed since then, while Instagram and YouTube have become vital parts of a holistic social media ecosystem.\u0026nbspBeyond the platforms themselves, trends have also changed in terms of what users want, how they interact with brands and what’s important to them. Customers have now become fans, emotional ties to brands are a thing and thought-leadership can make you an influencer. Content is still king, and shareability is vital.\u0026nbspBut as well as all this modern stuff – the basics are still important too.\u0026nbsp“On the high street you wouldn’t have a shopfront with a broken window, peeling paint, rubbish everywhere and goods randomly thrown on displays, and expect to thrive,” says PR and social media expert Mike Crutchley.As someone who helps businesses improve and overhaul their social media strategies, he says first impressions count.\u0026nbsp“Social media channels must be up to date with everything from posts to contact details and opening hours,” he says. “High-quality images and videos, as well as good grammar and spelling are as vital as creating engaging posts.”The tools that allow businesses to make this happen have never been more accessible, and there is now an opportunity to try some of them out free of charge. Customers of the website builder GoDaddy are currently receiving a complimentary 90-day premium subscription to the mobile app Over, which gives them access to simple templates for creating sleek and effective social media content.Sometimes the things that work best on social media are the simplest. You can have all the metrics and dashboards in the world, but if people don’t engage and share your original posts then you’re missing a huge potential source of customers.\u0026nbspWhen Dutch-born Londoner Annemarie Plas saw people in countries throughout Europe clapping for their healthcare workers she was inspired to help set up something similar in her adopted home, and so created clapforourcarers with GoDaddy.Scaling up quickly could well have proved a challenge, but with the astute use of social media things have gone from strength to strength.\u0026nbsp“I just put together a small image and posted it on my socials such as Instagram, LinkedIn, Facebook and Twitter, and sent it to all my UK friends by WhatsApp, I also made a small website and an Insta page,” says Plas.\u0026nbspHer efforts to spread the word were given a huge boost when her campaign was picked up by influencers such as the Beckhams and the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, who shared it to their followers.\u0026nbspThe first clap happened on Thursday 26 March at 8pm and became a weekly event, being covered by the national media and circulated widely on social media too, right up to the final clap on 28 May.Although Plas has a background working for media agencies, she had neither the time nor staff support that other organisations might be able to draw upon. So she decided to keep things simple and made shareability a big part of her strategy.\u0026nbsp“I understood the importance of having simple and engaging messaging. I used a hashtag and made the image easy to share on any social channels.”Her simple and consistent messaging has resulted in the #clapforourcarers hashtag being shared more than 139,000 times on Instagram alone.\u0026nbsp“Some influencers get a bad reputation,” says Masha Zvereva, founder of Coding Blonde. She set up her blog back in 2015, when she was trying to learn some coding skills to make her more employable. She originally registered it with GoDaddy, which she then also used as a hosting provider.Through that blog, as well as Instagram and YouTube, Zvereva has amassed a loyal following and is now regarded as an influencer in the field of women in tech, entrepreneurship and personal growth.\u0026nbsp“Influencers can be perceived as fake, superficial, salesy etc, but what people don’t see is the hard work that goes behind being able to make a living off of this business model and growing your business,” she says.Quality content is paramount according to Zvereva. Whether you’re filming a video for YouTube or writing a thought leadership piece, it has to add value beyond simply advertising your skills to the wider world.\u0026nbsp“Anyone can become an influencer if they want to, but I’d recommend approaching it from the standpoint of adding value to an audience,” she says.\u0026nbsp“What’s the purpose behind your blog? How will you be impacting people’s lives and who is your target audience? And finally, why should it be you?”Many people might still associate social media in a business context purely with selling, but its importance when it comes to building a brand can’t be overstated.\u0026nbspThis is something Zaffrin and Brian O’Sullivan, co-founders of the vegan skincare company Five Dot Botanics set out to do well before their company launched.Establishing it on Instagram even before they had products to sell, they were able to develop a loyal audience.\u0026nbsp“Social media has allowed small brands like mine to build a brand. Historically it would not have been possible to launch a beauty brand without millions of pounds to acquire customers through marketing,” says Zaffrin.\u0026nbspBefore setting up those social channels though, their first move was to register a domain name and get a URL through GoDaddy. Then it was time to get the ball rolling with social media.\u0026nbspThe stories the O’Sullivans shared weren’t all about success, but about the challenges they were facing. This honesty helped create a situation where people were rooting for them. The couple were also able to get 600 people signed up to their newsletter email list so there was already an eager customer base waiting for when the products were ready.Once the social channels were up and running, the O’Sullivans set up an internet landing page using GoDaddy’s services – and they were in business.Social continues to be at the heart of their marketing. As well as using Instagram for brand-building, Zaffrin posts to Pinterest and Facebook, although she says the latter works best for business if you’re willing to put money behind it – paying for targeted ads, for example. Otherwise the other platforms can be effective without budget, simply by skilful use.

It came with a five-year guarantee. Recently, a problem arose with the picture – horizontal lines appeared on the screen, which subsequently got worse.I called customer service which asked for pictures by email. I supplied these but received no reply. When I called again, I was told the TV would be collected and inspected at the workshop. Now I’ve been told this won’t be happening as its engineer had examined my photos and concluded that the lines were caused by me damaging the screen.I have suggested that John Lewis has the decency to inspect the TV before accusing me of causing the damage, but this has been refused. What has happened to John Lewis that its staff are behaving like this?A quick look online suggests that banding, as it is called, is mostly caused by loose connections at the back of the set.Sadly, we are no longer surprised by stories like this.

More ambitious performers might aim for an EGOT (Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, Tony). Bur, for the electronic duo 100 Gecs, only a PENOGT will suffice. “Pulitzer, Emmy, Nobel prize, Oscar, Grammy, Tony,” singer-instrumentalist Laura Les explains over video call. I haven’t heard that acronym before, I say. “We coined it, and it’s testament to our own ambition: there isn’t even a word for the shit we want.”To those familiar with 100 Gecs, these aspirations might sound a tad inflated some feel that the duo’s futuristic hyper-pop is too lo-fi, too entrenched in internet culture and unloved genres of the 90s and 00s (think chiptune, Nintendocore, German techno embarrassment Scooter), to be conceived of as anything but niche – so much so that the pair were accused, particularly at the start of their career, of being deliberately ironic, a postmodern inside gag. “It’s not a joke,” the band’s other half, producer Dylan Brady, reaffirms.In fact, 100 Gecs’s uniquely skewed vision and gonzo sound has become increasingly influential. The uniquely isive pair were the biggest buzz band of 2019. Their distinctive, energy drink-fuelled mashup of dubstep, ska, trance, forgotten Myspace synthcore and heavily distorted Auto-Tuned vocals on last year’s confusingly titled debut album 1000 Gecs (the follow-up to 2016’s self-titled, self-released EP) took the group to the top of many end-of-year lists. To the New York Times it was consistently “exhilarating”, while Dazed likened entering “their exaggerated realm” to “taking an acid bath at Tom \u0026amp Jerry’s”. Vice named it its album of the year, concluding that “you just have to turn yourself over to it and embrace the chaos”.After a few hyped gigs and shows held on the popular online game Minecraft – according to Les, you create a 20 minute-long file of your music and “they stream it while you fuck around in Minecraft” – Gecs were ready to fully take their digital art project into the physical realm in 2020. Alongside the late-spring release of their remix album, 1000 Gecs and the Tree of Clues, the band were supposed to play at Coachella, where this interview was going to take place. Instead, we speak on a split-screen video, with both members sat amid recording equipment, homemade artwork and cans of Red Bull.The pair, now in their mid-20s, grew up in neighbouring suburban towns just outside of St Louis. The sounds of their teenage years are in the DNA of Gecs: Brady loved ambient music such as Burial and the Warped Tour metalcore likes of Attack Attack! and I Set My Friends on Fire, while Les listened to dubstep and her dad’s classic rock. That’s all present in the pounding 90s trance of xXXi_wud_nvrstop_üXXx (the title a typical nod to the garbled early-internet aesthetic). It is especially evident on the ludicrous Stupid Horse, which morphs from ska to school-disco silliness to a ripping guitar solo. Tellingly, Les only learned guitar as a teenager so she could deconstruct other people’s songs before re-animating them into bold new shapes. They originally met at a house party in 2012, but a jealous Les left after hearing a song Brady had made with someone else. Over the following years, Les moved to Chicago and Brady to LA, but they bonded tightly from a distance, sharing music and dabbling in creating together. In 2019 they decided to make a full-length record under the Gecs name.Les, who still lives in Chicago with her husband, has spent lockdown watching The Sopranos for the first time, and Brady is apartment-bound in LA with his girlfriend. “I’ve been whittling,” he says. “I made my girlfriend a strawberry and a jalapeño pepper.” They’ve found other ways to boost their profile during lockdown, hosting a charity Minecraft festival called Square Garden, the same as their previous Minecraft shows but with a blocky digital venue for players to jump around in. Many contributors to the remix album showed up, including Charli XCX, whose recent album featured two raved-about tracks that were produced by Brady. The nature of the mashup of sounds has meant the past year has consisted of critics and fans dissecting their project. “It’s so flattering, I think, that people would even care enough to go deep into it,” says Les. But has the flipside meant people have got them wrong? “The ironic thing is the biggest non-true thing,” Brady pipes up. Les agrees: “We’re not doing this to be ironic. The opposite resonates as really true. There are people who say: ‘They’re just expressing a love for music, all sorts of different kinds.’”If 1000 Gecs was the logical conclusion of the late-2010s’ post-genre experimentalism, the remix album is that worldview taken to its absurdist extreme. It is the sound of every musician in your iTunes forced to work together. Or an already-boiling circuit board fizzing and snapping as it sets itself alight. They decided to make it after releasing stems to their songs for fans to remix, and included some of those contributions on the album Brady in particular loved seeing his music “shredded and sucked into the internet in a crazy way”.So 1000 Gecs and the Tree of Clues was very much made in this spirit of collaboration. Highlights are the deadpan presence of Charli XCX on Ringtone and a joyous vocal introduction to Hand Crushed By a Mallet by Patrick Stump of emo greats Fall Out Boy (“That one was shocking, I thought there was no way he’d do it … Absolute madman,” says Brady).What does the remix album add to their bizarre experiment? “We were building the extended Gecs cinematic universe,” says Les proudly. While fans search for clues on the remix album, Gecs will write new music for rescheduled 2021 shows. They will also be online considering their newfound platform, and the responsibility that comes with that.“We just do our best not to be jerks,” says Les. “If we can push that agenda, that’s a good agenda: don’t be a dick – and we can try to live up to that.” The PENOGT surely awaits.1000 Gecs and the Tree of Clues is out this summer"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/294e0d01f05b8ced96d6f92020dfa72f36e41936/0_0_3409_2157/master/3409.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=29fae3b3befb52d77ed6321553220fc0 1400w","title":"hancock lifts covid 19 restrictions in line with economy sorry science","story":"The health secretary is always guided by the science. Particularly the science that takes him places he wants to goHow much does Boris Johnson hate Matt Hancock? I’m asking because it’s clear the health secretary is completely burnt out. The smiles and the Tigger-like warmth are all gone. All that’s left is a desiccated shell that could crumble at any minute. A man reduced to muttering platitudes while scowling at the television cameras.A kinder, more sensitive boss – the type that Matt was about to insist were omnipresent and would be falling over themselves to welcome back staff who had been shielding – would have told Hancock to take some time off a while ago. A chance to catch up on lost sleep and reacquaint himself with his family. After all, it’s not exactly as if he would be missed.Instead, Matt found himself sent out on another hospital pass of a Downing Street press conference. After the usual nonsense about “our plan is working”, Hancock got down to the nitty-gritty.He wanted to say a huge thank-you to the 2.2m people who had been shielding for the past three months, but would shortly be writing to them all inidually to tell them their time was up.“As of 6 July, we want you to reacquaint yourself with the outside world, so feel free to hang out in groups of up to six people. Have someone to stay overnight if you like. Because from August 1, the fun stops. That’s when the food boxes, the medicine drops and the statutory sick pay will end. Anyone found bunking off from then will be on their own. So prepare to get your compromised immune systems back to work. Lots of love, Matt.”Predictably, most of the questioners were sceptical that not all those who were shielding would be quite so thrilled by the news. Not because they weren’t keen to meet up with friends and families again, but because they didn’t trust the government to relax the guidelines in a sensible way. Matt just glared his disapproval. Though it might have looked as if the government was deciding policy by focus group, it was actually committed to doing everything in line with the science. And to prove his point, he handed over to deputy chief medical officer, Jenny Harries. “Thank you for guiding us through this crisis, Jenny,” he added. Which was a bit like thanking a wonky satellite that had been transmitting faulty data for the past three months.But Harries was determined to do her best to help. The infection rates had now fallen from 1 in 400 to 1 in 1,700, so you could meet 1,700 people before you were in danger of getting the coronavirus. Even my basic maths could see the logical problem with that. Then Jenny became positively Ayn Rand.“Work is good for you,” she continued, so it was the government’s job to push shielders through the pain barrier. Yes, some people might still think that a 1 in 1,700 chance of catching a disease that could kill you if you had underlying health issues was a risk they were unwilling to take, but once they had re-experienced the joys of stacking shelves at night, they would see the error of their ways. Things really began to fall apart, though, when it was gently pointed out that this was all a bit previous. Announcing the end of the shielding programme the day before the government was about to make wholesale changes to other lockdown guidelines really didn’t make sense.Given that many people were already treating the 2-metre rule as a 1-metre rule, a switch to a 1-metre rule would be the end of any kind of social distancing for some. And with travel restrictions being eased in line with the focus groups and the economy – sorry, the science, there was clearly no way of anyone knowing if the changes would lead to an increase in the rate and number of infections. So the end of shielding could be a death sentence for the shielders. Now Matt’s eyes narrowed. A man on the edge of a nervous breakdown. This was supposed to be a “good news” press conference and he was sick and tired of everyone being so negative. He didn’t care if the director of the World Health Organisation thought some countries were being too cavalier in unlocking too quickly. He was always guided by the science. And where the science disagreed, he was all in favour of following the science that took him places he wanted to go.He was fed up with people laughing at the UK’s mishandling of the coronavirus, so he was willing to take a punt on relaxing the rules to make us more like other countries. And if people started dying, then we could always lock down again. By the end, Matt looked as if he was going to crack completely.Just as well no one asked him about his nonexistent “world-beating” app. "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d157bb539cb43559cb6fd0032e699ca9c1d25c01/0_0_4937_2962/master/4937.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=af79f6c052d3c5e9d268ca09d101c922","title":"britain beyond lockdown can we level up","story":"Jonathan Watts continues his road trip in Hartlepool, where some see an opportunity to emerge from the past into a greener futureMicky Day is an electrical cable installer from Hartlepool, one of the poorest, most avidly pro-Brexit regions in the UK. He is not interested in Westminster politics and has little time for talk of the green recovery, but he knows how to unite a community and care for people who are hurting. And it is this that inspires his thoughts about Britain beyond lockdown.“We can’t have more cuts. There are a lot of people on their knees already,” he says. “There is a lot of industry in this area. If the government puts the money on the table, it could be massive in the north-east. Let’s get people back working and lift the economy off its knees.”Day is known locally as “the most popular man in Hartlepool” because of the amount of time he devotes to community work. He has raised more than £400,000 for cancer, established the mental health charities Miles for Men and Minds for Men, and works with local supermarkets to arrange food donations. During lockdown, he and his friends have been doing karaoke car park tours to lift the spirits of people in isolation, regaling the inhabitants of elderly care homes with Elvis and Oasis numbers.He says this already close community of 90,000 has become stronger during the pandemic because people have rallied to help each other out. But Day foresees financial and mental health problems ahead unless there is more support. “A lot of people have been going through tough times. After lockdown, it’s going to get worse.”How to lift and heal the country is the biggest political challenge facing the government. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, is putting together a recovery budget that could be the defining economic policy of a generation. It must head off the UK’s worst recession in 300 years, address an existential climate crisis, and “level up” incomes in an unequal and ided nation. Politicians in the north-east see an opportunity for a historic transition. There are hopes that decarbonisation can give a future to a region that has often struggled to emerge from the past.Since Margaret Thatcher closed the collieries in the 1980s, the town of Hartlepool has slipped further and further behind other parts of Britain for job prospects, life expectancy, health and economic growth.One in three households are jobless. A third of children are obese when they finish primary school. Although there are only 40,000 families in the town, such is the level of need that there are nine food kitchens. Life expectancy was declining even before coronavirus. The local council is in dire financial straits. Locals joke darkly that even three pound shops have gone bust.Because the town was already so poor, the economic impact of Covid-19 has been muted. The third of the population on benefits may even be slightly better off because the government is giving an extra £20 a week in universal credit and £15 for school meal vouchers. In a ranking of which English towns have suffered the worst financial hit from the crisis, Hartlepool came 154th out of 175. Others have suffered a sharper downturn because they have lost tourist and student income.“For us, Covid is just another crisis. We already knew who to support. We’ve been doing it for ages,” says charity coordinator Sacha Bedding. He fears that what happened to Hartlepool after deindustrialisation in the 1980s could be a foretaste of what is to come.When the Conservative government closed the coal mines and ancilliary operations that had provided most of the jobs in the town, call centres were supposed to be the future – but they all moved to India in the 2000s. The public sector was then the biggest employer, but it was slashed under austerity programmes following the financial crisis. There has been public-private investment in redeveloping the marina, but several of the upmarket new restaurants have gone bust because there are not enough wealthy local customers to fill the tables.“We try to reinvent ourselves, but we always seem to be one step behind because we don’t address deep structural changes,” Bedding says. “If we are not careful, I worry the country will level down rather than level up,” he says over a cup of tea at the end of another day delivering food parcels and medicine to those in need.For most of the last few decades, Bedding – like several others the  spoke to – feels people in the north-east have been ignored, scorned as “scroungers” or derided as racist throwbacks who failed to adjust to a globalised post-industrial world.But he feels the voice of the region has grown stronger in the wake of Brexit and the election of a new post-”red wall” wave of MPs, mayors and councillors who can no longer take their support for granted. One such politician is Ben Houchen, a Conservative elected in 2017 as Tees Valley mayor. The investments he is trying to attract include some of the biggest decarbonisation projects in Europe.In a phone interview, Houchen comes across as very different from southern Tories like David Cameron, Theresa May and Boris Johnson. He seems more concerned about jobs, levelling up and the need to decarbonise the economy.“For Teesside, clean growth could be as transformative to our region as steel and iron were 200 year ago … This would be huge in levelling up.”He is under no illusions about the scale of the economic challenge. “It’s absolutely unprecedented – as big as it could be,” he says. “But the rebound will be strong. There is a lot of pent-up energy in the economy … that wasn’t there in 2007.”Many major spending projects have been pre-approved, and Houchen is hopeful for more because interest rates are low, which means the government has less of an incentive to take the path of austerity. Politically, it will also want to capitalise on its recent gains in former Labour territory.The old steelworks on Teesside was recently chosen as the site for one of the world’s biggest industrial-scale carbon capture and storage projects. Houchen said Net Zero Teesside will bring in more than £3bn in investment, create 5,700 jobs and capture CO2 equivalent to the emissions of 6m homes every year. It is due to start by 2025 with the backing of BP, Shell and Equinox. “They see it as the future of their business. They realise they can’t just release the emissions into the air any more,” the mayor said.Other potential job-creating investments by the chancellor include the decarbonisation of heating in the country’s 20m homes by switching boilers from fossil fuel gas to hydrogen. “That will require refitting 2,000 boilers every day until 2050. That’s a huge number of jobs,” the mayor says. The government could also support the domestic manufacturing of turbines for the large offshore wind farm at Dogger Bank, which is 80 miles off the Teesside coastline. Houchen estimates that would create another 5,000-8,000 jobs.But all this is not enough to hold back the unemployment tsunami that is gathering force. There will also be pressure to generate more carbon-intensive jobs through roadbuilding and expanding airports.Locals say they don’t care whether jobs are green or black, as long as they are not minimum wage, or zero-hours contracts, which barely pay more than benefits. That means employees in the care, health and retail sectors should be valued as the “essential workers” they were designated as during lockdown.The town centre is coming back to life. When non-essential shops reopened, locals say there were so many people wanting to return to old consumer habits that streets were blocked with cars, and marshals had to be called in to manage the long lines of eager customers.Some want a more caring economy. Independent retailers Angela Arnold and Trevor Sherwood, co-owners of the cosy LilyAnne’s coffee bar, have used their £10,000 Covid-19 support grant to expand the cafe so they can provide a “gentle space” that will help socially isolated residents to reintegrate. “Covid has heightened anxieties among many people,” said Arnold. “There will be a big mental health impact.”But with the prime minister urging people to shop for Britain, Arnold and her business partner fear the government will suspend the Sunday trading law to ramp up productivity again. “That would be a disaster for independent retailers like us,” she said. Like many, she would like more focus on togetherness, which helped during Covid-19 and previous crises and is likely to be needed in the tough times that everyone expects to come.“Before Covid, when did you last see your neighbour? Everyone is normally too tired when they come home. But in lockdown, we are getting to know each other again,” she says. “People are cooking for one another and leaving food on the steps, and reconnecting with friends. There is a realisation that there is more to life than money.” At the nearby seaside town of Seaton Carew, the beachfront is as close to bustling as it is possible to get in an era of physical distancing. There are long queues for fish and chips and ice-cream. Families picnic on the sand, play football and fly kites. With pubs and amusement arcades still closed, people pay more attention to each other. The scene could come from a more innocent, bygone age. It seems that the lockdown, which started with fears of dystopia and social breakdown, appears to be ending here with people more closely bonded and appreciative of nature than before. The question now is how long that mood can last once capitalism revs up again.

Wallace climbed out of his car and wept after the show of support.Wallace, Nascar’s only black full-time driver, was emotional after spending time in the top five before running short on fuel and finishing 14th on Monday, slapping hands with a group of mostly African American fans.The race was won by Wallace’s close friend, Ryan Blaney. “I think it’s great that everybody really came together,” Blaney said. “I don’t want it to be remembered as a terrible day or a bad day in Nascar. I want it to be remembered as there was an incident and we all overcame it together and showed that we’re not going to take it any more.”The stock car series was left reeling and angered by the racist act that came less than two weeks after it banned the Confederate flag on its properties at Wallace’s urging. It has vowed to permanently bar the person responsible, but the investigation was in its early stages. The size of the task was made clear after news emerged that a makeshift noose was found hanging from a tree at another Nascar venue, the Sonoma Raceway in California. Officials said they are investigating the incident.The raceway’s president, Steve Page, said a “piece of twine tied in what appeared to be a noose” was found hanging from a tree on Saturday behind a former administrative office.Page said the incident was under investigation by the Sonoma county sheriff’s department. He also said he has asked staff and on-site business tenants to share any information or “any possible alternative explanation”. Sonoma was closed over the weekend due the coronavirus pandemic.Meanwhile, disgruntled fans with Confederate flags drove past the main entrance to Talladega Superspeedway at the weekend, while a plane flew above the track pulling a banner of the flag that read “Defund Nascar” One fan in the stands on Monday said of the noose incident: “I thought it was funny myself.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6966ca07766cb12b6715c422a68fbb26621d4bf9/1604_0_2804_1684/master/2804.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0f75576848f8bc5d27fc619ccbf6af40","title":"apple ditches intel for arm processors in big sur computers","story":"Firm starts transition to Apple-made chips for faster performance, longer battery life and innovative technologiesApple has announced the biggest change heading to its Mac computers in 14 years: the dumping of Intel Inside.The company is ditching Intel’s traditional so-called x86 desktop chips for Apple’s own processors based on ARM designs - those used in smartphones and mobile tablets, including the iPhone and iPad.At the firm’s World Wide Developers Conference (WWDC), held virtually for the first time due to the Covid-19 pandemic in the US, Apple said the first silicon-based Mac would ship by the end of 2020, with the full transition taking two years, giving developers forewarning of the modifications they will have to make to their apps.The shift to Apple’s own ARM-based chips gives the firm even greater control over the its hardware and software, in the same way it has with the iPhone and iPad. But for users it promises very powerful machines that are drastically more efficient, meaning longer battery life, with the same instant-on features as a phone and potential for built-in mobile broadband.Apple said switching to its own chips not only opened up performance but also new, innovative technologies such as the AI neural engine, high-performance graphics and best-in-class security.The new macOS Big Sur also revamps almost all of the user interface of the Mac with new translucent effects, depth and colour. New is a unified space for both notifications and widgets, which now resemble those of the new iOS 14. Apple has also brought Control Centre from the iPhone to the Mac for quick settings changes, such as brightness, Bluetooth and wifi.The dock, too, now floats at the bottom of the screen, similar to that seen on the iPad in iPadOS 13, while the Messages app now operates like an iPhone with pinned messages and mentions. The Maps app has also been revamped using the iPad app as the base.Apple is not the first to attempt the switch to the vastly more power-efficient ARM chips. Microsoft has dabbled several times with ARM chips in its Surface Windows PCs, most recently with the Surface Pro X, which has a custom-designed chip made by Microsoft with mobile chip-maker Qualcomm.Despite making both hardware and software, Microsoft has struggled to bring key third-party software such as photo-editing suites to its ARM-based PCs. Here is where Apple may have the edge, with both greater control over third-party developers and previous experience in making such a dramatic switch.Apple said it had already ported all its apps to the new ARM-based chips, including its heavy, professional apps such as the video-editing suite Final Cut Pro. The company also said that both Microsoft and Adobe were working on getting their apps ready for the switch, demonstrating Photoshop among others.Apple is pushing a new Universal 2 format that allows developers to produce one app that runs on both existing Intel Macs and new ARM Macs.But the firm said it also has new emulation technology called Rosetta 2 to make sure that existing apps that haven’t been updated will run on the new Apple ARM-chips from the beginning. The new Macs will also be able to run iPhone and iPad apps natively, downloaded straight from the Mac App Store.The move will not be welcomed by Intel, which has enjoyed a near monopoly on the PC processor market. The firm tried and failed to break into the smartphone market with lower-power chips, but could not effectively compete with ARM-based designs.“Apple has made enormous investments in Arm chip design and it’s logical that it extends that capability beyond the iPhone and iPad,” said Geoff Blaber of analysts CCS Insight. “Its motivations for doing so include reducing its dependence on Intel, maximising its silicon investment, boosting performance, and giving itself more flexibility and agility when it comes to future products.”Now that Microsoft and Apple are switching to their own chips, and with Google also rumoured to be working on similar own-brand ARM chips, Intel is in danger of seeing significant erosion of its dominant position."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4899c5f4db7191fdfbc80c40b197ac92aa66a529/185_175_2510_1506/master/2510.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=d42bfadf7e9d5c2e6ad2080a822df6f9","title":"10 best books set in ireland sally rooney edan obrien colm toibin","story":"Explore Ireland’s history and culture through these tales of loss and love by Sally Rooney, Edna O’Brien, Colm Tóibín and more• Share your own suggestions in the comments belowI was born in Toronto and moved to Ireland as a boy, where I spent some formative years in a planned, Khrushchevian-style satellite town in south County Clare. Settlers arrived in waves from Belfast, London, New York or further afield – from cities throughout Chile and South Africa. In this multicultural outpost, populated by residential tourists, we became wry observers of traditional nuances. For me, Ireland’s political, historical and cultural landscapes were first properly discovered in the country’s literature. The greats, such as Wilde, Yeats and Joyce, offered signposts to the past while more contemporary writers, including Roddy Doyle, Flann O’Brien and Jamie O’Neill, shone a light on lesser-heard Irish voices. And so my selection of novels echoes Ireland’s literary journey from pre-famine to the present day.“The famine funerals, then, the women wailing, their thin screeching piercing the sky”The second novel in Walter Macken’s sweeping trilogy was published in 1962 and captures the harrowing decades in the lead up to the 1847 famine. At the start of the novel Dualta Duane’s life changes for the worse after a chance encounter with the son of a landowner. It is set in a time when Catholics still bore the scars of the last blight and eked out a bare existence working farms while paying exorbitant rents and tithes to corrupt landlords who relished a violent eviction. Dualta is the voice of these silent people. The sparkling waters of the Atlantic, stone cottages burrowed into the landscape and blue turf smoke keep his spirit alive as he journeys south along Ireland’s west coast to meet “The Liberator” Daniel O’Connell, before Black 1847 devours the county’s population.“The day was blue and brilliant, the beating sun making a mockery of the sea of dark clothes worn by the mourners”Sometimes death can make a cheerful appearance, as is the case in Deirdre Purcell’s 1993 novel about repression and isolation. With the windswept beauty of West Cork’s Beara peninsula as a backdrop, the protagonist, Elizabeth Sullivan, falls as hard for the ocean-sculpted landscape as she does for the young dancer – Daniel McCarthy. Despite a loveless marriage and unwanted pregnancy in 1930s Ireland – when most unmarried mothers were shipped to the Magdalene Laundries – happiness is discovered in the mucky paddocks beneath the shadow of a mountain. The novel was written shortly before we got to see the full horror the high walls of the Magdalene Laundries and Industrial Schools had been hiding.“The rain drove us into the church – our refuge, our strength, our only dry place”Limerick’s Georgian avenues and compact medieval quarter have finally emerged from the cloudy streetscape of Frank McCourt’s poverty stricken 1930s childhood to become a vibrant destination. This moving memoir and tribute to his mother, Angela, published in 1996, laid bare his bid for survival in tenement conditions on the fringes of Limerick’s society, and earned him a Pulitzer prize. Unknown to the young McCourt, across town future Hollywood legend Richard Harris and Terry Wogan were growing up in different circumstances, without the rainy-day backstory of death, near starvation and destitution. Head to O’Connell Avenue to South’s Bar and see where Frank’s father drank away their family’s meagre earnings.“At the far edge of the lake there was a belt of poplar trees, shutting out the world”The ground-breaking 1960 novel by County Clare author Edna O’Brien gave a voice to Irish women’s liberation, and the ensuing parochial outrage and censorship on its publication guaranteed its enduring success. This first book in the trilogy traces the lives of young Cait Brady and Baba Brennan, from their drab, cloistered life in County Limerick to the bright lights of Dublin. Scaling the pages were older men, like the predatory Mister Gentleman, who used the country girls’ bid for emancipation to exploit their vulnerability. The book incensed the country’s power houses at the time – church and state – who struggled to grasp the concept that women may want more from life than domestic servitude.“There was a vague mist that masked the line between the horizon and the sky”Colm Tóibin’s Costa Award-winning novel, published in 2009, is the story of the immigrant, transformed by the loneliness and freedom of her journey. Eilis Lacey returns home to Ireland in the 1950s and her married life in New York becomes obscured in a haze across the ocean. She adapts to the old familiar pace of life in County Wexford and begins to see handsome Jim Farrell with fresh eyes. However, Brooklyn eventually finds her in the cosy Irish coastal cocoon and she has to make a difficult choice between her two different worlds.“It was getting dark now, though the afterglow lingered over the western Atlantic a sky too big for the sun to leave”Man Booker prize-winner Anne Enright sets her softly lyrical novel at the tail end of Ireland’s Celtic Tiger economy. Rosaleen Madigan is entering her twilight years at her homestead by an old famine (green) road on the Burren Park’s ocean-ridged limestone landscape in County Clare. Rosaleen’s four children return to spend one last Christmas together, and the intricate backstories of their scarred lives unfold in the first half of this 2015 novel. Hanna is an alcoholic in Dublin, Dan is living with his boyfriend in Toronto, Emmet drifts through Mali and Constance stays close to home. Personalities clash over Christmas, before Rosaleen wanders into the darkness to escape the drama.“The colour of the streets always seemed drained and muted as if the colours, too, had been blown away”Two tales of the same city sharply conveyed by unlikely working-class friends: one a toughly veneered Catholic, the other a capitalist Protestant. The Belfast setting for this novel, published in 1996, straddles the months before and after the 1994 IRA ceasefire. The often-humorous take on the slowly retreating shadow of the troubles graphically depicts the violence of a fractured Belfast, as the protagonists try to normalise their lives in the chaos and prejudice. One chapter lulls the reader into a soft, harmonious take on the city and it’s followed by another, which blows apart the setting with the bombing of a sandwich shop. The two friends’ tangled lives are told in fast-paced prose and peppered with satire, a foreshadowing of the author’s future role at Charlie Hebdo.“Things you were sure you’d have in the future turn out to be on the far side of a big, dark mountain”Donal Ryan spins a Booker-prize longlisted yarn set in the lush Tipperary countryside, a place where looming hillsides and wide lakes block escape paths to mental and physical liberty. Mourning mother Bridie sits with her back to the River Shannon to block neighbouring County Clare where her child died, while Vasya concedes that he will drown if he tries to swim across Lough Derg. They are just two of 21 desolate voices marooned by circumstance in his novel, published in 2012. It’s set at a time when Ireland was haunted by ghost estates and zombie hotels as reckless bank lending destroyed the Irish economy and normal people were left to rebuild lives from the carnage.“Dublin is extraordinarily beautiful to her in wet weather, the way grey stone darkens to black”Published in 2018 and longlisted for a Booker prize in the same year, Sally Rooney’s tale of fractured hearts and minds crosses class structure and Ireland from the west coast to Dublin – and appeared on Barack Obama’s top 19 book list for 2019. It traces the fragile relationship between a popular high-school student, Connell, and marginalised Marianne, through their reversal of fortunes when she becomes Dublin’s Trinity College cool girl and he loses his way in the bigness of life there. The book’s small-screen production dominated ratings and press coverage throughout the Covid-19 lockdown, as did Connell’s short shorts, necklace and prolonged nudity. Onscreen, Tobercurry and Streedagh Strand in Sligo played the novel’s fictional town of Carricklea.“Henceforth I would have to address things as they are, not as I might imagine them, for this was a new version of reality”John Banville’s 2005 Man Booker prize-winning novel depicts art historian, Max Morden, as a man all at sea, trying to navigate his way through the turbulence of loss and sorrow. He returns to County Wexford, where he spent summer holidays as a child. You can almost taste the salty air and feel the gentle breeze burn tender skin as the prose ebbs and flows between the past and the present, in this timeless, meditative, disquieting masterpiece."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/49d3cb279ddd15a2bad807866ff413ea939ec093/0_367_5958_3576/master/5958.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=236ec066e211a022da160de12bf2cf63","title":"coronavirus shielding scheme eased england from 6 july","story":"Government support for most vulnerable will continue until end of July, says Matt HancockPeople with underlying health issues who are most at risk from Covid-19 will no longer have to shut themselves away in their home and can mix with other people from 6 July in England, the health secretary has said.Support for people who are undergoing chemotherapy for cancer, have a damaged immune system or have had an organ transplant will continue to the end of July, said Matt Hancock.But from 1 August, the 2.2 million “clinically extremely vulnerable” who have been shielding from the virus in England will receive only local authority and voluntary help and can return to their jobs if their workplace is “Covid-secure”.The Royal College of Physicians (RCP) warned that patients would be anxious and unsure of what lay ahead.The government has said the levels of infection in the community have dropped far enough to make it safe for the most vulnerable to go out and meet up to six people who are not part of their household outdoors, while keeping their distance. Any who live alone or with a single child will be able to form a “support bubble” with one other household.Ministers say they are committed to maintaining “the unprecedented package of support” until the end of July, to give those shielding time to adjust to the changes. From 1 August, “support will remain available from NHS volunteers and local councils. People will retain their priority for supermarket delivery slots, and still be able to access help with shopping, medication, phone calls and transport to medical appointments,” said a statement from the Department of Health and Social Care.In April the UK government set out these five tests it said had to be met before they would consider easing coronavirus lockdown restrictions:Hancock thanked those who have been shielding since the lockdown began. “I know this has been incredibly tough. Shielding has involved not leaving your house for months, not seeing people you care about, not being able to wander to the park for some fresh air, or even pop to the shops for something you need. This sacrifice has been for a purpose, and I want to thank every single one of you,” he said. The government’s deputy chief medical officer, Dr Jenny Harries, said it knew how difficult the past months had been for the most vulnerable and the impact it had had on their mental health. “The prevalence of the virus in the community is now lower and the chances of getting infected are reduced, so we believe it is the right time to relax some of the advice so people can start to regain a degree of normality once more in their daily lives,” she said.“People should continue to follow social distancing guidance when outside their homes, as well as frequently washing their hands, to minimise the risk of becoming infected. We will continue to monitor the evidence closely and adjust the advice accordingly if there are any changes in the rates of infection that could impact on this group.”The RCP, which represents many of the consultants who look after the most vulnerable, said the announcement would be met with mixed emotions.“The past few weeks and months have been challenging and we know that many patients will be unsure about what lies ahead,” said Prof Donal O’Donoghue, the RCP registrar.“It is crucial that the government builds trust by regularly communicating and engaging with those who have been shielding up to now. Patients are likely to have many questions, and we need to ensure that frontline NHS staff are equipped with the detailed scientific evidence base to be able to support patients to make their shared decisions based on inidual assessments of risk and their personal priorities.” Sue Farrington, chair of the Rare Autoimmune Rheumatic Disease Alliance, said: “Many people who’ve been shielding told us they have felt abandoned, and while an end to shielding is welcome, people are understandably wary and need to know that their concerns aren’t being brushed aside.“We’re particularly concerned about people needing to return to work if their workplace is deemed ‘Covid-safe’. Over the last few months people have told us how the guidance for employers is already too open to interpretation. We really need to see specific guidance on how this will be enforced, how people will be protected, and how any issues will be addressed.”The government says the rates of the virus are now low enough to allow the advice to be “carefully and safely eased”. On average, less than one in 1,700 people are estimated to have the virus, down from one in 500 four weeks ago, said the DHSC.Each extremely vulnerable inidual will receive a letter with advice, telling them of the support available.“I also want to reassure everyone that we will continue to deliver the unprecedented package of support including food and medicine deliveries until the end of July,” said the communities secretary, Robert Jenrick. “You will be sent information that will explain what support is available after that you will not be on your own. Chris Askew, chief executive officer at Diabetes UK, said: “The government has again given little to no acknowledgement of the impact that these changes will have on thousands of people living with conditions such as diabetes, or detailed the support and protections they can expect. By allowing lockdown to continue to ease without specific and enforceable safeguards in place, they are allowing people with diabetes to fall through the cracks.“Thousands of people with diabetes are telling us that social distancing at work is not being made possible, and that employers’ risk assessments are failing to protect them. Without more robust guidance, employers will continue to decide their own ‘acceptable risk’, with no safeguards for inidual staff, or consequences for non-compliance.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e2270964a5481004dda3d9d99d7a04e55779b7a/0_151_3854_2312/master/3854.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dd173891d307d42db9210b846cbe7632","title":"coronavirus what changes mean for people shielding in england","story":"From 6 July, people with underlying health issues will no longer have to avoid all contact with othersWith the government relaxing lockdown for those shielding from Covid-19 in England, we explore what this means for the most vulnerable in society.People who are clinically extremely vulnerable to Covid-19 were asked at the end of March to stay inside their homes for at least 12 weeks and avoid face-to-face contact with others, even keeping a distance from those they live with while at home.This group of around 2.2 million people included those with cancer who were undergoing chemotherapy, people who have had organ transplants, pregnant women with significant heart disease, and people with severe respiratory conditions, such as cystic fibrosis.From 1 June, the measures for those shielding in England were relaxed slightly, allowing trips outside the home once a day and even meetings, at a distance, with one person from another household.But from 6 July the guidance for people shielding in England will be relaxed further: people who have been shielding will be able to meet up outside in groups of up to six people from different households, provided they keep 2 metres apart, and they will no longer have to remain 2 metres apart from the rest of their household at home.If a shielding inidual lives on their own, or is a single parent, they will also be allowed to form a “support bubble” with one other household. However, experts have continued to stress the importance of physical distancing and hand washing in reducing the risk of infection.The government says the guidance will be relaxed because levels of infection in the community have fallen sufficiently that the risk, even to the most vulnerable, has reduced enough for such measures to be safe. From 1 August, the government has said, people in England will no longer need to shield. However, Matt Hancock, the secretary of state for health, said the shielding scheme is in reality being “paused”– the idea is that shielding could resume if needed.People who have been shielding will be able to see other people and even go to the shops. From the start of August it means they will also, potentially, be able to go back to their workplaces – provided such settings are “Covid-secure”.The details are not, as yet, completely clear. However, speaking at the daily briefing, the deputy chief medical officer for England, Dr Jenny Harries, said many children who have been shielding, such as those with asthma, could return to classrooms in September.“Those children are at very, very low risk from Covid they are probably at very, very significant risk of getting left behind in their education. In terms of the long-term health outcomes, that would be far worse,” she said.From 1 August, statutory sick pay and free food boxes that have been provided by the government for shielding iniduals will stop.Local authority and voluntary help may still be available, while a statement from the Department of Health and Social Care said people will retain their priority for supermarket delivery slots. There will still be help available for activities including shopping, getting medication, and accessing transport to medical appointments.Harries said that the government will “continue to monitor the evidence closely and adjust the advice accordingly”.Should shielding need to resume, however, it is not necessarily the case that everyone who has been shielding over the past three months will have to do so again. Research led by the University of Oxford, supported by NHS Digital, has resulted in a new model to improve the identification of who needs to shield, drawing on data from health records to predict how factors including age, sex, ethnicity and body mass index, as well as pre-existing medical conditions, affect the risk from Covid-19 – a move that could make shielding advice more precisely targeted."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ce26728b1e23351bfc8784a30d1d6173a15bb26a/0_25_3423_2054/master/3423.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f75b60d465de41a09fe50216cfc10762","title":"anthony fauci covid 19 statement house hearing","story":"US government’s top infectious disease expert will testify at a fraught moment in America’s coronavirus responseThe US government’s top infectious disease expert will testify again before Congress on Tuesday, as coronavirus cases continue to rise in about half the states and political polarization competing for attention with public health recommendations.Dr Anthony Fauci returns to Capitol Hill at a fraught moment in the nation’s pandemic response, and will testify before a House committee, along with the heads of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Food and Drug Administration and a top official at the Department of Health and Human Services.Since Fauci’s last appearance at a high-profile hearing more than a month ago, the US is emerging from weeks of stay-at-home orders and business shutdowns. But it’s being done in an uneven way, with some states far less cautious than others. A trio of states with Republican governors who are bullish on reopening – Arizona, Florida and Texas – are among those seeing worrisome increases in cases.Last week the vice-president, Mike Pence, published an opinion article in the Wall Street Journal saying the administration’s efforts have strengthened the nation’s ability to counter the virus and should be “a cause for celebration”.Then Donald Trump said at his weekend rally in Tulsa that he had asked administration officials to slow down testing, because too many positive cases are turning up. Many rally goers did not wear masks, and for some that was an act of defiance against what they see as government intrusion. White House officials later tried to walk back Trump’s comment on testing, suggesting it wasn’t meant to be taken literally.Fauci has recently warned that the US is still in the first wave of the pandemic and has continued to urge the American public to practice social distancing. And, in a recent ABC News interview, he said political demonstrations such as protests against racial injustice are “risky” to all involved. Asked if that applied to Trump rallies, he said it did. Fauci continues to recognize widespread testing as critical for catching clusters of Covid-19 cases before they turn into full outbreaks in a given community.About 2.3 million Americans have been sickened in the pandemic, and some 120,000 have died, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.As head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Fauci will be joined before the House Energy and Commerce Committee by CDC director Dr Robert Redfield, FDA chief Dr Stephen Hahn and the head of the US Public Health Service, Adm Brett Giroir.Giroir was tapped by the White House to oversee the expansion of coronavirus testing. But he gained notoriety after a whistleblower complaint flagged him for trying to push a malaria drug touted by Trump to treat Covid-19 without conclusive scientific evidence. The FDA has since withdrawn its emergency use authorization for hydroxychloroquine.“There have been a lot of unfortunate missteps in the Trump administration’s response to the Covid-19 pandemic,” said committee chairman Frank Pallone. “As communities across the country ease social distancing guidance and reopen their economies, it is critically important that both the administration and Congress remain focused on containing the spread of the coronavirus and providing the resources and support Americans need during this time of crisis.”There is still no vaccine for Covid-19, and there are no treatments specifically developed for the disease, although the antiviral drug remdesivir has been shown to help some patients, as well as a steroid called dexamethasone, and plasma from patients who have recovered.Fauci remains optimistic that a vaccine will be found, noting that patients develop antibodies to the virus – a sign that the human immune system is able to battle back. However, he shies away from promising results by the end of the year, as Trump has done.The Energy and Commerce panel has oversight over drugs and vaccines, among other facets of the US healthcare system. Committee Democrats have been harshly critical of the administration. However, not all Republicans have lined up to defend the White House. Some GOP members were growing concerned early in the year that the administration wasn’t doing enough to prepare."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d4915a3dee212dea49443ffbb8f459e9f1d21d8/0_121_3872_2324/master/3872.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fe373a6a4129375e99664845604728b3","title":"jordan smoking rates highest in world amid claims of big tobacco interference","story":"‘Big tobacco wants our youth’s lungs’: rise of smoking in JordanSmoking rates in the Middle East kingdom of Jordan have become the highest in the world amid what public health advocates say is widespread interference in policy-making by multinational tobacco companies.More than eight out of 10 Jordanian men smoke or regularly use nicotine products including e-cigarettes, according to a government study carried out in 2019 in collaboration with the World Health Organization. Jordanian men who smoke daily consume an average of 23 cigarettes a day, the survey found.“The rates are dangerously high and a predictor of a future public health catastrophe,” said Firas al-Hawari, a physician and head of the cancer-control office at Amman’s King Hussein Cancer Center.The Jordanian figures contrast with those in Europe, the US and Australia, where smoking has been drastically reduced over the past three decades with the introduction of limits on tobacco companies’ power to lobby and advertise, as well as through awareness campaigns about the dangers of smoking.Industry analysts and public health advocates said Jordan’s rates were exacerbated by the influence of big tobacco, which they said was allowed to operate with comparatively fewer restraints than in the UK – as is the case in many of the lower- and middle-income countries where the majority of the world’s smokers now live.“These companies continue to exercise as much political power as they can in wealthy countries, but they’re more successful in lower-income countries where they face less transparency, can operate more in the dark and overwhelm whatever civic societies exist,” said Rima Nakkash, an associate professor of public health at the American University of Beirut.A  investigation of tobacco industry conduct in Jordan has found:Tobacco company lobbyists have been accused of inappropriate involvement in shaping regulations on their products in Jordan. Meeting minutes seen by the  show that lobbyists from BAT, Japan Tobacco International (JTI) and PMI attended a series of meetings last year to discuss standards for e-cigarettes and heated tobacco products.Among the standards being decided were nicotine content, the size and composition of health warnings, the graphics and colours permitted on the packages, and whether the products could be labelled as less harmful than cigarettes or as an aid to quit smoking.“The tobacco companies actually sat at the table right across from us,” said Princess Dina Mired, a member of Jordan’s royal family, who attended the meetings in her capacity as the president of the Union for International Cancer Control. “They argued against every single standard.”The tobacco companies supported the adoption of regulation comparable to EU directives, according to meeting minutes, while anti-smoking campaigners said they were pushing for more restrictive standards on the products.Jordan is a signatory to an international tobacco-control treaty that obliges countries to protect their public health laws from tobacco company interference. A civil society group that monitors compliance with the treaty argues that the tobacco companies’ involvement in regulatory meetings in Jordan is an example of lobbying that is contrary to the agreement.PMI and JTI said in statements to the  that it was normal and lawful for their companies to be consulted as stakeholders when relevant regulatory issues were being debated.“Our interactions with government officials in Jordan – like elsewhere – comply with all applicable laws,” PMI said. “In addition, we abide to our own international standards and practices which are stricter than many national laws. In any democratic society, the central objective of regulatory policy – ensuring that regulations are designed and implemented in the public interest – can only be achieved with full participation of those concerned.”JTI said its involvement in the meetings on e-cigarettes and heated tobacco was about providing assistance on technical and industrial standards.Mired said she felt that few of the public health advocates’ concerns were heeded by the committee, which was made up of various ministries and the chambers of commerce and industry. “We failed miserably. They didn’t take a single recommendation from us,” she said.Several former and current government officers said big tobacco had strong relationships with Jordanian MPs and officials, who are not obliged to declare their contact with the industry.Mervat Mheerat, the deputy health manager at the Greater Amman municipality, told the  she was visited by a regional manager for a multinational tobacco company while she sat on a government committee that oversaw how tobacco products were displayed at supermarkets. “I was shocked when the regional manager came to me, and knew what I was saying in the meetings,” she said.Mheerat said she was asked to be “neutral” on some of the issues being discussed in the meeting, and was offered a donation of up to 1m dinars (£1.15m) for anti-smoking campaigns in the city, in what she felt was an exchange.“They approach each person in the style they like,” she said. “So for me, they know I am passionate about promoting health and raising awareness of the dangers of smoking. So they came and said: ‘Let us find some money for your campaign.’”Apparent conflicts of interest go to the heart of Jordan’s anti-smoking lobby. Emails seen by the  show a senior member of a major public health group recused themselves from anti-smoking work after a family member became employed as a lobbyist for a multinational tobacco giant.Company filings show big tobacco spends hundreds of thousands of US dollars in Jordan on sponsorship, including of many programmes aimed at young people. In one example, Philip Morris paid to refurbish 10 schools in the Amman neighbourhood where its factory is located, and provided children in 25 schools with bags and stationery.Philip Morris has also run careers training programmes, which were widely covered in local media and lauded at events attended by government ministers, local officials and senior police.Public health advocates argue such contributions launder the adverse health and economic impacts of the industry’s products. JTI said in a statement that its corporate social responsibility work strictly adhered to local and international laws and policies and that none of its programmes involved minors.PMI said its factory was located in an underprivileged area “where the local community has often requested much needed in-kind support and aid”. “It is saddening that even actions to improve the living conditions of people around our factory might be seen as a reason to attack us,” the company said.This message has been broadcast directly from government social media channels. “Philip Morris is the largest American investment in Jordan,” the company’s then general manager for the region, Fadi Maayta, said in a video posted by the prime minister’s office last year. “We are the second-biggest taxpayer in Jordan.”PMI said the video was one of several short interviews with local business leaders that featured on government social media.Research funded by the UK government has found that smoking costs Jordan £1.85bn a year in healthcare and loss of productivity, the highest per capita figure in the world, outweighing the approximately £1.03bn the industry pays in taxes, fees and wages to local workers.A Jordanian government source authorised to comment said tobacco companies did not receive special treatment compared with other industries and that anti-smoking awareness campaigns were continuing to try to change people’s behaviour."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/39ae5e66432f009630410252b8832e92ab20d983/220_540_4451_2671/master/4451.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6370f4df7abc85f6c8675282f233f7df","title":"shielding in england how do you feel about coming out of lockdown","story":"Lockdown restrictions are to be eased from 6 July and we want to hear how you feel about itFrom 6 July, people in England with underlying health issues who have been shielding since March will be allowed to leave their homes.They will be able to meet up outside in groups of up to six people from different households, provided they keep 2 metres apart, and they will no longer have to remain 2 metres apart from the rest of their household at home.If you have been shielding since March we would like to hear how you feel about lockdown restrictions easing.You can get in touch by filling in the form below or via WhatsApp by clicking here or adding the contact +44(0)7867825056.

The Moscow mayor, Sergei Sobyanin, appeared to yield to pressure to end Moscow’s lockdown earlier this month but he has urged spectators to avoid crowding the streets to catch sight of the passing military hardware. “It’s better to watch it on television,” he said. “There shouldn’t be any crowds, there shouldn’t be spectators there.” Egypt will from Saturday lift a night-time curfew that has been imposed since 25 March to curb the spread of Covid-19, the prime minister’s media adviser said. Moustafa Madbouly said earlier on Tuesday that Egypt would reopen restaurants, cafes and places of worship from the end of the week but would keep some restrictions in place to limit crowding, as new coronavirus cases continue to climb.Netflix will stream a collection of short films made by celebrated filmmakers around the world during lockdown. The films, made with whatever equipment and family members were close at hand, will be launched next week. Hollywood stars Kristen Stewart and Maggie Gyllenhaal were among 17 of those who rose to the challenge, with Stewart shooting hers in Los Angeles while Gyllenhaal sheltered in Vermont. Jackie director Pablo Larrain made his film at home in Santiago, Chile - which had been battered by months of civil unrest before the virus struck - while French-Malian filmmaker Ladj Ly shot around the tough Paris suburb where his Oscar-nominated movie Les Miserables is set. David Mackenzie of Hell or High Water fame got to grips with his hometown Glasgow, while Nadine Labaki used the backdrop of Beirut, which also featured in her 2018 hit Capernaum. Larrain said it was “an extraordinary chance to keep working... in days (that were) so confusing and unique.” The shorts will be streamed on Netflix from 30 June, with the company saying a donation is being made to its hardship fund for cast and crew who have lost their jobs in the crisis. The British prime minister Boris Johnson said any changes to the country’s quarantine policy would be based on public health guidance and not a desire to open up the economy. “We will have a policy on air bridges that is based on public health,” he told parliament as he announced an easing of some lockdown measures in England on Tuesday. Britain has a 14-day quarantine policy in place for arrivals into the country from abroad, but the government has said it is looking at “air bridges” which would allow restriction-free travel between countries with low infection rates.Russians soaked up the sun on boat cruises on the river Moskva for the first time in three months after authorities lifted many of the city’s last remaining restrictions aimed at halting the spread of Covid-19. Officials in the city of 12.7 million, the centre of Russia’s outbreak, say new infections have been falling from a peak in May and there were just over 1,000 on Tuesday. Russia’s national case load, the world’s third highest, is nearly 600,000. The city, which began rapidly relaxing an array of lockdown restrictions earlier this month, on Tuesday allowed restaurants, cafes, libraries, playgrounds and gyms to open properly and for river cruises to resume. Moscow’s mayor, Sergei Sobyanin, said late on Monday that life in the capital had already largely returned to its normal rhythm, but warned that some restrictions remained in force including a ban on mass public events such as protests. Sobyanin’s critics accuse him of rushing to ease the lockdown in time to allow a Red Square military parade on Wednesday and a 1 July nationwide vote that could extend president Vladimir Putin’s rule until 2036.  Authorities have urged residents to continue wearing masks and gloves and to observe social distancing rules. But on Tuesday the streets were bustling and many people were ignoring those guidelines.Novak Djokovic, the men’s world No 1 tennis player, has tested positive for Covid-19, the Serbian said in a statement on Tuesday.Croatia’s Borna Ćorić, Grigor Dimitrov of Bulgaria and Viktor Troicki have previously tested positive after playing in Djokovic’s Adria Tour exhibition tournament in the Balkan region.Italy has seen a surge in bicycle sales since the government ended its coronavirus lockdown as people steer clear of public transport and respond to government incentives to help the environment. To keep people off metros and buses, and avoid road congestion, the government has offered to contribute up to €500 ($562.70) for city-dwellers who buy traditional or “pedal-assisted” electrical bicycles.  The subsidy, which kicked in on 4 May and runs to the end of the year, has accelerated the trend even in small centres where it is not available. “May has been an extraordinary month for the e-bike market,” Gian Franco Nanni, chief executive of Italian electric vehicle producer Askoll EVA told Reuters. “We have seen triple-digit growth in orders compared with a year ago.” With more than 34,600 deaths, Italy has the world’s fourth highest Covid-19 toll and authorities have warned the risk of infection is still high in crowded places. The government has set aside €120m for its incentive plan, and has said it will make more funds available if needed.  Bicycle use has been traditionally popular in the flat northern cities of the Po Valley such as Bologna and Parma, but is now also becoming more common in cities further south. “We have sold more than 50 bikes since we reopened,” said Simone Lazzaretti, who runs a bike shop in the hilly capital Rome, where bicycles had never really caught on as a means to get around town. “We’ve sold out of all the less expensive pedal-assisted models and only have top-of-the-range ones left,” he said.England’s pubs, restaurants and hotels will be allowed to reopen on 4 July in the next stage of easing the country’s coronavirus lockdown, prime minister Boris Johnson said. All hospitality indoors will be limited to table service and our guidance will encourage minimal staff and customer contact.We will ask businesses to help NHS Test and Trace respond to any local outbreaks by collecting contact details from customers.Iran on Tuesday reported 121 new coronavirus deaths, its highest daily toll in over two months, as it battles to contain the Middle East’s deadliest Covid-19 outbreak. Health ministry spokeswoman Sima Sadat Lari said the new fatalities brought the overall virus death toll to 9,863. That is Iran’s highest single-day fatality rate since 11 April, when 125 deaths were recorded. Lari also announced another 2,445 people had tested positive for Covid-19 in the past 24 hours, raising the country’s caseload to 209,970. The Islamic republic recorded a drop in its daily fatalities in early May, but there has been a rise in recent weeks. There has been scepticism at home and abroad about the country’s official Covid figures, with concerns the actual toll could be much higher. Iran has not imposed a mandatory lockdown on people to stop the virus’s spread, but it closed schools, cancelled public events and banned movement between the country’s 31 provinces in March. The government progressively lifted restrictions from April in order to reopen its sanctions-hit economy. Egypt will reopen restaurants, cafes and places of worship from the end of the week but will keep some restrictions in place to try to limit crowding, the prime minister has said.

Photograph: iStockAs restrictions come down, social contacts will increase. Often, this will mean family members from outside the same household seeing each other for the first time in months.That can be a cause for celebration, but also, can bring its own set of difficult decisions and choices, especially around older family members.Hugging your grandparent, or comforting a crying grandchild, is now a public health issue, not just a personal one.What does the public health advice say?Amid a lot of rapid change to the timeline for unwinding restrictions, the guidance for the over-70s, and the medically vulnerable, has remained consistent: you should stay home as much as you can, maintain social distancing with visitors, use allotted times for shopping and use face coverings during visits, in shops or in busy public areas.The government advice is to “use your judgement to decide how best to apply” this health advice. Some will be frustrated by this, wanting a clear definition of what can and can’t be done, but that is unlikely to happen – no government can legislate for every circumstance, nor would it make a law against hugging grandparents.However, it would be irresponsible to encourage it during the pandemic of a highly transmissible disease which disproportionately impacts the elderly.So, public health rules, which provide a framework for decision making, are devised.What do public health experts say?Prof Mary Codd, an epidemiologist at the UCD School of Public Health, says that, despite temptations, an abundance of caution must govern physical interactions with people from different households.She says that the evidence is that risk of contracting Covid-19 was many times higher for the over-65s in residential facilities like nursing homes, whereas those in the same cohort living in the community didn’t face a higher risk of catching the disease.This, she says, is evidence that cocooning for the over-70s worked, and worked well. Reducing the opportunity for the virus to transmit to older or medically vulnerable people remains a core strategy for limiting its impact. “I just think we all need to be double conscious”.So what about in the future?While the guidelines for the over-70s have not changed as quickly as other aspects of the roadmap, Prof Sam McConkey, head of the school of infectious diseases at the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, says we need to find ways of maintaining close bonds in the time of Covid-19.“We’re moving the debate more towards iniduals taking more responsibility,” he says. This could involve iniduals conducting their own risk assessment of the circumstances around an encounter, with strict hand-washing and respiratory etiquette – as well as self-isolation for the symptomatic – at its core. If someone is living in an area where there has been no cases for a period of weeks, that could also come into the reckoning.“We do need to maintain our human relationships, to build strong relationships of trust within and across families, and that’s what a hug is a physical expression of tenderness, and love, really,” he says. “We need to find ways of doing that which are safe.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4285744.1592857142!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"restaurateurs remain confused about reopening guidelines","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA waitress disinfects a table at a restaurant in Vilnius, Lithuania in April, after restaurants reopened there. Photograph: iStockAccording to the tourism authority, restaurants should have at least one metre between tables, with the same distance maintained between guests not from the same household, even if they are sharing a meal. There will also be a two-hour maximum time slot for reservations, including 15 minutes for cleaning, along with a host of other measures.The chief executive of the Restaurant Association of Ireland Adrian Cummins questioned how the guidelines will be policed or if they are enforceable either legally or practically.While staff members will have to be delegated to ensure the new guidelines are being followed, there is no official oversight, which leaves questions over how they will be managed.Mr Cummins said he had spent several days trying to establish how the new measures will work in practice.“No one can give me a straight answer,” he told The . “Will someone walk into a restaurant and ask what time did each customer come in and then tell them to leave if they have been there for longer than 105 minutes?”He was similarly sceptical as to how restaurants could police rules on social distancing for people not from the same households.“Staff are not going to be asking diners about the relationships they have with each other, or if they share a home or who is sleeping with who,” he said. “What we need is a common-sense approach and we need to get back to some sort of normality.“This has been a traumatic experience for us all, but what is needed now is for people to relax a little bit and get the doors open and keep the tables apart and then we will have to continue to do as we have always done in terms of food hygiene and safety. We have always been best in class in terms, in that regard, and that needs to continue,” Mr Cummins said.He also said there were reservations about how cafés might be expected to operate as they do not typically take reservations.He wondered how they would be expected to contact trace. “Cafes cannot afford to have a staff member greeting people to enter,” he said.Despite the uncertainty that continues to surround the re-opening of the sector from next Monday, Mr Cummins said it was good to have guidelines in place as a starting point even if they a “long way from perfect”.A Fáilte Ireland spokeswoman confirmed that its guidelines were not legally enforceable but were “provided to assist businesses with safe re-opening in accordance with the Government’s public health advice from the Health Protection Surveillance CentreHealth Service Executive.”She stressed that restaurant would be expected to “apply the guidelines appropriately as our consumer research states visible health etiquette and safety are of paramount concern to people as they plan their leisure activities”.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4286186.1592901410!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"weather set to improve with highs of 25 degrees forecast later this week","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe weather is set to take a turn for the better tomorrow with temperatures as high as 25 degrees forecasted in parts of the country later this week.

File photograph: Nick Bradshaw Ireland has the highest rate of infection from coronavirus of health workers globally, the Oireachtas Covid-19 committee has been told.General secretary of the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation (INMO) Phil Ní Sheaghdha said nurses felt “applauded and abandoned” by the HSE and the State as they struggled to balance work with childcare.She said she did not think the sacrifice nurses made to contribute to the health service could be matched by any other sector of the public service.Ms Ní Sheaghdha said an international comparison found Ireland had the highest rate of infection. She told Fianna Fáil health spokesman Stephen Donnelly that the lack of personal protective equipment (PPE) was a major issue.In one case, a nurse was sent home for wearing a mask and it became an industrial relations issue which was resolved, she said.She said “face masks should have been mandatory” from the start for all healthcare workers in healthcare settings and that infection rates fell dramatically once masks were worn.Figures from the INMO showed that up to the end of May, a total of 8,018 cases of infection of healthcare workers were reported.A survey by the organisation found that 60 per cent of nurses faced additional expenditure to enable them attend work. Some had a relative live with them to provide childcare, or ended up using all their leave and taking unpaid leave to mind their children because of lack of alternatives.The INMO called for the costs to nurses and midwives of attending work to be repaid to them and they had to be prioritised when childcare services returned.In an address to the committee which is looking at the impact of the pandemic, she said it was an “absolute scandal” that Ireland has the highest rate of infection.She said there was a moratorium on recruitment since last May so staffing levels were particularly compromised.She said there was a huge reliance on overseas recruitment with 1,819 nurses from non-EU countries, predominantly the Philippines and India, but because of Covid travel restrictions many were unable to travel.Ms Ní Sheaghdha said that 88 per cent of those infected who work in the health service got the virus at work and had to absent themselves for 14 days.Some 66 per cent or 4,823 remain out sick, and of that number 1,600 are categorised as nurses and midwives.Ms Ní Sheaghdha said “this puts enormous pressure on rosters”.Childcare has always been a very difficult issue, she said, adding that 92 per cent of nurses and midwives are women.She said that since March 13th when creches were closed, childcare “became a huge issue for our members”.The survey by the INMO found that 27 per cent of all those who responded were reliant on crèches and with the pandemic the rate of childminding in childminders’ homes dropped from 27 per cent to 7.9 per cent, while childminding in the child’s home rose from 7 per cent to 11 per cent and care from grandparents dropped from 32 per cent to 10 per cent.Siptu health isional organiser Paul Bell said the struggle their members had “over the last number of months in seeking to secure childcare for their small children has been deeply frustrating, challenging and emotionally distressing”.Everything you need to know about the

Photograph: Andrew ParsonsEPAFamilies can be reunited and dinner parties will be allowed as England’s coronavirus lockdown is eased – but millions of people will still be unable to hug their loved ones.Under the changes from July 4th, indoor gatherings involving two separate households will be permitted – including the possibility of visiting reopened pubs and restaurants – but social distancing will need to be maintained.The two-metre rule will be eased, replaced with a “one-metre plus” measure, with the protection offered by the physical distance enhanced by other mitigation measures such as the use of face coverings, increased hygiene or layout changes in premises.UK prime minister Boris Johnson said the “national hibernation” is beginning to end, and “life is returning to our streets”.Mr Johnson told MPs that progress in tackling the virus meant steps could be taken to “safely ease the lockdown”, but “caution will remain our watchword”.Mr Johnson acknowledged that the two-metre rule “effectively makes life impossible for large parts of our economy even without other restrictions”.He added: “We’re today publishing guidance on how business can reduce the risk by taking certain steps to protect workers and customers.“And these include, for instance, avoiding face-to-face seating by changing office layouts, reducing the number of people in enclosed spaces, improving ventilation, using protective screens and face coverings, closing non-essential social spaces, providing hand sanitiser, changing shift patterns so that staff work in set teams.”With guidance replacing legislation, Mr Johnson said he is relying on people using their common sense to limit the spread of the virus.Officials acknowledged that July 4th is a significant step, but remains a long way away from normal life.Among the measures announced by Mr Johnson:However, nightclubs, soft play centres and other businesses that involve close contact will remain shut – including nail bars and beauty salons.Mr Johnson said “difficult judgments” had to be made and “every step is scrupulously weighed against the evidence”.“Our principle is to trust the British public to use their common sense in the full knowledge of the risks, remembering that the more we open up the more vigilant, we will need to be,” he said.From July 4th, two households of any size will be permitted to meet in any setting – inside or out.“It will be possible to meet one set of grandparents one weekend, the others the following weekend,” he said.Under the new arrangements, drinkers returning to pubs will be asked to provide contact details to help trace them if there is an outbreak of coronavirus.Mr Johnson said the measures will help restore a sense of normality after “the toughest restrictions in peacetime history”.He told MPs: “Today, we can say that our long national hibernation is beginning to come to an end and life is returning to our streets and to our shops, the bustle is starting to come back and a new, but cautious, optimism is palpable.”But he said the virus has not gone away and the government “will not hesitate to apply the brakes and re-introduce restrictions – even at national level – if required”. –PAEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com\"/polopoly_fs/1.4192672!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_940/image.jpg","title":"us democratic","story":"The process to choose the Democratic nominee to take on Donald Trump in November’s US presidential election is well under way.States across the country are in the process of choosing\u0026nbsptheir preferred candidate, either through a primary contest or a caucus. A primary is a traditional election where eligible voters select their candidate privately through a ballot system. A caucus is a public process which sees voters align publicly with their chosen candidate at caucus sites.Based roughly on their share of the vote in each state - states have different rules -\u0026nbspcandidates are assigned a number of “delegates”, which will be sent to represent each state at the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in July.On March 3rd – Super Tuesday – 14 states and one overseas territory voted. After a faltering start to the primaries that almost saw him written off, former vice-president Joe Biden got his campaign firmly on track with victory in nine states. Though Vermont senator Bernie Sanders finished first in four states, including delegate-rich California, Super Tuesday checked the Sanders momentum after a strong opening to the primaries in Iowa, New Hampshire and\u0026nbspNevada.On March 10th\u0026nbspsix more states vote, with most of the remaining primaries taking place throughout March and April. The final primary contest takes place on June 7th. However, by the end of March, well over 50 per cent of the delegates will have been allocated.In order to be selected as the party’s nominee at the convention in July, a candidate needs a majority of 50 per cent of delegates plus one, so the magic number is 1,991 pledged delegates out of the total of 3,979.However, with four candidates remaining in the race - Elizabeth Warren and Tulsi Gabbard complete the field, after Michael\u0026nbspBloomberg’s\u0026nbspwithdrawal -\u0026nbspit is possible that no one candidate will have a majority of delegates when Democrats convene in July.Though the rules were changed after the 2016 convention following tensions between the Sanders and Hillary Clinton campaigns, so-called superdelegates - unpledged delegates - still play a role. These are senior members of the party – governors, former members of Congress, etc. Their 771 votes come into play if the convention is contested, which is\u0026nbspa possibility.Notably, six of the candidates were asked during a debate in Las Vegas on February 19th if they would support the idea of a candidate winning the nomination if they secured a plurality but not a majority of the delegates. All but one – Sanders – said they were opposed to this.

Over the whole of Germany in the past seven days there were 3,280 new cases of Covid-19. That works out as 3.9 per 100,000 people. What does that look like? Think a mid-sized town like Bath, Worcester or Rochdale and imagine that four people caught the virus last week. Oh, and only one of them showed any symptoms. That is the extent of Covid-19 in Germany at present.The apparent acceleration in Germany\u0027s R number shows the foolishness of focusing so much on a single figure. The R number might have some meaning in the right circumstances, but publishing a single R for Germany doesn’t mean a lot at present. The rise in the number is entirely due to an outbreak in an abattoir in the town of Gutersloh in the region of North Rhine Westphalia, where 650 workers were found to have the virus. That is a closed environment kept at a chilled temperature which seems to have been an ideal place to promote the spread of the virus. It tells us nothing about Covid-19 in the rest of Germany where, according to the Robert Koch Institute, the epidemic continues to decline.  The R number is, in any case, only a crude estimate. It is the average number of people onto whom each infected inidual is estimated to have passed the virus. Except no-one really knows how anybody catches the virus.  Did the abattoir workers catch it by being coughed over by their colleagues in the work canteen? Did they catch it via some sort of cleaning process, involving a fine spray of water droplets, or from contact with a cold surface on which the virus was present?  If investigators have any insight into this they haven’t revealed it so far. All we do know is that abattoirs around the world have had a problem with Covid 19 – and that the conditions within them have little resemblance to the outside world. The models used to calculate the R number, however, are just looking at the raw mathematics of it. Paradoxically, the abattoir outbreak would have had a lower impact on Germany’s R number had the nationwide incidence of the disease been much higher. It has come out at a shocking 2.88 because there are few cases elsewhere in the country to dilute the infections at the plant.When the history of Covid-19 comes to be written, one issue which will need addressing is how mass fear was spread by the constant feeding of statistics by government and their agencies – figures which many people struggled to put into perspective. Here’s just a little more perspective. Germany so far has recorded 8,882 deaths from Covid 19.  That is less than 1 per cent of the approximately one million people who die in Germany every year.    More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"17 cities counties had no confirmed covid 19 cases last week","story":"More than one in 10 cities, counties or London boroughs went without a single new lab-confirmed case of Covid-19 last week, according to a  analysis of Public Health England figures.Of the 150 upper tier local authorities in England, 17 recorded no new cases in the week ending 20 June, with one of these areas not recording a single case for nearly a month.You can get the figures for your area by using our postcode search tool below.The number of people testing positive for the virus and the number dying with the virus have steadily declined since lockdown restrictions were introduced nearly three months ago.Boris Johnson is widely expected to continue the easing of lockdown restrictions at tonight\u0027s Downing Street press conference, with an anticipated revision to the two-metre rule as well as further guidance on family bubbles.The 17 areas that have seen no officially recorded cases in the past week range from all over England with one of the standout areas being York, where the first UK\u0027s recorded case of Covid-19 emerged in late January.According to the figures York hasn\u0027t seen an increase in lab-confirmed cases since June 2 when its total rose by one to 461.Rutland - another of the 17 - hasn\u0027t seen a new recorded case since May 27. The full list of areas is detailed in the table below.On a per capita basis, Bedford had the highest rate of positive tests in the country with 24 cases recorded last week. However, this is half the equivalent figure of 48 recorded for the previous week.These figures should be taken with a pinch of salt due to the many problems around the UK\u0027s use of testing.In theory, everybody who needs a test for the virus should now be able to get them. However, survey data compiled by the ONS and by symptom tracking apps estimates that there could be many cases per day that are not being picked up in official figures.The Covid Symptom Study, run by ZOE and King\u0027s College London, estimates there are are around 3,600 new cases of the virus per day compared to Public Health England\u0027s latest totals of around 1,200.Additionally, Public Health England\u0027s figures do not represent the number of people testing positive, just the number of tests coming back as positive. In some cases there will be double counting with nasal and throat swabs from the same person counting as two different tests.The regional data will also be affected by the ability of the testers to attribute cases to a given area.Despite all of these caveats, the general trend of lab-confirmed cases is a downward one. That the virus is in decline in the UK is also supported by deaths data and call volumes to NHS 111.The drop in new cases detected has been most pronounced in London, which saw, on average, 13 new cases a day in the week to June 20.At its peak in early April, more than 850 cases a day were being uncovered in the capital, with more than 1,000 cases on April 2.In the week leading up to lockdown over 400 cases a day were being detected in London, on average. Within England, the South West weathered the virus best, with fewer than 8,000 cases detected. London and the North West have seen more than 27,000 cases each.Every region in England is now seeing detection rates far below the levels seen when lockdown was imposed on March 23, with reductions of more than 60 per cent between the week to March 23 and the week ending June 20. Across the North East and South West, fewer than 10 cases a day are now being detected on average.The North West remains the hotspot since the epicentre of the virus shifted from London, and is now averaging 38 new cases a day, down from a peak of over 100 in the week leading up to lockdown, and more than 746 at its peak in mid-April.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"inside florida model gods waiting room could point way managing","story":"On Monday, Florida hit the grim milestone of 100,000 confirmed coronavirus cases, following a series of record daily totals.But the headline figure is far from the full story. On that same day there were only 12 deaths, and 82 people hospitalised, in a state of 22 million people, which has so many elderly retirees it is known as “God\u0027s waiting room.Florida\u0027s mortality rate - the proportion of deaths per positive cases - has fallen to just 3.4 per cent. That compares to 5.2 per cent for the United States, and the same globally. The UK\u0027s rate is 14 per cent.Most startling of all, the average age of people testing positive has plummeted from 65 in March to 35 now. In some Florida counties it is under 30.The figures reflect the Sunshine State\u0027s strategy of protecting the elderly, while allowing the young and healthy to proceed with life as much as possible.It is an approach not dissimilar to what was originally proposed in the UK and, with the addition of focusing on the elderly, what has played out in Sweden. Going forward, it could provide a model for how the virus can best be managed.If anywhere was set for catastrophe when coronavirus emerged, it was Florida. The state has 691 nursing homes, with about 85,000 beds, and over 3,000 assisted-living facilities, with 106,000 beds.And it is home to numerous resorts for the elderly, including mega-retirement community The Villages, the largest in America, which has over 130,000 senior citizens, with an average age of 70.From the start the approach of Ron DeSantis, the Republican governor of Florida, was simple - shield the elderly, and let others carry on because they are less likely to get seriously ill, and contribute more to the economy.The result has been a lot of cases, but less deaths, and less pressure on the state\u0027s health system.No special measures were introduced for the elderly. But repeated appeals were made for over-65s to stay home, and avoid crowds. Ultimately, it was each inidual\u0027s decision, but they listened.When the first case was confirmed in The Villages on March 19 public events there had already stopped, and restaurants had switched to takeaway. Churches immediately made services online or drive-thru only.Days later, Mr DeSantis unveiled what he called the most innovative testing site in the country at The Villages. It was a drive-thru centre that tested anyone, regardless of symptoms, and returned results within 72 hours. Testing went on for a month. Scientists hailed it as a global example.Ultimately, despite predictions the virus would devastate The Villages, less than 100 cases have been detected there.Meanwhile, Florida is nearing completion of testing everyone in all its nursing homes. All nursing staff are being tested every two weeks. The governor ordered the National Guard to help with testing.We have a lot of large retirement communities, but overall Florida didn\u0027t get to the point the models predicted we were going to hit. Our older people took note of the need to protect themselves.The shift in cases is in part thanks to them continuing those practices, and younger folks not.Experts like Professor Prins are still worried by the recent spike.The preference is to not have this many cases. this is not a desirable situation. Certainly when we look at younger cases, they\u0027re not hospitalised as often, not as likely to die, she said. But the 25-year-old may still go visit grandma and grandpa.Mr DeSantis was highly reluctant to issue any kind of statewide stay-at-home order, eventually doing so in April, and then starting to reopen as soon as possible in early May.Now, restaurants and bars are operating at 50 per cent capacity, or 100 per cent outdoors. He has not mandated masks.Since Memorial Day on May 25, Floridians have flocked to beaches. Images of sun worshippers avoiding social distancing have given public health officials apoplexy.But the governor is pleased at how the average age for positive cases has shifted in a radical direction younger.Speaking last week in Miami, he said: A trend that’s very important is what is the median age of those people who are testing positive. Those under 40, in particular, who don’t have any underlying conditions are much, much less likely to be hospitalised or to suffer a fatality. We’re not rolling back.The figures appear to back up Mr DeSantis\u0027s approach.Florida has the third highest population of any US state, including a very high proportion of vulnerable elderly people, yet it has had the ninth most deaths - 3,173.That equates to 147 deaths per one million people, far below the US average of 368 per million. For the UK it is 641 deaths per million, whereas New York\u0027s figure is 1,602. Florida is also testing aggressively, with 41,028 tests conducted on Saturday. On that day the percentage of positive tests was 14 per cent, compared to less than six per cent in preceding months. It reflects contact tracing efforts aimed at getting people treated quickly.Meanwhile, doctors have reported the falling age of patients easing pressures on them. In Broward County, the length of hospital admission has fallen from an average of 10 days to six.At the start of the pandemic elderly patients from nursing homes and cruise ships required long stays. Now, the vast majority of younger patients are not admitted, and sent home to recuperate.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"rebekah vardy suing coleen rooney leaked instagram stories saga","story":"Footballers\u0027 wives Rebekah Vardy and Coleen Rooney are set to face off in the High Court in a £1million libel battle over claims stories were sold to the tabloids. Mrs Rooney - wife of former England captain Wayne Rooney - claimed that she had deliberately been posting fake stories on her personal Instagram account to find out who was leaking information to The Sun newspaper. After a five-month investigation, she sensationally alleged that the culprit was the account belonging to Rebekah Vardy - wife of England striker Jamie Vardy. A social media tit-for-tat during which Mrs Vardy protested her innocence did not settle the dispute.Now, according to court papers, Mrs Vardy, 38, is suing Mrs Rooney, 34 for libel for the claims she made about her on social media. Court records indicate that Vardy filed her claim with the High Court on June 12.No further details are available at this stage, and no date has been set for a court hearing, but the case will proceed to a trial unless a settlement is reached between the parties.Sources close to the WAGs have told The Sun that legal costs from each side are expected to top £500,000.It was a whodunnit which was labelled \u0027Wagatha Christie\u0027.Coleen Rooney, wife of former England footballer Wayne and no shrinking violet when it comes to publicity, was perplexed as to how stories about her family were appearing in the tabloid press.So to catch the mystery mole, she set a trap. And after a five-month investigation, she caught the alleged culprit an account belonging to her fellow footballer’s wife Rebekah Vardy.She announced the findings of her inquiry on October 10 last year, prompting a huge reaction. Netflix promised to make a documentary on the saga, while Conservative MPs praised her ability to flush out nuisance leakers.Even international trade secretary Liz Truss waded into the debate. She said: There has been a massive fallout between some very influential people figures in our country that has ided the nation.There has been finger-pointing, there has been blame-shifting and there has been denials. But enough about Coleen Rooney and Rebekah Vardy.The MP went on to add what a fantastic British export football was.The stories at the centre of the mystery included such family secrets as Ms Rooney’s trip to Mexico to “make a baby girl”, her plans to resurrect her TV career on Strictly, and even a flood in the basement of their mansion.But in a surprise post, Mrs Rooney told her 1.2 million followers that she had invented the stories in a bid to work out who was sharing stories from her private Instagram account.Rooney, 33, said she came up with an idea, and that she blocked everyone apart from an Instagram page belonging to Ms Vardy from seeing her posts.She added: Over the past five months I have posted a series of false stories to see if they made their way into the Sun newspaper.And, you know what, they did! The story about gender selection in Mexico, the story about returning to TV, and then the latest story about the basement flooding in my new house.Now I know for certain which accountinidual it\u0027s come from.I have saved and screenshotted all the original stories which clearly show just one person has viewed them.Each of the stories apparently invented by Mrs Rooney were indeed published by the Sun newspaper. All were swiftly deleted.Ms Vardy then wrote back to Mrs Rooney claiming that various people have had access to her account, adding: I\u0027m not being funny but I don\u0027t need the money, what would I gain from selling stories on you?Vardy, who was on holiday in Dubai and pregnant with her fifth child at the time, said she was so upset that Rooney had made the accusation, adding: I\u0027m disgusted that I\u0027m even having to deny this.You should have called me the first time this happened.The Sun refused to reveal at the time whether it had paid money for the fake stories about the Rooneys. Mrs Vardy has been interviewed a number of times by the newspaper in months leading up to the sensational claims, where she opened up about violent relationships and alleged abuse she suffered as a child.Mrs Rooney’s detective work was met with widespread incredulity online, and was discussed by celebrities and politicians.Gavin Barwell MP, former chief of staff to Theresa May,  said the episode was a sadly all too rare moment when you can identify a leaker, while Greg Hands MP jokingly invited Ms Rooney to become a Conservative whip.Mrs Vardy is a former nightclub worker who once dated Luke Foster, a footballer in the lower leagues. He later accused her of dropping him to trade up to Mr Vardy, who was playing in the Premier League.During the Euro 2016 tournament it was reported that Wayne Rooney had warned Vardy about his wife’s social media posts. Roy Hodgson was forced to deny the story during a press conference.There were also rumours - denied by Mrs Vardy - that she had fallen out with Ms Rooney over the use of VIP seats.A statement from the Sun newspaper said: Each of the stories provided to The Sun was put to Coleen\u0027s representatives before publication, and on each occasion they declined to comment.In her statement, Coleen Rooney said she posted false stories on her social media account in the hope that they would end up in The Sun. Those she claimed to have fabricated include the story about gender selection in Mexico - an article which appeared on page 11 of the paper on Friday, August 16.The following month, The Sun reported that Mrs Rooney was resurrecting her television career by appearing on Strictly Come Dancing. The story appeared on page 19 on Sunday, September 29.In October 10\u0027s paper - which appears to be the straw that broke the camel\u0027s back - The Sun published a story which again Mrs Rooney said was fake. In its Bizarre showbiz section, the paper reported that the Rooneys\u0027 new £20million mansion had flooded. Mrs Vardy responded to the tweet with a statement of her own denying she had anything to do with the stories. The Sun has reported on Rooney and Vardy\u0027s exchange and their article states: Each of the stories provided to The Sun was put to Coleen\u0027s representatives before publication, and on each occasion they declined to comment.Read more: I don\u0027t know if I\u0027ve ever cared about anything as much as I care about Coleen vs RebekahMore from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"rules lockdown uk guidelines latest","story":"The move will enable pubs, restaurants, cinemas and other businesses to be run profitably when they are allowed to reopen on the same day, and will change the way in which schools, shops, transport and workplaces can operate.Mr Johnson told MPs the rate of infection in the community – as opposed to hospitals and care homes – is now low enough to relax the social distancing rule as long as steps are taken to mitigate the risk of people being closer together.Face coverings will be needed in some indoor locations, perspex screens could be used between tables in restaurants and al fresco dining will be encouraged to minimise the risk of transmission.A Downing Street spokesman said: After a long period of asking the public to follow very strict and complex rules, the Government believes we are now in a position to enable people to see more of their friends and family.The infection rate has fallen significantly in the first half of June. Only one in 1,700 people have the virus, compared with an average of one in 400 a month ago.Where it is not possible to stay two metres apart, people are advised instead to keep one metre plus apart – meaning one metre apart plus mitigation.But I must say to the House it will be all too easy for that frost to return. And that is why we will continue to trust in the common sense and the community spirit of the British people to follow this guidance, to carry us through, and to see us to victory over this virus.Families will be allowed to meet groups of relations or friends indoors for the first time since lockdown began – but there will be a ban on hugging or touching.From July 4, any two households can meet together under the same roof, and even stay overnight, as long as they observe social distancing. That means families could invite one set of grandparents over for lunch and then see the other set of grandparents for dinner, as long as they are not there at the same time.The new rule also allows any two households to meet up in a pub, restaurant, museum or cinema, or even go on holiday together. There will be no limit on how many people can gather, as long as no more than two households are meeting at the same time.The Government decided against an alternative plan to allow two entire households to form one social bubble, partly because it would have forced families to choose which set of relations they could see.Existing rules allowing up to six people from up to six different households to meet outdoors remain in place, as does the rule that allows someone living alone to join a support bubble (see below) with another household and be treated as if they live in the same home.Downing Street admitted people would need to show a lot of discipline and restraint to adhere to the new rules, such as preventing children from hugging grandparents, but stressed that the changes would be swiftly reversed if coronavirus started to spread again .A Number 10 spokesman said: Your household will be able to link with one other household at a time, which includes staying over at someone\u0027s house.This is not a bubble because households should continue to remain socially distant from one another when they are indoors or outdoors, so they will need to stay two metres apart or follow the new one-metre plus advice.Mr Johnson said he trusted in the common sense of the British people to make the new rules work.Hotels, pubs and restaurants will be allowed to reopen from July 4, but customers will be banned from propping up the bar and will have to register their contact details before entering. This will allow customers to sit closer together in venues where it is not possible for them to be two metres apart, so long as there are additional mitigating measures in place. New safety guidance, due to be issued later, will set out a menu of options for hospitality bosses to use as part of the new system. These include more back-to-back seating, perspex screens, partitions between tables, disposable menus and more cleaning of commonly touched surface areas. Waiters will be required to wipe down surfaces more often and collect glasses and plates more frequently. People will be discouraged to return their glass or order from the bar, with more table service and mobile apps expected to be introduced. The changes will also place limits on the number of people who can sit together indoors in pubs and restaurants, with just two households of any size permitted to drink or eat together. To assist the test and trace system, customers will be required to register their details with a venue before entry.Show some guts! he told holiday makers during his statement to the House of Commons.But the mass reopening will come with a number of conditions attached. Recommendations to stop coronavirus from spreading including emptying mini bars, offering buffet-free breakfasts and regularly deep cleaning rooms - with 24 hours left between bookings. All paperwork is likely to be removed from rooms, along with the telephone, while the plastic pouch containing tea and coffee sachets will either be removed or quarantined for upto 72 hours between guests.Those checking in should expect to see social distancing stickers on the floor, perspex screens at the reception desk and hand sanitiser throughout. Mr Johnson also gave campsites, caravan parks and self-catering accommodation the green-light to reopen from July 4 “as long as shared facilities are kept clean”.It is thought campsites will be instructed to ensure tents are pitched further apart than normal so that social distancing measures can be adhered to along with the frequent deeping cleaning of facility blocks like the showers. Some campsites will be required to reduce the number of pitches to keep numbers down. Campers are likely be told they cannot have day visitors to further limit the numbers on site. Communal areas such as receptions, shops, laundries and play grounds are likely to remain closed with guests advised to bring all their own essentials including gas canisters.As with hotels and other overnight accommodation, guests will be asked to pay in advance and use contactless payment rather than cash. Changes to the rules, allowing two households to meet up, mean that two families will now be able to go on holiday together.The Prime Minister confirmed: “From 4th July, provided that no more than two households stay together, people will be free to stay overnight in self-contained accommodation, including hotels and bed \u0026amp breakfasts.”He did not give any further specific details on air bridges, but said: “Our plans for quarantine will be based of course entirely on public health. We will not be led by any excessive desire to risk life by opening up the economy too fast.” The UK\u0027s controversial 14-day quarantine policy is up for review on June 29, by which time an announcement is expected to be made regarding air bridges that would enable European holidays, with frontrunners including Spain, Greece and Portugal. Mr Johnson did not specifically mention Britain’s 2.2 million shielded people in his statement to the House of Commons.However on Monday, Heath Secretary Matt Hancock announced that this “extremely clinically vulnerable” group would finally be able to meet friends and visit relatives’ homes from July 6.Shielded people, who are considered to be the most medically vulnerable to the effects of coronavirus, including those with lung conditions such as cystic fibrosis and people being treated for cancer, will be able to meet up to five other people outdoors after being virtual prisoners in their own homes for the past three months.If they live alone they will also be able to form a “support bubble” with one other household, meaning they can visit their families and even stay overnight with them. It is hoped that the infection rate will be low enough for shielding to end all together at the end of July, though help will still be available from NHS volunteers and local councils.As long as they continue strict social distancing measures, shielded people will be able to visit supermarkets and places of worship and those who cannot work from home will be able to return as long as their workplace adheres to Government guidance.Until now, the only easing of lockdown for shielded people has been allowing them to go outside once a day with their household or, if they live alone, to meet one other person at a two-metre distance.Boris Johnson said that this year Easter , Passover and Eid all occurred during the lockdown and that he was pleased to announce that places of worship will reopen for prayer and services, including weddings with a maximum of 30 people, all subject to social distancing.Weddings will restart from July 4, with up to 30 people able to attend ceremonies under social distancing rules. However, at present only two households will be permitted to attend a wedding reception held at an indoor hospitality venue afterwards.From July 4, provided they are Covid-19 compliant:More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"uk support bubbles new social distancing rules","story":"These include a new one-metre-plus rule for all venues, including shops, restaurants, schools, offices, and parks, in an overhaul designed to unlock swathes of the economy.The move, which will take effect from July 4, will allow people to remain a metre away from others if they take additional measures to protect themselves, such as wearing a mask or meeting outdoors.The Prime Minister said: Today, we can say that our long national hibernation is beginning to come to an end, and life is returning to our streets and to our shops, the bustle is starting to come back and new but cautious optimism is palpable.But I must say to the House it will be all too easy for that frost to return. And that is why we will continue to trust in the common sense and the community spirit of the British people to follow this guidance, to carry us through, and to see us to victory over this virus.These measures should allow people to reunite with their parents or both sets of grandparents, provided that they are not shielding, or to see multiple friends from different households, while keeping a safe social distance.Families will be allowed to meet groups of relations or friends indoors for the first time since lockdown began - but there will be a ban on hugging or touching.From July 4 any two households can meet together under the same roof, and even stay overnight, as long as they observe social distancing.It means families could invite one set of grandparents over for lunch and then see the other grandparents for dinner, as long as they are not there at the same time.For overnight stays, up to two households will be free to stay in self-contained accommodation, as long as shared facilities are kept clean and distancing is maintained.Existing rules that allow up to six people from up to six different households to meet outdoors remain in place, as does the rule that allows someone living alone to join a “support bubble” with another household and be treated as if they live in the same home.Downing Street admitted that people would need to show a lot of discipline and restraint to adhere to the new rules, but stressed that if the virus started to spread again the changes would be swiftly reversed.People can now also see friends or family in certain circumstances as part of the newly introduced \u0027support bubbles\u0027.On June 10 the Prime Minister announced that, from the weekend of June 13 and 14, single-adult households - adults living alone, or single parents who have children under the age of 18 - would be able to form \u0027support bubbles\u0027 with one other household.All those in a support bubble will be able to act as if they live in the same household, meaning they can spend time inside each other\u0027s homes and do not need stay two metres apart, Mr Johnson said.He added that support bubbles must be exclusive, meaning that people cannot switch the house that they are in a bubble with, and cannot connect with multiple households. If one person in the bubble develops symptoms, all members will need to follow the advice on self-isolation for the following two weeks.Anyone who is currently shielding due to medical vulnerability is not allowed to form or take part in a support bubble at this stage.However, people who are currently shielding can meet in groups from July 6, the Health Secretary has said - with shielding coming to a stop at the end of July.From this date, those shielding can meet with people outside of their household outdoors in groups of six - as long as social distancing is maintained.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"watch brussels shoddy coronavirus response has proved brexiteers","story":"Tuesday marks four years since the historic vote in which Britons voted to leave the European Union.What has been made abundantly clear is what Brexiteers have known all along: the clunky and expensive European Union is more interested in posturing and pointless rules than delivering anything meaningful for its people. The coronavirus pandemic has laid bare, warts and all, just how ineffective the EU can be.Watch the video above to find out why.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/06/23/07/michael-keaton-4.jpg","title":"batman michael keaton the flash return casting dc","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Actor previously played the role in ‘Batman’ and ‘Batman Returns’Michael Keaton is reportedly in talks to reprise the role of Batman in the forthcoming The Flash film.The actor previously played the title character in Tim Burton‘s Batman (1989) and Batman Returns (1992). The Flash will focus on the lightning-quick superhero played by Ezra Miller, who made his debut in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice and appeared again in Justice League.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAccording to reports, the plot will ignore the two films that followed Batman Returns, the Joel Schumacher-directed Batman Forever and Batman \u0026amp Robin. The story will be based on the 2011 comic Flashpoint, in which The Flash travels back in time to save his mother’s life.If the talks prove successful, this will be the first time Keaton has played the caped crusader since 1992. In recent years, he has appeared as the Marvel supervillain The Vulture in 2017’s Spider-man: Homecoming, and as an actor best known for playing a batman-like superhero in Birdman in 2014.Joel Schumacher, director of Batman and The Lost Boys, dies aged 80How Christopher Nolan’s Batman Begins changed the fate of James BondRobert Pattinson refuses to work out constantly for Batman roleSince Keaton left the Batman franchise, a number of other actors have stepped in to play the caped crusader, to varying levels of acclaim, including Val Kilmer, George Clooney, Christian Bale and Ben Affleck.Robert Pattinson is set to be the next actor to take up the mantel, when he stars in Matt Reeves’s The Batman.Affleck’s Batman will also be returning to screens on HBO Max, as it was revealed that director Zack Snyder has been given the go-ahead to re-edit Justice League into a longer cut.

Am I the black spokesperson?”He then told Morgan that, while he has “a bunch of views” to share, he felt that “now is not the time” to speak about them.Meet Che Lingo, the London rapper confronting police brutalityHow the art world can step up for Black Lives Matter“I’ve brought my afro out, I’m looking a bit natural and so maybe that’s why you’re asking the question, but not today,” he said.

You’re a high-profile black man in this country, and it’s been a huge issue and has been a huge news story for four weeks.”Dizzee, attempting to get a word in, replied: “You know what, I watch you on telly and you never let no one speak. You’re not going to do this to me, mate. Let’s keep it calm.”After Morgan called his response “aggressive”, Dizzee – laughing – replied: “This is what happens – I become the aggressive black man! I just wanted to be nice, and look how he’s behaving.”Viewers praised the rapper for “totally owning” Morgan.“Dizzee Rascal has made everyone’s morning,” one tweeter wrote, adding: ”I love watching Piers Morgan squirm for once. Totally owned haha.”Another added: “I’m so happy the way Dizzee Rascal called out Piers Morgan for asking him about BLM on GMB – why does every white host ask every black person about BLM, but not white people?!”“Dizzee Rascal what a bloke,” one person concluded. “Sticking Piers Morgan in his place whilst fishing to stir up more issues when he’s got positive things to talk about.”The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They amount to: now, soon, or later.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesDevelopers can get hold of the new update straight away, by downloading it from within Apple\u0027s website. Users can just head to the download page if they are signed in as a registered developer, get hold of the profile, and then simply go to the software update part of settings which should begin the install.There are tools to get hold of the update through that process floating around on the internet, through a variety of illicit channels. But that is not recommended – not only does it break Apple\u0027s rules, the early version of the software is risky, and could cause problems for any device that it is used on.Apple finally adds two of the most requested features to the iPhoneThe easier and safer way to get hold of the software sooner is to join Apple\u0027s public beta programme, through which the software will be available next month. You can sign up to that now, through Apple\u0027s special page, and the update will arrive when it is pushed out to the public.While the new features in the new operating system change some of the most fundamental parts of the iPhone, there are limited alterations to the architecture underpinning it, meaning that joining that public beta is less likely to pose any major risk to phones or the data stored on them. It could also mean that the public beta opens earlier in the month rather than later,If you want to wait for the full version – which is without a doubt the safest and most hassle-free way of getting the new software – then it will almost certainly come out alongside the new iPhone, in September.Created with Sketch.Apple shows off new updates for iPhone, Macs and more Show all 9Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.19 Apple CEO Tim Cook described WWDC 2020 as \u0027game-changing\u0027For the first time in its 31-year history, Apple\u0027s annual developer conference was held entirely online.A new operating system brings fundamental changes to the iPhone\u0027s home screen, app organisation and widgets.New features for Apple\u0027s smartwatch allows wearers to track how long they sleep.Amid a global pandemic, Apple released a new function to encourage people to wash their hands.59 Spatial audio for AirPodsUsing motion tracking within the AirPods Pro, the sound produced in Apple\u0027s headphones is no longer static.A complete redesign for its computer operating system changes the look of icons and windows.Apple\u0027s Safari web browser now allows users to customise their starting page.A host of new Memoji features include a wide range of age settings for the custom animoji.Arguably the biggest update was with the Mac chips, which will now be made by Apple.19 Apple CEO Tim Cook described WWDC 2020 as \u0027game-changing\u0027For the first time in its 31-year history, Apple\u0027s annual developer conference was held entirely online.A new operating system brings fundamental changes to the iPhone\u0027s home screen, app organisation and widgets.New features for Apple\u0027s smartwatch allows wearers to track how long they sleep.Amid a global pandemic, Apple released a new function to encourage people to wash their hands.59 Spatial audio for AirPodsUsing motion tracking within the AirPods Pro, the sound produced in Apple\u0027s headphones is no longer static.A complete redesign for its computer operating system changes the look of icons and windows.Apple\u0027s Safari web browser now allows users to customise their starting page.A host of new Memoji features include a wide range of age settings for the custom animoji.Arguably the biggest update was with the Mac chips, which will now be made by Apple.Apple didn\u0027t give any explicit date of when the new release would come, only mentioning this fall, but the updates have run on a fairly predictable schedule of coming out just before the new handset.

Two of the stores – in Ross-on-Wye and Leominster – reopened on Monday 15 June.“Being able to shop in person, especially at smaller independents, is a joy,” owner Andy Rossiter, pictured above, says. “I think lockdown made a lot of people realise that they don’t want all their shopping to just land at their door, but booksellers also know they need to work hard for their audience. It’s not simply a case of just opening your doors.”Rossiter has been busy preparing the stores, moving fixtures and checkouts so that staff and customers can socially distance while browsing for books.Carry out a risk assessment: employers will need to carry out Covid-19 risk assessments in consultation with their workers or trade unions.Maintain social distancing: employers should redesign workspaces to maintain social distancing between people and stagger start times.Manage transmission risk:\u0026nbspemployers should look into putting barriers in shared spaces, creating workplace shift patterns or fixed teams.Reinforcing cleaning processes: workplaces should be cleaned more frequently, paying close attention to\u0026nbspdoor handles and keyboards.“We have installed Perspex screens at till points, bought hand sanitiser stations for the entrances to our stores and placed tape and signage throughout so we can clearly indicate the social distancing rules within our stores,” he says.The bookshops have reopened with less members of staff and they have limited their opening hours from their pre-lockdown seven days to just five. Rossiter has also been consulting staff and getting their input on the UK Government’s coronavirus advice.“Our trade body, the Booksellers Association, has been brilliant at reading and interpreting this advice to make it bookshop-specific and releasing it in digestible and accessible weekly bulletins, he says.“Booksellers love serving customers, and we’ve been serving our local community for a decade, so seeing those regulars again and having that relationship start to return to normal will be fantastic.Surinder Josan, owner of All Seasons DIY, a family-run shop, explains how he has used strict safe workplace measures to keep his shop doors open and his businesses afloat.“All Seasons DIY is a family-run shop which was established over 40 years ago, run by myself, my wife, and my mother. My son and daughter work in the shop around their university studies as well,” Josan, below, says.The family decided to shut the shop when school closures were announced. But after just a week they decided to reopen the business in order to serve the local community, who relied on the store for essential food and other items.“In order to reopen, we had to reassess how we both serve and interact with our customers,” Josan explains. “We adopted several new measures to comply with social distancing to keep both ourselves and our customers safe.”These new measures they adopted included safe distance markers outside the shop, to limit the number of people in store at any one time, installing screens at the checkout areas, encouraging contactless payments, lowering the minimum card spend to £1, and offering hand wipes to customers.“The number of customers who have come in and complimented us for it is unbelievable. They say when they come here they feel really safe,” Josan adds.Blend Coffee Co is an independent coffee shop based in Portslade, East Sussex, near Brighton. The two directors behind the business, Oli Crawley and Tom Jennion, have introduced a range of measures so they could confidently reopen for staff and customers.“Our primary concern is to keep people safe, so to make sure our coffee shop was ready to be reopened we implemented a number of safer working measures,” says Crawley.These new measures included a deep clean of the shop prior to reopening, implementation of a new ordering layout and adopting a new policy which stipulates that no customers are allowed inside the store.Working alongside Crawley and Jennion are a further three members of staff.“Only the directors returned to work to alleviate any pressure on our barista team feeling they need to work,” says Crawley. “This also allows an operational analysis of all our new protocols to ensure they are efficient and safe.”The checkout system has now been moved to the front of the shop, Blend now only accepts card payments and there is a new waiting area outside the shop.This plan was developed after we undertook a risk assessment and analysis of the premises to ensure that customer-staff interaction could be maintained and sustained in a safe manner. We ran a test prior to reopening to ensure that our new measures would work and allow us and our customers to stay safe,” adds Crawley.For further information from the UK Government on how employers, employees and the self-employed can return to work safely, click hereThis is Government advice for EnglandWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Unfortunately, not long after her return, jobs began to get cancelled because of the intensifying Covid-19 crisis.She started looking for something else right away – and is currently living and working on New Moor Farm in Southminster, Essex, working with asparagus, having swapped fashion for food.Though a far cry from a usual career, Philip is enjoying her new setting. “Right now, I live on site on the farm, in one of the caravans in the orchard. It’s nice,” she explains. “The community is amazing. There are so many different characters on the farm. Everyone is really friendly and we’re all here for the same reasons: to help and to work.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHer day-to-day routine varies. “Most days I’m up at five, start working at six on the farm, in the packhouse,” she says. “Generally, I’m doing a little bit of everything, so I’m helping on the line, bundling, helping customers, grading – just helping out wherever I can.”Philip is among Brits across the country working on farms in order to help the industry continue despite the many obstacles presented by the Covid-19 pandemic.The temporary closure of much of the food and hospitality industry has left huge quantities of fresh produce at risk of going to waste. The pubs and restaurants that would usually purchase large amounts of vegetables remain shut and travel restrictions have prevented pickers from overseas working on the farms.Join the Pick For BritainThat’s why the Government is urging fit and healthy people looking for work across the country to get involved. The Pick For Britain initiative is helping to bring workers and employers together to ensure the farming industry can continue.From furloughed employees whose contracts allow them to work during this time, to university students on their summer breaks, it’s a great opportunity to earn money and meet new people – while helping Britain’s food industry during these unprecedented times.The growing season is only just getting started, so from now until September, bringing in the harvest requires a major effort. Visit pickforbritain.org.uk to find out moreEat seasonal and local vegBut that’s not the only way to support the industry right now. Simply eating more in-season local produce will help to prevent wastage.A wide range of vegetables are currently being harvested in the UK. These include asparagus, cucumbers, mushrooms, courgettes, spinach, summer squash, radishes, beetroot and tomatoes – and buying and cooking with this seasonal veg is a great way to contribute to the farming industry.​In need of some recipe inspo?

That’s why there\u0027s never been a better time to try something new.Among the wide range of different species found in UK waters are mussels, crab, mackerel, herring, rainbow trout, hake and coley (or saithe).

Viruferrin has been scientifically proven to block 98 per cent of similar viruses to Covid-19, including influenza and Sars.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe snood-like coverings can be worn for up to 50 hours before they need washing, and their effectiveness only drops to 96 per cent after over 200 hours of wear.The face coverings are cut and sewn together by Cookson \u0026amp Clegg in Blackburn, which is run by Patrick Grant, star of the Great British Sewing Bee. He is also behind a campaign to get Britons making their own coverings, The Great Community Sew.How to support our campaignThe coverings, which retail at £20, are different to medical grade PPE used by NHS workers. However, due to the protein coverings they are more effective than standard face masks at protecting wearers from viruses.There was a buzz at the Royal Park Felix Project depot when boxes of Virustatic Shield coverings arrived.David Clark, who has been volunteering for three years, said: “I think it is important to wear these face coverings when you’re delivering to members of the public who potentially come into contact with vulnerable people.”Mr Clark dropped off some coverings to Ian Breen, centre manager at Acton Homeless Concern, which serves hot meals five days a week to those in temporary accommodation or on the streets. Mr Breen said: “It is fantastic to have a delivery of some masks for free. It is important to protect those working here and the people who use our centre.”Gretchen Fisher, from Ealing, who has been volunteering for four years, added: “I wear them whenever I go out as you have to protect others.” Mantas Keblis, the depot manager, said that having “extra precautions” would help food reach more people in London. “Everyone really likes them. They are very comfortable to wear.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And today, because of the enormous generosity of Virustatic Shield, whose innovative anti-viral snoods we’ve also been producing, 10,000 of London’s most vulnerable people will receive a vital face covering, delivered to them via The Independent’s fantastic campaign.Which star will you bid for in Peter Blake’s big hotel cover auction?Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mHow Help The Hungry is helping refugees forced to live on £5 a day It is now mandatory to wear face coverings on public transport, but these coverings are in short supply.That’s why we started The Big Community Sew to encourage people to make face coverings for their friends and neighbours, and by doing so preserve vital supplies of PPE for NHS workers and care home staff who are fighting this virus on the frontline.The science behind face coverings is simple: they help prevent the wearer from unwittingly spreading the disease.

It is a fabulous way of making life worth living.”Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mDame Judi said: “How wonderful that Peter Blake’s amazing artwork will have a new lease of life for such good causes.

We fight for our life, we fight for the life of our brothers, and this is the feeling I have when I contemplate Sir Peter Blake’s masterpiece! A hundred stars that reflect the ersity of our world fighting to help Help the Hungry.

Of these, it cautions, only 1 million are eligible for the government’s free school meal summer holiday voucher of £15 a week, with the remaining 2 million living with parents who narrowly do not qualify but cannot always afford food.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHelen Barnard, of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, confirmed that the summer voucher scheme – agreed by the prime minister after being forced into a U-turn by footballer Marcus Rashford – only covers a minority of children in poverty. She said: “Soaring numbers of families are being pulled under and having to rely on food banks to get through the current crisis, even with the voucher scheme in place.”The harsh reality is that an astounding 66 per cent of food-insecure families – amounting to almost 200,000 children in London – cannot access government help and are forced to rely on food parcels from charities such as The Felix Project.Food and 10,000 face coverings donated to charities and vulnerableWhich star will you bid for in Peter Blake’s big hotel cover auction?Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mHow Help The Hungry is helping refugees forced to live on £5 a day At the start of lockdown, The Felix Project faced an existential crisis with a total collapse of its fundraising.

Our pledge is given added urgency by the release of worrying economic data, including that the number of people out of work and claiming benefits jumped 23 per cent to 2.8 million last month.”Jo West, of Ocado Retail, said most of its donation had been raised from Ocado and their customers via their “you give, we give” scheme. She added: “We’re extremely grateful to our customers for their generosity which enables groups like The Felix Project to bring food to people in desperate need.” James Murray, chair of the Bridgepoint Charitable Trust, which donated £50,000, said: “We are delighted to contribute to the work of The Felix Project in feeding vulnerable communities.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Coleen feels that the time and money involved could be put to better use her offer to meet face to face still stands. Mrs Vardy’s decision to issue court proceedings does at least mean that Coleen’s evidence can be made public when the time is right.”  The combined legal fees are set to cost up to £1m, The Sun, which found itself at the centre of the original dispute between the celebrities, reported. Everything you need to know about Coleen Rooney and Rebekah VardyRooney, an author and TV presenter who is married to former England football captain Wayne Rooney, singled out “Rebekah Vardy’s account” for apparently selling the stories after conducting her own social media investigation.In a post on Instagram in October, Rooney wrote: “For a few years now someone who I trusted to follow me on my personal Instagram account has been consistently informing The Sun newspaper of my private posts and stories.“There has been so much information given to them about me, my friends and my family – all without my permission or knowledge.”“To try and prove this I came up with an idea,” she continued. “I blocked everyone from viewing my Instagram stories except one account.

Now I know from certain which accountinidual it’s come from.“I have saved and screenshotted all the original stories which clearly show just one person has viewed them. It’s… Rebekah Vardy’s account.”However, Vardy, a model who is married to Leicester City striker Jamie Vardy, categorically denied that she had ever gone to the press about Rooney, even though she had been asked by reporters on numerous occasions.Rebekah Vardy says she was hospitalised after Coleen Rooney disputeRebekah Vardy ‘doesn’t see the funny side of’ Coleen Rooney riftHow American media reported on Coleen Rooney and Rebekah Vardy’s feudVardy also suggested that Rebekah Vardy’s account may have been accessed in the past by someone who was not, in fact, Rebekah Vardy.In a response addressing Rooney directly, Vardy wrote: “If you thought this was happening you could have told me and I could have changed my passwords to see if it stopped.”“Over the years various people have had access to my Insta and just this week I found I was following people I didn’t know and have never followed myself. I’m not being funny but I don’t need the money, what would I gain from selling stories on you?“I liked you a lot Coleen and I’m so upset that you have chosen to do this, especially when I’m heavily pregnant.

It has four core beliefs: family, integrity, teamwork and success – all integral pillars of its Reconnection to Recovery and Resilience programme.Put together by Sharon Gray OBE and the federation’s head teachers, it’s designed to welcome pupils back to class after lockdown. “Everybody in the Embark community has done their bit,” says Gray, a headteacher for 20 years, mostly in special schools supporting youngsters experiencing social, emotional and mental health difficulties and schools going through challenges.“It’s been all hands on deck,” executive headteacher and Trust leader of Embark’s schools Matthew Crawford adds. “Even two weeks into lockdown we were thinking about our children returning to school, whatever date that may be.”Safety at school1. Anyone who is unwell or been in contact with somebody showing coronavirus symptoms should stay away from schools, colleges and childcare settings2. Hands should be cleaned more often than usual with soap and running water for at least 20 seconds and dried thoroughly. Alternatively, hand sanitiser or alcohol hand rub can be used3. Promote the ‘catch it, bin it, kill it’ approach to coughing and sneezing4. Clean frequently touched surfaces regularly using standard products, such as detergent and bleach5. Help to minimise contact and mixing by altering classroom layout and timetablesWith regards to physical changes that parents and pupils can expect to see in corridors and classrooms, Embark is working with Government guidance and undertaking a thorough, bespoke risk assessment for each of its schools. “It can’t be a one-size-fits all approach,” Crawford stresses.According to Anna Upton – head of the 240-pupil Chaucer Junior School in Ilkeston, Derbyshire – questionnaires were sent out to reconnect with parents, through which they could express concerns and suggest ideas about the return to classrooms.According to Upton, staggered breaks and how drop-offs will work were important issues that were flagged in questionnaires. “But the risk assessment the Trust has put in has allowed us to make a comprehensive plan and we can communicate that to the parents,” she explains.“What the Trust have done with the programme is to implement nine stages which support our schools to open as safely as possible, supporting the staff parents and the children. The risk assessment means that I, as a headteacher, can do what’s right for my school.”Chair of trustees Sarah Armitage emphasises the importance of teamwork based around a guiding principle: families first. We look after families, so we reach out we talk.” she says.“Then there’s teamwork. Let’s harness the power of the team so it’s not the headteacher sitting by themselves with all these things to think about – that load is shared.”Armitage’s back-to-school outlook is optimistic too: “We have created something with this programme that we hope will be massively beneficial. Our role as leaders is to keep that going, carry on putting emotional needs at the heart of everything we do, because then children are able to learn and benefit – and move through this crisis.”Information in this article applies to schools in England only.

Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe GNA, backed militarily by Turkey, called Mr Sisi’s threat a “declaration of war,” and refused to halt its offensive. “We reject this, condemn it and consider it an act of aggression, a blatant intervention, which amounts to a declaration of war,” the GNA said in a letter on Sunday.The Arab League is scheduled to discuss the confrontation in Libya during an emergency session on Tuesday, but Tripoli is boycotting.  Libyan civilians are trapped in the crossfire of Haftar’s proxy warLibya’s general Haftar swindled out of millions by western mercenariesLibya has a chance at peace but Russia and the US are in the wayDanger of ‘miscalculation’ as powers scramble for position in LibyaFears of revenge attacks as Haftar’s forces flee Libya stronghold“We urge parties to commit to a ceasefire and resume negotiations immediately,” the US Embassy declared in a tweet, but efforts at diplomacy appeared to be failing. Turkey and its allies appear confident of a win and in no mood for a deal, and Mr Haftar and his supporters abroad, humiliated after weeks of battlefield losses, are reluctant to give any concessions from a position of weakness. “The Turks had a point,” said one western diplomat involved in Libya affairs. “They had to establish deterrence. Now they are acknowledging that they want to take control of the whole territory. They are saying Haftar has to go.”Libya’s civil war has been deadly, disruptive and gruesome. Hundreds of thousands have been displaced and hundreds killed. Last week came the discovery of mass graves filled with scores of bodies in the city of Tarhouna, where a militia loyal to Mr Haftar was pushed out last month by GNA forces.“Civilians in Libya continue to suffer disproportionately,” Stephanie Williams, the acting UN envoy to Libya, said last week in a presentation. “One million people are now in need of some form of humanitarian assistance.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailSirte, a city of some 50,000 people, is significant as the last major urban cluster before a set of crucial Libyan oil facilities and depots located on Libya’s eastern Mediterranean shore and controlled for now by forces loyal to Mr Haftar. It is home to a local population filled with supporters of Gaddafi who are allied with Mr Haftar and remain intensely hostile to the Islamist-tinged government in Tripoli.  It was controlled by militias loyal to the GNA until earlier this year, and both Ankara and the Tripoli government have said they would halt their offensive and be open to peace talks once it and Jufrah are under their control.Egypt boasts significant air and ground forces which could boost Mr Haftar in the battlefield and challenge any forces Turkey and the GNA could muster. But Marsa Matrouh, the last city at the Egyptian border where its troops are garrisoned, is some 15 hours away from Sirte. Meanwhile, Turks and allied GNA militias have a strong presence in Misurata, which lies less than three hours from Sirte, and Ankara has been flooding western Libya with military material and personnel for months. “Egypt’s political will to enter a physical contest with the Turkish-backed GNA coalition is not big,” said Jalel Harchaoui, a North Africa specialist at the Clingendael Institute in the Netherlands. “Turkey and the GNA forces are ready to move forcefully into both Sirte and Jufrah any day now.”Mr Sisi has appeared disappointed in Mr Haftar’s failures but is also under pressure from financial backers in the UAE and Saudi Arabia, who are hostile to the GNA’s inclusion of populist Islamist factions and see Turkey as a strategic threat. Egypt also views events in Libya with grave concern, worried troubles could spill over into its borders.“I believe the assertive language is serious and could lead to some form of action or military deployment even if largely symbolic,” said one Egyptian military analyst. “It appears Egypt’s intent is to force ceasefire negotiations by acting as counterbalance to Turkish and GNA strength on the ground.”The conflict in Libya has drawn in various international powers and their local backers. On the one side is Mr Haftar, the eastern commander and former CIA asset who is supported by the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Russia and France. On the other side is the GNA in Tripoli, which in addition to Ankara has begun to receive the implicit blessing of Italy, Germany and the UK.Backed by UAE air power and Russian and Sudanese mercenaries, Mr Haftar launched an ill-fated offensive to take control of Tripoli last year. All of his gains were wiped out in a few extraordinary weeks after Turkey forcefully intervened, dispatching drones, anti-aircraft machinery, military personnel, and Syrian mercenaries to back the GNA forces. After initially supporting Mr Haftar, the White House under President Donald Trump appears to have settled into indifference. On Monday, GNA Prime Minister Fayez Serraj and high-profile interior minister Fathi Bashagha reportedly received a delegation of US military commanders from Africom, the US military force in Africa, amid concern about the deployment of Russian fighter jets in Jufrah. “I  don’t think the Trump administration is willing to be associated with someone who’s losing and also a war criminal,” Mohammed Ali Abdallah, a GNA envoy to the US, said in an interview.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

There have been more than 170 new cases of Covid-19 since last week, marking the biggest increase since the virus\u0027s spread was close to being eliminated in April.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

which means one metre minimum distance when not possible to otherwise.The plus means that the public must also take other precautionary measures to limit any potential spread.Mr Johnson has also revealed to allow pubs to serve drinks outside in a bid to boost the economy.Matt Hancock confirmed The Suns story that bars and restaurants will have to keep a record of everyone who visits before being served under new plans.Ministers have discussed a guest register will be kept by landlords and managers to help track and trace coronavirus outbreaks.The idea has been used in New Zealand where each venue must record visitors and carry out regular head counts.Personal details are kept on file for four weeks there and are used to contact peopleone of the patrons later is hit with coronavirus.Some pubs have been allowed to partially reopen in June using outdoor market-style stalls.Government officials have previously suggested it could take many months for pubs to reopen - sparking fears for the future of many of the UKs , locals.Top scientists have predicted that the hospitality could start to pick up without triggering a second wave.The famous pub chain Wetherspoons shut all their doors on March , but have since revealed their plan to reopen over  pubs across the UK.Wetherspoons has said they are investing £million into this new plan to make sure the new measures keep both their staff and customers safe.Each pub will be temperature checking all their staff before they start their sht, as well as providing them with gloves, masks and protective eyewear for them to wear when working.They have also suggested they will be limiting their menu slightly, as well as replacing all the usual condiments with sachets rather than plastic bottles and create one-way systems in and out of the venues.The Sun was given a first glimpse of the new layout as it was revealed there will be screens, posters and floor markings.There will be separate exits and entrances, and tables will not positioned to abide by social distancing rules.The chain however will not be reopening until the government confirms a date when pubs can open again - which will not be until July at earliest.The plans have also revealed that social distancing measures will be in place for when pubs do eventually open.These measures would require drinkers to order their booze remotely via an app, with the punter then having to collect their drinks from the bar to minimise contact between staff and customers.Pubs must have ventilation systems to stop coronavirus building up, while the two metre rule will stay.British pub operators have asked for social distancing rules to be halved from two metres to one, worried that many will have to close permanently otherwise, the Financial Times reported.The report cited Simon Emeny, chief executive of pub group Fullers, as saying that the rules in the country currently went above and beyond the World Health Organisation guidelines.I think its really important thatare relaxed by the time pubs reopen, Emeny was quoted as saying.The FT also added that Jonathan Neame, the head of pub operator Shepherd Neame, said attempting to keep people two metres away would be profoundly challenging and many pubs would have to remain closed.Those pubs which have outdoor beers gardens, where it has been shown that coronavirus is far less likely, will probably be given the green light first.Some pubs were allowed to reopen with outdoor market-style stalls.Early in May, Professor Robert Dingwall, a top Government adviser, said pub beer gardens should reopen as long as punters can stay apart.He told BBC Radio s Today programme: If it is a sunny weekend afternoon and the pub has a garden and the landlords are prepared to accept responsibility for not overcrowding that garden, I see no particular reason why it should not reopen.Tourism Alliance Director Kurt Janson told the Sun Online that pubs could open up large beer gardens on high streets and farmlands in order to maintain socially-distant drinking.Those already with allocated outdoor seating are due to be given guidance on how they might be able to reopen from June .And plans are being considered to offer blanket permission to businesses wanting to add outdoor seating for customers.It is hoped the outdoor openings will allow venues to get people back to work.Shops may also be able to set up stalls outdoors so they can sell their wares on the streets.As well as missing the Euros this year, that bring in millions for locals, a closure over Christmas could sink a huge number of Britain’s locals.Frank Maguire from Truman’s brewery, which has traded in London since , said: “Things are looking pretty dire.“At this rate it seems unlikely that pubs will be open again before Christmas.“Small independent breweries are part of this country’s DNA, but a lot of them won’t survive unless the government extends the grants it has offered to pubs and hotels.“A lot of pubs and breweries were already struggling. If they take on loads of debt, the system will break.”You can join campaigns like Long Live the Local, who are trying to get the government to freeze beer duty to support pubs when they finally reopen.The team is also working on some new plans to try and mitigate the massive toll our boozers are paying for coronavirus.Budweiser is selling gt cards for pubs here, which they then match as a donation to your pub.Landlords can add their pubs to the scheme too.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Other beauty services have reopened with enhanced health and hygiene practices.The National Hair and Beauty Federationhas written an open letter to the Secretary of State for Business Alok Sharma, calling for clarication from the Government on how guidelines will impact on this sector.The NHBF is also asking for clarication on what the social distancing and PPE requirements will be when salons are allowed to reopen.Despite being closed since the lockdown, more than £MILLION worth of gt vouchers were sold during the month of April.These vouchers were purchased online, directly on salons’ websites or via social media s.If youre one of these people, sit tight, and your vouchers will be able to be redeemed for use once the beauty industry is back open for business.The government has pledged support to self-employed people in the United Kingdom as well as full-time workers.HMRC is contacting taxpayers eligible for the Self-Employment Income Support Scheme , with the claims service opening on Wednesday, May .The Sun has documented a guide on what support self-employed people can do to get financial help during the pandemic, which youabout here.If you are a beauty worker or nail technician who is employed then you employer can pay you through the Governments furlough scheme.You can read our guide on what the emergency measures mean for you.Others who see themselves as creative can conjure up new ways to supply the demand to their customers while at home, one nail technician did just that by doing, through the letterbox manicures,youre looking for some inspiration.If you are in dire need of some of your regular beauty treatments, you dont have to wait until the lockdown is lted to feel and look good again.There are loads of treatments that you can do yourself, with equipment you probably already sitting in your cupboards.Our DIY guide here gives great advice on dealing with such things as dealing with your bikini line, dying hair and tidying up your brows.Plus we show you how to get a salon-worthy manicure.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

As long as you all abide by the strict social distancing rule laid out by the government.Before you start packing up your picnic baskets there does seem to be a slight roadblock.The National Trust, for example, has closed all its car parks as well as its parks and gardens, so until these types of restrictions change - people will have to wait a little longer before they are able to enjoy the nations new freedoms in full.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

No matter that I am not, nor have ever been, a member of the Conservative Party.I would never be forgiven by some people, who just couldn’t understand why an ethnic minority person would have sympathy for Conservative policies. At best we’ve been hoodwinked at worst we must just be plain evil.It often feels like we are not allowed to think for ourselves, outside of the orthodoxies set down by left-wing political groupthink.In the days of fighting to set up my school, and in our first few years of establishing ourselves, I received racist emails and threats of violence — from the Left.There were protests outside my school and abuse was shouted in my face from militant union members opposed to free schools.My detractors tried hard to discredit me in ways that made sense to them.There was even a running Wikipedia battle over my heritage, lasting for years.It was regularly edited to state that I was of Indian descent, while some people claimed my ancestry to be Indian Ugandan, and thereforethat I must hate black people.It was absurd, and I didn’t know from one day to the next what race my Wikipedia page would say I was.While it seems a bizarre thing to fight over, some opponents clearly believed that my criticisms of the education system and my support for free schools could be discountedI wasn’t black.My experience ten years ago is why today I have the greatest sympathy for Conservative MPs such as Priti Patel and Kemi Badenoch. Heaven knows what actual Tory MPs from ethnic minorities must have to endure.Mirza has been working with the Conservative Party for many years and her simple appointment to this role has enraged her detractors. For them, a “good” ethnic minority is one who always toes the leftist line.So play around with my Wikipedia page, make me Indian with a couple of keyboard strokes, and suddenly not only have they wiped my mother out of existence, but my words don’t really matter any more. This accusation of “not being black enough” raised its ugly head when Priti Patel was accused of distracting from the racism facing black people by highlighting her own experiences — assomehow her struggles were worth less because she is of Indian heritage .That being called a “P**i” as a young girl wouldn’t have had the same crushing, hurtful impact as any other racial slur. Similarly, Munira Mirza has been accused of not being able to understand the experiences of black people because she is of Pakistani origin.The recent protests inspired by the Black Lives Matter movement should have provoked serious conversations about the meaning and impact of race we all need to explore the nature of racism and what to do about it.But it is clear to me, from the black boxes on Instagram to the meaningless supportive BLM statements on corporate websites, that few people are interested in examining race in our own society.Most people want an easy fix, a stamp of approval that will allow them to be branded a non-racist so that they can go back to their normal lives, satisfied that they are a good person .This is not even remotely helpful to anyone, it’s simple box ticking but the desire to signal “anti-racism” instead of just not being a racist is so prevalent that at times I wonder whether human beings have the capacity to distinguish between the two: The signal and the reality.This tick-box race culture goes hand in hand with the oppression Olympics. Hierarchies of race are the easy bingo card that allows ethnic people to be ticked off on a sheet.Chinese  Sorry, only two oppression points for you. Black  Wow, that’s ten points! You go straight to the top!This is why,you are merely interested in appearing to be non-racist, rather than actually being a non-racist, you will buy into the idea of this totem pole of oppression.You will ignore that race and class are so much more complex than this.My father was of Indian heritage, but he came from a much poorer environment than my black mother and grew up without any shoes.Le is more complicated than the tick-box culture allows, butyour only interest in race is to do enough to signal to everyone that you aren’t a racist, then you will promote that hierarchy enthusiastically, because it is the perfect prop for your non-racist dissimulation. It doesn’t require any thought or effort.The reality of being anti-racist requires years of reading and discussion, befriending a iety of black people, including ones who think dferently from you politicallyand really coming to terms with one’s own uncomfortable feelings around race. Signalling requires a black box on Instagram and instantly everyone approves of you. You can see why most people choose the simpler option.In fact, spending a letime helping black boys realise their potential, something Black Lives Matter should approve of, instead of earning me adoration as a black box on Instagram does, has given me many enemies.My -plus years of improving young people’s lives is meaningless next to the superficial letters of support for BLM, because making a useful dference to people’s lives is less important than being seen to do so. It is a wonder why anyone ever does anything truly good at all.But there is one way of being anti-racist in a very simple and real way that takes no time at all.Allow Priti Patel, Kemi Badenoch and Munira Mirza the right that so many white people enjoy and take for granted: The right to think for themselves.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Mums.And when you are responsible for home-educating your children as well as working out how to feed them three meals a day while holding down your job and everything  you used to do before children went to school at home, there is a strong incentive to get those schools open. And quick.Perhaps less so when someone  is taking care of all that stuff for you.Getting our classrooms back up and running may well take a bit of lateral thought, because of course it has to be safe to do so. But on the basis we can now pop to Zara or Ikea, surely we can open our schools safely Few disagree that lockdown should have included schools, but they need to open as soon as it is safe to do so.Yes, these things all need proper managing and organising. So why don’t schools ask local business leaders to help them with the logistics and arrangements To socially distance safely, we may need to cut class sizes in half and have twice as many classrooms, so why not look to use dferent spaces, for example empty community halls, empty libraries, empty offices etc.What about outdoor learning in small groups If we cut classrooms by half we will need twice as many teachers.So how about encouraging unemployed graduates to work as teaching assistants Or asking retired teachers to come out of retirement, just as many nurses did at the beginning of the pandemic.You know you can find the solution when it’s your problem to solve. Which is why any government and any Cabinet should be as representational of “real le” as possible, which is why we need more women advising the Prime Minister.That said, no doubt many women just don’t fancy a le in politics. When you look at the abuse, death treats, and sexism they face, who can blame them.But unless there are people from all walks of le — including women — in the Cabinet, then the issues that affect real people will not be properly tackled or solved.Just look at the incredible effect that some of the world’s female leaders have had when they’ve acted swtly and decisively in the face of Covid-.Germany’s Angela Merkel has kept deaths in her country down to just  per million — compared to  per million in the UK.New Zealand’s inspiring Jacinda Ardern has overseen a remarkable response to the pandemic which involved a rapid, draconian lockdown.Only  people died there. She has been widely praised for her strength in leadership.These daily UK Government press briefings have made it all too clear that we are crying out for more women at the helm.The steady stream of menfielding questions on the topics of the day has been alarming. Priti Patel’s appearances could be counted on one hand.It does make you wonder whether we’d be in a healthier positionmore women had been given more prominence in Boris’s Cabinet.I think we would be.Until recently, many people knew Maya Jama as the girlfriend of rapper Stormzy, but they broke up as a couple last year.What people are now gradually realising is that she has had a fantastic career in her own right – and she proved it last week when she stole the show while co-presenting Peter Crouch: Save Our Summer on BBC.And it wasn’t because her low-cut top, inset, raised a few eyebrows, though certainly not mine.As she rightly pointed out, she can dress how she pleases.She stole the show because she is good at what she does and is engaging.At the age of  she has already done a stint on MTV, DJing on Rinse FM, a job on Radio , and now she is presenting Saturday night TV.Andit weren’t for Covid- she would be acting in her first film around about now too.Plus, as a sideline she is launching a skincare range and has a mysterious big project brewing – rumoured by some to be Strictly Come Dancing.In fact, she said in an interview this week that lockdown is the first time since she was  that she has had such an extended rest .All of this would be impressive for any -year-old but way more so when you know that Maya’s father was in and out of prison for much of her childhood. And not only that – in  when she was , her then boyfriend, Rico Gordon, was killed in a shooting.These are the kind of le experiences that can lead young people down a very dferent track to the one that Maya has put herself on, and for that alone she deserves our admiration.But really we should admire her solely because she is so good at what she does, and such a brave and eloquent voice for her generation.Kate Ferdinand has announced she is pregnant and expecting her first child with husband of nine months Rio.It really could not happen to a nicer or more deserving couple, as evidenced by the fact that when they told Rio’s three children – Lorenz, , Tate, , and nine-year-old Tia – the youngsters jumped up and down with joy.That is the reaction of children who have been made to feel happy, secure and, above all, loved by their father and his new we, despite having gone through the pain of losing their mother.Kate put the video on Instagram with the caption: “The crazy house is about to get a little bit crazier . . . every time I watch this it makes me cry, the best reaction. Baby Ferdy, we are all so excited to meet you.”Good luck to them.About bloody time.This is an opportunity to be seized.If we think carefully about how to spend the money in the right way, we can achieve a great deal of good in this country – and God knows we need that right now.I am sure I’m not the only one having mixed feelings about shops reopening and the huge step back towards “normality” that we all took this week.On the one hand it feels like a huge relief.Thank goodness things are moving again.On the other, I’m a bit worried about how to get out of my pyjamas, start wearing make-up and navigate my working wardrobe again.On balance, though, I’m excited for us to all start doing what we can to get the economy growing again.Talking of shops reopening, I didn’t enjoy the level of scorn being heaped by people on social media on to the huge queues outside Primark stores, which re-opened on Monday.I think before they are so judgmental they should stop for a minute and consider that many people do not have credit cards so cannot shop online.But not only that – say what you like about Primark clothes, one thing they are is cheap.Families with kids who have grown out of their gear over lockdown couldn’t wait to get in there to grab what they needed, and there was a distinctly snobbish element to some people’s judgment.They should think before they speak.Photos of Reese Witherspoon running in a baseball cap with her face concealed by a mask made me realise celebs everywhere – especially those with lockdown hair and faces that might need a bit of  TLC – are seeing this season’s new must-have accessory as an opportunity to conceal a multitude of sins.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They do what they are told to by top brass but these horribly mixed messages are not a good look.It was once commonplace to hear that this country has the best police force in the world. When was the last time you heard that But it was true. Think of the late PC Keith Palmer, who died in  while heroically preventing a kne-wielding Islamist terrorist from entering the Palace of ­Westminster.Yet during this lockdown, there has been a steady draining away of respect for the police.How we all chortled to learn that in Hampshire,  per cent of police are now overweight or obese — the fat-buttocked blue line.While in London, when a ­protester leapt in front of the PM’s car causing a minor crash, it was hardly a complete surprise to see day-dreaming officers gormlessly staring off into space, as oblivious as Keystone Cops in a coma.There is a growing lack of respect for the police and that is the reason why  officers were injured in one weekend.The ordinary copper has been poorly led, leading to inevitable inaction the moment they are met by protesters or a crowd of eager shoppers at Nike Town.Their own senior officers seem far more concerned about ­displaying their politically correct credentials rather than anything resembling law and order. More than  years ago, the Macpherson Report into the death of Stephen Lawrence in South East London found the Met Police to be ­“institutionally racist”.There has been a great overhaul in the force since.It is hugely welcome that there are Black Asian and Minority ­Ethnicofficers now in senior Scotland Yard roles. This was long overdue.But there is still a long way to go before the force can be regarded as being truly erse.Five of the nation’s police forces have only one black officer.Forces in Durham, North ­Yorkshire, Warwickshire, Dyfed-Powys and North Wales had only one black officer in their ranks each as of March last year.This doesn’t mean our officers should be drawn into events like the death of George Floyd , miles away.It should be self-evident that British police were not in any way responsible for that death in Minneapolis.And yet a statement issued on behalf of Britain’s Chief Constables solemnly stated: “We stand alongside all those across the globe who are appalled and ­horried by the way George Floyd lost his le.“Justice and accountability should follow. We will tackle bias, racism or discrimination wherever we find it.”But the appalling racist violence of American cops — or indeed, when the police go on a violent rampage in Paris or Hong Kong — should not be clumsily confused with the issues our bobbies face here.As the violent clashes of the past few weeks have demonstrated, our officers should be focused on our own problems dealing with crime on our own streets.PAMELA ANDERSON ­promotes fake leather vegan handbags.You would never guess it’s mostly plastic.The bag, I mean.

No, not her clothes – the horses.“Doing this year’s Ascot at home,” sighs Lizzie.Just as well. They would never have let her into the Royal Enclosure carrying that glass of champagne.SIR KEIR STARMER, Labour’s gutless leader, is scared ­witless of upsetting his union paymasters so he can’t bring himself to admit that opening our schools is safe – despite sending his own children to school throughout the lockdown.Same old Labour – always hypocrites when it comes to educating their children. One law for them etc.Meanwhile, the Government is finally showing some urgency about getting the schools open again for all, pumping £billion into state schools over the next year, including £million for the most disadvantaged children.It beggars belief that non-essential shops have reopened while schools remain closed or see only a trickle of pupils.There are no non-essential children.DOMINIC RAAB says he would only take the knee for his missus and the Queen.Cue widespread and totally predictable outrage from the likes of Labour’s permanently apoplectic David Lammy.But as Raab’s Jewish father Peter fled the Nazis as a six-year-old Czech in , I don’t think the Foreign Secretary needs lessons in opposing racism from anyone.And to many of us, “taking the knee” looks like a servile and empty gesture, bowing down before the great gods of woke.During World War Two, there were those who thought Dame Veras songs were too sentimental for fighting men who might never see home again.But with We’ll Meet Again and The White Clfs Of Dover, Vera gave hope in the darkness all around.It is signicant that the Queen chose that immortal phase “We will meet again” in her address to the nation at the height of the pandemic.Some songs last for ever.DAN WALKER, the BBC presenter, mocks a supporter of the online campaign Defund The BBC as “a Russian bot” – meaning a fake account run by foreign communists who seek our demise.Oh, Dan! Defund The BBC was started by a smart young Glasgow University student called James Yucel.And there are millions who believe that the funding model of the BBC is laughably old-fashioned in the age of Netflix, Amazon and the rest.Sometimes I think it is the BBC’s preachy, ridiculously overpaid presenters such as Gary Lineker, Emily Maitlis and deluded Dan Walker, above, who are the Russian bots – planted to hasten the end of the BBC.Great, but Lewis is paid £million a year by the Mercedes-AMG Petronas Formula One team – and , forced labourers once toiled in Mercedesfactories in Nazi Germany.I drive a BMW, who also used slaves under the Nazis.When it comes to symbols of racism, Lewis, German carmakers take some beating.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

On the same day, Cancun, Mexico experienced a high of C -potentially seven degrees lower than in the Arctic Circle.The heatwave is set to continue as temperatures in the Siberian town are expected to reach highs of C this week.

A warming Arctic has accelerated the melting of Greenlands kilometres-thick ice sheet, resulting in a net loss of  billion tonnes of ice mass for the year – accounting for about  per cent of total sea level rise in .In April, the UNs WMO confirmed the past five years have been the hottest on record globally. This trend is likely to continue because of record levels of heat-trapping greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And we were facing serious disorder.”This prompted the Bank to embark on £billion of quantitative easing, a process which is likened to printing money. It was the biggest single cash injection into the economy in its history.Asked what would have happened had the Bank not taken swt action, Mr Bailey said: “I think the prospects would have been very bad.

That person was not at home.”Amaral, , led the initial investigation into Madeleine’s disappearance back in , but was removed after criticising British police officers.He also alleged, in a controversial book, that the three-year-old’s parents, Gerry and Kate McCann, had covered up their daughter’s accidental death in their Algarve holiday apartment.The McCanns claimed the book was unfounded and grossly defamatory and launched legal action against Amaral in .In , Kate and Gerry were awarded around £, in libel damages by a Portuguese court, although this decision was later overturned.Amaral has made numerous appearances on television since the emergence of Christian B as a suspect in the McCann case.He has repeated his well-known criticism of the Brit youngster’s parents and their “Tapas Seven” holiday pals.Amaral accused them of abandoning their children to eat out at night and lying to Portuguese police, and said Madeleine had been crying the night before she vanished on May , . He also branded Christian B a “scapegoat”, describing the -year-old as an “almost perfect suspect”.Amaral first claimed last April that a German paedophile who was in prison would be accused over Madeleine’s disappearance.He told a Portuguese TV interviewer last night: “When I spoke last year I was talking about the situation that’s happening now.“It matters little who the paedophile is.”He added: “He’s an almost perfect suspect. All that’s missing for him to become the perfect suspect is for him to be dead.”Askedhe believed Christian B was the man responsible for Madeleine’s disappearance, he added: “To answer that question it has to be proven first that an abduction took place.”But during his half-hour-long interview with Portuguese broadcaster TVI, he also insinuated the German authorities had altered photos of the two-tone VW camper van Christian B was using around the time Madeleine disappeared.The former PJ chief, showed interviewer Jose Alberto Carvalho photos he said were taken in Portugal of the same vehicle.One of the photos he produced showed a series of very distinctive Minion-style characters painted on the front and back of the camper van, which in the picture put out by police had no markings on it.He said: “It’s the same vehicle flagged up in the police appeal.“I think it’s important to ask why the photo put out by the authorities of the van was altered.“Would that vehicle have gone unnoticed in Praia da Luz with those markings on it  I don’t think so.”He went on to say any appeal focused on the van from the official photos without the distinctive markings would be a waste of time.He claimed detectives were not aware of Christian B’s  teenage sexual conviction for molesting a six-year-old girl.But he confessed: “At the time all we knew was that this man was a paedophile.”He also came out against German authorities’ plans to re-examine DNA evidence taken from the McCanns’ hire car and holiday apartment.Amaral rubbished reports a saliva sample had been found on Madeleine’s bedspread and could prove key to a conviction now Christian B had been identied as a new suspect.He said it had been proven it belonged to a baby being fed mother’s milk staying in the apartment before the McCanns arrived.Asked why he thought the German authorities might have interest in coming up with new information which in his opinion had no real value, Amaral claimed: “Because it enables them to have jurisdiction over this case.“I think the Portuguese police and the authorities can do anything here in laboratories that they can do in Germany.”Amaral’s interview was his first since Christian B’s name was made public - and the first time he has spoken about the case since last December.He spoke last year on Spanish TV to rule out speculation Hamburg-born child strangler Martin Ney was being probed over Madeleine’s disappearance, months after claiming on an Australian podcast that a scapegoat was being prepared by police.He failed to identy Ney by name at the time, describing the suspect only as someone who had been ruled out of the investigation into the missing British youngster in  but later jailed in his home country.Amaral told the Spanish TV programme: “A paedophile who is German and serving le for killing children has been spoken about.“What I know is that the suspect is not him, it’s another man.“He’s also in prison in Germany. He’s also a paedophile.“Years later, many years later, it appears that in an Internet chatroom there is a conversation between that person and another person where they talk about Madeleine.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Heat stroke, also known as sun stroke, is a medical emergency and must be treated immediately.She also offered advice on when to know the dference between heat stroke and heat exhaustion.“Heat exhaustion is caused by loss of salt and water from the body through excessive sweating. Perspiration is your body’s natural way of cooling itself. Symptoms should improve quickly by cooling and rehydrating the body, butleft untreated it can progress to heatstroke.“The symptoms are often the same in adults and children, although children may become floppy and sleepy.”Forecasters say the UK is set for record-breaking temperatures this week - prompting experts to issue a Level  heat health warning for tomorrow.The rare alert is triggered when the risk is  per cent or above for threshold temperatures being reached in one or more regions on at least two consecutive days and the intervening night.“This is an important stage for social and healthcare services who will be working to ensure readiness and swt action to reduce harm from a potential heatwave,” the Met Office said.It is working with Public Health England to help healthcare services prepare for periods of “extreme temperature”.The hottest day of the year could be recorded several times over as the mercury climbs towards  degrees in the south of the UK by Thursday.However, the record for the hottest June day ever looks set to remain in tact, as temperatures will not quite reach the .c seen in .Met Office forecaster Luke Miall said: Weve got high pressure to the South East of the UK over the next few days which is going to be drawing our air up from the continent, and the warmer climates of France and Spain.Tuesdays top temperature is expected to be around C in the South Wast of England, with other areas quite widely getting into the mid s, the forecaster said.The hottest day of the year so far was .C reached last month, and Mr Miall explained: Its likely tomorrow will beat that in the South, do it again on Wednesday and then again on Thursday.Thursday will probably be the hottest day in the region of  or  degrees, but he added thats not quite the June record from .Although its fairly uncommon to get  in June at the moment, it doesnt look like were going to break any of the records.Things will start to cool off for the weekend, and the meteorologist explained: By Saturday most places will be seeing the fresher air coming across for the weekend, so although it might still be humid at times I think generally temperatures will be falling below heatwave.With the dry and sunny weather expected and the Governments Covid- alert level lowered to three, emergency services across the country are urging people to continue to respect the two-metre social-distancing restriction.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But when the coronavirus crisis struck, the two of them were plunged into compulsory lockdown on the beautul -acre isle off the Pembrokeshire coast. With only seabirds for company, the situation has left them even more isolated than usual. Sylwia, who is using her spare time to learn the ukulele, says: “Every few weeks we take our boat to collect our online supermarket order from friends, and we alternate cooking duties. “You need to be OK with being in isolation, and not being able to just pop to the shops. You have to plan ahead and be able to enjoy the changes in the weather.”  In normal times, Skomer attracts up to  visitors a day, drawn by the chance to see the island’s wildle - but coronavirus cut this off virtually overnight, and the Wildle Trusts was faced with having to withdraw the wardens. However, thanks to a grant from The National Lottery Heritage Fund – part of a wider £m National Lottery allocation to help good causes affected by the pandemic’s impact – Nathan and Sylwia can continue protecting Skomer’s unique bird habitats.  National Lottery players have raised £m which will support good causes through the coronavirus. We’re facing exceptional times brought about by the global pandemic. But thanks to you, essential funding is being distributed over the next few months to charities, projects and the good causes most impacted by coronavirus. Click here to learn more about how you are helping - or visit national-lottery news While living on the island, Nathan initially came down with symptoms of the coronavirus and had to self-isolate for two weeks, then the pair struggled to get food deliveries But now they’re embracing the situation. Their work involves collecting data on breeding seabirds, including puffins and Manx shearwaters, and helping to protect them from other species – humans among them. “The island is really fragile,” says Nathan. “Puffins and shearwaters nest in burrows, so the ground is like a honeycomb. It’s important that people stay on the paths.”  Both are missing their families on the mainland, though. Nathan is also craving ice cream, while Sylwia pines for fresh strawberries. Meanwhile they, and two other wardens, have been sharing their work online via video blogs. And despite the crisis, the pair are counting their blessings.“We know how lucky we are to have a job on a remote island,” says Nathan. “We appreciate all the support from The National Lottery and the people who play it.” “It’s a very special place to work in and it’s definitely a privilege,” Sylwia adds Next we hear from another duo who have been separated from their loved ones in lockdown in Slough and find out how theyaposve been making the most of it too... Pensioners transform lounge into yoga studio  Like many loving grandparents, Rajinder and Usha Mehta have found being separated from their family in lockdown a challenge. But the couple have made the most of their time by turning their lounge into a yoga and dance studio, thanks to online classes run by a local National Lottery-funded community group. Rajinder, , and Usha, , live in Slough. While they’ve at least been able to see their son and two-year-old youngest granddaughter from a distance, they have also managed to stay close to their wide circle of friends through shared virtual exercise classes, WhatsApp groups, regular phone calls and even cooking challenges. The couple have been active members of the National Lottery-funded Apna Virsa voluntary community organisation for four years. It was co-founded by friends Seema Kamboj and Bobbi Johal in , with the aim of bringing together members of the vibrant South Asian community in the Slough area. Since then it has grown to have hundreds of members, and works in close partnership with other community groups, running yoga, pilates, wellbeing and bhangra dance classes, alongside community meet-ups and other services catering for a broad age range and uniting people from many dferent cultures. “Social isolation is a big issue, particularly among older members of the community, and early on we also recognised a need around peopleaposs health,” says Seema. “We’ve always consulted with the local community about the kind of services they want, and the classes we run have proved really popular.  “When lockdown hit, we knew we had to keep bringing people together, so we ran with the challenge and moved our classes online. It’s been amazingly successful, and our reach has risen from a maximum of  people in a class pre-lockdown, to as many as , views for one of our Facebook Live dance sessions. We even had the charity Shelter ask us to share our social media tips!” Apna Virsa was awarded National Lottery funding for its Wellbeing Matters project, launched in March , and some of that money has now supported it going virtual. “People have been sharing videos and photos, we’ve had weekly highlights on Facebook and a recipe of the week shared via WhatsApp,” says Seema. “It’s all these little things in lockdown that keep people positive and motivated.”"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus lockdown changes everything you","story":"NewsCoronavirus lockdown changes: Everything you can and cant do in England from July Boris Johnson has today given the green light for cinemas, galleries, museums, pubs, restaurants, bars, hotels, hairdressers and barbers to reopen from July  - while overnight stays with friends will be allowed.

Pubs, hairdressers, hotels, campsites, restaurants, cinemas, museums and galleries can open bang on Saturday  July - despite fears itaposs too soon to unlock the nation, especially all at once. Two households will also be able to meet indoors and even stay overnight - as long as they maintain social distancing. And the two-metre social distancing rule will be cut down to a one metre plus rule, with people able to be closerthey sit side-by-side or wear a mask. The death toll of people with coronavirus in the UK today passed , and stands at ,. And scientists warn the risk of catching Covid- is ten times higher at m away than m away. Yet Boris Johnson told his Cabinet the changes were crucial to rescue the economy, which has plunged into recession thanks to the pandemic.He told Parliament: Our long national hibernation is beginning to come to an end. But the PM also warnedthe virus surges too soon, the nation will be forced back into lockdown potentially region by region. Todayaposs changes come after the PM held a crunch meeting with his two top scientic advisors last night. The trio will appear later today at the pm press conference to offer more explanation. Later we are expecting detailed guidance on exactly what pubs, hotels and other venues will have to look like when they reopen. But key venues including hostels, soft play areas, gyms, swimming pools and nightclubs all remain shut.So what exactly has the Prime Minister announced so far and how will it affect you  Hereaposs everything you need to know. Things you can do from July  Venues that CAN reopen in England from July  All these venues can reopen in England providing they can show they are aposCovid-secureapos:Hotels and BBs  Holiday apartments or homes  Cottages or bungalows  Campsites  Caravan parks  Boarding houses  Places of worship  Libraries  Community centres  Restaurants, cafes and workplace canteens  Bars  Pubs  Cinemas  Bingo halls  Theatres and concert halls - but on the basis it’s not a live performance. They can only screen past performances for example  Museums and galleries  Hair salons and barbers  Outdoor playgrounds  Outdoor gyms  Funfairs  Theme parks  Adventure parks and activities  Amusement arcades  Other indoor leisure centres and facilities - including indoor gaming, social clubs, model villages, and indoor attractions at aquariums and zoos.You can finally visit friends and family indoors - but you canapost hug  People in England can have friends and family round to their house to eat, hang out and stay overnight from July  - but they can’t hug. For the first time since March, indoor gatherings will be allowed between two households who havenapost joined together in a “bubble”. Bubbles - a permanent joining of two households which let people break social distancing rules - aren’t being expanded, for now. But new rules will allow two households in England to meet indoors. This applies to all indoor gatherings, be they in private homes or in places like pubs. When you are indoors, your household will be able to meet with one other household at a time. That potentially includes staying over at someone’s house. There is no limit on the size of either of the households which can meet. And unlike with bubbles, ’exclusivity’ is not required. So you can have one friend round for a meal one weekend and another friend round another weekend. But there’s a big catch - these households should continue to remain socially distant from one another when they meet, That means following the m or ‘m plus’ guidance, and also following other advice such as regular hand washing. You can meet more people outdoors  There will be a slight change to the rules for people meeting outdoors from July . Currently up to six people from up to six households can meet in a park or garden,they maintain social distancing. This will continue, but there will also now be another option. Two households of any size - for example, two families of four - will now also be allowed to meet outdoors, as long as they maintain social distancing. So you can either meet five friends from dferent households, or an unlimited number of friends from one household. The two-metre rule will be cut  Changes will be made to the -metre rule in England from July . Where it’s not possible to stay  metres apart, people will instead be advised to keep to a social distance of “one metre plus”. This means staying one metre apart - plus mitigations which reduce the risk of transmission. On public transport it means people stay one metre away but with a face covering. In other spaces it will likely mean having screens between tables, making sure people face away from each other, putting in hand washing facilities, minimising amount of time spent with people from dferent households., and being outdoors where possible. Government sources claim having such mitigations in place at one metre away can have a “broadly equivalent impact” on transmission as staying two metres apart. But it comes despite grave warnings of the danger of moving people closer together. Scientists say the risk of catching coronavirus from someone is  to  times higher at one metre away compared to two metres away. Yet now fewer people have coronavirus in society overall, the overall risk of catching it is lower. And Tory MPs and the pub trade have piled pressure on Boris Johnson to cut the distance to save the economy. Crucially, the review was led by No and while it took advice from scientists, they had no powers of veto. Economists also contributed to the review.  Pubs, bars, restaurants, cafes and workplace canteens can all reopen in England from July  - both indoor and outdoors. But thereaposs a catch -youaposre indoors, you can only meet with people from one other household. And you should still maintain social distancing rules. That means staying either two metres apart, or one metre apart with mitigation measuresyou canapost manage two metres. It means no propping up the bar or standing in groups, and pubs will be encouraged to have table service where possible. All venues - from pubs to places of worship - will be expected to keep a record of people who visit, to enable contact tracing. But landlords won’t be expected to police what household customers belong to, or check ID of everyone coming in. Guidance for pubs will be published later today. You can get a haircut - but canapost get your nails done  Hairdressers and barbers will be allowed to reopen in England from July  with protective measures - including face visors for those cutting hair. It means millions of Brits can finally get a haircut after more than three months of having their locks chopped at home. But nail salons, which involve people sitting face to face, will remain shut for the foreseeable. You can go on staycation to English hotels, BBs and campsites - but not hostels  Hotels, BBs, holiday apartments or homes, cottages or bungalows, campsites, caravan parks and boarding houses can all reopen to paying guests in England from July . Again, they must follow Covid-secure guidelines - but people will be able to stay overnight away from their home. Despite concerns over shared facilities, campsites will be able to reopen in England from July . This would include showers and washing-up blocks. There will be Covid-secure guidelines to minimise the spread of the virus. But hostels with shared bedrooms cannot yet. This is dferent to Wales which is keeping both campsites and hostels shut. You can go to visit cinemas, galleries and museums  The government has now officially set the date of Saturday  July for cinemas, galleries and museums to reopen in England. Guidance will be published shortly on how to keep them safe - including one-way systems, spaced queuing, increased ventilation, and pre-booked tickets. A No source said: We are only able to move forward this week because the vast majority of people have taken steps to control the virus. But the more we open up, the more important it is that everyone follows the social distancing guidelines. We will not hesitate to reverse these stepsit is necessary to stop the virus running out of control.  Today comes hot on the heels of last nightaposs announcement that shielding will be eased for .million vulnerable people in England. From July  shielding people can go out and meet up to five friends - andthey live alone, form a aposbubbleapos with another household. From August , the advice to shield ends completely. But Statutory Sick Pay and direct food parcels for the shielding will also end on August , prompting alarm. Thereaposs also anger at the failure to have a legal safeguard against people being forced back to work. Things you still canapost do from July  Venues that CANaposT reopen in England from July  Government sources said “it’s not felt that at this moment in time it’s possible” for those venues to reopen. Task forces will be set up to try to get these venues open in a safe way. Nightclubs  Bowling alleys and skating rinks  Indoor play areas including soft play  Spas  Nail bars  Beauty salons  Swimming pools  Tattoo and piercing studios Massage parlours Water parks  Indoor fitness and dance studios  Gyms  Conference centres, other than for people who already work there. You canapost go to the gym  Government sources said gyms remain shut because there is a “far greater risk of infection” due to people breathing harder and touching surfaces. You canapost send your child to school  Only years R,  and  are allowed back to primary schools in England at the moment. The government wants all children back in September - but was forced to drop plans to do it earlier. Full plans for September are due to be announced next week. You canapost see a live theatre show  Theatres and concert halls can reopen in England from July  - with a catch. They can only reopen on the basis it’s not a live performance.

In Angela Merkel, his country of birth has an Iron Chancellor displaying crucial leadership – while Britain is lumbered with an incompetent flip-flopper in Boris Johnson. Germany’s death rate, at  per one million people, is roughly one-sixth of our . Yet it was achieved without wrecking a fth of its economy. Our world-beating highest excess deaths, and the worst economic hit, are a double-whammy panicking a growing number of Tory MPs into contemplating le after a Johnson clowning on a clf-edge. Easing lockdown restrictions, reopening pubs and dismantling ­ludicrous quarantine is the easy part for the Prime Minister. Build, build, build a decent, fairer, prosperous country feels beyond the dithering architect of lost lives, with care home scandals, PPE shortages, missed testing targets, still-shut schools and an app that proved to be the square wheel of technology. Johnson prefers to slobber constantly over the future because he can’t justy the present or defend the past. Feeble economic growth and still-mounting debt before the plague, the NHS on a le-support system and education suffering a decade of austerity cuts were the Government’s dismal record. Labour is wrestling with how to stop slippery Johnson exploiting Covid- as a Year Zero moment a fresh start for him and the Tories. His party did it successfully last year by dumping Theresa May so Johnson, ex-Foreign Secretary and lobby fodder – who for years loyally joined assaults on working families – could run against the Tories’ own record. Johnson regenerating more often than Doctor Who is tougher in . Unless Labour nail him, the charlatan won’t care about the truth.The next election might be as far off as December  but Lib Dem potential leader Layla Moran floatinglocal pacts with Labour and also ruling out another ConDem coalition is signicant.Tactical voting is key when Keir Starmer must win  more seats to just be the biggest party.

However, it wonapost be from July , Prime Minister Boris Johnson confirmed on Tuesday. New photos show a aposcoronavirus-proofapos gym in Essex that is ready to throw open its doors once the Government says it is safe to do so, and Total Fitness has released a video tour of a redesigned health club in Greater Manchester. Treadmills and other exercise machines will be separated by plastic screens pr spread far apart at redesigned gyms, and strict hygiene measures will be in place to curb the try to prevent the spread of Covid-. Gyms will be required to use clickers to count numbers going in and booking systems to prevent overcrowding, according to leaked guidance.to get the Mirroraposs biggest and best stories delivered straight to your inbox at www.mirror email.     No reopening date has been set for gyms. Owners were hoping they could restart their businesses next month alongside the reopening of pubs, restaurants, hairdressers and cinemas. However, Mr Johnson said indoor gyms in England must remain closed. Outdoor gyms can reopen. The Prime Minister published the Governmentaposs keenly-awaited review of the two-metre social-distancing rule, cutting it to one metre plus. UKactive, which represents , gyms, leisure centres and swimming pools, has warned that many facilities could close without financial help, thereported. The lockdown has put hundreds of jobs at risk. UKactive had told the Government that it would be “irresponsible” to open pubs and restaurants during a public health crisis while keeping fitness and leisure facilities closed. This is what gyms could look like when they reopen. Plastic screens Feelgood Fitness and Wellness Centre in Basildon, Essex, has undergone a transformation to prepare for le after lockdown. Owner Aaron Tyler, , held a socially distanced open day for customers to see the overhaul.All the machines are screened off. Mr Tyler said: “People can still stand next to their friend or loved one. A husband and we can be exercising next to someone they don’t know but they won’t be worrying about catching coronavirus. He added: “We’re now ready to reopen as soon as we get the green light. “I did not want to sit back and wait for the unknown asI lose this, I lose everything. Machines spread outTotal Fitness has redesigned its health clubs and laid out its gyms to ensure all workout spaces are a safe distance away from one another. There is increased distance between equipment, as well as floor markings to indicate the perimeters of workout spaces. Some machines such as treadmills will be switched off to make sure members donapost get too close to each other while working out. If each member is apportioned three square metres, the gyms still wouldnapost reach  per cent capacity during peak hours, the company said. Spotting could be prohibited PureGym said apospair-trainingapos and spotting could be prohibited and aposlighter loadapos exercise will be encouraged to prevent heavy breathing at its gyms. The chain has also spaced out equipment at its gyms. Strict hygiene measuresIt is unclearface coverings will be required. The sharing of personal items such as water bottles or towels is likely to be banned. Gyms will be required to employ strict hygiene measures and make sure machines and equipment are regularly wiped down and disinfected. Mr Tyler said numerous sanitiser stations have been attached to safety screens at his gym. Total Fitness will have sanitising stations and extra staff on hand to wipe down machines. It will ask customers to wipe down any equipment they have used or surfaces they have touched. There is a revised class timetable with  minutes between classes to allow for extra cleaning.  CEO Sophie Lawler said: “Importantly, our club teams will be on hand to support our members and also maintain rigorous cleaning regimes. It is making card-only payments mandatory across its reception and cafe areas to reduce contact. Changing rooms could be closed Sean McCoy, a personal trainer and CEP of GearJunkie, told Cosmopolitan that gyms may be forced to keep their changing rooms closed, similar to guidelines requiring retail shops to ban changing facilities. He said: I suspect that many gyms will close their changing rooms to encourage social distancing and disallow showers to avoid transmitting the virus through moisture. Many gyms feature showers that are not fully contained as they are open at the bottom. Essentially, water is passing through each cubicle and could cross contaminate surfaces.Gym users could instead be asked to shower at home. Lockers could also be sealed off, said Mr McCoy. Total Fitness is keeping its family changing rooms, childrenaposs play areas, squash courts and heat treatment areas closed. Members will be asked to wipe down their locker handles before and after use.

The south of the country will be the hottest spot this week - but much of the UK will enjoy temperatures much higher than the June average.Yesterday, Met Office forecasters issued a two level-two heat alert for the whole of England.The alert is triggered as soon as the risk is  per cent or above for threshold temperatures being reached in one or more regions on at least two consecutive days and nights. This is an important stage for social and healthcare services who will be working to ensure readiness and swt action to reduce harm from a potential heatwave, the Met Office said. Met Office chief meteorologist Dan Suri said: Temperatures will continue to climb through the week with a hot spell developing across much of England and Wales. From Wednesday temperatures will widely reach into the high twenties Celsius and itaposll be hot across much of the UK, especially central and southern England where we could see highs of Cto C .This hot weather is expected to last until at least Friday and so heatwave conditions are likely to develop for some areas this week.  For the rest of the UK, there will be some rain and drizzle up in the northwest, however this is expected to fade by late Tuesday. Northern Ireland and western Scotland will experience patchy rain, which will later die out and join the rest of the country in the sun. Today: Cloudy across the NW half of the UK with some rain or drizzle at times. Mostly sunny where and becoming very warm by the afternoon. Tonight: Remaining cloudy in the northwest with further rain or drizzle at times. Clear skies where with the odd fog patch forming by dawn.

Boris Johnson today told the House of Commons that places of worship will be able to open for prayer and services - including weddings - with a maximum of  people.This will be subject to social distancing measures, he said. But trips to indoor hospitality venues should still only be with one other household, the Mirror understands, which could make wedding receptions almost impossible. This also applies to baptisms and Bar Mitzvahs and other “le cycle events”. The PM acknowledged the dficulties people have endured with places of worship being closed, mentioning the Islamic celebration of Eid which fell during the lockdown period. The Mirror understands that while public worship will be allowed, full singing services will not due to the risk of spreading the virus. It comes as the PM today revealed a massive number of changes to the lockdown rules from July  in England. Boris Johnson said that from July , two households of any size should be able to meet in any setting. He said: From now on, we will ask people to follow guidance on social contact instead of legislation. In that spirit, we advise that from July , two households of any size should be able to meet in any setting inside or out. That does not mean they must always be the same two households, it will be possible for instance to meet one set of grandparents one weekend, the others the following weekend. But we are not recommending meetings of multiple households indoors because of the risk of creating greater chains of transmission.  Mr Johnson also announced that restaurants and pubs will be allowed to reopen. He said: I can tell the House that we will also reopen restaurants and pubs. All hospitality indoors will be limited to table service and our guidance will encourage minimal staff and customer contact. We will ask businesses to help NHS Test and Trace respond to any local outbreaks by collecting contact details from customers as happens in other countries and we will work with the sector to make this manageable.  The PM said hairdressers will also be allowed to reopen. Mr Johnson said: Almost as eagerly awaited as a pint will be a haircut, particularly by me, and so we will reopen hairdressers with appropriate precautions, including the use of visors. We also intend to allow some other close contact services such as nail bars to reopen as soon as we can when we are confident that they can operate in a Covid-secure way. And the PM added: From July , provided that no more than two households stay together, people will be free to stay overnight in self-contained accommodation including hotels and bed and breakfasts, as well as camp sites, as long as shared facilities are kept clean.

Up and down the country people have been standing on markers to ensure they stay cm behind the person ahead, and trying to visualise what two metres looks like when thereaposs no guide to help them. The move, recommended by the UK governmentaposs top scientic advisers, was implemented in March to help slow down the spread of coronavirus. While itaposs possible for people queuing in supermarkets and to enter high street stops, pub landlords and restaurateurs have said the rules would prevent them from making any money when theyaposre allowed to reopen. On Tuesday Prime Minister Boris Johnson confirmed the new one metre plus rule that would help businesses in England, such as pubs, restaurants, hairdressers and hotels, reopen from early July. What is the one metre plus rule  This new social distancing measurement would mean people can be one metre away from people they donapost live with,they make additional efforts to protect themselves. Efforts to mitigate transmission include avoiding face-to-face seating, reducing the number of people inside, improving ventilation, installing protective screens and additional hand sanitiser.

When the coronavirus lockdown is eased from July , customers may be required to show ID when they order a drink or food, and car parks could be transformed into beer gardens. It will be table service only, tables will be spaced apart or ided by perspex screens, and some pubs will use menus that will be thrown out after each use. Pubs, restaurants and hotels are expected to turn their spaces inside out this summer as they reopen their doors for the first time since late March in a bid to save the hard pressed hospitality sector.to get the Mirroraposs biggest and best stories delivered straight to your inbox at www.mirror email.     Boris Johnson has set out plans to allow pubs, restaurants, hotels, museums, theme parks and cinemas, among other places, to begin re-opening. The Prime Minister announced the Governmentaposs keenly-awaited review of the two-metre social-distancing rule on Tuesday, confirming it would be cut to one metre plus. The move follows intense pressure from some Tory MPs who have said easing the two-metre requirement is key to re-opening the hospitality sector. Many pubs and restaurants have been operating takeaway and delivery services. But the sector has warned that it would simply not be viable for them to operate as long as the two-metre rule remains in place, and thousands of jobs are at risk. Some scientists have, however, expressed concern the Government is moving too quickly, and that its track-and-trace system to contain any fresh outbreaks is not fully up and running. Here is what pubs could look like when they reopen from July , a day being dubbed Super Saturday. Book before visiting a pub  Punters may have to pre-book a table as pubs try to manage numbers due to social distancing restrictions. Some pubs have said all their tables have already been reserved on opening day. Health Secretary Matt Hancock had earlier suggested people may have to register their details online before they visit a pub. It would be part of contacting tracing efforts in case of a fresh Covid- outbreak. Mr Hancock told Sky Newsapos Sophy Ridge on Sunday programme: I wouldnapost rule it out, it isnapost a decision weaposve taken yet, but there are other countries in the world that take that approach. PPE Pubs and restaurants will have to adhere to extremely strict rules. Staff are likely to be wearing PPE such as face coverings, plastic face shields or gloves. Ban on ordering at bar  Punters will be banned from ordering at the bar in a bid to prevent crowding and limit contact between customers and staff. Instead, customers will be required to order at their table or through a smartphone app. Show ID when you order Each customer will be required to leave their name and contact details when they arrive. This measure would allow the authorities to carry out contact tracing should a Covid- outbreak occur. It had been suggested pubs and restaurants could ask customers to show ID to prevent them from leaving a fake name.  The industry hit out at that idea, citing privacy concerns and saying it would put unfair pressure on pubs because there is no similar requirement for retail shops. Pubs could be patrolled There was a suggestion at the weekend that pubs could be patrolled to make sure social distancing rules are being followed. By the time pubs reopen, the two-metre rule will likely be slashed to one metre or one metre plus. No standing outdoors  There could be a ban on standing while enjoying a pint with friends outside some pubs. In Westminster, central London, the council is planning to transform places such as Chinatown and Soho into a continental-style outdoor dining area in a bid to keep restaurants and bars afloat. The plans include a ban on standing and drinking outside. Beer gardens in car parks Ministers are drawing up plans allowing pub car parks and hotel grounds to be converted into temporary beer gardens this summer, thereported. Legislation to be introduced as early as Thursday will include changes to licensing laws to allow pubs, restaurants and hotels to turn their spaces inside out this summer.  It is hoped it will lead to a surge in al fresco dining and drinking. A source told the newspaper: At the moment, you [pubs and restaurants] have to specy in the plan for your licence where you are selling and serving alcohol. Beer gardens tend to be licensed already but car parks arenapost. You could have little courtyards that would be normally used for storage, car parks or land that you donapost normally license. A lot of hotels will have huge gardens but wonapost have an outdoor licence. Extended hours or one-off events Changes to the law would make it easier for pubs, restaurants and hotels to hold one-off events or extend the hours and activities permitted under their licence, thereported. More applications for road and street closures would also be granted, the report added. Social distancing  Punters will be required to maintain social distancing and pubs will undertake several measures to make it happen. Tables will be placed far apart and some pubs could install perspex screens. Some pubs could use disposable menus that are binned after a single use. Others could use a blackboard or a digital form. Restaurants can no longer lay tables in advance. Strict sanitising measures will be in place. Customer limits Due to the social distancing requirements, there will be a limit on how many customers are allowed. It could mean one in, one out policies or having to book a slot to help manage numbers. Some pubs could also use one-way systems for entering and exiting premises. Book a toilet break A Manchester tech firm has developed an app called Sort-It, which pubs and restaurants can use to force customers to book a trip to the toilet.

The Signal Box Inn takes its name from its location next to the Cleethorpes coast light railway and normally fits just six drinkers. Current social distancing rules mean no customers would be allowed to sit inside the CAMRA recognised pub - but going down to one metre means there may be room for one lucky punter. However thirsty drinkers donapost need to worry, with a large refurbished beer garden overlooking the adjoining railway and the Government now targeting a reopening date of  July, the pub aims to be back in business soon. For the latest on the coronavirus pandemic, click here The size of the building is approximate to the same scale as the narrow gauge trains that use the track and boasts five hand pumps serving real ale. Before social distancing measures came in there was just enough space for six people inside, according to landlord and former teacher Alan Cowood, . Alan said: Iaposve done all the risk assessments myself and at two metres we couldnapost have any customers inside, it is just too small wherever I stand behind the bar. It meant customers standing outside the door and collecting their drinks from a table.  Reducing the distance to one metre makes a big dference to the pub and all our staff. Alan says his regulars are very protective over the status as the smallest public house on the planet and canapost wait to be back. A lot of my customers travel round the country to dferent pubs and theyaposve all said weaposre the smallest by far, a proud Alan explained. The building was originally a signal box in Scunthorpe but moved to its current location in  and opened as a pub four years later in . Owned by the railway, it attracted visitors from around the world before lockdown, and a German tv station hoping to cover the grand re-opening. Alan added: We should have been open two weeks before Easter, and to be honest Iaposm raring to go. We just needed the green flag from Boris. We wonapost be able to get six customers inside, but fortunately we have got a large beer garden, so it wonapost be a problem for us. Hopefully we will be able to serve plenty of people, and the atmosphere should be great. The pub is hoping to open on  July and will resume train rides on the same day. Alan said: Technically we could have been serving takeaway beer but it isnapost the same experience. We wanted people to enjoy the pub and railway together, and open at the same time. Pete Bryant, , a director of the pub and railway, admitted the two metre rule had made opening dficult. We fully understand that at a time like this there are more important things going on in the world than getting the pub open, Pete said.  There are people who canapost see their grandparents, and that is why we didnapost want to open too soon, but we are ready to go now. The two metre rule caused us problems, not just in the pub, but for our volunteers in the cafe and in the train workshop. We have done all the planning at two metres, but we didnapost want to order all the branding just in case it changed. Going down from two metres also means we can get more people on the trains. The pub have rescheduled their famous cider festival for August after having to postpone it due to the lockdown. Fortunately we have made our station beer garden even bigger, Pete added.

Steve Challice, from Southampton, claims he took the picture of what he describes as a big fish while on holiday in Scotland. He estimated that it was  feet away and about  feet long. After sharing the image of the large creature emerging from the water online, people began commenting that it might be Nessie while others speculated whether the picture was real.But even Steve is sceptical, the Daily Record reports. He says he believes it to be something more mundane like a big fish or a seal. Personally I know there has been some interest and some people are saying itaposs the monster but I donapost believe that, he admitted. Steve was on holiday with his brother in September when they decided to visit Urquhart Castle on the banks of the famous loch. Spotting the chance to get away from the majority of the other tourists who had just arrived in a couple of coaches, Steve explained that he was initially photographing the opposite shore when he saw a sort of ripple in the water. He said: I started taking a couple of shots and then this big fish came to the surface and then went back down again. It only appeared in one shot and to be honest that was something of a fluke. I watched for a while as you can see from the last picture but didnapost see it again. He said it was only during lockdown that he has had time to look through the photos he had taken from his two week trip, stating that he had hundreds to go through as heaposs a keen photographer. Steve added he initially thought it was a catfish and only posted it online so people could try and identy it for him. He said: I have to say I donapost believe in the Loch Ness Monster and frankly I thinkanything is there then there is a logical explanation for most of the sightings. My guess would be that what I captured was a catfish or something like that. As seals get in from the sea then I expect thats what it is and that would explain why these sightings are so few and far between.

You don#t usually get something like that unless you#re giving something away but not for something that#s basically community interest.Dundee#.. ARE#.. YOU#.. READY Posted by The Kilted Kangaroo Dundee onWednesday,  June #I think the popularity of it is due to people liking what we#ve done and also, for a lot of people, they#ll be reminiscing back to the old Laings days.#We#re trying to create a separate environment from the unititself # so once you#re down at the bottom of the beer garden you don#t really need to go anywhere .#It#s completely self-serving. There#s a container bar there, portaloos, and, as of yesterday, there#s a -metre temporary marquee, with a removable roof for sunny days. It can come down and go up with a couple of hours notice.#At the moment we have everything set out at two-metres apart. It wouldn#t make a massive dference for us[social distancing regulations] changed to one-metre apart. As with what everyone  in the industry is experiencing, one-metre will make a massive dference for us. It won#t double capacity but it will give us a bit more peace of mind.#I think a one-metre rule will be much more manageable for establishments, when the time comes.#We were ready last week, when we thought we were going to be able to open.#I think the First Minister has been edging on the side of caution so we can be disappointed but we can#t really criticise.#When this started we were thinking we weren#t going to be able to re-open until October, November, maybe even December, which would be hard because you lose all the summer business.#Butwe can get a bit of July, into August and September then we will be happy with that.#For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

fulltext\"Lancet, which found that reducing physical distancing advice from two metres to one metre could double the risk of coronavirus infection.The study, which has been referenced by the First Minister in both the Scottish Parliament and during her daily media briefings, found that keeping a distance of more than one metre from other people reduced the risk of infection to %, compared with %standing within a metre.The WHO has recommended that people should physically distance by at least one metre, following a review of  comparative studies on the issue.When asked what Boris Johnson made of scientic critics, including the independent Sage group, coming out against reducing the two-metre guidance, a No  spokesman said: “The Prime Minister has asked for a review to be conducted by the permanent secretary in No  and that review has of course considered a range of medical and economic advice.“The committee will meet later on and will be free to discuss and consider whatever information they decide.”The First Minister also used Monday#s daily briefing to warn of other countries, including China and Germany, who are already dealing with spikes in cases as a result of #signicant outbreaks#.She added: #And health officials in South Korea have said they think the country is now experiencing a second wave.#I know that when numbers of cases and deaths here are continuing to fall it is very tempting for all of us to think it is all over and we should just now quickly get back to normal.#We are trying to get back to normal and we want to do that as quickly as possible but let me reiterate my strong view that acting recklessly now would be a serious mistake.#We must continue to be cautious and all of us must continue to adhere strictly to the public health advice.#That will help us continue progress and avoid a resurgence of the virus now.#The Tele is Dundee Born and Read, and is committed to providing news to our communities.Right now that’s more important than ever, which is why our key content is free.You can chose to support us and access premium content by subscribing to the Eveningfrom just £. a month. blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % -

We will of course continue to monitor this as the week goes on as it is still early days.#We are following the Scottish Government guidance to engage, explain and encourage customers to wear face coverings. If someone isn’t wearing a face covering, the driver will remind them of the new rules.#To help protect others, we are confident our customers will continue to do the right thing and bring a face covering to wear on our buses.#Our drivers’ main focus will remain on getting passengers to their destinations safely. Some people travelling will be exempt from wearing a face covering, including our drivers in their cabs or someone with a respiratory or other medical condition. We would urge passengers who are exempt to download our Extra Help to Travel card from the First Aberdeen website, which they can show to the driver to help ease this process.#We are already communicating the need to wear face coverings at this time, which aligns with guidance from the Scottish Government in conjunction with an industry approach for operators to engage, explain and encourage adoption. Throughout the coronavirus pandemic our drivers have responded superbly to the challenges in helping to ensure people can make essential journeys and this will continue.#We like to thank all customers for their ongoing co-operation at this challenging time. We all have a role to play in following the Scottish Government’s latest advice and regulations, to help get Aberdeen moving again safely.# vw, px\"  To support customers, free face masks have been made available at  of the busiest rail stations across Scotland, including Aberdeen, for a limited period.Stagecoach and ScotRail said the first day of the new rules saw the #vast majority# adhering to them.David Simpson, ScotRail operations director, said: “The position on face coverings is now absolutely clear and we are urging customers to take collective responsibility and follow the Scottish Government rules on their mandatory use.“We are doing everything we can to help customers get used to the changes in rail travel and that’s why, for a limited time, we will be providing face masks at our busiest stations. But Scotland’s Railway can’t guarantee physical distancing at all stages of a customer’s journey.“The message remains the same as it has been since the start of the pandemic: only travelyour journey is essential and follow our five rules for safer travel. It will help to keep you, your fellow customers, and our staff safe.“We have been asking customers to cover their face when using our services for a number of weeks, and it was positive to see the vast majority of people doing that today.” vw, px\"  A Stagecoach spokeswoman added: #We are following Government guidance, encouraging passengers to wear a face covering when using our services.#For day one, we have been pleased to see an overwhelming majority compliant with this guidance in Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire.#With that said, members of the public spotted breaching the rules will now be fined “as a very last resort”.Officers from British Transport Police will be speaking to rail staff and passengers to ensure people are following the new regulations.Assistant Chief Constable Sean O’Callaghan said: “I reiterate that everyone should still be avoiding public transportat all possible.“We are however confident that those who need to use the railway will act responsibly and will want to play their part in helping to protect each other and comply with the requirement to wear face coverings.“We understand that initially not everyone may be aware that it is now mandatory to wear face coverings – therefore our approach will be to engage with the public, explain the new government policy and encourage them to follow the new regulations for travelling on the railway.“Only as an absolute last resort will we carry out enforcement in the form of fines.“We are sure that the public will want to be responsible and do their part to protect others by wearing face coverings.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancellation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Evening Express website including all Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening Express n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb and ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayUnlimited access to all articles on the Evening Express website.

They are doing the same to support other temporary NHS services across Scotland.Our people have worked around the clock with health boards across the country to offer new, technical solutions to help frontline health workers get on with their jobs during this crisis.Our frontline staff in contact centres across Scotland – including Aberdeen, Dundee, Glasgow and Greenock – have risen to this unprecedented challenge. We’ve received a huge surge of customers asking for faster connections to help with home working, home schooling and running their businesses remotely.These colleagues – most of whom can now work from home when they want to – have performed a critical role keeping our customers, including frontline health workers and vulnerable people, connected.The people in our two  contact centres in Scotland are also playing a critical role, answering lesaving emergency calls.I couldn’t be more proud of how my colleagues have responded to these challenges and their desire to help us all through this crisis.Jane Wood, BT Group director in Scotland, Edinburgh.COVID- is seriously not a jokeGlobally kills thousands of folkYou start coughing, you can#t breatheWithout a respirator, this earth you#ll leaveSocial distancing is now in placeKeep two metres apart, not face to faceWash your hands frequently and well hours on surfaces it can dwellShop infrequently, for essentials onlyDon#t mix with othersyou#re lonelyKeep in touch by text and phoneDon#t put yourself at risk, stay aloneIt#s hoped soon this contagion will peakThen we canto normal, so to speakDon#t travel to other towns by carIt can spread the virus near and farSports, socialising and most work on holdThe alternative could cause damage untoldSupport the NHS, essential workers and neighboursThen we#ll defeat this virus by all our laboursDugald MacGilp, Lochgilphead.Sir,We are looking for people who have the passion to bring communities together, believe in the power of co-operation and who hold the well-being of their community at the forefront of their mind.The successful #Member Pioneers# will receive full training and business support as they help groups and iniduals during the coronavirus pandemic and beyond.

Action is needed and the bullies must be confronted. That they were allowed to behave in this way for so long is the real shocker.Their own managers have questions to answer. Why was this not nipped in the bud  Is there an ongoing lack of management training and support Whatever the reasons, it has to stop now.Minard folk were surprised to find themselves in the papers, on television and on the radio this week.

People who may have previously felt isolated in remote and rural communities may be feeling this even more acutely at this time, so it’s important they know support is available.Across the region, many people have also sadly faced the pain of losing loved ones to the virus or have fallen ill themselves, while others have seen their livelihoods put at risk or incomes reduced. All of this has put additional strain on people’s mental well-being.This year’s Mental Health Awareness Week is putting the focus on kindness as a means of helping people through the pandemic and building a better society as we emerge from it. We see many acts of kindness in the Highlands and Islands all the time, but this week is an opportunity for people to reflect on their interactions with others and how they can try and be a little kinder during this unprecedented time.David Stewart, MSP for Highlands and Islands region.Sir,During Mental Health Awareness Week, sight loss charity RNIB Scotland is highlighting the emotional reassurance and practical help it is offering during the coronavirus lockdown.Our Need to Talk telephone counselling service remains available in Argyll and Bute for anyone diagnosed with sight loss, as well as their families, friends and carers.Losing some or even all your sight can be devastating news to take in, but our trained helpers can support you in coming to terms with your condition and finding the way forward.RNIB is concerned the lockdown might be affecting people who are blind and partially sighted, many of whom are older, particularly hard. The uncertainty over access to basic shopping and medication, to information in accessible formats, the social isolation and barriers to being guided because of social distancing can all add and compound to the mental and emotional stress people are experiencing.As well as our Need to Talk service, the RNIB helpline on    is available for anyone with sight loss and we continue to organise social activities over the phone and social media.We want people with sight loss to know they are not alone and that help is available.James Adams, RNIB Scotland director, Edinburgh.The Scottish Invasive Species Initiativehas launched Alien Detectives – a fun and educational online resource to help the young and not so young  learn more about alien # or non-native – invasive species.Originally designed as a school education pack, the huge array of activities now includes a wide range of fun games and activities that anyone can enjoy at home, in the garden or on local walks during lockdown.Alien Detectives includes crafts, quizzes, worksheets, presentations and puzzles all themed around invasive species and the river environment. Although primarily aimed at young people, anyone with an interest in the environment or invasive species can enjoy them too.Our project team has been busy while homeworking during lockdown to produce these fantastic resources. We hope becoming Alien Detectives will bring many hours of enjoyment to iniduals and families during lockdown, especially at a time when most young people are not in a regular school environment and might be looking for a new challenge or activities to continue their learning.Invasive non-native species might be a new topic to many but it is a really important one. Invasive species can have a major impact on our environment and native wildle and are responsible for signicant bioersity loss in Scotland and across the world. We hope these resources will help raise awareness of the impacts of invasive species and inspire more young people to learn something about them.No prior knowledge is needed and there’s lots to learn and have fun with so become an Alien Detective and help us tackle invasive species today.All of the ‘Alien Detectives’ resources can be found at www.invasivespecies.scot alien-detectives.Callum Sinclair, SISI Project Manager, Newton Stewart.Sir,We may not be able to hold picnics in the usual way just yet, but why not hold the next best thing – a virtual picnic  That way you can invite as many people as you want.National charity Family Action is running its Virtual Family Picnic from May  to May  and everyone is invited.

We stayed with Margaret and Iain McDonald at their home named Meadowview in Tarbert which was located near the school.We all enjoyed the area so much that we continued to visit every year for the next consecutive eight years.Margaret invited me to go out on the herring boats once or twice. One was named Village Maid and the other Village Belle and, needless to say, we often had kippers for breakfast, which were very nice. I remember there was a boat called the Southern Cross tied up to Cock Island # can anyone tell me any history of it and when it disappeared There also used to be a smokehouse for kippers along from Tarbert to Ardrishaig.Another fond memory I have is watching the logging trucks unloading on the quay and watching them get loaded on to large boats and I think then being shipped round to Sweden or Finland. Is that correct or not as I thought there was a paper mill at Fort William As mentioned earlier, I joined North West Ambulance Service in the s and Margaret used to send me the Argyllshire Advertiser and in one of them was an advert for recruitment to the Scottish Ambulance Service.I duly got an application form from Paisley and was all but sending the form in when I realised it would be very unfair to move so far away from our young children#s grandparents and for them to be unable to see them growing up. At the time your local pharmacist was retiring and my we Sue was a qualied pharmacist, but our children were both under school age so relied on her parents for child care. Ironically, I believe the job was filled with a Blackpool pharmacist whom I had met ocassionally.My love for Scotland continued, and we had our honeymoon travelling around Scotland and calling in at Tarbert for several days on the trip round.Our last trip up there was  in June as a treat from our daughter who accompanied us on this trip. The weather was glorious, and one day we caught the bus to Skipness and walked part of the Kintyre Way back.Another day we took the MacBrayne Ferry to Islay, which was again a glorious day out, also visited Crinan, Lochgilphead and Inveraray, followed by a couple of days fishing off the pier in Tarbert. We travelled back via Portavadie and Dunoon, and have in the past used the ferry to Arran, then Brodick, Ardrossan and home.Thank you for taking the time to read this.

But the COVID- lockdown interrupted proceedings.This season’s Scottish Cup was a bit of a disappointment with Star exiting the competition in the second round after losing out to a vastly improved Dumbarton United side -. On the plus side, the first round saw Star take on Paisley League team Pollok FC and an excellent performance saw Star run out convincing winners -, one of only four defeats suffered by Pollok in all competitions.In the West Region Cup, Star progressed to the quarter-final again. A first round bye, a convincing - win against Cambuslang FA then a walkover saw the Lochgilphead youths face Paisley League A Division team Erskine.In a hard-fought encounter, Star matched Erskine for most of the game but with only  players available they couldn’t get the breakthrough they needed and eventually lost -.Star started their league campaign in September with a competitive match against new team Thorn, who transferred from Paisley A Division. Star lost -.Two strong performances in October saw Star record  a terric - win over Shettleston, last season’s league runners up, and a - win against St Patrick’s Sports Academy # an entertaining but nerve-wracking game.A mid-season stutter in November saw the Lochgilphead boys lose out to Cathcart -, then Clydebank -, both newcomers.The losing run continued into early December as Star faced last season’s champions Drumchapel Amateurs ending up down - at half-time before recovering their form with a committed second half display to pull it back to -. Unfortunately they lost out to a fourth Drumchapel goal as they chased the winner themselves.This set Star back on track as they finished the year with a hugely convincing performance, demolishing Cathcart -.January and February proved a real battle with the weather with wind, rain and freezing temperatures # often all three # only allowing four games to take place. Star secured fine victories over Busby, -, and Glasgow Red Star, -, and fought back to grind out creditable draws with Shettleston, -, and Place Park, another new team, -.Star played one league game in March before lockdown and again it was another entertaining game with a rollercoaster feel to it. Facing up to Drumchapel Amateurs, both teams played out another terric match which had everything.Coming back from a goal down and with only  men, Star played cracking football to race into a - lead but it took its toll as Drumchapel stuck to their task to draw level before adding a couple more goals to secure a win in the final five minutes.This was another fine season for Red Star s, competing well in a strong league, with only  signed players.Though the season was cut short, the boys played  games winning , drawing two and losing seven. They scored  goals and conceded  goals. There were some cracking games and the boys were looking forward to the knock-out stages of the league cup.Inconsistency probably cost Star a few more wins, but that’s what youth football development is all about and there is potential for the boys to develop.Well done from coaches and parents to the  boys who played this season – Craig Aitken, Zak Barclay, Gregor Brown, Keiran Caskie, Lewis Curran, Ruaridh Green, Woody Hoad, Alexander McLean, Conner McMurchy, Leon Murphy, Innes Paterson, Jamie Stewart and Tom West.Thanks for great support goes to sponsors Ardrishaig Community Trust, main strip, SC Crawford Building Contractors Limited, change strip and zip tops, Jewsons, tracksuits, and Mid Argyll Youth Development Services and the parents, supporters, referees and opposition teams that have made the season so enjoyable."},{"url":null,"title":"sheena shows the way as tarbert tees off","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsGolf started again at Glenralloch as lockdown measures were eased slightly across Scotland.The first members were on the tee at am on Friday May  for the re-opening, followed by a steady stream as the day went on.

based on the expert guidance we received, playing in clusters, in one territory, is the best option in terms of testing, travel and accommodation.It is the second year in a row that the competition has been played at the East Lothian course.Last yearrsquos event was won by Bernd Wiesberger after a play-off with Benjamin Hebert.Among those hoping to line up at the tournament is North Berwicks Grant Forrest.The -year-old, who finished tied for rd at least years event, said: \"It is great it is going ahead.\"Obviously, so much uncertainty in the last few months and the guys on the European Tour have been working really hard to put something together for us.\"I am glad they have got it on the schedule and I hope the weather is alright in October ndash who knows what it could be like \"There was a point where I thought it would almost be a year off, which would have been a real shame.\"They have done really well to give us so many events already and with the hope they could add a few more.\"Councillor John McMillan, East Lothian Councilrsquos spokesman for economic development and tourism, was pleased to hear the event had been rescheduled.He said: ldquoI very much look forward to welcoming world class golfers back to East Lothian for this fantastic tournament.\"We will of course work closely with the European Tour and in accordance with guidance on the detail of how the tournament can be run safely.\"It is an encouraging development and signals that Scotlandrsquos Golf Coast will be back open for business this year albeit with some restrictions still in place.Councillor Jeremy Findlay, who represents the North Berwick Coastal ward, was similarly pleased to see the event rescheduled but stressed it remained to be seen how the tournament would look in terms of a crowd.He said: \"I think it is great news not only for Scottish golf itself but for tourism in general.\"Hopefully, by then, we will be able to have crowds as well but I am really not sure what the rules on that are going to be yet ndash whether it is crowds or played behind closed doors, it would be a bit oddit was behind closed doors.\"In general, we will have to wait and see what the rules are about crowds.\"That is what produces the benefit in the short-term to the local economy.\"Mr Findlay highlighted that the tourism sector had taken \"a huge hit\" during the coronavirus crisis and many businesses would have to survive until next year before tourism started to resume in the traditional way.Currently, the Aberdeen Standard Investments Ladies Scottish Open is pencilled

In this monthly column, she shares her wildle diary ndash and pictures!THE day I first visited Musselburgh was not one to write home about.I came to town to see the house I had already agreed to move in to. Most people would organise a viewing before deciding to move in however, since it was my fianceacutersquos childhood home, I had simply said YES!Our move-in date was already confirmed, meaning this visit was just a formality.Upon seeing the amount of work the house still needed as it underwent considerable renovation, my initial reaction was one of utter petrication that it would not be completed on time.The weather was not particularly favourable either. Drenched in the cold September rain, I had lost my appetite to explore the area, which now seemed grim and gloomy.By contrast, my second visit to Musselburgh is one worth remembering.I had come to check on the progress of the house and to join a group of birdwatchers for a stroll around the Esk and the lagoons.The walk started at the river mouth, from where we watched a couple of cormorants sunbathing.It was not long before someone raised the cry: ldquoA kingfisher!I promptly directed my camera to where everyone was looking, and I saw him: a beautul, bright blue kingfisher.After that sighting I knew my le would change.Moving to Musselburgh ended up being one of the best decisions I have made .Since that day I have been studying this wee bird.Every spare moment is spent at the river watching for our kingfisher.It has become my all-encompassing obsession.Each encounter teaches me something new and I never stop learning.This one bird inspired me in many ways, such as helping me understand the importance of fieldcraft in wildle photography, and allowed for some unforgettable captures.So, without further ado, let me formally introduce Mr KingfisherhellipThe kingfisher is an unmistakeable bird, with its metallic azure blue back and bright orange breast.The bird is usually glimpsed, a sudden flash of glistening blue, flitting at the riverbank.If you are luckyenough, the bird may comfortably land near you.Usually, despite its exotic colouration, the bird is dficult to spot sitting on a branch surrounded by foliage, a kingfisher successfully blends into the landscape.I have spent hours in the field and can still struggle to spot a perching kingfisher.When I locate a bird, I identy the sex by the birdrsquos beak: the malersquos is completely black, whilst the femalersquos is orange underneath.Kingfishers are territorial and they will hold their ground against other iniduals.Breeding season is the only time when the male and female tolerate each other and share territory.The choice of feeding ground is extremely important as the bird is dependent on it all year round.Each area covers at least km of slow-flowing fresh water or lake, but this may extend anywhere up to km.The resident male I have been watching for almost three years exhibits slight migratory behaviour it travels upstream during the breeding season, whilst it spends the winter months near the river mouth. For its fishing ground, a kingfisher will often choose a shallow pool in the river bend.They are not titled ldquoking fishers for nothing and are experts in this field.Before ing, they sit patiently on a perch, bobbing their head back and forth to assess the exact position of a fish.Once it has spotted a fish, it es headfirst at speeds up to mph.The kingfisher enters the water with beak half open and eyes protected by its third, transparent eyelid.A split second later, the bird emerges, beak first, and flies back to the perch.Here, it twirls the fish so that it may be held by the tail, proceeding to bash it against the perch to kill it and break the spine, making it easier to swallow.If you have a favourite animal you would like me to feature next month, or are looking for advice on how to spot and photograph a kingfisher, contact me through my website or social media channels.

But the journey became more than I anticipated, and gave me a new angle on Einsteinrsquos theory of relativity.To reach the island I went on a cycle with my good friend Gareth. He is a keen cyclist, and in my early days I was too. I literally cycled hundreds of miles a week. It gave me freedom and a sense of adventure.Over the last couple of decades my cycling adventures have signicantly declined. Those long adventurous rides I used to go on, well they have been a thing of the past, especially after my beloved bike was stolen years ago.But then, during the lockdown, my wee daughter Skye decided she wanted to learn to cycle, and with gritty determination she did so, magically on the same path in the Greenhills at Prestonpans where I learnt so many years before.So another friend very kindly leant me a bike and I was able to accompany my daughter around the then quiet streets of our town as she developed her confidence.I enjoyed this, and it was good exercise, but it began to give me itchy feet and a nostalgic longing to re-experience some of the joys of my youth and head off onto the open road and go exploring on two wheels under my own steam.So when Gareth suggested we go for a ldquovery short cycle ride to visit Green Craig island that I had heard so much about, I gladly accepted.The destination was just beyond the big gates of Gosford House in total just under five miles away. And, of course, the road follows the coast, so no horrible hills to climb.So I set off, with my children waving at me asI was going to war, and met Gareth outside Cockenzie House as arranged.It was from here I became increasingly aware of the depreciation my body has suffered since my last long cycle.The road was, as far as I could ascertain, flat.There was a very slight breeze on my face to cool me, so in theory it was perfect cycling conditions.But something was wrong I was very quickly puffing and panting as I tried to keep up with my friend, who was coasting effortlessly in front of me.I could feel my face turning red and an old lady walking her small dog looked up and gave me a sympathetic glance as I passed her.I was cycling faster than she was walking but not by much.Then another cyclist passed me, at what seemed to be close to the speed of light, at least compared to the pathetic speed I was travelling.It was at this moment I noticed Gareth was well ahead of me, and talking to himself, as he believed I was still just behind him.So I called out, ldquoGareth, slow down a wee bit! He waited for me to catch up.ldquoSorry, I said, ldquofeel free to cycle ahead but I will have to go slower.ldquoYou want to go ahead  he asked.ldquoNo, I said, ldquo we do that we may be in danger of falling over due to lack of velocity!And so we headed out of town.My comment about velocity had put me in mind of Einsteinrsquos theory of relativity that speed is not absolute and objects move at a speed relative to one another, and that this affects the passage of time.My time was most certainly being slowed down. Never had that short journey felt so long.I discovered small hills I had driven over but never noticed. I became acutely aware of the power of gravity, and I lost count of how many stops I needed before we finally arrived at our destination.But what elation when we did arrive: I was shocked on one hand at just how unfit I was, but on the other I had a sense of achievement.We locked our bikes and headed along the coast to the island. The tide was out which meant we could reach it without getting our feet wet.Gareth was keen to find a trig pole which he had discovered was on the wee island. It was used by early map makers but we didnrsquot find it.We sat on a log, and Gareth offered me a cup of tea from his flask. Hersquod bought an extra cup, and we sat there, two metres apart on an old log looking out to sea, talking. It was the best cup of tea I can remember in a long time.The island isnrsquot much in itself, more like a tuft of land or gloried sandbank, just beyond the coast.But itrsquos the location and what you can see from it which makes it special, both in terms of wildle and landscape. And history too is all around.The sea comes in fast at this point and it was soon moving in a pincer motion, enveloping the wee tuft of land to make it an island once again.Itrsquos that which perhaps excites the childhood imagination in us, beating the tide before being marooned or maybe being marooned could be the best bit!But we left just in time. The sea lapped at our feet as we walked past the huge concrete blocks from wartime and we discussed the goings on in the world.As we reached our bikes I noticed some dens made by previous visitors.Impressive constructions, showing perhaps that the lockdown for many of us has given us an opportunity to explore and discover our own area in ways perhaps we never did before.Then we set off home. The journey back gave me a new phenomena to contemplate that a road can feel uphill both ways when you are an unfit, overweight man on a bicycle.Gareth insisted on cycling with me all the way home, you know, just in case.But I made it, and got a kind reception from my kids who asked me, ldquoWhere have you been all this time, you must have gone really far Well in one way I had. Not in terms of actual physical distance perhaps, but certainly in terms of having an unexpected and unforgettable adventure with a kind and understanding friend."},{"url":null,"title":"man-stamps-mark-unique-present-idea","story":"Donald Malone ndash originally from Whittingehame and who runs his own wildle education business, Wildside Nature ndash is using stamps from all over the world in a iety of dferent ways as interesting gt ideas for people.He explained: ldquoI collected stamps when I was a child, aged seven or eight.ldquoThen about  years ago my interest in them restarted.

Wuhan, Iran and later Italy, we knew that losing your sense of smellwas a signicant symptom of the disease.Now, after months of reports, both anecdotal and more rigorous clinical findings, we think we have a model for how this virus may cause smell loss.One of the most common causes of smell loss is a viral infection, such as the common cold, sinus or other upper respiratory tract infections.Those coronaviruses that donrsquot cause deadly diseases, such as COVID-, Sars and Mers, are one of the causes of the common cold and have been known to cause smell loss.In most of these cases, sense of smell s when symptoms clear, as smell loss is simply the result of a blocked nose, which prevents aroma molecules reaching olfactory receptors in the nose. In some cases, smell loss can persist for months and years.For the novel coronavirus , however, the pattern of smell loss is dferent. Many people with COVID- reported a sudden loss of sense of smell and then a sudden and fullto a normal sense of smell in a week or two.Interestingly, many of these people said their nose was clear, so smell loss cannot be attributed to a blocked nose.For others, smell loss was prolonged and several weeks later they still had no sense of smell. Any theory of anosmia in COVID- has to account for both of these patterns.This suddenof a normal sense of smell suggests an obstructive smell loss in which the aroma molecules cannot reach the receptors in the nose .Now that we have CT scans of the noses and sinuses of people with COVID- smell loss, we can see that the part of the nose that does the smelling, the olfactory cleft, is blocked with swollen soft tissue and mucus ndash known as a cleft syndrome.The rest of the nose and sinuses look normal and patients have no problem breathing through their nose.We know that the way SARS-CoV- infects the body is by attaching to ACE receptors on the surface of cells that line the upper respiratory tract.A protein called TMPRSS then helps the virus invade the cell. Once inside the cell, the virus can replicate, triggering the immune systemrsquos inflammatory response. This is the starting point for the havoc and destruction that this virus causes once in the body.Initially, we thought that the virus might be infecting and destroying the olfactory neurons.These are the cells that transmit the signal from the aroma molecule in your nose to the area in the brain where these signals get interpreted as ldquosmell.However, an international collaboration showed recently that the ACE proteins the virus needs to invade the cells were not found on the olfactory neurons.But they were found on cells called ldquosustentacular cells, which support the olfactory neurons.We expect that these support cells are likely to be the ones that are damaged by the virus, and the immune response would cause swelling of the area but leave the olfactory neurons intact.When the immune system has dealt with the virus, the swelling subsides and the aroma molecules have a clear route to their undamaged receptors and the sense of smell s to normal.So why does smell notin some cases This is more theoretical but follows from what we know about inflammation in other systems.Inflammation is the bodyrsquos response to damage and results in the release of chemicals that destroy the tissues involved.When this inflammation is severe, other nearby cells start to be damaged or destroyed by this ldquosplash damage. We believe that accounts for the second stage, where the olfactory neurons are damaged.Recovery of smell is much slower because the olfactory neurons need time to regenerate from the supply of stem cells within the lining of the nose.Initial recovery is often associated with distortion of the sense of smell known as parosmia, where things donrsquot smell like they used to.For many parosmics, for instance, the smell of coffee is often described as burnt, chemical, dirty and reminiscent of sewage.Physiotherapy for the noseOlfaction has been called the Cinderella of the senses because of its neglect by scientic research.But it has come to the forefront in this pandemic. The silver lining is that we will learn a lot about how viruses are involved in smell loss from this. But what hope is there for people with a loss of smell now The good news is that the olfactory neurons can regenerate. Theyrsquore regrowing in almost all of us, all of the time. We can harness that regeneration and guide it with ldquophysiotherapy for the nose: smell training."},{"url":null,"title":"headteacher-praised-leadership-style","story":"North Berwick High Schools head Lauren Rodgers was described by Education Scotland inspectors as having a clear direction and being well respected.However while the inspection, carried out in February, praised the staff and leadership at the school and achievements of its senior students, it flagged some concerns about S-S pupils.The report called for more work to be done to ensure all younger students received their full entitlement to Broad General Educationin the first three years at the school.In particular it stated: \"Currently, a few young people are not experiencing a modern language until the end of S.\"Inaddition, the current arrangement is not sufficient for young people to receive their entitlementto a meaningful experience of a third language.\"Inspectors urged the school to ensure the focus was on ensuring younger pupils received full access to experiences across the curriculum and did not allow a focus on reaching exam levels to impact on them.The inspectors said: \"Teachers should ensure that learning at Sacross all curriculum areas remains focused on the experiences and outcomes of CfEanddoes not prioritise the requirements of National Qualications .\"Senior and middle leadersshould ensure that learning experiences in S provide those young people specialising atfourth level with appropriate depth in their learning to provide successful progression to thesenior phase.\"Inspectors visited the school in February  and assessed the schoolrsquos performance across four key indicators: leadership of change learning, teaching and assessment raising attainment and achievement and ensuring wellbeing, equality and inclusion.The school was evaluated as lsquovery goodrsquo in the first three categories and lsquogoodrsquo in the fourth.Headteacher Lauren Rodgerrsquos leadership style was described as ldquocharacterised by openness and by trust, promoting empowerment in a supportive ethos.

Itrsquos not just in the countryside that they have become a large part of our lives, a source of ersion, fascination and even, or so I have felt, of company. Stepping outside in the morning is like entering the Usher Hall during warm-up, a discordant and energetic orchestra of flutes, pipes and trumpets. As I brush my teeth, I sometimes see Wilf, the blackbird with the silver ankle ring, by the chimney, letting the wind ruffle his feathers. He has a very keen look, and when our eyes meet, you feel you have been noted. By evening, his spot is taken by a pair of turtle doves which perch side by side on the TV aerial, well camouflaged against the dusky sky.Alan saw Wilf enjoying a bath in a puddle the other day, near his HQ, in the centre of the village. On our first social gathering in months ndash a glass of wine in a neighbourrsquos garden one warm evening ndash Wilf landed on the lawn beside us, hopping behind our chairs, and unperturbed by our friendsrsquo inquisitive dog. Clearly he considers every garden to be his private food department. Theirs is Fortnum and Mason to our Lidl.A barn owl has been seen in the village lately, out hunting before dark. The photos show a beautul, ghostly creature with a heart-shaped pale face, after which Hoolet is named. It was gliding low between trees and across the edge of rough fields. I hope it kept its distance from the blue tits, because other birdsrsquo chicks are the perfect snack for owls and their owlets. That comes as little surprise, but it wasnrsquot till recently that I learned that the woodpeckers haunting our garden might be lingering near the nestbox in hope of a tasty snack. A large one had taken up position on the gatepost, a few days ago, within earshot of the nest. Squirrels, meanwhile, are the stuff of blue titsrsquo horror movies. They have been known to gnaw away at a nestbox entrance to reach the birds inside.The charm most of us find in bird le and nature is often a rose-tinted perspective. For birds, every day is a challenge, a survival exercise tougher than anything the SAS could conceive. Often Irsquoll see the older blue tits, decidedly dishevelled, stuffing themselves on our peanut feeders as they boost their blood sugar levels ahead of another caterpillar hunt. Occasionally a scattering of feathers in the flowerbeds indicate where a cat has brought down a weary or unwary bird. The RSPB says that the avian massacre by cats ndash estimated to be over  million a year ndash is a natural winnowing, with only the weak or ill falling prey. Irsquom not convinced. It sounds like a half-truth, aimed to prevent all-out conflict between bird and feline lovers. Not that the two are mutually exclusive.Danger is all around,yoursquore small and feathered. Friends were out for a walk beyond Hoolet recently, and spotted a flock of sparrows, feeding on grass-heads. Suddenly, not six feet away from them, a sparrowhawk swooped and snatched one of the birds. The speed of the attack, and the hawkrsquos audacity, were startling.Nor was this a first sighting of this turbo-charged predator that moves at the speed of a bullet. Occasionally I catch one ing between our house and a neighbourrsquos garden. As it flashes past the kitchen window, you know this is no idle reconnaissance. From its perch high in the sycamore, it has spied something delicious. The best you can hope is that, for the creature caught in its crosswires, the end is mercully swt.With less traffic, you see far fewer birds flattened on the roads, especially pheasants, which usually seem positively eager to examine the chassis of approaching cars. Our neighbours were nevertheless worried that theyrsquod found a pegged-out pheasant among their poppies. Hearing them calling to us through the beech hedge ndash by now almost as impenetrable as the Berlin Wall ndash we hurried over to offer first-aidrequired.The glittering, fearless ndash and pea-brained  ndash beauty, which has been parading our gardens since springtime, was far from dead. It had simply settled itself into an earthy dip to enjoy the sun. This would explain the dusty hollows Irsquove been finding of late in the shrubbery, asan easter egg-sized UFO had landed. Unfazed by the humans clucking anxiously around it, the pheasant only roused itself and got to its feet when it heard us approaching on the gravel.Another frequent visitor is the young hedgehog which has taken to walking up the road to the house, around tea-time, and disappearing into the back garden. Seeing it approach, I stuck my head out of the door into the pouring rain, and noticed it has a limp. Seen from behind, it lurched on one hind leg, like a trolley with a wonky wheel. Since it was going at a lick, and obviously knew exactly where it was heading, I left it to get on with it.Itrsquos a matter of days before the blue tits will be out of their nest, and bouncing around the garden. In a second-hand bookshop last year I found a guide to making your garden more bird friendly. In a chapter on building nestboxes for dferent species, it advised that, after the breeding season, these boxes must be cleaned, to protect future broods from disease. This must be how landlords feel when the end of a tenancy is approaching. The need to disinfect is clearly universal. Unique to providers of avian accommodation, however, is the warning to brace yourselves for finding addled eggs, or the remains of chicks that failed to thrive.

His immediate task  The further easing of the lockdown in England without causing a surge in new cases.Ahead of the main act announcing something this week, Downing Street sent a warm-up man in the shape of Englandrsquos Health Secretary, Matt Hancock. On the dove-ish side of the lockdown easing debate, he was perhaps better placed than some to reassure the public that it would be safe to get back out there into pubs, restaurants, and schools.Sky Newsrsquos Ridge on Sunday was first to run the rule over the numbers with Mr Hancock. By presenter Sophy Ridgersquos reckoning, the contact tracers were only reaching two people a week.: Revolutionary vision for post-Covid ScotlandFar from being a sign of failure, said the Minister, this was a good thing.

With the failure of the Isle of Wight trial and still no date as to when the software will appear, the app has become a Bennettian ldquochip in the sugar, a sign of standards not being met and promises unfulfilled.Asked when the app would be ready, Mr Hancock said he was not going to put a date on it . ldquoIrsquom highly confident it will happen, said the Minister. By the time he reached The Andrew Marr Show this had become ldquoWersquoll get there with the app.Nick Robinson was standing in for Andrew Marr, whose father has died. The Today presenter was among those who deputised for the Scot after his stroke in . Robinson would have found the format much the same: start with the papers, end with a Minister, and pause in the middle for something lighter, in this case interviews with Kristen Scott Thomas, who stars in one of the Talking Heads, ldquoThe Hand of God, and Nicholas Hytner, who directs three of them.One major change Robinson could not have predicted are the by now regular slots on Marr for experts. Both Professor Sir Ian Diamond, the UKrsquos National Statistician, and Professor Peter Piot, director of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine stressed that coronavirus had not gone away and there was no room for complacency.Professor Piot, described in his introduction as something of a star in the fight against viruses ndash the ldquoMick Jagger of microbes someone had called him ndash said he would be okay with a relaxation of the two metre rule as long as masks were worn in public places. He also called the quarantining of people entering the UK ldquouseless and urged the UK Government to appoint a Covid- tsar at Cabinet level.: Former FMslates blended learningIn all his answers he was as clear as day, unlike Mr Hancock who had to do the usual thankless ministerial task of talking about a subject while not giving anything away before the official announcement.In lieu of detail Mr Hancock had come bearing a new word: ldquomitigations.

It sounded like another headline in the making.One person determined not to make the headlines was Iain Stewart, the new Scotland Office Minister, making his first appearance on Politics Scotland.Mr Stewart, the MP for Milton Keynes South, got his job because the previous incumbent had resigned over Dominic Cummingsrsquo dash to Durham. But Mr Stewart had little to nothing to say on that to host Gordon Brewer. Nor was he keen to share his thoughts on extending the furlough in Scotland save for telling the Scottish Government to be ldquomore ambitious on reviving the economy.ldquoAll yoursquore doing is telling us things we already know, said Brewer. Mr Stewart was still not for budging. He survived his baptism of fire, or baptism of Brewer, by sticking ruthlessly to his lines.

It was her proud claim that not one of her children left without being able to read and write. Coincidentally, it seemed that the majority of them wanted to learn, teachers and parents were respected and discipline was applied rigorously, despite the widespread poverty.I find it dficult to understand why, in our modern system of free education, more and more children seem to prefer to roam the streets, rather than apply themselves to learning the basic Rs. Interestingly, the children of immigrants seem to appreciate this more than our home-grown lot.I wonder why this would be Carol MacDonald, Troon.POLITICIANS and high-ranking civil servants behind the decision for \"blended\" schooling, aka part-time school, are largely cushioned from the consequences of their decisions: they dont have to choose between working and educating their children at home because they have jobs where they can be flexible about hours, can afford for their partners not to work full-time, can afford private tutors or to send their children to private schools whichthey are not offering full-time schooling in August will still be offering much more than state schools.But it isnt just the children of politicians and high-ranking civil servants who are protected from the consequences of their decisions about lockdown. They, together with the scientists who are advising them, are not facing redundancy. Very many people employed in hospitality, retail and many other businesses in the private sector will lose their livelihoods as this protracted lockdown pans out these senior figures in the public sector wont.Linda Holt , Anstruther.WHEN I retired from teaching almost  years ago it was obvious that a signicant proportion of my colleagues did not enjoy the best of health.

but also considered by the Scottish Governmentrsquos Covid Advisory Group - the percentage of positive Covid tests in a total sample is an important way of gauging the magnitude of the virus problem.The paper adopted Germanyrsquos criteria, which says thatmore than % of your virus tests are producing a positive result you ldquohave a problem.At less than %, the country is ldquogetting a handle on the problem and at around % ldquoyou are likely to be in control.By the time the positive rate falls to around % or less ldquoyou are on the safe side, said the paper, noting that this was the benchmark set early in the pandemic by Covid success stories such as Taiwan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand.Fundamentally, the percentage positive rate is considered to be an important thermometer of whether a countrys testing regime is adequate to cope with the amount of virus spreading within its population.The World Health Organization recommends that the rate should be below % for at least two weeks before countries begin to relax social distancing and other public health measures.At the height of its Covid crisis, New York City had a positivity rate of % -

Everything, intellectually, is up for grabs. Changes in thinking ndash which before would have taken years, even generations ndash now happen almost overnight.Just a few days ago, for instance, I was taken aback by the boldness of thought which came from one of Scotlandrsquos leading economists, Professor Ronald MacDonald.MacDonald and I spoke about what can only be described as his revolutionary vision for a post-Covid economy. I wrote about his ideas in our sister paper, The Herald on Sunday, at the weekend. To put it mildly, MacDonald wants to completely reimagine capitalism ndash to recalibrate how we live so the world becomes a fairer, safer, saner place.MacDonald isnrsquot just a big brain at home here in Scotland and Britain ndash hersquos among the leading % of economists in the world. When he speaks, others really should listen. Nor is MacDonald a natural radical. In Scotland, hersquos probably best known for pouring economic cold water on the case for independence.In person, hersquos mild-mannered, avuncular and charming. This isnrsquot a rebel by any stretch of the imagination. But what he says is truly rebellious ndash at least from the point of view of those who control the levers of power when it comes to politics and finance.Self-evidently, it says a lot about our world that the term \"revolutionary\" should ever be applied to ideas that champion decency and fairness. But then inequality and a brutal social darwinism are the hallmarks of the society in which we currently live.MacDonald is simply saying what a lot of ordinary folk will see as common sense. The only dference is that unlike many of us, MacDonald can back up his common sense worldview with a letime of knowledge and study. Intellectually, hersquod be a dficult man to shout down at any time but the world we live in today makes any attack on his ideas seem dull, lazy, stagnant. Yesterdayrsquos thinking.The ideas that MacDonald is putting forward would have been dismissed just a few months ago as crazy by the middle-brow commentariat and political class whorsquove spent their cosy careers singing hymns to unfettered free market capitalism. Our think-tanks and political parties are populated by a courtier class of hired hacks and group-thinkers whose intellectual horizons go no further than the tips of their noses.Now, though, in this post-Covid world, real thinkers can look at the world and see that not only is the time ripe for change, and ripe for debate about change, but also ordinary people are desperate for change, they want to hear big ideas that will make their lives better.I see the central message of MacDonaldrsquos call for change as this: a sht from shareholder capitalism to stakeholder capitalism. In other words, itrsquos not those distant shareholders who only call the shots, itrsquos you too. How many jobs have been lost, and lives squeezed, in recent years following the  financial crash, because shareholders wanted to wring more money for themselves out of the companies we work for. The idea that an ordinary worker can be thrown on the scrapheap because an absentee shareholder wants more money, more luxury, more \"stuff\", is so audaciously brazen, itrsquos almost criminal.So at heart, MacDonald simply wants to recalibrate the economy so itrsquos fairer for all. He proposes a wealth tax on the super-rich, and also a land tax. His plans donrsquot fundamentally threaten business or entrepreneurs. Theyrsquore needed to invest and help rebuild the economy post-Covid. In fact, he suggests making le easier by providing grants rather than loans to small and medium-sized companies.Another intellectual pillar of MacDonaldrsquos vision is that GDP should no longer be the sole measure of a nationrsquos success. We need to measure ourselves not by wealth alone, but by health, social care, the environment and the quality of citizenrsquos lives.Isnrsquot this the essence of decency  Isnrsquot this the kind of ideas our grandmothers instilled in us when we were all young  That money doesnrsquot buy you happiness. That you donrsquot measure a person by whatrsquos in their pocket but in their soul.MacDonald wants ldquoa new form of social contract where government instigates a ldquowellbeing fiscal stimulus. There can be no more austerity. Social capital is as important as capital. Happy, community-minded people who trust each other and their government will be productive wealth-creating citizens.Key to managing this change is the greening of the economy. If we replace our old dying oil industries with new green energy utilities,we start building and retro-fitting green homes and factories, we will create jobs and wealth, and help keep climate disaster at bay.Irsquom simply giving you the headline bullet points from MacDonaldrsquos new study on changing the economy. It makes for compelling, convincing, and necessary reading.But will it lead to anything  Will those in power listen to him, or is MacDonald a wise man shouting at the storm There is hope. The First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has indicated in the past that she has the bravery of thought to also imagine a new form of economics. Earlier this year, before the pandemic, she said that it was ldquomorally indefensible to focus purely on growth as the measure of a nationrsquos success. Sturgeon also backs a Universal Basic Income although, some fear that rather than lting people out of poverty, UBI could institutionalise poverty.What matters is that Sturgeon has an open mind to economic change. If we cast our eyes around the world, there are few leaders of similar inclination.The ingredients for change are all there. We are facing financial ruin in the face of coronavirus, with devastation worse than . God knows where that leads us in such a ided and fraught era. So we have to act. An economist of great standing has written a roadmap for change. A leader is in office who has the intelligence to see that change is needed. Most importantly, the people want change, and we want it now.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

This was a logical result of the requirement by the government of clan chiefs sons to be educated in England or the Lowlands. It was the inevitability of insisting these Scots be forced to enter schools which to this day are the production line to leadership in government and the military. Hoist by your own petard comes to mind.It is an obvious fact that history is written by the victors. I would suggest thatmore Scots actually knew their history there would be a much greater feeling of anger aimed at the Parliament in Westminster. Of course we were involved in the slave trade, but so were the African chiefs who sold their countrymen to the slavers and the plantation owners, many of whom were freed slaves in later days. Egyptians, Greeks, Romans, Vikings and Moors all have history of slavery and Brazil only banned slavery in . I am not being deafened by their apologies.If you throw a stone into the wake of a boat it will alter the pattern of the waves in some way but it will not affect where the boat is going. It is the same with history. If you are willing to learn from it you can better move forward, but changing street names and pulling down statues benefits the future not one iota. I would suggest to Mr Smith that he should worry far more for the future of his unionist ideologyScots do give up victimhood, as the next logical emotion is anger.David Stubley, Prestwick.I AGREE with Mark Smith that Scots need to face up to their history, good and bad, but when I was at school I studied history for five years and the curriculum contained not one iota of Scottish history what I got was Henry VIII and his marital woes, the Battle of the Nile, the League of Nations and the Russian Revolution. I note that in his cherry picking of bits of Scottish history, Mr Smith has made no mention of the  Act of Union, when Scots rioted in the streets because their nationhood had been signed away, and the Speaker of the House of Commons declared \"We have catchd Scotland and we will bind her fast\".The past should serve as a lesson to the present, although that is a lesson which seldom seems to be learned sadly, the war to end war didnt, and in the st century UK foreign policy would appear to have learned nothing from past centuries, involving itself in foreign wars including an unwinnable war in Afghanistan, and to the UKs eternal shame, the illegal invasion and bombing of Iraq. Carl Sagan wisely said: \"You have to know the past to understand the present,\" and many would dismiss Henry Fords comment that \"history is more or less bunk\". But he went on to observe: \"It is tradition. We dont want tradition. We want to live in the present and the only history that is worth a tinkers dam is the history we make today.\" In making todays history, how we deal with present issues, many of which are rooted in the past, will determine our future and the future of generations to come that is what should concern us most of all.Ruth Marr, Stirling.NOT that long ago the Scots actor David Hayman narrated an excellent BBC documentary on this countrys involvement in the slave trade entitled Scotlands Shame. The essence of the programme was that it related actual and authentic history, highlighting how the trade in human beings impacted every aspect of Scotlands economic, social and cultural le. In doing so it broke with the Great Man or Great Inidual view of history which so often trivialises serious history. The same approach has been adopted by Professor Sir Tom Devine.This authentic appraisal of the nations past is not an easy debate to have and it is important that it is conducted as objectively as possible. It is, however, related to another aspect of Scotlands history and one that remains important for many peoples view of their Scottish identity. When I was younger I, in common with millions of other Scots, listened uncritically to the song a Scottish Soldier. This relates the story of the Scot who soldiers far away and fights in many a fray. If I listened to the same song today I would do so much less uncritically and would be inclined to consider the origins of the Martial Scot.History is an interesting area of study but it is also something we can learn and progress from. After all, we dont need to go back to Britains imperial past to find examples of pointless, avoidable wars.Brian Harvey, Hamilton.MARK Smithrsquos article on how we view our history is interesting and perceptive, but may I take him up on one point . We talk, he says, ldquoabout our lonely imprisoned queens and not our brutal warrior kings. The sole member of the former set is easily identiable but whom has he in mind for the latter War is brutal anda king, whose supreme obligation is to protect his people, is faced with the choice of seeing his country overrun by a brute and adopting brutal means to prevent it, as was true ofRobert Bruce, then there is no choice at all.

A storm in  showed something strange in the sand at the Bay of Skaill and the Laird, William Graham Watt, went on to excavate part of a , year old village. After reading the original reports, I now know that this isn’t true. The real story is more interesting.The Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, has three papers on Skara Brae. The first was by Samuel Laing, who visited the site in autumn .“Two chambers have been completely excavated, together with the passage and parts of the entrances to other chambers by Mr William Watt, a relative of William Watt, Esq of Breckness, residing at Skaill, to whose zeal the scientic world is indebted for the discovery and exhumation of this interesting relic of antiquity.#When I saw the credit being given to a relative of William Watt Esq, rather than the man himself, I remembered my father, Peter Leith, telling me that his father, also Peter, had told him that a dferent William Watt, known as Black Willie, had been the man responsible.In the  Census, I found the Laird living at Skaill, aged , with a son William, aged . His son and heir, William WG Watt was  and living at Kierfiold, so there were two sons called William.In James Irvine’s  book, ‘The Breckness Estate’, I read that William G Watt had a natural son, William, who in  was given £ a year and free board, “so long as he chose to remain a clerk in the house.”The story then turned into a neat circle. I followed up a reference in the book and found it was an Orkney Herald article written by my grandfather. It was about Hugh Miller’s book ‘Rambles of a Geologist’, in which Miller recorded his visit to Orkney in .My grandfather had written: “Another interesting person, who has already been mentioned, was William Watt of Skaill. This was not, as some readers may suppose, the laird of Skaill, but a distant relative who made his home there. He was well-known to everybody as “Black Willie” from his dark hair and complexion. Like Miller, he was a self-taught geologist, he always carried a little bag with a hammer and chisel to dig out any fossils he came across. He brought some of his more interesting specimens for Hugh Miller’s inspection and they had an interesting discussion. When Skarabrae was first dug into in the ’s, it is certain that Black Willie took an active part in the work and saw to it that anything found was safely preserved.”I looked up the references to William Watt in the book and found that Hugh Miller had come with a letter of introduction to him and described him both as an intelligent geologist and an intelligent palaeontologist. He showed Watt, along with Dr Garson of Stromness, where his famous discovery, the Astrolepsis fossil, lay.To read about the second and third papers on Skara Brae and what Patricia found out, see page  of this week#s edition of The Orcadian.Patricia Long is a tourist guide based in Stenness with a strong interest in social history.

Employers should support their workers in using face coverings safely and provide advice,requested, on applying and removing the covering.On ferry services face coverings must also be worn by passengers and staff unless the ferry, or part of the ferry which is open to members of the public, is entirely outdoors or physical distancing of two metres can be maintained.Transport Secretary Michael Matheson stressed the importance of the new rules and that by wearing a face covering everyone is engaged in a collective responsibility to reduce the risk of transmission.He said: “Our message remains clear that public transport should be for key workers and those who need it most and can’t walk or cycle to work.#Capacity is reduced to enable physical distancing and operators are not yet running full services. However, as we work towards recovery and more peopleto work and further local leisure opportunities begin to open up it is vital that measures are put in place to protect everyone’s health.“Transport operators continue to play a key role in supporting essential travel and in ensuring passenger confidence in public transport while maintaining physical distancing. The use of face coverings forms a fundamental part of gaining that public trust.“We are asking people to take personal responsibility to do the right thing. Wearing a face covering while on public transport means you are playing your part in the collective effort to prevent the spread of coronavirus and reducing the risk to your fellow citizens. These measures complement physical distancing and good hand hygiene, they do not replace them.”Advice on face coverings, including how to make one and instructions for using one, will be available on the Transport Scotland website.

The financial support is helping firms across the nation to adapt, innovate and protect jobs. Here are two examples of how companies have been helped, and what support is available.Source: Her Majesty’s TreasuryAn unprecedented package of UK Government financial support has helped firms like Q-Mass in East Kilbride weather the coronavirus crisis. Director Ronnie Robertson said lockdown hit his company’s order book, but the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme has been vital to help them hang on to their valued staff.Ronnie said: “Before this, we had quite a good order book, with three to four months of work planned, so we were pretty worried where it was going to take us.” At first, he was worried how he would keep Q-Mass’  staff on the payroll, but then the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme was announced.It offers UK Government support to pay  per cent of staff’s wages up to £, a month, and the scheme has now been extended until the end of October.Q-Mass manufactures bespoke parts for the oil, gas and defence industry so staff training is important. Ronnie said: “Our staff are very highly skilled. We’ve gathered a bunch of people here and trained them up and taken on apprentices. We do a lot of training, we’ve got good people, we train them a lot and we want to hang on to them.”He found applying for the furlough scheme quick and straightforward. He said: “It was surprisingly easy and we were surprised that the money came through relatively quickly.”Now staff at the firm who’ve been furloughed are gradually ing to work, with strict safety measures in place. Ronnie said: “We’ve put a day sht back on and we’ve still got a few office people working at home, with quite a few still on furlough.And because of the size of the building, maintaining a two-metre distance hasn’t been a problem for ing staff.“The workshop’s a big, wide open space and we have to keep cleaning things like photocopiers and touch screens, but it’s been quite straightforward.”Now Ronnie’s looking forward to a brighter future. He said: “I feel like we’re on the side of the valley and we’re looking across to the other side and it looks absolutely fantastic. Getting through the next few months is crucial for us. We have a really good bunch of people and we want to hang on to them. The furlough scheme has helped us to do that.” vw, px\"  Planning, forward thinking and invaluable help from the UK Government has enabled a Northern Ireland firm to ersy and remain solvent. When Covid- struck, Newtownards baby product manufacturer Shnuggle’s owners Sinead and Adam Murphy were prepared thanks to advice from their export colleagues in China.Sinead said: “We reduced our out-goings, put on pause our marketing spend in the business. We just tried to protect the cash that we had.“The first impact was our customers that we sell to in Asia. They all went into lockdown so our orders and sales to them stopped. But also a lot of our production happens out in Asia so our factories went into lockdown.“Luckily we had bought a lot of stock beforehand. We were so relieved that we had, at least we could carry on trading with our UK and European customers.” With around half of the company’s sales in the UK and Ireland and half in the export business, Shnuggle had to rely on their local retail-base.Sinead continued: “Baby items were classed as essential goods which was a huge relief to us. This meant as long as we could socially distance within the warehouse we could continue trading and selling online.“All of our business is supplying other retailers like John Lewis, Mamas and Papas, Amazon. But our online sales actually grew because everyone was at home and maybe an element of panic buying.”Shnuggle took advantage of the furlough and Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Schemeschemes.Sinead said: “We furloughed five out of our  team, and were able to access the Business Interruption loan through Ulster Bank.“That was our biggest headache and stress, we owed signicant amounts of money to them and we didn’t have the cash as we needed time to sell our products.”Shnuggle also received a £, Small Business Grant.Adam said: “Furloughing was brilliant, and the CBILS was the one that was the best for us because it meant that we could keep all our suppliers happy.“So even though we had a temporary dip in our sales, and obviously the inventory was sitting there ready to sell, it just kept us solvent and the cash flow moving.” vw, px\"  Here are some examples of the support available for businesses and workers.

It is important that we face our fears and do not avoid them.“The enjoyment we might get from moving more freely outside, travelling and meeting friends and family is tempered when we are worried about the spread of infection. By sticking to the rules during the gradual lting of restrictions, we can be confident that risk won’t rise. Less virus around us can be matched with less restriction.“Although there are practical things we can do to help ourselves cope over the coming weeks, remember that help is availableneeded.  We’ve never had to deal with a situation like this before, so be kind to yourself and to others, and reach outyou need to talk to someone.  Support is there.”For practical tips, you can visit clearyourhead.scot.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

If people are face-to-face, they are at an increased risk compared to being side-by-side or back-to-back. People should still try to maintain greater distances when they are face-to-face.ldquoDuration of exposure is important. A brief exposure at close distance is unlikely to pose a signicant risk, but prolonged duration in an enclosed space is much more risky. vw,vw,px, px\"ldquoAs we have seen in the supermarkets, physical screens and barriers can be installed. People can wear face coverings. Employers can use technology to reduce contact between members of the public and staff.ldquoIn the hospitality sector, there are apps where people can pre-order food and drink. The time employees and the public spend in crowded or busy environments increases the risks they face.

The auld yins used the on-course site while the large overflow parking space easily accommodated the youngsters.Hand sanitising gel dispensers were installed and made available outside the clubhouse which like all others in the land is closed for business for the foreseeable future.Fortunately, although our clubhouse generates a decent amount of money from sales of teas, coffees, confectioneries but most importantly club logo-ed items of clothing we will not suffer quite as much as the larger clubs who maintain essential bars and restaurants.On the actual playing surfaces greenkeepers were required to make provision for golfers to be able to #hole# their golf balls without requiring to touch either the cup, the flag or the pin.Creativity came to the fore and what would our fellow dream up for our edication and delight # but much more importantly for our health and safety Sadly, unlike our local dominies for this year#s SQA exam diet he wasn#t allowed to #mark his own homework# so his efforts were subject to public scrutiny.Effort #: He decided to insert some of his old CD#s just below the lip of the hole to prevent players having to touch the edges in order to retrieve their balls but this wasn#t a great success as his choice of music did not seem attractive to the Titleists and Callaways of this world.Born on the wrong side of the River Forth our man#s musical integrity was questionable to say the least and with the greatest respectyou were a golf ball would you rush to be anywhere in the vicinity of wee Clfie Richard#s Greatest Hits or Daniel O#Donnell Sings Sacred Songs Effort #: His musical theme continued as he experimented with plastic piping in the holes to make it #touch-safe# for players to retrieve their balls without fear of contamination # but methinks neither Fred Morrison nor Dr Angus Macdonald need have any fears there either And so with health and safety requirements plus traceability suitably concluded play duly started on Friday th May at am – prompt .Play would necessarily be limited to solo or dyads of players with  minute intervals between groups teeing off in order to maintain social distancing.Apparently there were some horror shots off the first tee and indeed #yours truly# playing that first morning as a #lone-ranger# was mightily relieved to see his opening bf # following an enforced  week lay-off # fly straight and true down the middle of the fairway.That doesn#t happen very often!Social media pictures provided evidence of a rich harvest of players theand breadth of the land sclaffing and indeed in some cases actually missing the ball completely much of course to the great amusement and consequent delight of their respective playing companions and assorted onlookers.With the restrictions on playing golf eased well before local football and with the shinty season already all but over before it has even started the golf club is delighted to see that some of their fellow sports enthusiasts in Skye and Lochalsh have decided to give their #second# game a wee bit more attention pending the resumption of their own particular athletic activity of choice.Many of the shinty and football boys have paid their green fees for a round on the course in the past to both stimulate their interest and improve their golfing skills in God#s own game but now that there#s no choice of sport the membership numbers at the club have started to grow and develop-and all are most welcome.Although it could still be a wee while before the #rubber once again hits the road# and the competitive golf resumes the situation could be much worse.Consider the dilemma facing a much larger Highland club with c. members and the problems associated with trying to accommodate these golfers desperation toto their #links# Teeing off from am till :pm in ten-minute intervals playing either solo or in pairs only c. players per day get the chance to grace their fairways.Whereas down Sconser way our members can now book their slot, play their game, savour the view, enjoy the company then travel but a short distance home only today-after-day should they so desire Stay safe, keep healthy and best wishes to you all from the Isle of Skye Golf Club.The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until th July .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/home-farm-new.jpg","title":"skye nursing home worker positive for covid 19 for a second","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe news that a staff member had tested positive for a second time was confirmed by local MP Ian Blackford.Ten residents died at the nursing home after a major outbreak of the virus was detected there at the end of April.The Free Press understands all residents and staff at the home are to be re-tested as a precautionary measure today.The interim chief medical officer Gregor Smith was questioned about re-infection at today#s Scottish Government coronavirus daily briefing.He said that he could not comment on the inidual case, but added that the global evidence was that re-infection is #not a phenomenon we would recognise#.Dr Smith added that viral fragments can still be picked up in tests many weeks after the initial infection, and these highlighted the challenges which surrounds the testing process.Skye councillor John Gordon, whose father died at the home after testing positive for Covid-, said he was concerned families had found out about the new test via social media.He said: #Our thoughts are with families, residents, and staff who yet again have had to read about this on social media which has caused them more distress.#I can’t understand why a protocol has not been put in place to contact families before it’s in the media, and why management is not informing staff, despite assurances from NHS Highland and HC-Onethat this is happening.#Regular precautionary testing should be happening as a matter of course.#It’s a worrying time.#Mr Blackford said: #It has been confirmed to me that one of the staff members at Home Farm who had previously tested positive for Covid-, recovered and was tested negative twice has tested positive again.#The staff member concerned was re-rested on Sunday and received confirmation last night that they were positive.#It is important to stress that when someone does test positive having previously had Covid- that they may not necessarily be infectious.

Victor Leonard, chairman of the international youth football competition at which Rashford was twice a winner with Manchester United, has always been impressed with the manner in which the young England international striker has handled himself. As Rashford vowed to continue helping those in need after successfully forcing the government to reverse its decision not to provide free school meal vouchers during the summer, Mr. Leonard described the footballer as an inspiration to everyone. He added: “We first came across Marcus in the Manchester United squads that came across to Northern Ireland to compete in our tournaments. “He was a smash hit as United went on to win the Premier section in  and  but you could not help but admire the way, even at a young age, Marcus conducted himself. “We have been across to United many times and it was always very clear how highly regarded he was as a player and a person.” Rashford came off the bench in United’s  final victory over County Tyrone at Ballymena Showgrounds and started when the Red Devils triumphed  months later against defending champions Vendee from France. Victor added: “I think he is an inspiration to everyone. He has been so passionate about this issue but gone about attempting to bring change in a highly commendable manner. “He is a credit to his family and his club and we at STATSports SuperCupNI are privileged that he is one of our tournament graduates who has gone on to achieve greatness in his football career and also through his campaigning for something in which he believes so fervently. “Hopefully he will continue to be an inspiration to all of us.” Rashford has raised about poundm to supply around three million meals to vulnerable people while working with charity FareShare UK during the coronavirus lockdown. In an emotional open letter to MPs, Rashford drew on his own experience of relying on free school meals and food banks growing up. He said his story was all too familiar for families in England.

In Northern Ireland several petitions have taken aim at Mitchel, who died in Newry in . One calls on GAA clubs named after the Irish patriot to disown him and another calls for his statue to be removed.Padraig Mac Cionnaith started a petition to have John Mitchel Place renamed.In a statement yesterday, Newry, Mourne and Down District Council said its equality and good relations reference group met on Friday to discuss the issue.The council set up the group to discuss politically sensitive and contentious issues to reach a common understanding, agreement and actions. The local authority said it would aim to educate the public about Mitchel.In a statement it said: Following constructive discussion between elected members on the John Mitchel statue and John Mitchel Place, it was agreed that officers proceed to clary responsibility for the John Mitchel statue, develop options for an education programme, identy the origins of John Mitchel Place and give consideration as to other potential issues in relation to slavery within the council area.Mr Mac Cionnaith, whose petition has attracted almost , signatures, accused the council of avoiding the issues.I find the council#s decision disappointing and a matter of kicking the can down the road rather than addressing the issues at stake now, he said. There has pretty much been unanimous condemnation and disgust at John Mitchel having a statue street named after him in the first place. People were surprised at his past - it should not have taken me starting a petition for people to learn about his disgusting views.The argument of judging historical figures in the historical period they lived doesn#t apply to Mitchel as he campaigned against abolitionism in slavery#s dying days and was nothing short of a white supremacist.I was hoping the council would take a definitive action by beginning the procedures to rename John Mitchel Place and relocate the statue to the local museum. A plaque on the street or beside the statue won#t send a message that Newry is a welcoming place for people of all colours and backgrounds, but renaming a street named in his honour and relocating his statue will.An online petition calling for Mitchel#s statue to be retained had just  signatures last night.The killing of George Floyd by a police officer in Minneapolis a month ago led to mass protests and anger in the US, and in the UK attention has focused on the commemoration of signicant figures from Britain#s history in the slave trade.A statue of slave trader Edward Colston was torn down in Bristol and thrown into the harbour.This is not Newry#s first naming row.

But, for now, all that has stopped.Fans of the local game have been left scratching their heads wondering what to do with their Saturday afternoons since the game came to a halt in March due to Covid-, never mind trying to wrap their minds around the proposals to bring back the action. Whether the club you love often basks in the glory of lting the Gibson or Irish Cups, or you trod home thinking what might have been, the Irish League is like no other in terms of the friendships forged on those Saturday afternoons.Certainly, some of the best memories this reporter has made in his  years is sharing Glenavon#s Irish Cup wins in ,  and  with his family. Who knowsthe Irish Cup will finish at all this season, but fans will not be able to share that special cup-winning feeling with the players, their friends and their families.Four Irish League fans who miss their weekend football fix spoke to the Belfast , looking back at those Saturday afternoons that feel so long ago and discussed what they are doing now to try and fill that void.Cltonville supporter Brian Smyth , Glentoran man David Kerr , Newry City fanatic Laura Hillenand Lurgan Blues fan Michael Scottwere all in agreement - it is not just the football, but the social aspect of our local game that has been missed over the last three months.Brian, a Green Party councillor in Belfast, described following his beloved Reds as an outlet and misses the unique quirks of the Irish League.If you#re invested in it, it#s family, he said. Your family is a bit of a melt sometimes, but that#s what the Irish League is, it#s your family.You miss it. You miss the characters and there is a social aspect to the Irish League. We don#t go there for sexy football. Sexy football comes along once in a generation for most teams, like Cltonville from  to  with Liam Boyce and Joe Gormley.You go along because it#s an extension of your family and you#re invested in it and you love it.I#ve been keeping myself busy with my council stuff, but I miss football. I#m a Manchester United man as well and a mate of mine said that the matches are back, but football isn#t, as the fans aren#t there.Michael was forced to watch old football fixtures on TV and YouTube at the beginning of lockdown.Like all those dedicated to following their team home and away every Saturday afternoon Michael, who is the editor of the Ulster Gazette in Armagh, has been totally knocked out of his weekend routine. I found that really, really hard. I missed that routine of getting up on a Saturday, going to the match, seeing my mates, have the craic, maybe stay on for a wee while afterwards and then come home, he said.I#ve been going out for a walk on Saturday afternoons, and like everybody  I ended up painting the fence. There was wee jobs in the house you end up doing.I miss meeting up with my mates. Saturday would be the day I would see a lot of people that I hang about with.You do miss that and obviously going to match might lead to staying on and getting a couple of pints or going round to a mate#s house for a pizza or a bite to eat. My routine on a Saturday now is basically get up and sit in a dferent room to the one I work in.Meanwhile, David#s Saturday afternoons at The Oval consisted of working with Glentoran#s media team, but all that has changed since Covid- struck.Focusing on nostalgic periods in the Glens# history during lockdown, David has been trying to bring a bit of Irish League football back into people#s lives through the club#s social media channels.You don#t have that usual routine of getting up, seeing what your mates and family are doing and heading to the ground, he explained.It#s the wee things you miss. I drive down and see that green mecca of mine that#s The Oval, so you miss that. You miss the smells, the taste of the burger and maybe getting a drink after the game.I think whether you#re a fan of Warrenpoint, Institute, Linfield, Glenavon, Cltonville or whoever, you all still have that same social side and I think that#s a massive part that everybody is missing and can#t wait to get back to.My job is trying to bring people closer to the club and Irish League football, so I guess I miss going out and speaking to people to create content.David added that no matter what your day job is, everyone who attends the game is the same when the referee blows the whistle at pm.Newry City#s Press officer Laura has even started supporting Hertha Berlin with their blue and white striped kit after the Bundesliga was the first major league toto screens.Her weekly routine consisted of attending committee meetings on Mondays, watching the players train on Tuesday, the under- games on Friday and seeing the first team play in the Championship on a Saturday.Going from that to nothing at all has been particularly tough.I would go to the matches with my sister and my daddy, she said. We all support Newry, so you#re getting to spend time with your family as well. My mummy is sick of the sight of us.Supporting local football is a great way to be part of the community and make friends.A large amount of our support would be the older generation and aren#t into social media, so without face-to-face contact they have no link to the club, so I#m sure as hard as it is for me, it#s harder for them.During this break we have launched a #KeepYourHeadUp campaign, getting videos from people from all over the sporting community - even a referee - to promote positive mental health and to keep your head up until we are back together again. Hopefully that#s sooner rather than later.Irish League football can generate a lot of negativity, mainly from those who don#t watch the local game, be it through the perceived quality of football or attendances, but Brian feels that is what makes our league.You even miss the games where there#s just  fans or less, he added. You can hear everything and the stuff coming out of people, which can be slightly outrageous, but it#s in your head for the rest of the week and it gets you through.I#m missing the routine, I#m missing the familiarity and I#m missing the social aspect. I think my we would prefer me going to watch a match.It is now up to the powers that be to get the ball rolling again, whenever that may be...

Publicans in Derry who took a ‘massive’ financial hit by closing ahead of St Patrick’s Day in the interest of public safety have encouraged the public to ‘support their local’ once they reopen. Northern Irelands hotels, bars, restaurants and cafes can reopen from July . William McGuinness and his business partner Phil Nolan own Paedar O’Donnells, The Gweedore and Fty Seven nightclub on Waterloo Street. Before the government issued any formal directive for businesses to shut, Paedar’s led the way by announcing that it was closing its doors on March . googletag.cmd.push It came two days before the busiest date on the calendar for Irish bars, St Patrick’s Day. “It was a matter of conscience for us,” Mr McGuinness said, “the general feeling at the time was that the NHS was going to be under pressure and we thought St Patrick’s Day would have been a petri dish for infection and we didn’t want to be responsible for that.” Boris Johnson’s order for all non-essential businesses would come over a week later on March . Derry City and Strabane has the second lowest COVID- death rate of every council area in the country and just  positive Coronavirus cases to date – also the second lowest in the country. googletag.cmd.push Chair of the British Medical Association in NI, Derry doctor Tom Black, has credited the part played by local businesses who took their cues from the Republic of Ireland. Mr McGuinness said they’re happy they made that decision even though the business took a ‘massive hit’ because of it. “St Patrick’s Day is our busiest day of the year and we were thinking about retirement soon but this thing has thrown it all up in the air. “We knew that, but we were just concerned about the health of Derry people.” Paedar’s missed out on grants because it didn’t meet the criteria but employees were furloughed. The rebuild will be a slow process, Mr McGuinness said, as the pandemic took its toll. DIFFICULT From July  pubs and bars will be allowed to trade but must serve food and operate on a table service basis. Pubs that do not serve food will be allowed to sell alcohol outdoors, such as beer gardens, also restricted to table service. Mr McGuinness said that will make it ‘very dficult’ for small bars like Paedar’s with limited outdoor space. Permission to use that space is absolutely essential in his view. He added: “I would object to the fact that restaurant bars are allowed to open but bars aren’t allowed to serve inside. “I think the risk is higher in a restaurant bar with adults and children being served food and drink whereas we’re just serving alcohol to adults. “With food there are all sorts of utensils but we just have glasses and disposable plastic. “I don’t see the sense in holding us up because we don’t do food.” The ‘rush’ is now on to ready the bar for customers and bar owners like Mr McGuinness are looking to the government and local authorities for guidance. Paedar O’Donnell’s has been cleared of tables and chairs to allow for the walls to be freshly painted and floors nished ahead of the grand reopening.  Mr McGuinness hopes that the government advice is relaxed to allow bars to serve indoors. They’re awaiting further guidance before spending any money on Perspex screens or other safety measures. He concluded: “We’d encourage people to come back but it’s going to be very limited space. “We don’t have the tourists, we were a very busy bar at weekends, and we’re not going to get those numbers in – nowhere is – because Derry people like to go out on a Friday and Saturday and nowhere will be able to cater for them because of social distancing. “There’s no money to be made in the next few months that’s the reality. “But hopefully over timeit is under control and there’s no resurgence maybe we can get back to some normality.” INFORMATION The owner of numerous bar-restaurants in the city including the Bentley, The Magnet and Molly Malones, Tony O’Connor, is also seeking clarity. “I’m surmising that they’re working on it at Stormont but we need more information about social distancing and so on,” he said. With all of his restaurants serving food he’s assured by the fact that customers can sit indoors but is unsure as to whether dining customers can stay longer to socialise. Mr O Connor said: “Every one of our premises will be opening on July  because of the food situation. Out of our six bars, five of them have outdoor areas.” This week he held a meeting with management and they’re ‘all positive and raring to go’. Like many businesses, the pandemic has been a ‘nightmare’ for Mr O’Connor but he realises that everybody is on the same boat. The Irish government ‘deserves a massive pat on the back’ for closing bars before St Patrick’s Day, he said, because ‘you would have had thousands and thousands across Ireland’ spreading the virus. “A lot of bars lost out on revenue there, no money was coming in and none getting paid out, so you just start over again,” he added. AMAZING  Bars have been actively discouraged from staging live music events or screening football matches to minimise the urge for customers to ‘dance’ or ‘hug each other’ after a goal is scored. It’s Mr O’Connor’s aspiration that the bar will be allowed to have a singer-songwriter, two-piece band performing or DJ providing entertainment. The local businessman said they will have hand sanitisers at each entrance, on every floor, at every table and also behind the bars and in kitchen areas for staff. “I’d rather not open as to have big screens in front of the bar because I think it takes the atmosphere away. “We have enough space so we can take tables away to create distance,” he stated. They’re also considering an App on which people can order food and drinks but are awaiting further guidance. And extra staff will be on hand to carry out an increased cleaning schedule. Looking to the future, Mr O’Connor would like to see visitors to the city from other parts of the island. He said: “I think Derry will get a good turnout because we handled the pandemic well as a city, there was a low number of Coronavirus cases. “I can’t wait to get my teeth back into it, we’ve been doing nothing the past few months, and the not knowing is the worst thing. “We’ve been doing takeaways but getting fully open is going to be amazing. “We’d invite people to get back out and support your local. “Self-awareness is key, Derry has played a blinder, it should be recognised and people here don’t have to be told to social distance, they’re fully aware.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Publicans in Derry who took a ‘massive’ financial hit by closing ahead of St Patrick’s Day in the interest of public safety have encouraged the public to ‘support their local’ once they reopen. Northern Irelands hotels, bars, restaurants and cafes can reopen from July . William McGuinness and his business partner Phil Nolan own Paedar O’Donnells, The Gweedore and Fty Seven nightclub on Waterloo Street. Before the government issued any formal directive for businesses to shut, Paedar’s led the way by announcing that it was closing its doors on March . googletag.cmd.push It came two days before the busiest date on the calendar for Irish bars, St Patrick’s Day. “It was a matter of conscience for us,” Mr McGuinness said, “the general feeling at the time was that the NHS was going to be under pressure and we thought St Patrick’s Day would have been a petri dish for infection and we didn’t want to be responsible for that.” Boris Johnson’s order for all non-essential businesses would come over a week later on March . Derry City and Strabane has the second lowest COVID- death rate of every council area in the country and just  positive Coronavirus cases to date – also the second lowest in the country. googletag.cmd.push Chair of the British Medical Association in NI, Derry doctor Tom Black, has credited the part played by local businesses who took their cues from the Republic of Ireland. Mr McGuinness said they’re happy they made that decision even though the business took a ‘massive hit’ because of it. “St Patrick’s Day is our busiest day of the year and we were thinking about retirement soon but this thing has thrown it all up in the air. “We knew that, but we were just concerned about the health of Derry people.” Paedar’s missed out on grants because it didn’t meet the criteria but employees were furloughed. The rebuild will be a slow process, Mr McGuinness said, as the pandemic took its toll. DIFFICULT From July  pubs and bars will be allowed to trade but must serve food and operate on a table service basis. Pubs that do not serve food will be allowed to sell alcohol outdoors, such as beer gardens, also restricted to table service. Mr McGuinness said that will make it ‘very dficult’ for small bars like Paedar’s with limited outdoor space. Permission to use that space is absolutely essential in his view. He added: “I would object to the fact that restaurant bars are allowed to open but bars aren’t allowed to serve inside. “I think the risk is higher in a restaurant bar with adults and children being served food and drink whereas we’re just serving alcohol to adults. “With food there are all sorts of utensils but we just have glasses and disposable plastic. “I don’t see the sense in holding us up because we don’t do food.” The ‘rush’ is now on to ready the bar for customers and bar owners like Mr McGuinness are looking to the government and local authorities for guidance. Paedar O’Donnell’s has been cleared of tables and chairs to allow for the walls to be freshly painted and floors nished ahead of the grand reopening.  Mr McGuinness hopes that the government advice is relaxed to allow bars to serve indoors. They’re awaiting further guidance before spending any money on Perspex screens or other safety measures. He concluded: “We’d encourage people to come back but it’s going to be very limited space. “We don’t have the tourists, we were a very busy bar at weekends, and we’re not going to get those numbers in – nowhere is – because Derry people like to go out on a Friday and Saturday and nowhere will be able to cater for them because of social distancing. “There’s no money to be made in the next few months that’s the reality. “But hopefully over timeit is under control and there’s no resurgence maybe we can get back to some normality.” INFORMATION The owner of numerous bar-restaurants in the city including the Bentley, The Magnet and Molly Malones, Tony O’Connor, is also seeking clarity. “I’m surmising that they’re working on it at Stormont but we need more information about social distancing and so on,” he said. With all of his restaurants serving food he’s assured by the fact that customers can sit indoors but is unsure as to whether dining customers can stay longer to socialise. Mr O Connor said: “Every one of our premises will be opening on July  because of the food situation. Out of our six bars, five of them have outdoor areas.” This week he held a meeting with management and they’re ‘all positive and raring to go’. Like many businesses, the pandemic has been a ‘nightmare’ for Mr O’Connor but he realises that everybody is on the same boat. The Irish government ‘deserves a massive pat on the back’ for closing bars before St Patrick’s Day, he said, because ‘you would have had thousands and thousands across Ireland’ spreading the virus. “A lot of bars lost out on revenue there, no money was coming in and none getting paid out, so you just start over again,” he added. AMAZING  Bars have been actively discouraged from staging live music events or screening football matches to minimise the urge for customers to ‘dance’ or ‘hug each other’ after a goal is scored. It’s Mr O’Connor’s aspiration that the bar will be allowed to have a singer-songwriter, two-piece band performing or DJ providing entertainment. The local businessman said they will have hand sanitisers at each entrance, on every floor, at every table and also behind the bars and in kitchen areas for staff. “I’d rather not open as to have big screens in front of the bar because I think it takes the atmosphere away. “We have enough space so we can take tables away to create distance,” he stated. They’re also considering an App on which people can order food and drinks but are awaiting further guidance. And extra staff will be on hand to carry out an increased cleaning schedule. Looking to the future, Mr O’Connor would like to see visitors to the city from other parts of the island. He said: “I think Derry will get a good turnout because we handled the pandemic well as a city, there was a low number of Coronavirus cases. “I can’t wait to get my teeth back into it, we’ve been doing nothing the past few months, and the not knowing is the worst thing. “We’ve been doing takeaways but getting fully open is going to be amazing. “We’d invite people to get back out and support your local. “Self-awareness is key, Derry has played a blinder, it should be recognised and people here don’t have to be told to social distance, they’re fully aware.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Patrick McGonagle, , whose address was given as Old School Lane in Shantallow appeared in court on June  charged with breaching his bail conditions on June  by ‘intentionally exposing his genitals’. The defendant had been released on bail on June  after being charged with common assault, namely throwing bread at a woman and attempting to grab her, and disorderly behaviour in a public place. A police officer said that on June  the PSNI became aware of a video circulating online showing a man acting in an ‘indecent manner’. googletag.cmd.push It was brought to the attention of police by community representatives and family members of children who witnessed it. McGonagle was identied in multiple reports. The officer said the incident took place at Old School Lane where the -year-old was seen ‘defecating in view of children’. A -year-old recorded the incident. The officer added: “He used chip shop wrappers to wipe himself. He was extremely intoxicated.” Police located the defendant at Old School Lane and he charged straight away. Objecting to bail, the officer said on June  McGonagle was warned about his behaviour and not to be intoxicated in a public place. googletag.cmd.push The court heard the -year-old has  previous convictions and two suspended sentences. There is an ‘extremely high risk of reoffending’, the officer added, ‘this man is incapable of not being intoxicated in a public place.’ Defence barrister Stephen Mooney said his client pleaded guilty to the offences before the court on Monday at the first opportunity and it was adjourned for a pre-sentence report. McGonagle was not in a position to be interviewed by the police due to his level of intoxication. Mr Mooney told the court that back in   the -year-old spent a ‘very signicant’ period of time in custody on remand. He was then found ‘unfit for trial’ because of his mental capacity and the prosecution was discontinued. The defence barrister said it is not so much a ‘fool’s pardon but a street drinker’s pardon’ as he is a well-known street drinker. His alcoholism is being criminalised because of his inability to stay sober, he added. Mr Mooney asked for bail to be granted with strict conditions attached. District Judge Peter King said ‘you’re absolutely correct’ and any bail conditions would have to include a prohibition on alcohol which would set him up for ‘spectacular failure’. He added that McGonagle may upset the ‘wrong person or group of people and find himself facing more dficulties’. The defendant was remanded in custody due to a ‘clear risk of reoffending’ to appear by way of video link on July .

From  July, people who are shielding will be able to meet up to sixpeople outside the home, as long as social distancing is strictly observed. In addition, people who are shielding and living alone will be able to form a support bubble from July  with one other household. These easements are based on the continuing reduction in the rate of community transmission of the virus in Northern Ireland. Further details will be provided in writing to people who are shielding. This letter will also set out plans to put shielding on hold from  July. googletag.cmd.push Minister Swann said:“I have no doubt that shielding has played a key role in saving many lives. It has undoubtedly been extremely dficult for those who are shielding. I have listened with great sympathy to what people have told us about feeling isolated and how they have missed their loved ones. “I know these easements that take effect on  July will be welcome news to many as we move towards the pause in shielding from the end of July. “However, I am also very conscious that there will be some who are apprehensive about this change. I would therefore, once again, repeat my call to everyone to continue to observe social distancing and to be considerate of the fact that the people you meet may have been shielding for many weeks.” googletag.cmd.push The Minister added that people who are shielding must strictly follow public health advice on social distancing and hand washing. “While the risk of being infected has reduced, the virus still constitutes a serious threat to those who are shielding should they get it. “It is important to remember that because of your underlying condition, Covid- will remain a threat to you. At the same time, it is accepted that shielding has been really challenging and that being stuck indoors indefinitely is bad for mental and physical health. What we all have to do in these dficult times is try to strike the right balance. “This is about minimising any risk as much as possible, being aware that all contacts with the outside world must be managed really carefully. “Keep your distance, wash your hands, don’t touch your face, avoid touching hard surfacesyou are out. Wherever possible, avoid enclosed spaces where social distancing is hard to maintain – such as public transport and shops.” The easements in shielding guidance from  July were agreed at today’s Executive meeting. This includes meeting up to six people outside the home providing social distancing is strictly observed. People who are shielding alone can form a support bubble with one other household. Social distancing is not required with this other household. This will allow people to visit, stay over and spend more time with the second household. The second household can be of any size. Both households should not be part of more than one bubble and should continue to socially distance outside the bubble.

The RQIA – Northern Ireland’s health and social care regulator – was directed by the Department in March to reduce the frequency of its statutory inspection activity and cease its non-statutory inspection activity and review programme. This temporary measure was introduced to minimise the risk of health and social care professionals and other visitors spreading infection within care homes. Similar restrictions were introduced in GB and the Republic of Ireland. With community transmission of Covid- now signicantly reduced, the Department has been able to rescind the March direction. googletag.cmd.push With the rebuilding of health and social care services under way following the first wave of the Covid- pandemic, the RQIA will be able to increase its activity across all areas of work. It is important that this increased activity remains as safe and as flexible as possible. Returning to pre-pandemic inspection levels will not be immediately possible. Whilst RQIA’s planned inspection programme was temporarily paused, RQIA’s inspectors – including registered nurses, social workers and pharmacists – continued to regulate services and respond to risks and concerns. It reports that since the outbreak of the Covid- pandemic, it conducted around  on-site inspections at care homes and domiciliary care services. It has also taken enforcement action against five services during this time. googletag.cmd.push In recognition of the threat from Coronavirus to older and vulnerable people, the Department of Health also “repurposed” RQIA from March to provide enhanced support to care homes and domiciliary care services. In response, the regulator established a Service Support Team.This has involved RQIA inspectors and senior staff providing detailed advice and direction to care homes and domiciliary care services in managing their services during the pandemic period.

This is dferent. Last weeks edition of this column made two proposals for a new-look Derry senior football championship. Both were based around the inclusion of isional teams and in part two, we put some flesh on the bones. The thought process is the poorof players from the intermediate and junior grades coming through to the Derry senior football team in the last decade. Of  players used in league and championship, by five dferent managers, none hail from junior clubs and  from intermediate, one less than Ballinderrys club total. googletag.cmd.push Also, the decade saw Coleraine, Slaughtneil and Ballinderry dominate the competition. Its great for the clubs in question, but in a bid to help raise the quality overall. A county team needs more options. In Sideline Views proposal,  senior clubs have been selected on the basis of the last five years of the senior championship. The  teams who reached at least one semi-final were joined by Swatraghand Dungivenas the highest placed teams in the  league standings. The other three teams are isional teams picked from the rest of the clubs. Foyle Oaks , North Derry and South Derry. googletag.cmd.push Logistically it will be dficult to fit in around hurling. So in a case where Tiarnaacuten McHugh is trying to balance North Derry, Drumsurn and Kevin Lynchs, it will be far from ideal. A balance will be needed and proper dialogue between all three managers, with the players training regime at the heart of it. The senior championship will need to be played off over dferent weekends to intermediate and junior. This would be a stumbling block as it stands, with so much tied up in the leagues. Under this new concept, leagues would be totally dferent from championship. Leagues of  with a two up two down relegation, would be devised with one thing in mind – getting as many games as possible. The CCC would allocate rounds on the weekends the NFL is on. Club games are on Friday or Saturday night, with the county taking place on Sunday. The county manager names his starting  and anyone outside of that, who didnt see any meaningful game time in previous round, is eligible for club football. It would need checked with the county physio, buta player is going to be of any benefit, they need competition in the legs. The advantage is having more games on a more regular basis, with more room to balance the club championship commitments. It would help avoid loggerheads at a time of year when it really matters, it would help get rid of the alarming drop-off rate from players being caught between two stools. A situation where nobody wins and in the case of Derry, it leaves a situation that stles any continuity. ON THE DRAW Last week, Liam Tunneyrandomly picked  numbers and the draw was populated as you see below. It has some mouthwatering ties. North Derrys clash with a Dungiven side clambering their way back to their decline is the tie of the round, with the late Sunday night billing at Owenbeg. The appointment of former Dungiven manager Michael OKane and Darren McShane as managers of North Derry will add a bit of spice along the sideline. South Derrys debut in the championship see them up against a ravenous Slaughtneil, who have aim to win back the John McLaughlin Cup after a two year absence and have the astute Paul Bradley at the helm. In the opposition dugout is Ronan Rocks who will know the intermediate scene well and has an handle on the up and coming minor talent from his time with Derry Us. He is joined in the South Derry management team by Hugh Mulholland, who never misses a club championship game and will know Slaughtneil inside out. Foyle Oaks, under the management of Michael McLaughlin and Joe Gray, come up against Loup, with Paddy Bradley in his first season in charge. Lavey and Coleraine renew their  final rivalries.

At the end of the season, two from the first teams eliminated will meet in a play-off to stay in the senior championship. From the last five years, form will be assessed for wins, draws and defeats, as well as scoring totals to pick the two lowest performing teams, who will play in a relegation play-off. The loser will drop to intermediate, with the intermediate winners promoted to the senior grade.

With handsanitiserat the door to every store, one-way systems, contactlesspayment, and limits on customernumbers, the new normal might take a while to get used to. Around half the shops in Foyleside Shopping Centre were open on Tuesday morning, with Dunnes Stores attracting the biggest crowds. Staff in Marks and Spencers and Boots, which have remained open throughout the pandemic, were glad to see a bit more hustle and bustle in the centre And with sales on in Debenhams, Dunnes and Marks and Spencer, many shoppers remarked on how happy they were to be out spendingagain. googletag.cmd.push But while the shops are open, cafes and coffee shops in the shopping centres remain closed for now. Mary McLaughlin, who hasnt been shopping in the city centrein over three months, said shewas glad to be back. This is my first day back up the town and Im all hyper with it, she said. I havent been up thetown since way beforeSt Patricks Day Its been awful not being able toget up the town, butas long as we are all healthy thats the main thing. Its just great to get out again. Ive been looking forward to it. Self-confessed shopaholic Geraldine Deery has been yearning for the social side of shopping. googletag.cmd.push Im ashopaholic and its been drivingme crazy, she said. I missed going up the town and meeting people and having a chat. And I really miss going in for a cup of coffee with my sister. Ive gone abit crazy buying things, Im making up for losttime of the weeks I missed. The management at Foyleside, The Richmond Centre and Debenhams have clearly put a lot of timeand effortinto establishingand marking out one-way systems and there are plenty of signs in place reminding people to keep to the two metre social distance rule. You do be a bit nervous because youre looking at the floor, trying to make sure you are going the right way, said Mrs McLaughlin. Everything is well spaced out and the floors are all marked out. Although Im glad I came out early because its quiet at the minute. Derrys small independent retailers are also slowly getting back to business after getting the go ahead this week, David Thomas, whose jewellery shop and workshop Thomas Goldsmith has operated from Pump Street for over  years, has been surprised that some of his fellow small traders havent reopned yet.  Ive just been for a walk round and Ive noticed that a large number of small independents arent openat the minute. This is the second dayinto it and they are taking their time to get back to work. Maybe thats their own choice. It surprisedme because to rebuild businessagain is important. For a lot of them who have furloughed staff and who are self employed as it were and are receiving payments they are thinking I wont risk it because theres a safety net there. But obviously that safety net is going to start disappearing. Business has been quite slow this week, but MrThomas is hopeful that shoppers will be back. We arecompleting the work we werent able to complete in March after the guillotine came down and we werent able to finish. And then we were hit by problems in the supply chain but that has started to ease up. In the last two weeks it has relaxed and things are filtering thoughnow. Were now able to complete things we should have done in March so weve stillgot that momentum from then, but in terms of work coming through its going to be a bit slow. There are a lot of people are being made redundant or who havent been able to claim grants and things like that. But on the other hand there are people who were furloughed and had to stay at home and werent able to spend money and they should have a fairly healthy bank account and they are desperate to get out and buy stuff. Mr Thomas has made changes to the way the shop operates in order to comply with the new regulations. Only one customer is admitted at a time, staff are usingfacemasks and hand sanitiser, and jewellery that has been tried on is being cleaned before it goes back on th shelf. People are understanding and respectful, remarked Mr Thomas. He feels that lockdown has given people time to reflect on their work le balance and lestyle. People are saying it will never be the same, he said. We were all chasing our tails a bit, workingvery hard. Does it have to be like that  Can we take things a bit easier  Do we have to be rushing off to Portugal on cheap flights  It has been strangeto sit at home in the garden and look up and see the skies totally clear. Many of Derrys charity shops have also reopened their doors, with Oxfam, Kinship Care, the Red Cross and Cancer Focus back in businessearlier this week. However, the three month closure has meant some stores are struggling with low stock levels. Deborah Tracey is the manager at Cancer Focus on Shipquay Street, which opened in May .  The shop reopened last Friday after a week of cleaning and preparation and have been busy ever since. Inside there is hand sanitiser at thedoor and a one-waysystem in place. Most people have been using the hand sanitiser before they come in, said Ms Tracey. We have been busy with people bringing stuff in and buying stuff too. People seem to feel confident coming out to shop now and theyare glad toget back to a bit of normality. Cancer Focus has amanager and deputy manager but all the other staff are volunteers. Some of our volunteers have been worried about coming back because they are older and more at risk, said MsTracy. So weare lookingfor newvolunteers now. We provide everyonewith shields, masks and gloves for their safety. Cancer Focus has also launched an appeal for donations. Any donations to the shop must be quarantined for  hours when we receive them, said Ms Tracy. We are looking for donations of clothes, bric-a-brac, shoes, bags and books. If you would like to make a donation to Cancer Focus or to enquire about becoming a volunteer telephone .

At present, hospitality businesses have to adhere to strict licensing laws in terms of serving outdoors. However, local councils have been encouraged by the Northern Ireland Executive to take a flexible approach to the situation to support the sector as it emerges from the coronavirus lockdown. Derry City and Strabane District Council is currently looking at ways it can help local businesses. They have launched a short survey asking for peoples opinions on the matter. The survey can be filled in here -https:bit.ly eohTnm googletag.cmd.push A council spokesperson said: The hospitality and retail industries have been some of the hardest hit in terms of lost revenue during COVID-. They will also be one of the last to fully emerge from the lockdown. With the impact of the pandemic and the resulting social distancing measures that must continue when businesses reopen it is essential that we start to reimagine how theservice industries can adapt and operate in the current circumstances.New business models and taking hospitality and trade outdoors will play a signicant part in the survival of the service industry locally. Using private and public spaces such as pavements, car parking spaces and events spaces such as Guildhall Square, Waterloo Place and the Canal Basin in Strabane could be part of the solution. googletag.cmd.push To achieve this, Council and key stakeholders including Department for Infrastructure and the Department for Communities will be adopting a flexible approach that seeks to facilitate innovation - whilst ensuring appropriate controls such as Insurance, disability access, enforcement and public health are in place.

Following a request from the Irish Central Border Area Network , the NIAO report will also look at the process used by BT for upgrading its own infrastructure. Mid Ulster District Councillor Sean McPeake said it was a positive development. “I have been supportive of the group’s request for an NIAO report to ensure future transparency around the lack of competition for Broadband infrastructure in the North,” he said. “The report is being currently compiled and crucially includes areas such as the process used by BT for upgrading their own infrastructure. googletag.cmd.push “I am confident that any positive recommendations which emulate from the report will be taken on board by Dept of Economy prior to the awarding of Project Stratum delivery contracts. “This is crucially required for the equitable roll-out of such a major broadband scheme that will have such major implications for future generations of rural people.” poundm of funding has been secured for Project Stratum, which aims to improve broadband connectivity at approximately , premises. There has been some criticism of theof time it will take to complete the improvements, with no upgrade work planned before the delivery of the project. googletag.cmd.push “Full delivery could take another - years, which does not address present needs,” said Cllr McPeake. “Rural areas such as Mid-Ulster need to have immediate interventions in broadband improvements to remain economically competitive and meet the needs of local homeowners. “Broadband availability has become a service utility which is equally essential as water, electricity or any telecommunications. “In recent months I have been inundated from constituents who cannot access sufficient broadband speeds for home-working, home-schooling or basic socialising. “Small to medium sized businesses are also struggling to achieve adequate speeds to operate their businesses in rural areas.” The Carntogher councillor has asked residents to detail their experiences in order to help with the evidence gathering process. “An integral part of the NIAO reporting evidence gathering process is having anecdotal evidence of the challenges of home working or home schooling during the ongoing public health crisis. “I would encourage anyone who is experiencing dficulties with Broadband provision during the COVID- Pandemic to email their experiences toinfo@icban.

Patricia McCallion, who shot to fame on dating show Pretty Single, said she has used her unexpected down time to reboot and put the finishing touches to her first hair care range. I really enjoyed having that time to myselfand spendingtime with my daughter, but now that we can reopen Im very excitedto get back to work, she said. Pretty Single brought togethersix gorgeous single women who agreed to be stripped of their make-up before going on a series of blind dates. googletag.cmd.push  Patricia won the public over on the show with her bubbly personality and natural good looks and although she didnt manage to find love she says she has found friends for le. I still chat to my final two fellas on the show but its on a friendship basis, she said. I did go on a second and thirddate with Martin the barber, but I realised we are more like friends. I talk to the girls every single day though. Theres notmany times you get a group of girls togetherand everyone justgets on so well. Everybody is buying each othercards and presents on their birthdays- its lovely. googletag.cmd.push Since taking part in the show, Patricia has embraced a more natural look. I think Ive found lovely new friends and Ive found myself too, she said. I havent worn make-up in three weeks. I wouldnthave gone out the door before without running a make-up brushover my face. Itwas just the norm, like brushing my teeth. So its been very liberating. Earlier this month, Patriciafulfilled her lelong dream of launching her own hair care products, which are named Glam after her salon in Waterloo Street. It features two luxurious ranges SOS and Peyton, named after her  -year-old daughter. I started hairdressing at  and after Peyton was born working and being successfulwas all for her, she explained. I wanted her to be proud. Patricia was able to use lockdown to put the finishing touches to the range and she is delighted with the finished products. Getting to make the products was so educational but there was so much work involved in it, she admitted. Im so thankful that I had that time to properly work on it because I never thought it would be that stressful. I was nervous about it, but I have learnt to trust in myself. My clients trust that when I bring out a product I will have trialled it and tested it on myself and I have been doing hairdressing so long that I know what works. Pretty Single is available to watch now on BBC iPlayer.

Dean O’Neill, from Drumsurn, died suddenly last week and mourners at his funeral yesterday heard how the news had left the community in shock. “The church would be absolutely packed todaythings were normal,” said Fr Seamus Kelly, officiating at the funeral. “The tragic news that spread throughout the area on Thursday morning stunned the whole community. “He was one of the most gted sportsmen to emerge in Drumsurn in recent years and it was lovely to see all the young people with their shirts on as his remains were being carried in.” googletag.cmd.push  Dean, known around the community as ‘Floater’, excelled on the sports field and Fr Kelly described him as ‘one of the most gted sportsmen to emerge from Drumsurn in recent years’. In the colours of St Patrick’s College, Dungiven, he was outstanding and won a Derry vocational schools’ All-Star award in . He represented St Matthew’s GAC and Kevin Lynch Hurling Club and carried his talent with modesty. Fr Kelly recalled how he deflected praise after a notable victory at minor level. “He covered every blade of grass in defence and attack but didn’t want any great glory,” he told the congregation. googletag.cmd.push “When Drumsurn and Drum amalgamated as St Patrick’s at minor level a few years ago, he gave an exhibition of football as he dragged his team back into contention and eventually saw them defeat Glenullin having been nine points down at half time. “He declared humbly, ‘sure Micheacuteal Archibald deserves praise more than me’. He loved sport and played Gaelic, soccer, hurling and basketball with distinction for the school.”  Dean in the colours of Kevin Lynch Hurling Club. Off the pitch, Fr Kelly told mourners how Dean had a great sense of fun and spoke of his great love for his family and friends. “He tortured friends and relations with pranks and jokes. He was very close to all his cousins and friends and kept in touch with them,” he said. “When his brother, Justin, go married, he was best man for him and was godfather to their first child, Taylor. He absolutely doted on her, as indeed he did on all his nephews and nieces. “I know how proud Justin and Jordan were of their brother Dean, but they all have wonderful memories as have Gertie, Rory and wider family and friends. “He met a lovely girl in Amber and it looked like they would settle down for good. Of course, he was not known as Dean, it was just ‘Floater’ to all his friends who loved him so much. “In recent times, he had settled a lot and went to live in Dungiven, although, he always insisted, he was a Drumsurn man.” Fr Kelly spoke of the great sadness within the community following his passing. “I’m well aware that Drumsurn is in a state of mourning, as Dean was so well-known and loved here,” he said. “However, we have a promise that death is not the end, but another step on the journey to eternal le. “Everyone who knew him, or even met him, loved him. He had an amazing personality that endeared him to all and had a relentless sense of fun. “To young and old, he was a legend. It has been the most common remark uttered over the past few days. What a character.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Dean O’Neill, from Drumsurn, died suddenly last week and mourners at his funeral yesterday heard how the news had left the community in shock. “The church would be absolutely packed todaythings were normal,” said Fr Seamus Kelly, officiating at the funeral. “The tragic news that spread throughout the area on Thursday morning stunned the whole community. “He was one of the most gted sportsmen to emerge in Drumsurn in recent years and it was lovely to see all the young people with their shirts on as his remains were being carried in.” googletag.cmd.push  Dean, known around the community as ‘Floater’, excelled on the sports field and Fr Kelly described him as ‘one of the most gted sportsmen to emerge from Drumsurn in recent years’. In the colours of St Patrick’s College, Dungiven, he was outstanding and won a Derry vocational schools’ All-Star award in . He represented St Matthew’s GAC and Kevin Lynch Hurling Club and carried his talent with modesty. Fr Kelly recalled how he deflected praise after a notable victory at minor level. “He covered every blade of grass in defence and attack but didn’t want any great glory,” he told the congregation. googletag.cmd.push “When Drumsurn and Drum amalgamated as St Patrick’s at minor level a few years ago, he gave an exhibition of football as he dragged his team back into contention and eventually saw them defeat Glenullin having been nine points down at half time. “He declared humbly, ‘sure Micheacuteal Archibald deserves praise more than me’. He loved sport and played Gaelic, soccer, hurling and basketball with distinction for the school.”  Dean in the colours of Kevin Lynch Hurling Club. Off the pitch, Fr Kelly told mourners how Dean had a great sense of fun and spoke of his great love for his family and friends. “He tortured friends and relations with pranks and jokes. He was very close to all his cousins and friends and kept in touch with them,” he said. “When his brother, Justin, go married, he was best man for him and was godfather to their first child, Taylor. He absolutely doted on her, as indeed he did on all his nephews and nieces. “I know how proud Justin and Jordan were of their brother Dean, but they all have wonderful memories as have Gertie, Rory and wider family and friends. “He met a lovely girl in Amber and it looked like they would settle down for good. Of course, he was not known as Dean, it was just ‘Floater’ to all his friends who loved him so much. “In recent times, he had settled a lot and went to live in Dungiven, although, he always insisted, he was a Drumsurn man.” Fr Kelly spoke of the great sadness within the community following his passing. “I’m well aware that Drumsurn is in a state of mourning, as Dean was so well-known and loved here,” he said. “However, we have a promise that death is not the end, but another step on the journey to eternal le. “Everyone who knew him, or even met him, loved him. He had an amazing personality that endeared him to all and had a relentless sense of fun. “To young and old, he was a legend. It has been the most common remark uttered over the past few days. What a character.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In this extract the autistic teenager shares his joy of the natural world on a day out to Murlough with his sister and brother.OUR garden is thrumming with birds today: coal, blue and great tits, blackbird, thrush, magpie, jackdaw, rook, all of them revelling on the grass, pecking at the feeders.I could happily watch them all day but rain is coming from the east, so we decide to go west to the coast at Murlough to stay in the sunshine. I usually despise being in the sun. I find its light too bright, its heat too hot, and it can make me feel astherersquos nowhere to hide. But with this rain coming, I feel like being on the dunes at Murlough, pressed by warmth and sea breezes.The ancient dune system here is six thousand years old, fragile and spectacular. The unusually high dunes were formed in the late th and th centuries by massive storms, and were used by people in the Middle Ages as rabbit warrens to provide them with meat and pelts.Grazing rabbits encouraged the grassy heathland here, but when myxomatosis first broke out in the s, as it did in other parts of Ireland and Britain, the population was almost wiped out. With fewer rabbits, sea buckthorn and sycamore could grow, turning heath to scrubland. Now the National Trust have intervened at Murlough, managing the landscape so it reverts back to heath mdash and judging from the copious pings, it looks like the rabbits are thriving again, too.The day is sparkling, the wind is shaking and shaping the clouds. Lorcan and Blaacutethnaid want to swim, so I stroll along the beach with my binoculars. Shapes out at sea stop me: a trinity of torpedoing gannets. They swoop, wheel and suddenly drop, spiralling until the last second when they transform into arrows before hitting the water.Swallows are overhead ndash I can see their small bodies so clearly, weightless and constantly moving. I feel myself rising with them.My dark, knotted thoughts seem to be staying away at the moment. I feel as free as the gannets and swallows. If they can live their lives, shouldnrsquot I do the same  Can I breathe and live and also fight  The natural world mdash which includes us mdash is facing such enormous challenges that itrsquos easy to become overwhelmed and depressed. But we must fix them, andIrsquom no longer here, alive, I canrsquot be part of the solution.What is it thatrsquos holding me back  Anxiety  Depression  Autism  These are the shackles. Surely, I can break free. Or at least I can accept these things as part of me. I have no answers, but the lightness of these thoughts and these days weave my body and mind with everything around me. The only thing that I am really bound to is nature ndash as we all are.Lorcan and Blaacutethnaid are running towards me, and I run to them, and then we run together, exultant. We slow down in unison, all feeling the same pull of the large peculiar shells dotted around the beach. We each pick one up and hold them outstretched, delicate porcelain in our hands.They look like pale planets, pockmarked with symmetrical lines. I rattle mine, listening to the whisper of sand and the past. These are sea potatoes mdash a type of sand-burrowing sea urchin mdash with pocks that once held spines and a bleached calcium carbonate shell that could so easily shatter on land or at sea. Each one is a miracle. So many miracles washed up at once.We start to collect them and Lorcan decides to name three of the best specimens Sandy, Sam and Sandra. He holds a conversation with them, three sea potatoes, which makes us laugh so hard that tears well up and almost flow, and wersquore still laughing as a warm rain starts to fall on us.Under dark skies, I feel completely unburdened of any doubts in my own abilities to help our planet. Instead, I feel energised and ready. Sopping wet and cold and with chattering teeth, still giggling madly, I feel hope pouring in the rain. Being myself is enough.Diary of a Young Naturalist by Dara McAnulty is published by Little Tollerand can be bought online, or at No Alibis bookshop in Belfast..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"A lifetime of capturing Ireland’s scenic beauty  ","story":"AMATEUR photographer Chris Laverty spent a letime capturing Irelandrsquos scenic beauty.The former Queenrsquos University computer centre manager travelled extensively, always with his camera, and always with an eye for the magic of the countryside around him.

As we work to do so, our absolute priority will be to keep our patients, service users and staff safe. the statement adds.The health trustrsquos insistence that emergency services will be restored at the Downe comes ahead of a meeting with a Sinn Fein delegation to discuss the issue.Spearheaded by South Down MP, Chris Hazzard, the delegation will be seeking assurances that all services will be restored to their previous level.Ahead of the meeting, Mr Hazzard said that due to the pandemic, the local community was left without access to vital services at the Downe due to the health systemrsquos response to coronavirus which ldquorequired what amounted to extraordinary measures for an extraordinary time.The MP said the Downe was left ldquounrecognisable as emergency and outpatient services, amongst others, closed from the end of March.ldquoWhere required, all available staff and equipment from these units was also requisitioned for use in other parts of the South Eastern Trust area, he continued.ldquoIn agreeing to the radical reconfiguration of the Downe, the community made a big sacrice in order to accommodate the unprecedented demands made by both health trusts in the fight against Covid-.Insisting that it was the right thing to do at the right time, Mr Hazzard said there is now an onus on trust management to respond in kind to the community.He said the recently published recovery plans have delayed the restoration of vital services to the community, causing signicant concern amongst many who fear that ldquotemporary closure might inevitably mean permanent removal.Mr Hazzard said the Sinn Fein delegation will be calling for the full restoration of services at the Downe and will also be meeting with the chief executive of the Southern Trust to call for services removed from Newryrsquos Daisy Hill hospital to be reinstated.Rowallane DUP councillors are also demanding the full restoration of services at the Downe Hospital, highlighting the importance of reopening the emergency department as soon as possible.Cllr Billy Walker said it was ironic that within hours of confirmation that the Downpatrick ED would not reopen at this stage, the South Eastern Trust revealed via social media that the Ulster Hospitalrsquos emergency department was extremely busy.ldquoThis is nothing new, he declared. ldquoThere is a clear need for the Downersquos emergency department to reopen now. Having this facility available can help ease the pressure on other EDs and we cannot understand why there is not increased investment in Downpatrick.ldquoWe all understood the temporary closure of services at the Downe to allow health chiefs to respond to the global pandemic, but the time for those services to be reinstated is now.

However, bearing in mind the scheme is all but shovel ready, this should be a simple case of signing the commencement orders with construction starting as soon as possible.Mr Hazzard said the roads minister has a capital budget of more than poundm to be spent this year, suggesting that very few projects are as advanced as the Ballynahinch bypass.ldquoThere is no logical reason why this long overdue project canrsquot get the green light for construction as a matter of priority, he said.The MP added: ldquoIn light of the severe economic impact of Covid- and the ongoing Brexit uncertainty, the commencement of this scheme would be a welcome step towards improving both our local economy and the wellbeing of our community..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Darragh Cross residents bring cheer to local residential home  ","story":"RESIDENTS from Oakland Court in Darragh Cross made the most of the lockdown by having socially distanced nights of entertainment while helping the residents of a nearby residential home.From hosting fun events such as bingo and discos, they raised pound for Willowview Residential Home in Saintfield.Oakland Court residents would like to thank Darragh Crossrsquo Vivo shop for its donation of prize hampers and everyone who donated prizes and gts.In turn, all residents and staff of Willowview Residential Home would like to say pay their gratitude to to all the residents of Oakland Court and Darragh Cross Vivo for their kindness and thoughtfulness..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"DNA testing on dog dirt  ","story":"SENIOR Newry, Mourne and Down Council officers say they will need time to research the issue of using DNA testing on dog dirt in a bid to trace animals which are allowed to use public areas as open air toilets.Members of the local authorityrsquos Neighbourhood Services Committee will discuss the issue at their virtual meeting later today.A motion on the issue tabled by Rowallane councillor Patrick Brown at the March meeting of the full council was referred to the local authority committee for discussion.Dog dirt poses a major health risk, especially to children, who could potentially lose their sight as a result of coming into contact with it.Cllr Brown said there was a need to consider innovative ways of tackling the issue which has been raised on a regular basis by elected representatives across the local authorityrsquos seven DEAs.He is keen for the local authority to investigate the viability of using DNA testing in a bid to identy offenders and aid enforcement officers to dish out fines.Cllr Brown is also eager for council officials to draw upon best practice from other councils who have introduced such a scheme in a bid to crack down on the dog fouling issue.In addition, he wants the local authority to roll out what he has described as an ldquoenhanced public awareness campaign focusing on the dangers of dog fouling.Ahead of tonightrsquos council meeting, officers are recommending that Cllr Brownrsquos motion is agreed to allow them time to research similar schemes which have been introduced where.In addition, officers say that they will need to understand the time and resources required to implement such a scheme locally beforereporting back to the council committee.Politicians, who have previously asked for more enforcement staff to be deployed across the district to deal with the dog fouling problem, say the highly contentious issue is one of the single most complained about problems in the area.They say that despite valiant efforts over recent years by council officials and others, the issue has not been adequately addressed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Drive in assembly at Crossgar primary school  ","story":"CEDAR Integrated Primary School in Crossgar has said farewell to its P pupils.Staff held a drive-in leavers ceremony for the outgoing P class last Friday.Parents and carers were invited to park in the playground and watch the  pupils receive folders of their work from their time at Cedar.They also received a survival kit for lsquobig schoolrsquo, as well as trophies for sports, arts and ICT,.

The team, captained by Harry Manley and Matilda Harty, secured a superb win.This yearrsquos Provincial Towns League galas provided a fantastic opportunity for club members to swim competitively and aim for personal best times, whilst having fun and making new friends with other clubs.The galas included a medley relay, inidual back, breast, fly and free swims, inidual medley and finally a freestyle relay for each of the four age groups.Lecalersquos galas took place from September to February with two at Down Leisure Centre and two away. Lecale swam against Cookstown, Leander, Coleraine and Portadown with some extremely close scores. Many parents, coaches and volunteers helped time and again, and this was truly appreciated.Swimmers at Lecale are able to start on the competitive pathway through development and open galas. Thirty-one swimmers have competed this season, gaining personal best times and medals.Of particular note, Tom Williamson was a medal winner in every event he entered across the four development meets of the season, winning eight gold medals, three silvers and one bronze medal.Orla Gibney shone at the Ards Christmas meet, winning two golds, a silver and a trophy for the best performance in the age  category, while Matilda Harty was in fine form at the Templemore open meet, winning medals in all four of her events mdash one gold, two silvers and a bronze.This season Lecale also had a squad of six elite swimmers who are involved in Swim Ulster Regional Talent Development and Performance Pathway, training and competing at national level.They qualied to compete in Swim Ulster meets and were placed within the top five in their age group in the spring qualying meets.Swim Ulster National Qualying Division  times were recorded for Adam Colgan, Adam Mahon and Aidan Mallett, Division  times for Christopher Mason and Rebecca Colgan and Aoe Mason were close to Division  times as the season was interrupted.Adam Colgan, Adam Mahon and Aidan Mallett qualied for the Swim Ulster short course championships in November and Aidan and Adam Colgan qualied for the McCullagh international meet in February, competing with the best swimmers in Ireland and GB, including Olympic swimmers Adam Peaty and Duncan Scott.Adam Colgan also qualied for the Irish long course meet, which serves as the Irish Olympic trials, prior to its Covid- cancellation.In challenging times for athletes used to training five or six times a week, swimmers now take part in al land work training up to three times per week under the direction of club coaches.Up to  swimmers are regularly taking part in what has become a highlight of the week. Although it cannot take the place of training in water, coaches hope power, balance and coordination levels can be maintained and that the swimmers will be to get back to business in the pool at a future date.It is always sad to say goodbye to swimmers who are ready to move on after finishing their school career. This season, Lecale said goodbye to Year  swimmers Chloe Galloway, Sarah Colgan, Peter Murphy and Tom Rodgers.Coaches, committee and club members thank them for their long and dedicated association with the club and look forward to hearing about their successes in the future.The club also wishes to thank the outgoing captains, Chloe Galloway and James Kane, for their dedication and service to the club this season.Lecale Swimming Club continues to take their lead from the governing bodies, Swim Ireland and Swim Ulster, and look forwards to welcoming swimmers back to training before too long and new members when the next season starts..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Mr Joseph McMcIlmail  ","story":"MR Joseph McIlmail, of Crew Road, Downpatrick, died peacefully at home on Tuesday, April , at the age of .Joe, as he was known to his family and many friends, was the fourth child of the late John Joe and Margaret McIlmail, from Bright.

He was also famous for discovering milk chocolate.Born in Killyleagh on April , , Sir Hans died in Cha in , aged  and described as the worldrsquos greatest collector who, from his earliest years, catalogued and carefully encased every artefact that he found.Over the years he accumulated nearly , items many of which today are on display in the British Museum.Close to the picturesque harbour in Killyleagh stands a copy of the London statue in honour of Sir Hans with a local councillor branding the campaign to take down the statues in the capital as ldquoridiculousCllr Billy Walker insists that the pioneering physician was not a slave trader and that the clamour for many statues to be taken down was becoming ldquosilly, urging the Government to show some backbone on the matter.He said Sir Hans was ldquorevered in his home town where people were proud to have a copy of the statue to a man who did so much for the world.Cllr Walker continued: ldquoSir Hans gave us the concept of free museums, found a cure for smallpox and pioneered science and medicine to do away with magic for treating illness.ldquoHe also promoted the use of quinine against malaria, discovered milk chocolate and was the first man to lead both Royal Colleges. Sir Hans also treated the poor for free and was no slave trader.Cllr Walker said Sir Hans left Killyleagh for London when he was  where he studied chemistry, before deciding on a career in medicine, qualying in France and ing to London.He was subsequently appointed as the personal physician to the governor of Jamaica and it was there that he discovered drinking chocolate.When he ed to England, Sir Hans was able to market his find and Cadburyrsquos promoted this drink for many years.Cllr Walker said that Sir Hans, who has a centre named after him in his home town, encouraged inoculation against ious diseases and for  years was President of the Royal College of Surgeons and a Fellow and hard working secretary of the Royal Society for many years.ldquoWe in Killyleagh are rightly very proud of Sir Hans and his links with our town, he continued.The councillor added: ldquoI hope that his statue in London will remain in place as he was a man of great distinction which is evidenced by the fact that there is now a centre dedicated to him in his home town.

In addition to the services directly provided at our local hospital mdash the peoplersquos hospital mdash Downe staff were redeployed to other healthcare facilities andcontributed enormously to the NHS effort.When the emergency planning was taking effect, it was the clear understanding of many local political and community representatives, that the emergency department service would be restored immediately upon the conclusion of the pandemic.Whilst there is clearly a signicant possibility of a so-called second surge in infections mdash and we are all aware as to just how serious such a second surge could be mdash at the same time there is increased normalisation of health provision across the North.The restoration of the urgent care service previously provided at the Downe must be a top priority as part of this normalisation. It should have been included in the June action plan, published by the health trust last week.Just last week, as attendances were increasing at the remaining emergency departments, including at the Ulster Hospital, it was apparent that existing facilities are and will be unable to cope with demand.During the Covid emergency planning, decisions were taken to temporarily close the emergency departments at the Downe, Daisy Hill and the Mater hospitals.Just last week, trade union representatives received categorical assurances from the Southern Trust about the re-opening of about Daisy Hill Hospital. Similar assurances are now required about the Downe.There is also a signicant impetus gathering now for the implementation of restructuring of healthcare services generally, and of urgent care in particular, across Northern Ireland.Decisions about the future of healthcare, particularly urgent care, afford an excellent opportunity to redress health inequalities that have arisen and been perpetuated by the historic under investment in the health service by successive governments and by the pursuit of centralisation policies.Many people believe that those centralisation policies played a crucial role in leaving us facing into a pandemic with insufficient hospital beds, insufficient intensive care beds, insufficient ambulance cover, insufficient ventilators and insufficient healthcare workers.Any change to emergency and urgent care provision is only permissible where it happens with the consent of the people.In the final analysis, decisions about the allocation of healthcare resources are political decisions taken by politicians, elected by the people and not by bureaucrats. Tiers and levels of bureaucracy make no dference to where ultimate responsibility lies.I have a great deal of sympathy for the recently appointed health minister, Robin Swann, who within a few weeks of his appointment, found himself facing the biggest public health emergency in the history of the National Health Service.I would respectfully suggest that Mr Swann should insist upon the criteria for change stated by Michelle OrsquoNeill when she was Health Minister.The now Deputy First Minister stated in November  that local people should be at the centre of decision-making processes in designing and delivering services. The , people who marched through Downpatrick in support of the Downe Hospitalin the Love the Downe Rally on February , , would certainly agree with that.As far back as , Dr Michael McBride, speaking at the sod cutting ceremony for the new Downe Hospital, said that ldquothe emphasis would be on making the health system respond to the patient rather than the patient to the system. I concur with that.In the Down Recorder of November , , after the publication of the Bengoa Report, Michelle OrsquoNeill was quoted as saying: ldquoWe will deliver care and support in the most appropriate settings, ideally in peoplersquos homes and communities.Again, I would concur with that.If there is to be a change in urgent care provision across Northern Ireland, no one can expect to be immune from that change. At the same time, change would only be possible or acceptableit is to create a better service for all of the people and a fair and equitable distribution of services.Many people in this area believe that we have had a very raw deal for over  years from the health service and some politicians.It sometimes seems to be forgotten that the National Health Service is free at the point of use, but it is certainly not without cost. It is the people who pay for it.Rural communities have particular characteristics and needs that must be addressed, in terms of at the most basic, accessibility to services. Like everyone , they have rights.Access to healthcare is a right, not a privilege.If it is to be the case that urgent care is being restructured, citizens in rural areas which, for this purpose, includes virtually anyone outside the Greater Belfast area, cannot be expected to forego services so that Belfast can continue to enjoy a proleration of emergency services, with not one but two Type  emergency departments on the scale of that at the Ulster Hospital, on its overdeveloped and cramped site, the Royal Victoria Hospital and the Mater, with the Type  unit at the Lagan Valley hospital, just seven miles from Belfast, a similar distance to that travelled by the people of Ardglass to the Downe hospital.Of course, Type  emergency departments are also to be found at Antrim and Craigavon, neither of which are far from Belfast and are linked by the best possible road infrastructure.Logically, it would seem, that the existence of two Type  units in Belfast is not sustainable, given the apparent massive pressure on services.We were told by the Department of Health at the time of the January  public meeting in Downpatrick Cricket Club that the purpose of that meeting was to enable local people to ldquofundamentally shape, inform and influence the criteria to be used to deliver services in the future.We hope that is still the case and await meaningful engagement with the community before change is implemented.The then deputy permanent secretary was quoted as having said that the then Minister would want to see ldquoongoing engagement in redesigning services. I am sure that the current Health Minister has the same views.The challenge for the Health Minister in the future must surely be to develop a fair and equitable distribution of services that would end discrimination against rural communities and ensure that all services, including ambulance services, are readily accessible to all of the people.It is worth remembering as well, that there was actually a .%in the attendances at emergency departments in Northern Ireland between December  and December . In the same period, attendances at the Downe Hospitalrsquos emergency department rose signicantly.Decisions about change in the health service are political decisions. All of the major parties form the Northern Ireland Executive, which is collectively accountable for the program for government and all that it delivers or fails to deliver for the people.It is imperative that any attempt to change or restructure healthcare provision in Northern Ireland is done so in full consultation with the end users of the services, who are also the paymasters for it. This will be very dficult, as history has created a deep mistrust between substantial elements in our community and the Department of Health.Our community has suffered greatly from repeated cuts to services and the ruthless pursuit of a centralisation agenda a pursuit that has continued even in recent years when the NHS in England and Wales has been investing in and supporting smaller hospitals, recognising their crucial roles at the heart of local communities and using technological advances to support them.If it appears that Covid- is being used as a cover to implement long-standing Department of Health policy, then any changes would be resented by the community and in fact rejected by it. This would lead to an irreparable breach of trust between the people and the State.If an attempt is made to in any way reduce the services that are currently on offer at the Downe Hospital, this community, as it has done before, will rise up in righteous indignation.Twenty five thousand people took to the streets of Downpatrick in February . If our emergency department is not restored within a reasonable timescale mdash a matter of weeks mdash it is very likely that this area will see an unprecedented display of anger, with , plus people on the street, with legal challenges about any perceived abuse of process and a community-wide campaign, a cross-community campaign and political upheaval at the highest level of government.The people of East and South Down have had enough. They have reluctantly sacriced local services, as a temporary measure in the short term, but their resolve should not be underestimated.The people of Newcastle, Ballynahinch, Castlewellan, Ardglass, Killough, Clough, Downpatrick, Strangford, Crossgar, Lower Mourne and the vast surrounding rural hinterland need these services.Farmers, fishermen and builders need emergency care as much as ever, so too do the tourists who flock into our area every year and probably will do so in even greater numbers this year.It is time to restore the Downe Hospitalrsquos emergency department and it is time to concentrate investment in local services, delivering for the people who need the services, where they need those services.The NHS must serve the people from ldquocradle to grave. It is a part of the social contract between the people and those who govern them.Politicians and administrators come and go. The Downe hospital must live on, developing all the time the range of services it offers.Equality demands nothing less..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Revered servant of local cricket  ","story":"Robin Walsh remembers Alfie Linehan, the distinguished Downpatrick cricket stalwart who died last yearTHE great paradox of Alfie Linehan was to be found in his disposition on the cricket field and off it.At the crease, his was a belligerent style, hitting the ball farther than anyone , compiling his runs in a manner that kept the scorers busy. Beyond the boundary!Yet this domineering, almost bullying, approach belied one of Irish cricketrsquos truest gentlemen off it: soft-spoken, never a word that offended, never a word against him.In one of the most distinguished legacies to the local game, the late Downpatrick farmer captained the Ireland team before turning to administration in the roles of chairman and president of the Northern Cricket Union and president of the Irish Cricket Union.Yet it was where it mattered most, at the grassroots of the game, that Alfie left his indelible mark.His devotion to the Downpatrick club and its famous international ground The Meadow was boundless and le-long, from underage player to captain of the club, coach and ultimately chairman and president.He either played or captained Downpatrick in five NCU Senior League, three Senior Cup-winning sides and an Irish Senior Cup triumph along with his older brother Hugh, another talented batsman whose death at the age of  dealt a terrible blow to Alfie.In later years it was a source of great pride that Hughrsquos son, Paul, was to captain the club and daughter Anne played for Ireland.His wersquos nephew, James Cunningham, also captained the club.Alfiersquos hard-hitting ways over four decades from the s took him to  Irish appearances mdash six of them as captain mdash in the days when international caps were much less liberally awarded, and his contribution to the success of NCU representative cricket has rarely been equalled.Administration was an endless labour of love at local, provincial and national level. Such was his accommodating nature that he chaired countless committees ranging from solving an umpire shortage in the NCU to raising funds at ICU golf days.His contribution to his local community extended far beyond the boundaries of the cricket club.In his day he was a member of the NI Sports Council, a director of his local hospital trust and president of Ardglass Golf Club.Alfiersquos friends were legion, none more close than Cecil Walker, that leading light of the Lisburn club.Their playing days over, they travelled the world with their wives watching international cricket and storing delightful memories of new friendships, whether tales of the Bodyline era over tea with Harold Larwood at his home in Sydney, or a fond mention by David lsquoBumblersquo Lloyd from the commentary box.Of all thatrsquos been written down the years about Alfie Linehan, one game has been overlooked and yet it speaks more than any of his commitment to Downpatrick.It was Saturday, August , , and Downpatrick were due to play Lurgan. It was also the day of Alfiersquos wedding to his beloved Mary. No problem: wedding in the morning, cricket in the afternoon, reception in the evening, off on honeymoon the next day.Of all the tributes paid to Alfie none has been more signicant than that on BBC Televisionrsquos Sports Personality of the Year programme last December.He was included in the prestigious roll of honour of international sports personalities who had died during .

in one of his articles that such a progressive town as Penarth was without an operatic and dramatic society, writes Penarth Operatic  Dramatic Societypresident, Mary Gardner.The response to his outcry was quickly taken up and within three weeks the Penarth Operatic Society was formed.The Societyrsquos first production was Gilbert  Sullivanrsquos Iolanthe, played at The Hippodrome which later burnt down, and what a glittering opening evening it must have been as the audience wore evening dress.The review featured next day read, ldquoBrilliant Initial Performance.More newsVale council issues warning over the use of parksFines increased for coronavirus lockdown breachesMarie Curie Great Blooming Tea Party goes virtualA few years later in , the drama section came into being and with it a new title of the Penarth Operatic  Dramatic Society, known affectionately as PODS.Since then PODS has progressed down through the decades with many highlights along the way.One being in  when PODS presented that great musical, The King And I, which won the premier prize at the Waterford International Festival, for which the company received a beautul Waterford crystal vase.The Town Council held a reception to honour the Society at the Paget Rooms, and James Callaghan, the local MP, paid his tribute to PODS saying it ldquoadded lustre and brought culture to Penarth.Another landmark was the play, Dear Octopus, by Dodie Smith produced for PODS th anniversary celebrations.One of our most challenging and exciting shows was Cabaret in , which won the National Operatic  Dramatic Associationrsquos award for Best Production and Best Stage Management and Technical presentation.More recently in , to honour and pay tribute to the many men who gave their lives in World War One, PODS presented the very special play, Last Man Standing, which also won a NODA award for Best Drama.In , PODS decided to do pantomime, and this has been a greatly gratying and popular addition to the companyrsquos output.Itrsquos wonderful to see children in the cast having on-stage experience, and then those children in the audience, perhaps for the first time, enjoying and loving live theatre.PODS is a very busy Society putting on four shows a year, a musical, two plays and a pantomime.Mrs Gardner said: ldquoThis year, sadly and very upsettingly after much hard work by all involved, the covid- virus struck as PODS had just set-up at the Paget Rooms ready for its run of Goodnight Mister Tom, only to be told the venue would be shut down next day.ldquoSince January, the Society had also been rehearsing for its May musical, The Full Monty, and that too has had to be cancelled.       ,params: .pushldquoNevertheless, when this terrible emergency is over the company will put on these two productions sometime in the future. ldquoPODS is proud of its achievement in giving much pleasure and entertainment to the local community with its first-class shows over the last  years, and its goal is to make its centenary in  with the help of its faithful audiences, friends and patrons.PODS is always ready to welcome new members, but at the moment it cannot meet or rehearse due to the covid- restrictions.It might be some time before restrictions are lted on groups being able to rehearse together, or audiences allowed back in theatres, meanwhile PODS members keep in touch on social media.There is a lsquoPODS public grouprsquo on Facebook, PODS quiz nights are being held on Zoom, and there is a website to keep track at podspenarth.org article_url   content_id   site_id

option to alleviate potential flood risk.More NewsVale nurse developed coronavirus symptoms after sitting with patient, inquest toldMillions become unpaid carers due to coronavirus crisisPenarth RNLI station marks  years despite current coronavirus lockdownThe campaign by the Save Dinas Powys Woods and Protect Homes from Flooding group was launched in March  after the Woodland Trust said NRW was proposing to build a dam within its site of Cwm George and Casehill Woods.The group said the proposals would involve cutting down  square metres of trees including  square metres of ancient trees and regular flooding upstream during high rainfall would result in further destruction of ancient trees, hedgerows, wildle, and plants.Dormice and other protected species like bats were at risk, the group said.The woods, much-loved by the community, attracts visitors from other areas and is the Woodland Trustrsquos most visited site in Wales with more than , visitors.Hundreds of people took part in marches in  to oppose the dam.NRW released its draft Outline Business Case in February  and a consultation period with the local community took place.Hundreds of people attended a meeting in February to oppose the dam and they wrote to NRW, with their views, during the coronavirus lockdown.Chairman of Save Dinas Powys Woods  Protect Homes From Flooding, Peter Smith said the group welcomed the announcement that NRW will not develop a dam in the Dinas Powys Woods.ldquoLocal people recognise the flood risk in the village, but are overwhelmingly in favour of a natural flood management programmein the Cadoxton River and Eastbrook catchments, plus improved channel maintenance andrequired local hard defences, rather than an environmentally unfriendly dam, Dr Smith said.ldquoOur proposals will slow the flow of the rivers upstream thus reducing the risk of flash flooding, and by removing obstacles improve flow downstream.ldquoWe now look forward to working with NRW and The Woodland Trust to design an effective NFM scheme.ldquoBoth have expertise in this area, and, having made funds available for NFM projects, we know that the Welsh Government is keen for Wales to become an exemplar of good practice. community involvement and support will remain key features of our campaign.He added: ldquoWe are grateful to people far and wide who have supported our campaign, including the Woodland Trust, our local community councils, and county councillors.ldquoWe extend our particular thanks our local MS, Jane Hutt, for her advocacy and support.Community councillor, Chris Franks said NRW must not now ignore any problems.ldquoClearly over the years there has been reduced spending on maintenance of the stream through Dinas Powys and towards Barry, he said.ldquoThe public has said that the NRW must improve monitoring of flows on the Cadoxton River, implement natural flood management measures and improve flow at Cardf Road bridge where the stream passes under the A to reduce flood risk.Vale MS Jane Hutt said: ldquolsquoFollowing our meeting on May  Sir David Henshaw chairman of NRW wrote to me on May  to say that NRW received almost  responses to our consultation on the Outline Business Case with the vast majority being opposed to the upstream storage option on the Cadoxton Brook.NRW chairman, Sir Henshaw said: ldquoWhen we consider the marginal case for this option, it is therefore clear that we will not be pursuing an upstream storage scheme. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey

has spoken of the plight of rural communities during lockdown in Uganda.Three months ago, Jenipher Wetaka Sambazi, a Fairtrade coffee farmer from the Mt Elgon region in Uganda, was sharing her experiences of the benefit of Fairtrade in Penarthrsquos Tabernacle Baptist Church.More NewsVictory in campaign to save Dinas Powys ancient woodland as dam plan is abandonedVale nurse developed coronavirus symptoms after sitting with patient, inquest toldPenarth RNLI station marks  years despite current coronavirus lockdownNow she and her family, like communities around the world, are under lockdown.In March, campaigners, businesses, supporters, and students from around Wales heard Jenipherrsquos story, face to face.Now she is unable to travel or even meet with her neighbours.This means the coffee picked at the end of the last harvest remains on the mountain and Jenipher and her fellow farmers are prohibited from travelling to gather it for processing under the current lockdown rules.There are currently several hundred known cases of covid- in Uganda, but none in the Mount Elgon region and no fatalities in Uganda as yet.Farmers want to keep it this way, but lockdown is causing other concerns such as limiting access to food and healthcare.This is the time of year when there is the least amount of food available, and the closing of markets and freedom to travel for farmers to source food and water means that times are exceptionally hard.Jenipher as vice-chairwoman of a Fairtrade coffee cooperative, is responsible for many who rely on the cooperative for work.The expert hand-sorters who are seasonal workers and rely on this part of the coffee chain to feed their family at this time, have no coffee to sort.While they may have some spare eggs, vegetables or matoke to trade, the threat of soldiers prohibiting them from doing so is too much for them.Farmer co-operatives, an essential element of Fairtrade, enable and encourage communities to work together.Fairtrade also requires an extra amount of money, the Fairtrade premium, to be paid to producers.Fairtrade farmers like Jenipher are struggling, but they have the benefits of a strong local community as well as the backup of the Fairtrade premium.Fairtrade International have announced a .m euro Fairtrade Producer Relief fund targeting the immediate needs and Resilience Fund to help producers rebuild their businesses after Covid-.Jenipher Wettaka Sambazi said: ldquoLe is hard.ldquoThe markets are shut so there is nowhere to sell or earn money, or to buy food and basic essentials.ldquoLocal health centres have been shut to reduce the chance of spreading the virus, but since all transport is banned, those who need operations, treatment or antenatal care need to walk  km to the nearest hospital.ldquoTwo women and their unborn babies have died on the way.\"Roger Casey, who attends Tabernacle Baptist Church said: ldquoIt was wonderful to meet Jenipher and hear her story.ldquoWe get through a lot of coffee in our office and meeting a real coffee farmer from Uganda makes you think about the real people and real lives behind that Fairtrade logo.Vale MS Jane Hutt said: ldquoMeeting Jenipher during her visit to Wales earlier this year was inspiring.ldquoThe increasing dficulties facing rural farming communities because of the pandemic has shown how important Fairtrade cooperatives continue to be and I am glad that leaders like Jenipher continue to promote the benefits of Fairtrade and to support communities.National co-ordinator of Fair Trade Wales, Aileen Burmeister added: ldquoFair Trade producers are being impacted by covid- restrictions.ldquoGlobal stock markets are falling, meaning that farmers and workers are receiving far less for their produce.\"It is in these times that we can really see how important the Fairtrade minimum price is. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey

These include:Communication of health information, and how effective it isCultural issues relating to the suitability of health and social services for BAME communitiesIncome and employment insecurity, which is experienced disproportionately by BAME communitiesPoor quality of ethnicity data, which is preventing accurate analysisHousing overcrowding and environmentThe financial burden created by migration statusThe role of structural and systemic racism and disadvantage.The report is by the BAME Covid- expert advisory group, set up by First Minister Mark Drakeford to look at the reasons why people from BAME communities were more likely to be adversely affected by coronavirus.:One of its two sub-groups was tasked with examining the socio-economic factors, chaired by Professor Emmanuel Ogbonna, professor of management and organization at Cardf Business School, Cardf University.\"Therersquos an overall theme running through our research for this report. It centres on long-standing racism and disadvantage, and the lack of BAME representation within decision-making processes,\" said Professor Ogbonna, who is also a trustee and vice-chair of Race Council Wales.ldquoThe coronavirus pandemic is, in some respects, revealing the consequences of a lack of action on race equality.ldquoMany of the issues wersquove highlighted have been identied and discussed previously, but they havenrsquot been addressed in any systematic and sustained way.Analysis of Covid- related deaths across England and Wales by ethnicity showed that people from a black ethnic background are at a greater risk of death involving COVID- than all other ethnic groups.The Office for National Statistics study showe that the risk for black males has been more than three times higher than white males, and nearly two-and-a-half times higher for black females than white.Adjusting for socio-economic factors and geographical location partly explains the increased risk, but there remains twice the risk for black males and around one-and-a-half times for black females. Signicant dferences also remain for Bangladeshi, Pakistani and Indian men. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

If people are face-to-face, they are at an increased risk compared to being side-by-side or back-to-back. People should still try to maintain greater distances when they are face-to-face.ldquoDuration of exposure is important. A brief exposure at close distance is unlikely to pose a signicant risk, but prolonged duration in an enclosed space is much more risky. vw,vw,px, px\"ldquoAs we have seen in the supermarkets, physical screens and barriers can be installed. People can wear face coverings. Employers can use technology to reduce contact between members of the public and staff.ldquoIn the hospitality sector, there are apps where people can pre-order food and drink. The time employees and the public spend in crowded or busy environments increases the risks they face. Employers will need to think about steps to safeguard their staff, particularly those working with the public.ldquoAnd all of this is influenced by the level of virus in the community. If we can keep the overall level of infection down, the role of mitigation eases.ldquoPut simply, the chance of coming into contact with someone who is infected ndash or touching a surface they have contaminated ndash is low when the level of infection is low. Thatrsquos why reducing social distancing and relaxing other measures need to be underpinned by an effective test, trace and track system, to contain any outbreaks of the disease.Shaun Fitzgerald, visiting professor at the University of Cambridgersquos Department of Engineering, added: ldquoThe key thing about reducing the risk of transmission is that it is not all about the distance, whether that be two metres or one metre.ldquoThere are other mitigation measures which are available including: limiting the duration of close proximity limiting the number of people in a given space limiting the number of contacts between households use of face coverings use of screens increasing rates of ventilation talking more quietly orientation of one person to another use of technology to reduce contact such as more transactions or ordering things from your phone and of course regular cleaning and hand-washing.ldquoIf we think of all these potential mitigation measures as levers available to help control the pandemic, then I can understand why the particular combination chosen at any moment in time might y depending on the circumstances and of course where we are on the curve..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title:  uMitigation measures important u as social distancing reduces article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

back to the ‘Ballygobackwards’ days of Craigavon Council,” said Councillor Nelson.“It is a slap in the face to nationalist people and I would urge the Ulster Unionist Party to stand up and be counted.”The Alliance Party has also come out in opposition to the proposal, with party group leader, Councillor Eoin Tennyson concerned such a move would require an equality impact assessment.“Any change at this late stage would mean further delay to the opening of the centre and additional cost to ratepayers as an Equality Impact Assessment would have to be satisfied, signage replaced at a potential cost of more than £k and planning implications would have to be considered,” said Cllr Tennyson.“We may even find ourselves in a position where residents are left without leisure provision altogether for an extended period.”He continued: “The centenary of Northern Ireland is a signicant event in our shared history, and of course it is right that we mark it in a thoughtful, inclusive and informative way.“Now, more than ever, people want to see their councillors showing leadership, working together and focused on the ongoing pandemic.“Engaging in political point-scoring or afaux fight over the name of a leisure centre ismerely a distraction from that.”Speaking last week, DUP group leader, Councillor Mark Baxter said of the proposal: “Our country celebrates a great milestone on May  next year, our th anniversary as a nation within the United Kingdom.“Given the current economic situation, we, as a party, discussed a fitting and inexpensive way to mark this signicant anniversary, so we will propose that the Council officially name the new leisure centre in Craigavon as the ‘Centenary Leisure Centre’.”A decision on the proposal will be taken at tonight’s full meeting of Armagh City, Banbridge and CraigavonBorough Council.Sinn Fein was asked for comment.Adam Morton , Local Democracy Reporting Service\"\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\"

From  July, subject to the rate of community transmission continuing to be low, people will no longer need to shield and should instead follow the same guidance and precautions as those considered to be generally vulnerable. That involves taking particular care when out and about - and strictly maintaining social distancing.Letters will be issued in the coming days to all those covered by shielding informing them of the planned change.Mr Swann stated: “I have been clear that shielding would not last one minute longer than it needed to. We have now reached the point where,the current trends continue, there will be no need for anyone to shield after  July. “I have listened to many of you and to the challenges you have faced during this period. I am in no doubt as to the dficulties shielding has presented for a great many people.“It is unrealistic to think these dficulties will just vanish because the need to shield has ended. That is why the letters we issue will provide details of the support which will continue to be available up to and after  July.“While my announcement today will be welcome news for many who are shielding, some will view the prospect of an end to shielding with great anxiety. I want to assure them that they should decide what to do at their own pace. Everyone will approach this situation dferently.“As is so often the case at present, this will be about weighing up the options and making informed choices. Going outside can bring some degree of potential risk but this can be mitigated and minimised by strict social distancing. Staying indoors indefinitely is not good for anyone’s mental or physical health.“Finally, I would ask everyone to be considerate as people end their periods of shielding.We should all continue to social distance, but in the coming weeks I want you to be particularly understanding of the fact you might be encountering someone who has had to stay at home for many weeks. Please be aware of this, show respect and kindness to all and keep your distance.”  addthis, Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_eedccedaeedcf   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_acbabaccf   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]  []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
