I’m staying with people I don’t know in an area I know nothing about.’Anna says she is scared of ‘being judged’.‘Him coming from his situation into mine is a little daunting because I’m not gonna be offering what he’s used to.’The first episode sees Fergus help Anna run her home in a bid to prove to himself that he can be independent and cope without his father’s support.He is tasked with a trip to the shops to buy food to feed Anna’s family for a week on a budget of £40, and stresses over the strains of managing the budget.And there’s a real shock in store when Anna takes Fergus to the council estate she used to live on, where Fergus is met with some hostility.Rich Kids Go Skint airs tonight at 9pm on 5Star.MORE: Vogue Williams shows off tiny baby belly as bump finally popsMORE: Darren Criss responds to Versace family’s reaction to American Crime Story: ‘They have every right to feel the way they do’"},{"url":"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/sec_8013551.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all","title":"tributes pour great entertainer dale winton","story":"Dale Winton was the great entertainer (Picture: Getty)Family and friends have paid tribute to Dale Winton, who has died age 62.David Walliams has spoken out about the death of his good friend Dale , telling fans that he has been left ‘heartbroken’.

Her parents used to lock the fridge just so that she couldn’t steal food.Alex has a condition similar to Prader-Willi syndrome, an incurable genetic disorder which causes overeating and often leads to morbid obesity.Alex, who has an associate’s degree in social and behaviour science and is studying towards one in early childhood education, was diagnosed with Prader-Willi aged three.It is caused by a defect in a paternal gene in chromosome 15 which disrupts the function of the hypothalamus, the part of the brain that controls the release of hormones.The condition, which affects one in 15,000 babies in the US, causes cognitive disability, behavioral problems and underdeveloped genitals as well as weight issues.Doctors believe Alex has a condition similar to Prader-Willi because she has most of the symptoms but not all and she is very high functioning.(Picture: Alex Brown  SWNS.com)She was born ‘floppy’, or with low muscle tone, she underwent speech therapy as a young girl due to cognitive impairment and experiences weight issues.As a child her parents locked the fridge and cupboards when they left the house and Alex had a minder at school who ensured she didn’t eat anything she shouldn’t.As a teenager with newfound freedom, Alex would drive to McDonald’s and Taco Bell and eat fast food, which meant she rapidly gained weight.However, she is now on a mission to lose it – though the condition makes that incredibly hard as it means she has a slower metabolism.If Alex eats anything sugary or fatty, she will quickly gain weight and struggle to lose it – which means she has to closely monitor her calorie intake.Alex, of Paso Robles, California, said: ‘Sometimes I wake up at 5.30am and I’m horribly hungry.‘I feel like I haven’t eaten in days – I’m absolutely starving.(Picture: Alex Brown  SWNS.com)‘It’s hard, but if what I eat wasn’t closely monitored I would gain weight horrifically fast.‘When I was younger if I went to a birthday party my mom and I would talk about how there was going to be lots of food and I would only eat the food that was given to me.‘If someone else was having treats I could have one and that was it.‘It was a challenge because I saw everyone else eating and having more than what I would get.’She continued: ‘The pantry was locked, the fridge was locked, the garage was locked. With Prader-Willi you have chronic pangs of hunger that are unable to be satiated.‘My friends would ask to come over and I’d say no because I knew my parents wouldn’t be there after school and I didn’t want them to see all access to food was blocked.‘When I was in junior high I had an aide who was my shadow. She followed me during breaks and lunch and her job was to make sure I didn’t have access to food that wasn’t provided by my parents.(Picture: Alex Brown  SWNS.com)‘When I got my driver’s license at 19 or 20 I would go get food, not because I needed it but I had never had that free access to food.‘I could do whatever I wanted and I ran with it. I wasn’t making the healthiest choices – I would go to McDonald’s and Taco Bell a few times a week.‘All my parents could do was put healthy food in the house but I had no interest in it at that point.’Two years ago, Alex saw a specialist who advised she slim down in order to avoid the complications of obesity that plague people with Prader-Willi and similar disorders.The doctor recommended the Weight Watchers diet, which uses a points-based system to help followers of it track their calorie intake.The diet has given Alex control over her diet and helped her resist the urge the binge to such an extent that they no longer need to lock food away.She has since lost 20lbs through daily exercise and restricting her diet and is documenting her journey on her Facebook page.(Picture: Alex Brown  SWNS.com)Typically she eats oatmeal for breakfast, fruit and nuts for lunch and salad or chicken for dinner, with the occasional treat in the form of ice cream.Alex, whose learning difficulties meant it took her five years to get her associate’s degree rather than the standard two, also does 45 minutes of activity a day, such as Zumba.She said: ‘I feel like I’m doing the best with what I can and I’m not getting the results as quickly as I want to.Could Jesus microwave a burrito so hot that even he couldn\u0027t eat it?‘There are still days where I want to eat things but I know it won’t fit in my points and I can’t even deal.‘But I am doing this for me, mentally and physically. Ultimately, it might take me longer and be harder but it is up to me.’Alex has recently started speaking out in a bid to raise awareness about her condition and to help others with PWS facing similar situations, so that they can follow in her footsteps.You can follow her journey here.MORE: People are tweeting the one thing not to say to people with mental illnessMORE: The best alternative period products for (almost) every need"},{"url":"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/sec_7961580.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all","title":"woman uses different men take holidays costing 100000","story":"Gweneth relaxing at home.

Pictured above is man walking down Market Street with a gun as several buildings burn during a massive fire after the quake            The captivating photos show the dilapidated foundations of buildings, and bewildered survivors surrounded by the rubble of what was once their home city. Pictured above are residents along Grove Street as the fire continues to burn following the earthquake          Other images show the cracks that ruptured through the pavements due to the earthquake, causing breakages in the road and the train tracks throughout San Francisco. Pictured above is a cobblestone street that split into two causing a cart to fall into the gap caused by the earthquake          Another striking image reveals the fires that broke out after the earthquake, showing the sky filled with smoke as the fires roared high above public buildings, as people stared helplessly at the relentless blaze. Pictured above are residents overlooking downtown San Francisco as the fire rips through the city          The massive 7.9 magnitude earthquake struck the Northern California coastline, at precisely 5.12am local time on April 18th. Pictured above are people gathered following the quake as the fire continues to burn in the city          Although, the earthquake occurred before the Richter Scale was created, so the magnitude is an estimate. Some experts estimate the large tremor varied from 7.7 to 8.3. Pictured above is a horse drawn fire engine in front of the Harbor Emergency Hospital and the Union Ferry Building is in the backgroundThe earthquake occurred before the Richter Scale was created - which didn\u0027t happen until 1935 - so the magnitude is an estimate, but some experts believe the large tremor varied from 7.7 to 8.3.The extent of the intense shaking was felt from Oregon, to Los Angeles and even as inland as Nevada proving its undeniable strength.The epicenter of the earthquake was predicted to be offshore, in a north-westerly direction of the Golden Gate Bridge as a minor local tsunami was recorded by a tide gauge in a nearby location.In the immediate aftermath of the quake, 375 deaths were confirmed, however, the total is thought to be up to 3,000 deaths making it one of the worst and deadliest quakes in the United States history. That death toll also remains the greatest loss of life in the state\u0027s history from a natural disaster.

We started descending, made the turn back to Philadelphia. \u0027We were with one engine for maybe 10 minutes.                              Some of the crew couldn\u0027t hold back their horror... some were crying as they looked through the open window and onto the engine                        \u0027We decreased altitude from 8,000 to 5,000 and then when we finally landed it was relatively smooth, kind of a typical landing so the crew and the pilots did a fantastic job.\u0027 Passengers were taken from buses to the airport.  It is not the first time the malfunction has occurred on a Southwest-operated Boeing 737-700. In August last year, a different flight from New Orleans to Orlando was forced to make an emergency landing at Pensacola Airport in Florida after the casing surrounding one of its engines tore away at a similar altitude. On Tuesday, the airline manufacturer said it was aware of the accident and was prepared to cooperate with investigations. \u0027Boeing is aware of an incident with Southwest Airlines flight #1380. \u0027We are gathering more information and stand ready to provide technical assistance,\u0027 it tweeted.The engine which exploded is a CFM56 turbofan engine which costs  $10million and has a fan diameter of 68 inches. The engines are the most popular engines on single aisle commercial planes.           One of the plane\u0027s engines exploded not long after it had left LaGuardia Airport in New York City on Tuesday morning.

CFM said in a statement that the CFM56-7B has had \u0027an outstanding safety and reliability record\u0027 since its debut in 1997, powering more than 6,700 aircraft worldwide.Last year, the engine maker and the Federal Aviation Administration instructed airlines to make ultrasonic inspections of the fan blades of engines like those on the Southwest jet. The FAA said the move was prompted by a report of a fan blade failing and hurling debris. But it was unclear whether the particular engine that failed on Tuesday was covered by the directives.\u0027There\u0027s a ring around the engine that\u0027s meant to contain the engine pieces when this happens,\u0027 said John Goglia, a former NTSB member. \u0027In this case it didn\u0027t. That\u0027s going to be a big focal point for the NTSB - why didn\u0027t (the ring) do its job?\u0027In 2016, a Southwest Boeing 737-700 blew an engine as it flew from New Orleans to Orlando, Florida, and shrapnel tore a 5-by-16-inch hole just above the wing.

There would be associated financial costs.\u0027 Elan-Cane said in a statement before the hearing: \u0027Legitimate identity is a fundamental human right, but non-gendered people are often treated as though we have no rights.\u0027The UK\u0027s passport application process requires applicants to declare whether they are male or female.\u0027It is inappropriate and wrong that someone who defines as neither should be forced to make that declaration.\u0027 "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/18/16/4B48950900000578-5630539-image-a-44_1524065842405.jpg","title":"GDPR need know","story":"    The GDPR, General Data Protection Regulation, compliance deadline is fast approachingWith over 87 million users estimated to have had their data mined through the ‘This Is Your Digital Life’ quiz, it has also emerged that private Facebook Messenger conversations may have also fallen into the hands of Cambridge Analytica. But what is GDPR?What is GDPR?The General Data Protection Regulation has been created over the course of four years in order to strengthen data protection in an era in which people are continuously giving social media websites permissions to use their personal information in exchange for ‘free’ services.GDPR will be replacing the Data Protection Act 1998, which itself was brought into law so that the 1995 EU Data Protection Directive could be implemented and give people more control over how organisations use data.The regulation also introduced penalties for those who do not comply with the new rules and in turn, suffer from data breaches. It also standardised all data laws across the European Union.A significant change in the new regulation is that if companies fail to provide adequate security to protect data, they could be fined heavily under GDPR.Why do we need GDPR?  The advent of the Internet and the emergence of the cloud led to organisations being able to use personal user data for their own purposes, which caused problems when iniduals wanted to know how their information was being used.  GDPR was planned because of the EU’s need to align data protection law with the 21st century, a time where people use free services like Amazon, Google, Twitter and Facebook and offer their information openly.Alongside this, the EU wanted to align data protection law across all member states so that companies are clear about what they need to comply with.          The General Data Protection Regulation will apply from May 25, 2018 in all EU member statesWhen will the GDPR be implemented?The GDPR  will apply from May 25, 2018 in all EU member states automatically, without the need for each country having to draw up their own legislation.While businesses have until May 25 to ensure they have applied the new rules, the directive came into force on May 24, 2016 after the EU agreed to the final text.Who does the GDPR apply to?GDPR will apply to those who decide how and why personal data is processed, the controllers, as well as those who actively process the data, otherwise known as the processors. This means that GDPR could apply to anyone working in a company, charity, government or IT firm.It will also apply to controllers and processors that are based outside the EU, but deal with data that belongs to EU residents. Controllers are responsible for ensuring that processors abide by the new law and process data lawfully, who themselves are required to maintain records of their activities.After the GDPR is put in place, data must be processed with consent and transparently, for a purpose and once it is no longer needed, data should be deleted. Alongside this, consent must be granted in an active fashion by the user, not passively with pre-ticked boxes.What is personal data?Under the GDPR, the European Union has expanded the definition of ‘personal data’ to include other online identifiers such as IP addresses, mental health, cultural and economic information about an inidual.Iniduals already have the right to access information that a company has obtained and to know how and why their data is being processed, as well as who will see it. Data can also be rectified, changed or deleted at any time by the person it belongs to.          The European Union has expanded the definition of ‘personal data’ to include other identifiersHow much are GDPR fines?When a data breach occurs, the people who are at risk of being affected must be told within 72 hours of the company being aware of it. Those who do not meet this deadline could face a penalty of two per cent of their annual worldwide revenue, or €10 million (£8.7m), whichever is higher.Then, the data protection authority should be contacted and in the UK, this means the Information Commissioner\u0027s Office, or the ICO. The authority should be given information about the nature of data breach, how many people have been affected, what the consequences could be and what measures have been actioned.If people’s rights are ignored, the fine could reach up to €20 million (£17m) or four per cent of your global annual turnover, whichever is higher.Does Brexit affect GDPR?With Article 50 being triggered in March 2017, the UK has two years in which to leave the European Union, but this means that the GDPR will be implemented before this time. In August 2017, the UK government put forward a new Data Protection Bill, which replicates the requirements of GDPR ahead of Brexit. The new bill allows the ICO to issue fines of up to £17 million, or four per cent of global turnover, whichever is highest.Maniac: Everything you need to know about the Netflix series starring Emma Stone and Jonah HillPornhub star Yurizan Beltran cause of death revealedSplendour In The Grass tickets: When the tickets go on sale and how to get themWhen does Bachelorette 2018 Start: All you need to knowDonald Trump merchandise: How the President\u0027s branded products are fairing now Burger King to roll out Fanta Lemon slushiesBack With the Ex: Everything you need to knowIs Fornite Meteor strike on the Tilted Towers coming to PS4 and Xbox One?Stranger Things 3: Cary Elwes and Jake Busey join Netflix series castCampbell sisters revealed: Everything you need to know about Cate and Bronte CampbellGDPR: All you need to know Rob Kardashian \u0027begging Khloe Kardashian to dump Tristan Thompson during NBA playoffs\u0027International Champions Cup 2018: Fixtures, dates, teams and ticketsJohnny Galecki net worth revealed as Big Bang Theory star returns to RoseanneSouthwest Airlines passenger paid $8 to leave Facebook Live goodbye message on Flight 1380 Pornhub now accepts Verge cryptocurrency"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/18/17/4B48EEDA00000578-5630851-image-a-17_1524069353144.jpg","title":"Cuba not ruled member Castro family time 1959","story":"    Cuba  proposed Miguel Diaz-Canel (right) as sole candidate to replace Raul Castro (left) as president on Wednesday, which will make him the island\u0027s first non-Castro leader since the 1959 revolution          Castro (left) will remain first secretary of the Communist Party, a potentially more powerful position.How much influence Diaz-Canel will actually wield is an open question that has many observers looking at his past for clues since power in Communist Cuba has long flowed from personalities more than institutions. \u0027There is a tradition in Cuba of strong men at the head of the State,\u0027 said Cuban watcher Arturo Lopez-Levy of the University of Texas-Rio Grande.But \u0027the profile of Miguel Diaz-Canel seems weaker,\u0027 Lopez-Levy added. \u0027He has no more power than what he has been given.\u0027Until March, Diaz-Canel had said nothing to the Cuban people about the type of president he would be. But he has mentioned that he is a fan of The Beatles, and has advocated greater openness to the internet and a less restricted press. The white-haired, jean-wearing Diaz-Canel had been seen at greatest length in a leaked video of a Communist Party meeting where he sombrely pledged to shutter some independent media and labelled some European embassies as outposts of foreign subversion.That image has begun to change slightly this year as Diaz-Canel stepped into the moderate limelight offered by Cuba\u0027s Soviet-style state media. With his public comments in March, many Cubans got a glimpse of him as a flesh-pressing local politician, an image familiar to residents of the central province where he was born and spent nine years in a role akin to a governor.          Diaz-Canel would be the first non-Castro to hold Cuba\u0027s top government office since the 1959 revolution led by Fidel Castro (pictured) and his younger brother RaulRaised and educated in the city of Santa Clara, Diaz-Canel graduated from the local university in 1982 and performed three years of obligatory military service. In 1987 he joined the Young Communists\u0027 Union. He also went on to work as a professor of engineering at the University of Santa Clara and travelled to Nicaragua as part of a government-run mission to support that country\u0027s socialist revolution.Santa Clara residents remember him wearing his hair long and openly admiring the Beatles, who were frowned on by ardent communists who considered the group as representative of the decadent culture of Cuba\u0027s capitalist enemies.Nonetheless, the young professor was named first party secretary in Villa Clara province in 1994 and gained a reputation as a hard-working public servant with a conspicuously modest lifestyle. Residents said that Diaz-Canel was the first official they remembered who didn\u0027t move to a new government-provided home after accepting the position of first secretary.Diaz-Canel travelled the city on a bicycle during the economic crisis spawned when the fall of the Soviet Union cut off subsidies for Cuba, and he accepted visits at all hours at his home and office from residents with complaints or suggestions.When he finished work, residents said, he would start his shifts with the local Committee for the Defense of the Revolution, a mix of a neighbourhood watch committee and local militia.\u0027Some comrades didn\u0027t want to put him on watch because he would be overwhelmed with work, but he would say, \u0027\u0027I\u0027m a citizen of this country and I\u0027ll stand watch like anyone else,\u0027\u0027\u0027 said Liliana Perez, whose house faces the  home where Diaz-Canel lived with his wife and two children.          The proposal is subject to a vote later in the day by the national assembly and the result will be formally announced on Thursday. Pictured: Diaz-Canel on Wednesday          Diaz-Canel had been seen at greatest length in a leaked video of a Communist Party meeting where he sombrely pledged to shutter some independent media and labelled some European embassies as outposts of foreign subversionIn 1996, he began appearing on a local radio program during which he would take two hours of live phone calls from people complaining about problems ranging from bad state restaurants to pothole-rutted side streets, radio journalist Xiomara Rodriguez said.In a country where the state controls most daily activities, Diaz-Canel also made surprise visits to government-run establishments such as the local funeral parlor to check on the quality of services.Diaz-Canel also became known for pushing back against the intolerant tendencies of the Communist Party, an organisation with strains of deep social conservatism and conformity.Canada recalls diplomatic staff and their families from Cuba...Blind leader of Colombia\u0027s Revolutionary Armed Forces is...Share this articleAs first secretary of Villa Clara, he was an active supporter of El Menjunje, a cultural centre that hosted rock \u0027n\u0027 roll shows and became a focus of activities by lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Cubans, including some of the country\u0027s first drag shows. Diaz-Canel was known for bringing his children to the club, an unusual assertion of support in a society with deeply rooted antipathy toward homosexuals.Two of Diaz-Canel\u0027s children have gone on to play in Polaroid, a well-known Cuban rock band.In 2003, Diaz-Canel was named first secretary of the eastern province of Holguin, where he ran into complaints.           Diaz-Canel also became known for pushing back against the intolerant tendencies of the Communist Party, an organisation with strains of deep social conservatism and conformitySome say he focused too much of his six years in office on beautifying the city centre while neglecting the needs of poor and working people. In 2003, Diaz-Canel was also named to the Communist Party\u0027s Politburo, one of its highest-ranking bodies. Six years later, he was named minister of higher education and was praised for modernising curricula and introducing computer technology to many university programs. He was also known as one of the first high-ranking officials to bring a laptop to government meetings.In 2012, conservative Communist Party officials shut down \u0027Young Cuba,\u0027 a blog run by young academics at the University of Matanzas who supported Cuba\u0027s socialist system but who criticised corruption, inefficiency and resistance to change.Diaz-Canel called a meeting between the university rector and the blog\u0027s founders and pointedly asked them, \u0027What do you need to keep running \u0027Young Cuba?\u0027\u0027 The blog was unblocked and remains an important forum for debate among Cuban intellectuals calling for gradual reform. Diaz-Canel also intervened when a government official denied a travel permit to the U.S. for Humberto Rios Labrada, a sustainable agriculture expert who won the U.S-based Goldman Environmental Prize, said Gregory Biniowski, a Cuba-based Canadian lawyer who nominated Rios Labrada for the honour.As first vice president he has mostly stayed out of view, but many observers see that as a wise strategy for survival in a system run by ageing revolutionaries who have ended the careers of many young politicians who rose to prominence early in their careers.   The reign of the Castros: How brothers Fidel and Raul led a revolution and controlled Cuba for decades As Raul Castro passes the presidency on to his mentee, Miguel Diaz-Canel, it marks the end of the reign of Castros at the helm of politics in Cuba.Raul became president in 2008 when his older brother, Fidel Castro, formally handed over power as his health deteriorated. Fidel died in 2016 aged 90.The brothers overcame imprisonment at the hands of dictator Fulgencio Batista, were exiled in Mexico and survived a disastrous start to their rebellion before triumphantly riding into Havana on January 1959.At age 32, Fidel became the youngest leader in Latin America and put his younger brother Raul in charge of the armed forces.           Brothers Fidel (left) and Raul (right) Castro overcame imprisonment at the hands of dictator Fulgencio Batista, were exiled in Mexico and survived a disastrous start to their rebellion before triumphantly riding into Havana on January 1959          Despite initial setbacks, the bearded guerrillas operating in the eastern mountains steadily gained support across the country. Pictured: Fidel is seen with his brother Raul Castro (left) and Camilo Cienfuegos while operating in the Mountains of Eastern Cuba in 1957 Despite initial setbacks, the bearded guerrillas, operating in the eastern mountains, steadily gained support across the country. On January 1, 1959, Batista fled and Fidel became the unquestioned leader of Cuba, with his younger brother put in charge of the armed forces.Fidel\u0027s government initially executed or imprisoned many foes, and veered to Soviet-backed socialism in the early 1960s.Cuba backed revolutions across Latin America, and while most of those failed, the Castros\u0027 resistance to U.S. domination inspired millions across the continent and beyond.Fidel\u0027s control survived repeated U.S. plots to overthrow or kill him, and even the hardships that followed the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union, which had kept the island\u0027s economy afloat.But illness finally forced Fidel to turn over power in 2006 to Raul, who formally became president two years later.Raul announced that he will step aside as president in April - though he plans to remain in what is probably a more important position: head of Cuba\u0027s lone permitted party, the Communist Party.           But illness finally forced Fidel to turn over power in 2006 to Raul, who formally became president two years later.

Pilot Tammie Jo Shults (pictured), a former Navy fighter pilot and the first woman to fly an F-18, quickly brought the Dallas-bound Southwest Flight 1380 to land at Philadelphia International at 11.30am after the explosion at 32,000ft\u0027These two wonderful men the EMT and a passenger managed to get her back inside the plane and we lay her down and we started CPR.\u0027She told the outlet that Riordan had suffered \u0027significant\u0027 head and facial trauma and added: \u0027If you can possibly imagine going through the window of an airplane at about 600mph, and hitting either the fuselage or the wing with your body, with your face...I can probably tell you that there was significant trauma to the body.\u0027Phillips added: \u0027I am terribly, terribly sorry for the family. My heart goes out to them but I am so proud of my fellow passengers and the flight crew and the pilot,\u0027Southwest, which is headquartered in Dallas, Texas, has also responded to the incident – changing its Twitter profile photo to a picture of a broken gray heart and saying in a statement that Riordan\u0027s family are their primary concern.The airline added on Tuesday: \u0027We are deeply saddened to confirm that there is one fatality resulting from this accident.\u0027The entire Southwest Airlines Family is devastated and extends its deepest heartfelt sympathy to the customers, employees, family members, and loved ones affected by this tragic event.\u0027We have activated our emergency response team and are deploying every resource to support those affected by this tragedy.\u0027 "},{"url":null,"title":"Burger King roll Fanta Lemon slushies","story":"Maniac: Everything you need to know about the Netflix series starring Emma Stone and Jonah HillPornhub star Yurizan Beltran cause of death revealedSplendour In The Grass tickets: When the tickets go on sale and how to get themWhen does Bachelorette 2018 Start: All you need to knowDonald Trump merchandise: How the President\u0027s branded products are fairing now Burger King to roll out Fanta Lemon slushiesBack With the Ex: Everything you need to knowIs Fornite Meteor strike on the Tilted Towers coming to PS4 and Xbox One?Stranger Things 3: Cary Elwes and Jake Busey join Netflix series castCampbell sisters revealed: Everything you need to know about Cate and Bronte CampbellGDPR: All you need to know Rob Kardashian \u0027begging Khloe Kardashian to dump Tristan Thompson during NBA playoffs\u0027International Champions Cup 2018: Fixtures, dates, teams and ticketsJohnny Galecki net worth revealed as Big Bang Theory star returns to RoseanneSouthwest Airlines passenger paid $8 to leave Facebook Live goodbye message on Flight 1380 Pornhub now accepts Verge cryptocurrency"},{"url":null,"title":"Splendour Grass tickets tickets sale them","story":"Maniac: Everything you need to know about the Netflix series starring Emma Stone and Jonah HillPornhub star Yurizan Beltran cause of death revealedSplendour In The Grass tickets: When the tickets go on sale and how to get themWhen does Bachelorette 2018 Start: All you need to knowDonald Trump merchandise: How the President\u0027s branded products are fairing now Burger King to roll out Fanta Lemon slushiesBack With the Ex: Everything you need to knowIs Fornite Meteor strike on the Tilted Towers coming to PS4 and Xbox One?Stranger Things 3: Cary Elwes and Jake Busey join Netflix series castCampbell sisters revealed: Everything you need to know about Cate and Bronte CampbellGDPR: All you need to know Rob Kardashian \u0027begging Khloe Kardashian to dump Tristan Thompson during NBA playoffs\u0027International Champions Cup 2018: Fixtures, dates, teams and ticketsJohnny Galecki net worth revealed as Big Bang Theory star returns to RoseanneSouthwest Airlines passenger paid $8 to leave Facebook Live goodbye message on Flight 1380 Pornhub now accepts Verge cryptocurrency"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/18/21/3097D4B700000578-0-image-a-32_1524084281341.jpg","title":"The torching rituals reveal just Queen loved corgis","story":"The Queen was hit especially hard by the death of her last Welsh corgi Willow (who appeared in the Olympic opening ceremony with Daniel Craig), that had to be put to sleep at Windsor after suffering from cancer and other related illnessesLike all 30 of the corgis she has owned — and other royal pets including gundogs, labradors and cocker iels — Willow\u0027s time as part of the Queen\u0027s menagerie will be recorded in the traditional manner.It has been like this since 1959 when the death of Susan, the Queen\u0027s first corgi, given to her as a puppy on her 18th birthday by her father King George VI, was marked with a headstone.On it are engraved the dog\u0027s dates of birth and death along with the moving epitaph: \u0027For almost 15 years the faithful companion of the Queen.\u0027The same words appear on the gravestones of two of Susan\u0027s descendants, Sugar and Heather. And, because Willow is the last of the line, the 14th generation traced back to Susan, the elegy is likely to be just as heartfelt.There is only one unwritten rule — wherever possible, the animals are buried where they died, which means the final resting place of generations of the Royal Family\u0027s pets can be found at Windsor, Balmoral and Sandringham.These pet cemeteries have one thing in common: they are all in a secluded and peaceful spot with special resonance for the Queen.Willow is believed to have been interred close to Frogmore House, the royal retreat in Windsor Great Park where Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will celebrate their wedding with a party on May 19.Other corgis have been buried closer to Windsor Castle, but Frogmore is where the Queen likes to walk, often with her dogs, far from any public access.          The death of Willow represents the final act in a story that began one spring day 85 years ago when the Queen\u0027s father — then Duke of York — brought home a Pembroke corgi called Dookie from kennels in SurreyBy far the largest animal cemetery is at Sandringham, in a tidy corner of the 20,000-acre estate, but within view of the royal residence.It was started by Queen Victoria for her collie Noble, who died in 1887, and it is where Susan was buried more than 70 years later.There are also memorial plaques set into a stone boundary wall that separates the cemetery from the rest of the estate.One commemorates Candy, Prince Philip\u0027s yellow labrador, who died in 1958. Another bears the name Sandringham Slipper, a black labrador who died in 1980 after eight years as a royal pet.Sandringham Brae, another black lab, is described as \u0027a gentleman amongst dogs\u0027 on his stone, while a roan cocker iel called Sandringham Fern is celebrated as a \u0027tireless worker and mischievous character\u0027.When Holly, the Queen\u0027s penultimate corgi, died at Balmoral 18 months ago, she directed that he must be buried in sight of the castle\u0027s drawing room windows.\u0027Even when they are no longer with her, the Queen likes to feel she is still surrounded by her corgis,\u0027 says a friend. \u0027That is why they are buried at all of her main private homes. They have been such a huge part of her life.\u0027The Queen is not, of course, without four-legged companionship now she still has her two dorgis — corgi-dachshund crosses Candy and Vulcan — along with a new addition to her canine family, Whisper, a corgi who used to be owned by a Sandringham gamekeeper.But the death of Willow represents the final act in a story that began one spring day 85 years ago when the Queen\u0027s father — then Duke of York — brought home a Pembroke corgi called Dookie from kennels in Surrey.In her 1983 biography of the Queen, Elizabeth R, the Countess of Longford wrote: \u00271933 was the year of the corgi.\u0027          At one stage there were said to be 13 corgis — memorably described by Princess Diana as a \u0027moving carpet\u0027 — lolling in the Queen\u0027s private sitting room, and nipping the heels of footmen, prime ministers, ladies-in-waiting and diplomats          Princess Elizabeth, then only seven, had fallen in love with a corgi she had played with in Hyde Park. It belonged to the family of Viscount Weymouth, a future Marquess of BathPrincess Elizabeth, then only seven, had fallen in love with a corgi she had played with in Hyde Park. It belonged to the family of Viscount Weymouth, a future Marquess of Bath.The breed was little known outside South Wales, but the young princess and her sister Margaret pleaded with their parents for one of their own.The Duke and Duchess of York needed little persuading and Mrs Thelma Gray, breeder of the Weymouths\u0027 dog and a pioneer of the breed, supplied the first royal corgi, Rozavel Golden Eagle — or Dookie, so-called by Mrs Gray because, she claimed, he acted \u0027aristocratically\u0027.Three years later Dookie acquired a wife called Jane but this royal marriage of convenience proved unproductive.Jane did produce two puppies with another mate, however, and Crackers and Carol joined King George and Queen Elizabeth\u0027s household during World War II.In 1944, Susan arrived as Princess Elizabeth\u0027s birthday present. Mistress and pet were inseparable. She even accompanied the Princess on her honeymoon with Prince Philip in 1947, hidden from view under a blanket in the royal carriage.The following year, when the Princess gave birth to her first baby, Charles, newspaper columns were full of advice on how she could prevent Susan from becoming jealous of the infant prince.A year later, Susan followed her royal mistress into motherhood, producing a pair of puppies: Sugar, who belonged to Prince Charles, and Honey who, in later years, lived with the Queen Mother. It marked the beginning of a new royal dynasty.Over the years, the Queen became one of the most experienced breeders of Pembrokeshire corgis in the country. She always chose the sire herself, aiming for good-looking puppies that maintain the red colouring of the original Pembrokes.At one stage there were said to be 13 corgis — memorably described by Princess Diana as a \u0027moving carpet\u0027 — lolling in the Queen\u0027s private sitting room, and nipping the heels of footmen, prime ministers, ladies-in-waiting and diplomats.Every few years, a fresh litter arrived and older dogs passed away. No puppies were ever sold instead the Queen ensured that they went to good homes. Susan\u0027s descendants have gone to Australia and America.Then came the dorgis, a cross-breed resulting from an unplanned liaison between one of the Queen\u0027s corgis and Princess Margaret\u0027s dachshund Pipkin.In 2009, it emerged that the Queen had stopped breeding the dogs. It was perhaps the first public sign that our monarch was growing old.She worried about puppies and lively young dogs around her feet, and the fear that she might trip over, hurting herself or them. But what was not clear then was that she no longer wanted any new four-legged companions to replace those that died.Then, three years ago Monty Roberts, the Californian cowboy who inspired the Hollywood film The Horse Whisperer, disclosed what many had suspected: the Queen, who will be 92 on Saturday, did not wish to leave any of her beloved pets after her death. Corgis have an average life of 12 to 13 years, though some can reach 18. Willow was just a few weeks short of her 15th birthday.Inevitably, perhaps, it took a plain-speaking American to give this first intimation of the Queen\u0027s sense of her own mortality.Roberts — after whom the Queen named Monty, one of the corgis that appeared in the James Bond spoof she made with actor Daniel Craig for the London Olympics — was an informal adviser to her on horses and dogs for more than 25 years.He said that when Monty died in 2012, he offered to find the Queen a replacement puppy. \u0027But she didn\u0027t want to have any more young dogs. She didn\u0027t want to leave any young dog behind. I understood we would discuss it further at a later date.\u0027Well, we never did, and I have no right to try to force her into continuing to bring on young puppies if she doesn\u0027t want to.\u0027          Often the dogs are taken to the Queen\u0027s private sitting room when she is having breakfast, and clamour for scraps, slices of toast and marmalade, fed to them from the tableFor now, life for Candy, Vulcan and Whisper will continue as usual. Each day starts with a brisk walk with a footman in the Buckingham Palace gardens and, because of their age, they are relatively easy to handle. The days when former royal butler Paul Burrell, then a Palace page, was knocked unconscious when nine leashed corgis pulled him over on the steps of Sandringham House are long past.When their mistress is at the Palace, the dogs sleep in raised wicker baskets in a boot room near the royal apartments, through which they are at liberty to wander.Often the dogs are taken to the Queen\u0027s private sitting room when she is having breakfast, and clamour for scraps, slices of toast and marmalade, fed to them from the table.Whenever possible, the Queen feeds the corgis herself — their menu includes steak, poached chicken, liver and rabbit.According to former royal chef Darren McGrady, who spent 11 years in the Palace kitchen, the corgis had a \u0027wonderful diet. One day it might be chuck steak, boiled and diced and served with finely chopped boiled cabbage and white rice. The next they\u0027d have poached chicken or liver. Or rabbits shot by William and Harry which we\u0027d clean and cook\u0027.Kate and Wills WON\u0027T know if they are having a boy or a girl...South Korean kills and COOKS his neighbour\u0027s dog then...Kate Middleton and Prince William launch Royal Baby webpage In over his head! Adorable video shows a Corgi hopping...Share this articleThe Queen likes to take them on a daily constitutional which also serves as a kind of meditation. Prince Philip has referred to this as her \u0027dog mechanism\u0027 therapy.And she is very hands-on with their personal maintenance, de-fleaing them and administering medicine. Nothing is too much trouble. When she is being fitted for a new dress, the Queen produces a special magnet to pick up pins to ensure the dogs do not prick their paws.No world figure has been as identified with an animal as the Queen has with her corgis.Over the years they have brought a warmth to her public image, being photographed at her side receiving statesmen in formal situations, or on a tartan picnic rug with the Royal Family at Balmoral, or being bundled by a flunky up the steps on to a royal plane.In a life governed by protocol, they are also a simple way to break the ice with strangers. The line may now have ended, but Willow, like each and every one of her corgis, will be remembered.Reacting to news of Willow\u0027s death yesterday one royal fan, Angela Cox, recalled visiting Sandringham just after the Queen had been there.In a tweet she said: \u0027There was a small posy on each of her dogs\u0027 graves. It made me cry.\u0027 "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/18/22/4B4B223C00000578-5631741-image-a-13_1524086711879.jpg","title":"Is Britains magnificent magnolia picture better one win 500","story":"    This magnificent magnolia was photographed in Kew Garden in London earlier today as temperatures soared           To enter the competition you need to be a UK resident aged 18 or over and have taken the photograph this yearWhile some blossoms are now at their best and others are still to thrill, Radio 4’s John Humphrys remarked sadly yesterday that all the petals on the specimen in his London garden have already dropped. Despite becoming a fixture in Britain, the trees have strong French ties, having been named in the 18th century after botanist Pierre Magnol.

When will the industry tackle its failings?The year is 1971. In London, Robert Morris’s Tate show, Bodyspacemotionthings closes after four days because viewers, encouraged to climb over its adventure playground-style structure, have become too boisterous. In New York, the Whitney Museum faces a huge backlash for appointing a white curator for its Contemporary Black Artists in America exhibition. Meanwhile, Linda Nochlin’s essay Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists is published to the delight of campaigning feminists everywhere. She argues not that women artists aren’t great, but that their greatness has been overshadowed and ignored by a canon comprised almost entirely of men. Its publication is a watershed moment, one that shakes the lofty and complacent art world to its core. Forty-seven years later, much has changed. Female curators are now commonplace within national museums and galleries the head of the Tate is a woman, Maria Balshaw and there is a much greater awareness of the way women artists have been marginalised over the years. However, there is one aspect of visual arts that remains overwhelmingly male (and white): criticism. As Jerry Saltz, megawatt showman for New York magazine, receives his deserved Pulitzer win for his art criticism, it is worth taking note of the absence of female art critics who are similarly feted. Despite numerous female winners of the Pulitzer prize for criticism specialising in architecture, TV, fashion or film, the last – female art critic to win was Manuela Hoelterhoff of the Wall Street Journal, back in 1983. Since then, little has happened to dislodge the notion that men are the cultural gatekeepers. From John Ruskin’s enthusiasm for JMW Turner to Robert Hughes championing Lucian Freud, male art critics have been invested almost exclusively with the power to make or break entire artistic movements, shaping the cultural legacy of generations and deciding whose work is worth celebrating – and collecting in museums. So where are the women? Rosalind Krauss, Lucy Lippard and Griselda Pollock, all feminist art writers well known in their fields, largely write for academic and specialist titles rather than the mainstream press. At the other end of the spectrum, young UK-based art critics Gabrielle de la Puente and Zarina Muhammad are dedicated to making art criticism accessible and ersifying the structures of the arts industry. They make the case for a new brand of art criticism, as concerned with Love Island as it is the White Cube’s latest offering, and their success without the patronage of the mainstream press is laudable. But it speaks volumes about the kind of voices national titles are willing to give status to. Meanwhile the lead art critics for the Sunday Times, the Washington Post, the Independent, the Telegraph and the Guardian are all male. Laura Cumming at the Observer, Rachel Campbell-Johnston in the Times and Roberta Smith, co-chief art critic at the New York Times, are rare examples of female critics given a broadsheet platform. It’s not as though the visual arts industry is devoid of women – in fact statistics point towards a gender disparity in the opposite direction: arts, design and history graduates are overwhelmingly female. Yet the art press is still a boys’ club.  The problem must lie in an arts and media landscape that sees men as the voices of authority. Feminist art collectives the Guerrilla Girls and Pussy Galore, and art theorist Hito Steyerl have all attested to an art world still in the heavy grip of patriarchy. Like a bad rash, the effects of the arts industry’s problem with unpaid labour are catching. With the majority of unpaid work being taken up by women, is it any wonder that they are turning away from a career in arts criticism for more stable work elsewhere? Add to this the reduction of space for arts criticism in many newspapers, and common microaggressions like mistaking female journalists for PR assistants, and the circles of access for women art critics get smaller and smaller. Despite important work by people such as Taylor Renee Aldridge and Jessica Lynne – who have highlighted the significant lack of black art critics – the issues have been ignored, erted and at worst, forgotten. Unwelcoming and certainly not inclusive, it points at an art press seriously out of touch with the modern world.At a time when barriers in other branches of the arts are being dismantled – from Kendrick Lamar winning a Pulitzer to Beyoncé’s historic headlining set at Coachella – the art world is lagging badly behind. It’s about time arts criticism began to assess its failings. In the harsh light of a year dominated by the revelations of the #MeToo movement, Nochlin’s legacy remains a troubling reminder of the work that still needs to be done."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5a991fd62798f90eb6935fb361c442e3aa221d94/0_0_1600_1042/master/1600.jpg?w=1500\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e08ca9ac8f963ace794ecfee304613dc 3000w","title":"the last town in sovietland vorkuta russia tomeu coll in pictures","story":"Up above the Arctic Circle, 40 hours by train from Moscow, sits the Russian city of Vorkuta.

The total is up from 455 towers in the pipeline in 2016, according to research from the industry forum New London Architecture (NLA) and real estate consultancy GL Hearn.Construction has started on 115 towers, also a record. Over the past two years, work started on more projects than in the preceding five years combined.Twenty-two Bishopsgate, formerly nicknamed “the Pinnacle” and then “the Stump” after work stalled, will be – at 62 storeys or 278 metres – the tallest building in the City of London when it is completed next year. However, in the 2020s it will be overtaken by 1 Undershaft, nicknamed the Trellis, at 290m.Two of Europe’s tallest residential towers will be the 233-metre Landmark Pinnacle on the Isle of Dogs and the 235-metre Spire London, also in Canary Wharf. Both are expected to be completed by 2020. But they do not come close to the Shard, which, at 310 metres, remains the tallest building in Europe.Peter Murray, the NLA chair, said the slowdown was to be expected. “The uncertainties created by Brexit are causing projects to be postponed, while higher stamp duty introduced by George Osborne in December 2014 continues to impact on the market.”The planned towers could provide 106,000 new homes by 2030, while the mayor of London has called for 66,000 new homes a year. Half of the planned towers (252) are in east London, while the second-biggest cluster (99) is in central London.Almost a third of the entire pipeline is in outer London, in zones three, four and five.

Who doesn’t want zero hunger? Who thinks education is bad? Who doesn’t want clean and sustainable energy or responsible, pro-social businesses? Who wants poverty entrenched, children from poor families to have no aspirations, opportunities for only some, inequality to thrive and some people to be treated as worth less than others?The language became so anodyne and meaningless that we had to look for the sense of it in the cracks, in the things that went unsaid. What did “lacking aspiration” really mean? Did it mean a person didn’t want a good life, or just that they weren’t middle-class enough? How was it that all unfortunate circumstances were driven by their hapless or feckless victims, and there were never any other factors? Why, when everybody was against inequality and for human rights, did equality get further away, and “human rights” become the new “red tape”, amorphous, troublesome, indistinct, someone else’s idea?In tandem with the new discourse, where everybody wanted the same thing – better, less impoverished lives for all – and all that was left was for decent people to choose between a suite of practical options, the actual decisions meted out by politics have become cruel. The “hostile environment” for which Theresa May is rightly castigated today has become the norm not just for immigrants, but for everyone who falls short of what the “decent citizen” of her conception should be. Anyone economically unproductive, unless they are old anyone insufficiently healthy, unless they are in the Paralympics anyone who doesn’t belong here, a category whose dimensions have become theoretically limitless, now that the criterion for belonging is that you can prove you belong, yet the Home Office holds the proof and is liable to destroy it at any moment, for “data protection”. It transpires – who knew? – that not every stamp of politics does want the best for everyone. Being unable, under the 21st century’s Convention on What’s Normal, to admit to not wanting the best, instead rightwing politics has reconfigured what it means by “everyone”.There’s historical precedent, sure, for conservative politicians not saying what they mean. Margaret Thatcher famously wanted to solve her disputes in the industrial heartlands by just putting a wall around Liverpool and leaving them to it. Even though this view was pretty well understood at the time, it took the release of historical cabinet papers before anyone could stick it on her. But the new element, the shiny modern bit of our predicament, is the sluggishness: we’re aways waiting for the hostile environment to explode into human tragedy, for a man to be refused cancer treatment, for a woman to be deported, for a hunger strike, for a suicide, always waiting for a catastrophic injustice to have a face, before we can say “this is unjust”. It’s not a collective amnesia, where we have forgotten what justice looks like, or a sudden, generalised lack of sincerity or compassion. It’s just a logical consequence there’s no space to argue about principle, because everyone claims to believe the same thing. So we wait and see what it looks like in practice. This has the pleasing scientific veneer of an evidence base, but is destructive to the lives capsized in the process. We need to stop buying it: stop swallowing the rhetoric with which no reasonable person would disagree. Then we might see the meanings beneath it in time to halt the consequences rather than bemoan them.“Am I being unreasonable?”, asked a woman posting on Mumsnet. That would have been the moment to look away. The answer is always either: “No, that’s fine, though it’s quite unreasonable that you wasted my time by asking,” or: “Unreasonable doesn’t even begin to cover it, you are so boilingly unhinged that someone should tattoo you with a warning sign or stripe you yellow and black like a bee.” But I had got as far as the subject line, whence there is no escape, like a spell invented by Tolkien.A mother of three was complaining that her husband, having started a job, had announced he needed “full personal assistance” in the morning. I assumed it was a sex thing, but no: he needed his keys and his wallet laid out, and his shoes and suit neatly arranged, unless he was cycling, in which case he wanted them in a bag, but she wouldn’t be informed of his method of transport until such time as she’d already done the other thing. Responses ided three ways: “If my husband said this, I would laugh in his face” “I used to have a husband like this, then I left him and my current husband is much nicer” and “How disappointing, I thought this was going to be a sex thing.”The outrage was superb – I want to say comradely or supportive, but no, it was just so vividly enjoyable. If someone had suggested forging the man’s Brompton into stocks and setting him there in a town square, I would have been in. Any one of us would have been. Which all made me feel a little sorry for the great villains of the internet age, the Zuckerbergs, the Russians trolls, the many facilitators of a social rage that previously didn’t exist. It’s not that the internet is making us angry. It’s just the place that you go when only anger will do, as the corner shop is to the strawberry bonbon.The Queen’s corgi, Willow, passed away this week aged 14, survived by two dachshund-corgi crosses that are probably called dawgies, full name: Inspector Dawgie.

Emily Beatty, who attends King Edward VII school in Sheffield, came joint-first among nearly 200 teenagers who took part. She was one of only five competitors to get a perfect score of 42 out of 42.The British team finished third of 52 in the European Girls’ Mathematical Olympiad, which took place in Florence, Italy.Her teammates Alevtina Studenikina, from Cheltenham Ladies college in Gloucestershire, and Naomi Wei, from City of London Girls’ school, won silver medals for their scores. Melissa Quail, from Longsands academy in Cambridgeshire, won a bronze medal.The team was chosen by the UK Mathematics Trust (UKMT), a charity set up to advance young people’s education in maths.Speaking the day before the competition, Beatty and her teammates explained why they loved the subject. Beatty said she has always found “elegance in doing mathematics” and that she likes the way “structures weave into each other”. Studenikina said: “I find Olympiad-style mathematics questions interesting because, even though they do not necessarily seem to have useful applications, principles and skills obtained from solving them help solve real-life problems.”Quail said she enjoyed solving maths problems as they allowed her the freedom to use her imagination and creativity.Speaking to the Times Education Supplement, Beatty’s maths teacher, Graham Harvey, said that older pupils could be good role models for young mathematicians.“Probably the biggest impact on Emily was from one of our former students, another girl, currently at Cambridge studying maths,” he said. “We have always encouraged our older students to help us run clubs for the younger ones. Emily herself is currently mentoring one of our year 10 students. We also have a significant number of female maths teachers in the department.”Linda Gooden, the headteacher at King Edward VII school, said: “As a headteacher, I alongside all the other staff in school are really proud of Emily’s success and achievements. We always encourage staff to develop and enhance depth of mathematical understanding from an early age. We are really pleased with Emily’s achievements and know her parents will be proud too.”Rachel Greenhalgh, the director of the UK Mathematics Trust, said: “The team demonstrated their outstanding problem-solving skills and it is great to see their mathematical potential recognised.“I thank all those involved, from the maths teachers who support our activities and the UKMT volunteers who run them on our behalf, to our sponsors and supporters, in helping make this possible.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/48969322d7c394dee4e0acea35f722b60f3d6853/0_918_2655_1593/master/2655.jpg?w=1300\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=18d4e063b828dcddd33bdbbc65cd5add 2600w","title":"stella mccartney designer ethical fashion interview","story":"The designer’s ethical stance made her a style outsider – but now the industry is finally catching up.

No one is going to come back for more of that chat.”McCartney is at the V\u0026ampA in London for the launch of Fashioned from Nature, an exhibition opening on Saturday that tackles the complex relationship between fashion and the natural world. In other words, the very axis McCartney has been obsessing over for two decades. She was an outlier when she launched her cruelty-free, sustainably minded brand in 2001, but has found the centre of gravity shifting in her direction. “When I was younger, just saying you were vegetarian at someone else’s dinner table wasn’t often a pleasant conversation. So I learned early on how to navigate those conversations and I learned early on that there were ways of introducing a different mindset.” “I come at fashion with lightness of heart. I shot my last ad campaign in a landfill site for a reason, and to make a point, obviously. But the models looked happy, there was lightness, there was colour. My messaging is not the kind that is going to make you panic or feel rubbish about yourself or not sleep at night, because I don’t think that achieves much.” McCartney and her family – husband Alasdhair Willis and four children Miller, 13, Beckett, 11, Bailey, 10 and Reiley, 7 – live in London but spend weekends in the Worcestershire countryside, where she rides her horses and tends her garden. “Everything comes from nature. I mean, where does colour come from, if not from nature, from the changing of the seasons? Every fabric we use is emulating something from nature. Nature is … oh man, it’s magnificent, isn’t it?”Many of fashion’s great artists have been obsessed with nature. Christian Dior was a knowledgable gardener who channelled his passion into pieces such as his 1952 Vilmorin dress, hand-embroidered by the house of Rebe with thousands of tiny daisies. Alexander McQueen dressed women in dresses of razor clam shells, headdresses of antlers and shoes modelled on armadillo hooves. But the relationship has a dark side, from the fur trade to the monumental environmental impact of a global fashion industry that expends the Earth’s resources on clothes that are surplus to requirements. A survey of 2,000 British women by Barnardo’s last year found that the average piece of clothing was worn just seven times before being thrown away.The Stella McCartney pieces chosen for the exhibition reflect the contrasting emotions swirling around clothes and natural beauty. A catwalk outfit from last year features a horse print from the Stubbs painting Horse Frightened by a Lion, referencing the love of the countryside, of animals, and of horses in particular that McCartney inherited from her mother, Linda McCartney, still a constant presence in Stella’s world 20 years after she died. In another display case, the Mylo Falabella Prototype 1 is a handbag created in collaboration with the biotechnology company Bolt Threads, using a groundbreaking alternative to leather made from mycelium, which is the root structure of a mushroom. (“Please don’t call it mushroom leather, will you,” pleads a V\u0026ampA spokesperson wearily. “Mycelium is completely different from mushroom leather.”)From what feminism looks like on the red carpet to how to dress ethically, fashion finds itself in the eye of the moral storm. The primacy of inidual choice is the ideology of our age, and what we wear is the most public manifestation of that. It has become fashionable among prominent designers to make a moral stand and renounce fur: Donatella Versace last month joined Gucci and Michael Kors in proclaiming her brand fur-free. McCartney is happy to see this shift, although, from where she stands, it has taken too long. “Fur … it’s so medieval,” she sniffs. A personal ideology that was rooted in animal rights grew into “being mindful of the impact that fashion has on the environment, and became a conversation about this industry being the second most destructive industry that there is. And once you are aware of that, as a lover of nature and of life, you can’t ignore that.”Fashioned from Nature is the latest in a procession of fashion-related museum shows, with an Azzedine Alaïa retrospective at the Design Museum and the V\u0026ampA’s take on Frida Kahlo’s wardrobe and image hot on its heels. Central to it, says the curator, Edwina Ehrman, is the need “to get away from the idea that sustainable fashion should look quirky. We need leaders like Stella McCartney, who can tell scientists what the future needs to look like.”An exhibition is always telling a story about the era it is staged in, as much as about the past. Fashioned from Nature s a time period from 1600 to the present day, but it is a very different show than it would have been even a decade ago. Awareness has grown exponentially around the environmental impact of the fashion industry, which produces greenhouse gas emissions of 1.2bn tonnes a year, larger than that of international flights and shipping combined. To tackle this, “we need to completely rewire the hierarchies of fashion”, says Ehrman. The mindset by which a dress made up of rare materials imported from far-flung corners of the globe is the first to be put in a museum is finally being challenged.Those who scoff at the notion that the modern consumer might be made to read a shirt label and be impressed by, say, flax – a sustainable fibre because, when grown in the right climate, it needs no irrigation – should be encouraged by the clean eating movement, argues Ehrman. “The way the modern consumer behaves around food – reading the label, taking pride in knowing about ingredients, wanting to identify as the type of person who is knowledgable and makes informed choices – shows what is possible.” But for this to happen requires us “to reconnect with fabric, and fabric has been forgotten in modern fashion, which is all about surface and decoration. If we feel fabrics again, engage with our clothes on a tactile, sensual level, we might start valuing them sufficiently to be motivated to sew buttons back on, or hems back up.”The emotional trigger of ethical fashion has long belonged to animal rights. McCartney’s refusal to use leather and fur is the one fact everyone knows about her. Many of the most startling exhibits in Fashioned from Nature are those for which animals have grotesquely suffered: a pair of Brazilian red-legged honeycreeper birds made into earrings, their tiny bodies dangling like pompoms, would have been a prized accessory for a fashionable woman of the late 19th century. A dress made in the 1860s features embroidered “flowers” with the petals made up of about 5,000 iridescent green beetle wings, most of which would have been harvested from live beetles.But as awareness of animal rights pushes fur towards being a footnote in fashion history, fast fashion has become the focus. The poor record of workers’ rights in the production of fast fashion, its convoluted supply chains, environmentally reckless dye processes and short wardrobe life make cheaply produced garments the villain of the modern fashion piece. The circular economy is the buzz phrase in the industry – McCartney recently partnered with the RealReal, a resale company, to encourage shoppers to keep clothes in circulation by selling them on. But the issue cannot be tackled on a meaningful scale until it engages with the consumer who has neither the budget for designer fashion nor relatives dropping off piles of hand-me-down cashmere.There is just one high-street garment in Fashioned from Nature, a dress made from recycled ocean plastic from H\u0026ampM’s Conscious range. McCartney’s elegant ethics are beyond the budget of most people. She says she wishes more people “would save up and buy one thing at Stella McCartney instead of the 20 things they buy from a fast-fashion label”, but I am not convinced that most family budgets work like this. McCartney’s label takes another step upmarket this year with the opening of a new London flagship, on which she has been working “like a bat out of hell”, situated, symbolically, on Bond Street. (Her previous store was just off London’s main luxury drag.) What’s more, her name has been mentioned as a possible wedding dress designer for Meghan Markle. “I read this morning that you are designing the royal wedding dress,” I say to McCartney as she is preparing to leave. She laughs and raises a sceptical eyebrow. “Oh, you did, did you? You’re hilarious. How many designers have you said that to today?” That’s not a denial then, I point out. “Well, you didn’t actually ask a question.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a6199c2342bf2024a7310dc1b94705df9fac0e99/0_190_3120_1871/master/3120.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=1bfcb2e6fc7a0e12d3926507e20cd7e3 1240w","title":"grease review john travolta olivia newton john","story":"Rereleased on its 40th anniversary, the nostalgic rock’n’roll high school musical remains a sugar-rush of a film‘What happened to the Danny Zuko I knew at the beach?” With this stunned and plaintive cry, Olivia Newton-John introduces the main theme and narrative dynamic of this still very enjoyable 1978 movie based on the original stage musical, which is now on rerelease.Newton John plays Sandy, and she’d met such a sweet boy over the summer, enjoying a more-or-less platonic beachside romance and imagining she would never see him again once she went back to Australia. But her family’s plans changed and, with the new term, Sandy shows up at the local high school and is astonished to see Danny, played by John Travolta. Compelled to be super-cool in front of his gang buddies, he is crudely dismissive of Sandy, but secretly still in love with her.We hear the classic split-point-of-view song Summer Nights, in which Sandy regales her saucer-eyed friends with Danny’s gallantry and Danny jeeringly implies he’d had his way with her on the sand. The movie is all about male identity, peer pressure, sex in that pre-pill era and innocently imagined rock’n’roll. Grease was also about race: the title had overtones of “greaseball”. Blond Sandy is as Waspy as they come Danny and some of his gang are regarded as outsiders partly because of their Italian American ethnicity – and the same goes for Rizzo, as tough as any boy, played by Stockard Channing.Grease broke John Travolta through to family audiences who might have been chary about his more adult movie sensation, Saturday Night Fever, the year before. It was part of the 70s fashion for 50s nostalgia that also had its expression in George Lucas’s American Graffiti and Garry Marshall’s longrunning TV show Happy Days, and survived in the form of Robert Zemeckis’s Back to the Future in 1985. Travolta’s effortless dancing here is different from his lithe and narcotically sexy disco performances in Saturday Night Fever. In Grease it is more family-friendly. Still superb, less about pelvic grinding than about the quiff, elbows and the knees rotating in 45-degree shunts, as if he were appearing in an Egyptian frieze. It’s still a sugar-rush of a film."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/893007c8bb46b312892379b7b423a8052de7f3ce/0_617_5669_3400/master/5669.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=e500e47dd3b549b867f70fe1e845546b 1240w","title":"mercury 13 space women nasa 1960s","story":"In a new Netflix documentary, the tales of 13 female pilots who dreamed of becoming astronauts yet were denied the opportunity by Nasa are finally brought to lightBut what if that one small step had been taken by a woman? What kind of leap would that have represented, at a time when the American public was waking up to women’s rights?That’s the focus of Mercury 13, a Netflix documentary that explores the fates of 13 female pilots who were prevented from entering Nasa’s space training program.The women featured in the film passed through some of the same physiological and psychological testing procedures as Nasa’s first male astronauts, as the space race with Russia ramped up in the early 1960s. In some cases, the women, each of them skilled flyers, fared better than their male counterparts, but their testing, which was designed to assess their suitability for space flight, was conducted with private funding without the approval of Nasa.As the women prepared to undergo further testing, which would have included flying jet planes, Nasa refused to extend the project. The women’s dreams were shattered, and it would be more than two decades before an American woman made it into space.After the release of Hidden Figures in 2016, which told the story of three black women who struggled for acceptance at Nasa during the space race, Mercury 13 offers a further glimpse into the difficulty women faced in breaking into the field.“I think it’s important to tell people that women were involved in the space program. There’s lots of films about the space program and lots of stories about the space program but they generally focus on men,” said Heather Walsh, who co-directed Mercury 13 with David Sington.“So I think it’s good to draw out these stories and show that women might not have been talked about but they were there, and they did help, and they did do their bit.”The film follows the story of the 13 women and their legal battle before Congress in 1962, arguing that they were prevented from further space testing and training on sexual discrimination grounds.Their case captured the imagination of the American public, but was rejected by President Johnson. It was a missed opportunity. Russia sent the first woman – Valentina Tereshkova – into space in 1963, winning a propaganda battle that the US could have otherwise claimed.Walsh believes there would have been greater implications than just a propaganda victory, had the US backed the Mercury 13 women.“I think everything would have changed. I think there would have been a female president by now,” she said. “Being an astronaut at that time was the pinnacle of what you could do. You know, the whole world was watching. And when you step out on to the moon there wasn’t a person on the planet that didn’t want to see you and didn’t know who you were.“And I think if that person was a woman it would have would have changed things. It would have seemed normal for women to do anything.”Mercury 13 interviews Wally Funk, Rhea Woltman, Sarah Ratley and Gene Nora Jessen, each of the women participated in space-readiness testing conducted by Dr William Randy Lovelace, who had helped develop the physical and psychological examinations used to select the first team of astronauts for the Nasa training program. Named Project Mercury, it was America’s first human spaceflight program, and would see Alan Shepard become the first American in space in 1962.Lovelace was close friends with Jacqueline Cochran, whose pilot skills had propelled her to fame in the 1930s. Cochran had set women’s national speed records and was involved in setting up establishing Women Airforce Service Pilots, who performed non-combat flying missions during the second world war.Cochran and Lovelace felt women had a role to play in space. Outside his contract with Nasa, Lovelace began a private screening program, conducting the same tests he had devised for men on female pilots.Jerrie Cobb, who later became a staunch advocate for female flyers, was the first to undergo space testing, but faced resistance in the media. Mercury 13 shows one clip from a television interview in the early 1960s that particularly illustrates the opposition the women faced. In the interview Cobb is quizzed as to why “there is a need” for women in space.She answered: “Well it’s the same thing as is there a need for men in space. I mean, if we’re going to send a human being into space we should send the one most qualified. And in certain areas women have to offer, in other areas men do. I think we ought to use both.”Sington, who previously directed In the Shadow of the Moon, a documentary about manned US missions to the moon, said he and Walsh had originally hoped to bring Hillary Clinton’s success in the 2016 election into the film.Clinton has often told a story about writing to Nasa as a teenager, asking how she could become an astronaut. She said she received a letter back “saying they weren’t accepting women”, and Sington said contrasting that experience with her subsequent presidency would have provided an uplifting ending.Clearly, that didn’t happen.We’ll never know if Walsh is correct – and if we would have had a female president by now had a woman been the first to walk on the moon. Even if the Mercury 13 had passed the aptitude tests, they might still have been rejected – perhaps Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin would still have proved more able, and the first person on the moon would still have been a man.But as Cobb told her skeptical interviewer in the 1960s: women should have been given the opportunity to try."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/75774357628d4fbb572c121d97fc15057053feb3/435_115_2536_1522/master/2536.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=f4b102515da3112c55b138bf36617213 1240w","title":"bournemouth manchester united premier league match report","story":"Three days before the FA Cup semi-final against Tottenham, and in the aftermath of Sunday’s pathetic defeat by West Brom, a drama-free win is enough for Manchester United. That is what they achieved thanks to goals by Chris Smalling and Romelu Lukaku. The result tightens their hold on second place in the Premier League and raises spirits, at least a little, before they resume their pursuit of the only trophy they can win this season.After offering another reminder of his personal roll of honour – “eight titles in four different countries, including three in this country” – he said: “I know why you win and why you don’t win. No doubt about City’s quality and that in any circumstances they would win this title this season but we could have perfectly, I would say, 10 more points this season.”Mourinho made seven changes to the lineup who were embarrassed by West Brom but perhaps the most intrigue concerned a change the manager did not make: did the inclusion of Paul Pogba, who had been withdrawn before the hour on Sunday, indicate Mourinho wanted to see a performance that would convince him the club’s record signing deserves to start against Spurs?If so, Mourinho got the display he wanted. Pogba did not cast spells but did play very well. He affected the game positively almost every time he got the ball, which was not often enough for him to be described as having dictated play. Mourinho acclaimed a “top performance” from the Frenchman, who crowned his display by teeing up Lukaku for the goal in the 70th minute that made sure of United’s victory.Smalling had given United the lead in a low-key first half by converting from close-range after a sharp move. Ander Herrera, the most influential of United’s trio in midfield, was instrumental, playing a neat pass to Jesse Lingard, whose crisp low cross left Smalling with a straightforward finish.The goal came one minute after Marcus Rashford injected spark into a humdrum game by winning possession off Nathan Aké before firing off a shot that forced a ing save from Asmir Begovic.Rashford was deployed centrally because Lukaku was on the bench. The 20-year-old looked dangerous, combining well with Lingard and Anthony Martial. All three, without quite catching fire, made reasonable claims for starting at Wembley ahead of Alexis Sánchez.Other players were given opportunities to stake claims, too – or perhaps just to add another word to their long goodbyes from United. Luke Shaw did fine at left-back on his first appearance since being hauled off at half-time against Brighton last month. The right-back Matteo Darmian did not disappoint on his first league start since October. Marouane Fellaini, who is expected to leave Old Trafford on the expiry of his contract in the summer, completed the midfield trio adequately on his sixth start of the campaign.United bossed most of the match against hosts minded to make their visit uncomfortable. Josh King did ruffle United just before the break, however, drawing a save from David de Gea with a shot from 20 yards.The visitors started the second period as if ordered to wrap up the win as quickly as possible. Bournemouth resolved to try to fend them off and hope to equalise on the break. They came close to doing so in the 56th minute but Callum Wilson was unable to connect with King’s ball across the six-yard box – the striker claimed that was because Shaw had pulled him back but the referee disagreed. Soon afterwards Smalling was booked for dragging down Wilson near halfway. One minute later Steve Cook received a similar punishment for a far more brutal tackle on Pogba. As tempers and the tempo rose a touch, the game became more open. That displeased Mourinho, who decided it was time to introduce Lukaku in an attempt to finish off Bournemouth.Lukaku soon fulfilled his mission. Racing on to a through-ball from Pogba, he held off Aké and clipped the ball over Begovic into the net from 12 yards.There might have been a late twist if Wilson had been awarded a penalty after going down in the box following a loose tackle by Smalling but the referee did not whistle and the travelling fans kept singing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c7b463b73732a2df2f8e481b8b82cdfc72c38a2/173_48_5059_3036/master/5059.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=39702ee228af240abbbcf3a361c70cf6 1240w","title":"chelsea antonio conte easier to manage small clubs burnley","story":"Antonio Conte believes he has a more difficult job than Sean Dyche and other managers who have smaller transfer budgets and are expected to fight\u0026nbsprelegation.The Premier League table shows minimal difference between Chelsea, in fifth, and Burnley, who lie seventh, but perceptions could hardly be more contrasting. It has been cast as a failure for Conte’s defending champions while Dyche, whose team had been expected to struggle, has led Burnley to challenge for a Europa League place.Conte praised his counterpart before Thursday night’s game at Turf Moor but left little doubt he did not take kindly to their performances being compared directly, making particular reference to a difference in transfer priorities.“He is doing an important job, a great job this season,” Conte said of Dyche. “But if you start the season fighting to avoid the relegation zone it is more simple – also if you have a small budget, because you can count on the team that in the past qualified to play again in the league. It is more difficult when you have to prepare in the transfer market to win something, because only one team wins.”His point was that having finished 16th last season, Burnley could rely on the same core of players to survive again and had little need to seek reinforcements, a longstanding cause of tension between Conte and the Chelsea hierarchy.Asked to elaborate, he suggested it was harder for those looking to avoid the drop – an ambition he gave to half the teams in the Premier League – to fail than those that are expected to win trophies. “You have to avoid the last three places at the bottom, and then you can stay between 10 teams that play only for this target,” he said. “You have to fight only to avoid this.“It is difficult if you have to play to win because only one team wins and if the other doesn’t win you are the first to speak about a failed season. If you don’t win the FA Cup, the league, the Carabao Cup, it’s a failure season and for this reason it’s more difficult to play for this target.”Emerson Palmieri is likely to start in the Premier League for the first time. He will replace Marcos Alonso, who may in any case be starting a three‑match ban for violent conduct if a Football Association charge – brought for a challenge on Southampton’s Shane Long – is upheld."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c628ab9b39352393fdc74d699f55cb71b3405034/0_11_5470_3282/master/5470.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=684fcf1574f29a5c6dadcae955b3ff5c 1240w","title":"premier league fans standing survey","story":"Premier League clubs have been told that a clear majority of fans want the option of being able to stand during a game but only one in 20 wants to stand for the entire match.The research, conducted by the polling firm Populus over the past 16 months, was discussed last week during the Premier League shareholders’ meeting in London.Unlike the English Football League, Premier League clubs have not yet reached a joint position on whether they should back calls for the government to drop the all-seat rule for the top two isions, which has been in place since the 1989 Hillsborough disaster.

What a chance for United to double their lead here.65 min: Martial relieves some pressure with a powerful run. He finds Rashford, whose shot’s deflected wide.64 min: Lewis Cook breaks past a feeble challenge from Herrera and knocks a pass through to Wilson. The striker’s first touch isn’t great, though, and Jones is able to deflect his shot behind. From the resulting corner, the ball drops to King after a header from Ake, but he can’t get his shot away.

I am strongly attracted to a friend with whom I work. We meet up once a year and work together for several weeks across the summer. The rest of the year, I’m in another country.Last summer I told him I was attracted to him, and his reaction was initially one of joy and surprise. Moments later his attitude changed and he started to talk about his “issues”. Over the next few weeks, he distanced himself from me. We did have one good talk, during which he said he was worried about detrimental effects on his mental health if things didn’t work out. I get strong signals that he would be very interested, except for this fear holding him back.Since separating our work has required us to remain in email contact. Besides work emails, I have sent several personal emails in which I have told him in detail about how I feel about him and how much I value and admire him, in the hope that it will give him some reassurance. I’ve not had much response, other than a brief thank you in acknowledgement, to these.I am in a quandary about what to do when we meet up again this summer. I flip between thinking I will keep my distance and let it go, and thinking I will push things a little further. But I am very worried that pushing things further may constitute harassment.You say you get “strong signals that he would be very interested except for this fear holding him back”, but the signals that you’ve described here are, alas, not that. You told your friend that you were attracted to him in person and he told you that he didn’t want to be in a relationship with you. You told him again, over email, how you felt about him, and you’ve “not had much response”.I’m sorry to say that I don’t think that your friend wants to date you. Who knows why not? It may be the “issues” he professes. It may be something else altogether, but the bottom line is that it’s not your job to persuade him otherwise.That’s not to say I don’t understand your desire to encourage him to feel otherwise! You mentioned that his initial reaction to you confessing your feelings was joyful, and it’s natural to wish that you could help him get back to that feeling. But what I learned from my own experience with ambivalent men (and oh my, I have known quite a few ambivalent men) is that the key to a successful relationship is two people wanting to be in a relationship. You can be kind and you can be encouraging, but you can’t make someone want to be with you by persistence and force of will.Will trying again to persuade your friend constitute harassment? I think it could be viewed as unwanted behaviour. Imagine if the gender roles were reversed: in this post-#MeToo world, a man who asks a female colleague out repeatedly after she says no would be seen as a creep. Even if he did not make a formal complaint if you “push things a little further”, your continued pursuit after your friend gave you a pretty clear no may make him uncomfortable, and have a negative effect on your experience working together. That would be a shame, since you clearly care about your friend and your work.Please don’t lose heart, or at least not too much. That you’ve written to ask me this question and that you don’t want to step over the line shows that you are a thoughtful and caring person. I’m certain that you will meet someone who you adore who will adore you back without caveat or condition or hesitation: someone who, like you, is ready, not afraid. I teach English as a foreign language and I’ve always been a bit wary about relationships related to work – both with colleagues and students (adult students, obviously). Although I’m relaxed about being friends with adult students outside of the classroom, I’ve always personally carried the idea that dating students is something that shouldn’t happen.However, I’ve met other teachers who’ve ended up in great romantic relationships with students (often after they’ve stopped being their teacher) and who now have happy marriages. I’m curious to know what you and others think, especially as it could potentially be an issue for me in the future.You gut feeling is correct: you should not date your students, even if they are adult students. The student-teacher relationship is inherently imbalanced in favour of the teacher’s authority, even if the student pursues the teacher, rather than vice versa. (Jo Livingstone wrote very well about this in the New Republic.) Your no dating students rule is right because it respects the reason that your students are spending time with you: to learn. A classroom is not a singles bar. I would also say that if a teacher is standing in front of a classroom of adult ESL students and thinking about which one of them is most attractive, rather than how to help them learn English, the teacher is … not really doing their job?Drawing the line at dating students also eliminates risks: that your relationship with one student might have a negative impact on your other students, your ability to do your job or your employer’s perception of your motivation and performance. These are all things that you’ll put on the line if you date a student, even if the relationship itself is True Love.Once someone is no longer studying under you, I think you can feel free to ask them out – when they’re not your student, but your peer. But maybe wait until they’ve been out of your classroom for a few days before you make your move, lest this give your employers the impression that you’ve been counting the days until the end of term."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f9c67bc391b477148487b8e24af63575492ff087/0_88_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=656175f840b0d7917580260b07abd9fe 1240w","title":"kanye west twitter return philosophy book","story":"The rapper made an unexpected return to the platform, sharing a book involving time and photography and advice for creativesDuring Kanye West’s 11-month absence from the site, Twitter could hardly have been described as boring. Even without the 40-year-old rapper’s daily musings, the Twitterverse remained as addictive and corrosive as ever, thanks in large part to it having become, under the 45th president, a flashpoint for international diplomacy, partisan combat and ruthless trollery. But this past weekend, seemingly out of nowhere, Yeezy returned to the site where he once admitted to getting “emotional over fonts”, declared The Life of Pablo “the album of the life” and wondered about the providence of a water bottle he discovered while on an airplane. Having deleted all those old tweets, West started anew on Sunday with a remarkably on-brand, and predictably existentialist, message. “Some people have to work within the existing consciousness while some people can shift the consciousness,” he wrote, following it up with photos of forthcoming Yeezy footwear and the word “Saint”, West’s son’s name, in various typefaces. Following a 24-hour break, he returned again on Tuesday with a string of aphorisms: “As a creative your ideas are your strongest form of currency,” read one tweet. “Try to avoid any contractual situation where you are held back from your ideas,” he wrote in another, which the MSNBC anchor Chris Hayes called “extremely good advice”. West went on to call distraction “the enemy of vision” and instructed his 7.6 million followers to “make decisions based on love not fear”.All these tweets made more sense once West, in a Hollywood Reporter interview with his interior designer Axel Vervoordt, revealed plans to release a philosophy book called Break the Simulation. “I’ve got this new concept that I’ve been diggin’ into,” he said, describing his Barthesian thesis about photography. “I’ve got a concept about photographs, and I’m on the fence about photographs – about human beings being obsessed with photographs – because it takes you out of the now and transports you into the past or transports you into the future.” Time, West added, “is our most valuable resource”.To his longtime fans, the preoccupation with lofty ideas like time, capitalism and consciousness are just about the least surprising thing about the 21-time Grammy winner’s return to Twitter. He’s always been hip-hop’s pre-eminent and most brazen sage. What may come as a surprise, though, is the fact that West’s latest tweets are the book, as he revealed on Wednesday morning. “Oh by the way this is my book that I’m writing in real time,” West wrote. “No publisher or publicist will tell me what to put where or how many pages to write.”Of course, a tweet-stream-of-consciousness book is not the only thing on West’s plate. The rapper-cum-designer is also reportedly working on his eighth studio album, his first since 2016’s The Life of Pablo, which was dropped during an elaborate listening session at New York’s Madison Square Garden. In a since-deleted tweet from 2016, West said his next album would be called “Turbo Grafx 16”, a title that’s presumably gone through a few iterations since, as West changed the name of his seventh album several times before settling on Pablo. In March, E! News reported that West, along with several of his collaborators, was recording at a studio in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, where “he is in the zone to get things done”. Rumored visitors of West’s, gleaned from Instagram posts and sightings in the Jackson area, reportedly included the Dream, Travis Scott, Kid Cudi and the Chicago rapper King Louie.Nevertheless, exactly when West plans to release new music is unclear. He and his wife, Kim Kardashian, welcomed a third child, Chicago, in January, and he’s also hard at work on the latest collection for his clothing line, Yeezy. But if West’s insightful and reliably zany return to Twitter is any indication, he is not wanting for consciousness-shifting ideas."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a1be1cd6779be74f1c20c13734681e8708ec7ae8/186_2_3024_1814/master/3024.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=c41809e12edf361aebe50118eda3c48c 1240w","title":"jeremy hunt investigated breach money laundering rules luxury flats","story":"Health secretary now under investigation over purchase of luxury apartments on south coastJeremy Hunt received a “bulk discount” on seven flats bought from a Conservative donor, the Guardian can disclose, as parliament’s watchdog opened an investigation into the health secretary’s admission that he breached money laundering rules.The health secretary was forced to apologise for failing to declare his part-ownership of a company, which bought the luxury seaside flats in Southampton.Kathryn Stone, parliament’s commissioner for standards, received a complaint about Hunt on Friday. The commissioner’s website confirms that Hunt is now under investigation.Guardian inquiries established that the 82-flat block, called Alexandra Wharf, was developed by Nicolas James Group, a south coast property firm owned and chaired by businessman and Conservative donor Nicolas James Roach.Neither Hunt nor Roach agreed to disclose the value of the deal but a source close to the health secretary said he had received a “bulk discount” for buying multiple apartments. A spokesperson for Roach said that all sales at Alexandra Wharf were at “open market value”, adding that the businessman’s political donations had been properly declared on the Electoral Commission website.They added that the pair had known each other for “several years” but had no business relationship beyond the purchase of the flats.A spokesperson for Hunt said: “The owner of the development is a long-standing acquaintance. “Jeremy paid standard market rates which would have been available to anyone else making an equivalent purchase. “As Jeremy has been clear from the outset, the rental income from these properties will be donated to charity.”Roach has made more than £50,000 in donations to Hunt’s South West Surrey constituency office since 2011, mostly in the form of complimentary venue hire. The pair were pictured together in 2011 at a party to launch a £60m hotel in Guildford, Surrey, that was developed by Nicolas James Group. Sir Alistair Graham, the former chairman for the committee on standards in public life said: “In terms of public perception of ministerial priorities, Hunt seems more concerned with maximising his personal interests rather than ensuring that there are good public services.“On a local level, there does seem to be an incestuous relationship between a local donor and a local politician in a way which will make the public uneasy.”According to the MPs’ code of conduct, “members shall fulfil conscientiously the requirements of the House in respect of the registration of interests in the Register of Members’ Financial Interests”.When the registration documents were filed in September 2017 only Hunt’s wife was named, constituting a breach of regulations.According to the property giant Savills, each flat in the development is worth between £450,000 and £1m.The spokeswoman blamed Hunt’s accountant for mistakes in the Companies House documents. “These were honest administrative mistakes, which have already been rectified,” she said. “Jeremy’s accountant made an error in the Companies House filing, which was a genuine oversight.“With respect to ministerial and parliamentary declarations, the Cabinet Office are clear that there has been no breach of the ministerial code.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2019fced7d93af14d85ce6216f74d9ada8979306/0_14_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=53318337177f31f19695436b134fdcf6 1240w","title":"ministers to announce brexit climbdown as they face lords defeat","story":"Amendment calling for UK to continue in customs union with EU passed by majority of 123Theresa May was under pressure to reopen the issue of Britain’s membership of a customs union after suffering two big defeats in the House of Lords on the government’s key Brexit bill.Peers backed an amendment to the EU withdrawal bill that would force the government to explain what it has done to pursue remaining in a customs union, by 348 votes to 225 – a convincing majority of 123.The government suffered a significant rebellion on the amendment tabled by crossbench peer Lord Kerr, which received the backing of 24 Conservatives, including former ministers Lord Patten, Lord Heseltine and Lord Willetts. A separate amendment that would limit the power of ministers to slash red tape without the approval of parliament was also passed, by 314 votes to 217.The debate on the government’s key piece of Brexit legislation, in a packed chamber, was watched by the shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer. After the customs union vote, he said: “The passing of this cross-party amendment is an important step forward. Theresa May must now listen to the growing chorus of voices who are urging her to drop her red line on a customs union and rethink her approach.”Explaining why he believed a customs union was so important, Kerr underlined the difficulty of replacing the UK’s trade with the EU with new deals with other countries. “Looking further afield is well worth doing, but it will be very hard not to see a fall in overall exports if our trade with the EU is made more complicated, and it will be much more complicated if we leave the customs union. We must try to limit the damage of our nearest, because closest, market,” he said.The amendment would commit the government to report to parliament “outlining the steps” it had taken to secure “an arrangement which enables the UK to continue participating in a customs union with the European Union”.A spokesperson for the Department for Exiting the European Union (DeExEU) said: “we are disappointed that parliament has voted for this amendment. The fundamental purpose of this bill is to prepare our statute book for exit day, it is not about the terms of our exit. This amendment does not commit the UK to remaining in a customs union with the EU, it requires us to make a statement in parliament explaining the steps we’ve taken.”But opposition peers hope the substantial support for the amendment could strengthen the hand of pro-customs union Conservative MPs, who have said they plan to force the issue in the Commons.Peers will continue debating and amending the bill for another five days, spread out over the next few weeks. It will then be returned to the House of Commons, where MPs will decide whether to accept the changes, or refer them back to peers, in a process known as “ping pong”. The EU withdrawal bill transfers EU law on to the UK statute book in preparation for Brexit – and grants the government sweeping powers to tweak it in the process.Separately, Labour peers hailed concessions from the government over another amendment, on EU rules on clinical trials. Crossbench peer Lord Patel had tabled an amendment that would ensure EU clinical trial regulations, which have not yet come into force, were enacted in UK law. He withdrew it after reassurances from the government minister in the Lords. A spokesman for the DeExEU said the government would be willing to continue accepting changes to the complex bill as it makes its way through parliament.“We have always said we are open to listen to expertise, be it from peers or MPs, and if we think the bill can be improved, we will move to do so. That will be the approach through the whole process.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7cc51799fd20ba033e1f691609cc2a4a5aa02dec/56_409_5347_3208/master/5347.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=cf5b37bb7ac34678541ae47f1c5abb10 1240w","title":"mary keitany paula radcliffe marathon record london","story":"It is a record that has loomed over athletics for 15 years, impervious to challenge. Yet when Mary Keitany starts the London Marathon on Sunday she will be the first runner with a realistic shot at shattering Paula Radcliffe’s world record. And, tantalisingly, she intends to take it.Her pedigree is beyond reproach. The 36-year-old has won in London and New York three times each, and last year ran faster than Radcliffe had ever done in a women’s-only race, scampering away from a stacked field in London after the first mile before finishing in 2hr\u0026nbsp17 min\u0026nbsp01 sec.It was a staggering display of front-running and it led to the second fastest time in history – even though she slowed down significantly after going through halfway in 64min\u0026nbsp55sec because she had to make so much of the pace by herself.This time she will have three male pacemakers around her for the first time, which should enable her to take serious aim at Radcliffe’s overall world record of 2:15.25, which was set with the help of male runners, in 2003.“I have my focus on the world record and hopefully with the help of male pacesetters I will be able to shave a few seconds off the time,” said Keitany, who is 5ft\u0026nbsp1in. “If you compare last year to this year, last year I went almost alone from halfway but now I will have someone with me all the way, so it will help a lot.”The mother of two knows it will not be easy to break such a famous record. “Running 2:15 is not easy, it is something else,” Keitany said. “We are trying to follow in the footsteps of a legend, Paula. But because the London Marathon have decided to put in male pacemakers we have to try to see whether it is possible. We will try our level best to see if we can go under.”Unseasonally high temperatures and thunderstorms may thwart those ambitions but Keitany believes she will be able to handle whatever happens. Her confidence is particularly high after setting a personal best of 1:04:55 in the Ras Al Khaimah half-marathon in February.Keitany may not get things her own way on Sunday. The Chicago marathon champion, Tirunesh Dibaba, who finished second last year, is in much better shape this time. “I have more experience and prepared well for the race,” she said. “I will not sit back, but take the race to Keitany.”Dibaba, who has set three world records on the track and won five Olympic medals, has not ruled out attacking Radcliffe’s record. “Breaking Paula’s record is not an easy thing,” she said. “It’s a very challenging one. So I just can’t say I am going to break it but we will see.”With other talented athletes – including the 2017 Berlin marathon winner Gladys Cherono and the 24-year-old Brigid Kosgei, who ran a personal best of 2:20.22 in Chicago last year – also intending to have their say, London could be set for a battle for the ages.It is also worth noting the race will be started by the pioneering American Kathrine Switzer, who in 1967 challenged the all-male tradition of marathon running when she became the first woman to run the Boston marathon.Dibaba was also asked about comments made by Britain’s Laura Muir, who said last month she would not talk to Dibaba’s younger sister Genzebe because of her association with the controversial coach Jama Aden. “I\u0026nbspdidn’t expect that,” Dibaba said. “It doesn’t bother me. I know my sister and I trust all her training.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7c34991e4cd9f4f17332ff36d37fc9164eb43d2/0_120_3481_2089/master/3481.jpg?w=860\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=a4cdbfd8a0f39fc706af47e4a8d93609 1720w","title":"peter sagan pope cyclist cycling paris roubaix interview","story":"Sagan is the most popular rider in cycling today and, with the murky uncertainty surrounding Chris Froome and Team Sky, his victory felt like a shaft of light which revealed panache and grit. They call Paris-Roubaix the ‘Hell of the North’, because its 29 cobbled sections have a bone-juddering impact on even the toughest and most brilliant riders. It is also the glittering peak among the five monuments which are cycling’s oldest and most prestigious one-day races.This year the severity of the challenge was underlined by the death of the young Belgian cyclist Michael Goolaerts, who suffered a cardiac arrest. For just under six hours Sagan was in a battle and his feat was accentuated by the fact he broke for glory a startling 53km from the finish. The Swiss cyclist Silvan Dillier clung to a narrow lead as they entered the velodrome, but Sagan was imperious in the final 100m.“Twice I didn’t finish Roubaix,” Sagan says, “and in those races I did finish I was in much worse condition than this year. If you’re fighting for first position your emotions are very different. I was not thinking: ‘This is the hell of the north.’ But you realise one, two, three days later how tired you are. Especially the first morning, I was so tired when I woke up from shaking on the cobblestones.”Sagan sinks into the couch in a Maastricht hotel. We’re a week past Paris-Roubaix and it’s the day before he finishes fourth in the Amstel Gold Race – a 261km ride featuring 35 serious climbs – and the toll is obvious. Yet he is much more involved than he had been in a stilted press conference preceding our interview. As the routine questions from the Dutch press corps arrived slowly, Sagan quipped: “Is this a funeral?”Here, in a more relaxed setting, it seems appropriate to consider Sagan’s remarkable rise from obscurity in Slovakia to becoming the world’s premier sprint cyclist and star of the peloton. The 28-year-old, who rides for the German team Bora-Hansgrohe, became the first reigning world champion to win Paris-Roubaix since Bernard Hinault in 1981. This second classic, after Sagan won Flanders in 2016, sits alongside other milestones. Last year only a controversial disqualification, after Mark Cavendish fell heavily in a bunch sprint, ended Sagan’s run of five successive Tour de France points victories in the green jersey. He then won a third consecutive world championship in Norway.After that victory Bradley Wiggins tweeted, of Sagan: “Cycling’s saviour! This man is currently bigger than the sport, look after him. Congrats Peter, a true legend and one of the all-time greats!” This\u0026nbspgushing reaction mirrors the online response whenever Sagan pulls a giddy stunt – as in 2015 when he was John Travolta to his wife Katarina’s Olivia Newton-John and they acted out the fairground scene from Grease.Sagan reaches an audience which might not know the difference between the cobbled hell of Paris‑Roubaix and the hilly agony of Liège-Bastogne-Liège. Yet Sagan can also be crass and, after the 2013 Tour of Flanders, he pinched the behind of a podium girl.It feels apt to linger over Roubaix. Sagan’s instinctive daring meant he accelerated away early from his main rivals and hunted down the breakaway riders. “It wasn’t planned. It just happened. I started to believe this year could be the year so I told Silvan Dillier: ‘We must work together because behind us are strong guys. If you stick with me there’s a chance for you.’”Afterwards, Dillier said evocatively: “Sagan is an angel and a devil in the same person – an angel because he took me with him and a devil because I had to go man‑to‑man with him.”Sagan nods. “A race is a race and at the end you take it.”He pauses when reminded of Goolaerts’ fate. “I didn’t know him personally. But it’s a shame and I’m very sorry. I don’t know exactly what happened but I don’t think we can blame the sport.”His victory was watched by his father and the emotion they shared sparked memories of their humble Slovakian past, in the town of Zilina, a world away from cycling’s heartlands. “My parents met at a restaurant where they worked as waiters,” Sagan explains. “After some time my father opened a small supermarket. It was still one of the bigger ones in our city. Lots of people came to us and we were also selling beer in tanks. But after they opened big supermarkets in Zilina – like Tesco and Carrefour – in two years my parents’ business was gone completely. My father opened a pizzeria next but they had to work very hard.”When I mention seeing people chortling at his internet escapades he smiles. “Oh yeah? That’s a pleasure for me. I’m happy.”There are moments when Sagan reminds me of Zlatan Ibrahimovic. He is capable of outrageous brilliance, amusing arrogance and sly wit – even if Sagan is a much more measured talker. He still once described himself as an artist. Sagan\u0026nbspnods and points to a bland painting behind us.“For me art is not just a picture like this. Art can take many forms – even in sport. Look at motocross where they do triple back-flips in the mud and land without any issues. That’s art because the rider is doing something impossible for other\u0026nbsppeople.”Sagan might be an artist on his bike but does he feel a responsibility to improve cycling’s battered image? “If you ask me how could I help cycling I would say by being myself. I want to make people enjoy life – because so many people have a hard time. Maybe some of the videos are a little ridiculous, like I’m a clown, but it’s fun. The Grease thing with my wife was my idea. I tried to be good.”I am curious to know what Sagan thinks of Froome. Should the four‑times Tour de France winner be\u0026nbspallowed to race while his lawyers try to clear his name after he was found to have twice the permitted amount of Salbutamol at the Vuelta\u0026nbspa\u0026nbspEspaña last year?Sagan starts to answer but his team’s media officer, an otherwise genial man who accompanies him, interrupts. It is team policy not to comment on the affairs of other riders. I try again and ask Sagan directly. “It’s not my responsibility to discuss this,” he replies.What about the grey area of TUEs – therapeutic use exemptions – as Froome insists his doctor advised him to use his inhaler more when his asthma deteriorated? Sagan shrugs. “If somebody’s sick then\u0026nbsp…”It is, however, an important area as Team Sky have been castigated in a parliamentary hearing for their use of TUEs and Wiggins, another British winner of the Tour de France, has been implicated. “I don’t worry about this,” Sagan stonewalls.Some cycling fans are worried about motors being hidden on bikes but, for Sagan: “If somebody has not been proved guilty then what do you\u0026nbspsay?”Sagan is amused when I ask about his infamous bum-pinching moment on the Flanders podium five years ago. “That was young Peter,” he laughs, raising his hands in guilt. “But she reacted really well and thanks to her for understanding. She did not turn it into a serious problem. But it was a difficult time. I thought: ‘What’s going to happen?”Why did he do it? “Maybe it’s my personality. I don’t know. I was happy I came second and I had my friends around the podium. One of them said, spontaneously, ‘Just touch her thigh or ass’, and I said: ‘Yeah!’ I didn’t think about the consequences. But you have to respect people – otherwise it’s anarchy.”Six months ago Sagan became a father. “Marlon is healthy. He’s laughing, he’s a good boy,” he says of his son. “It’s too early to speak about whether there’s been any change in my perspective because he’s still very small.”As his fame grows so Sagan’s world expands and in January he met the pope. “I was very happy to bring my mother to see the pope. It was her present. I also gave the pope his personal bicycle which was specially made for him. It’s not every day you shake hands with the pope.”Sagan is not the saviour of cycling. He is just an ordinary man, with an extraordinary talent, and so he smiles. “I think being the pope is much harder than being a cyclist,” he says. “I’m not the superhero. I’m not saving people’s lives. I’m just a sportsman. It’s something I’m doing for myself and if people enjoy it then I’m happy.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b24968a80aa7afa710b6bd95110517c76e1f70a5/0_55_3000_1799/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=21ea18d8b3cb34066beaec40e476b5fd 1240w","title":"tms talksport radio change cricket england","story":"Stop all the clocks.

Except, of course for the fact it may actually be all right.A quick census of the loudest online voices suggests the general response to this news has been somewhere on the spectrum between regret, dismay and a great swirling fudge of mawkish, cake-fondling, doily-clutching Middle England horror.Understandably so, too. It is a mark of the way Test cricket is cherished in England that the idea of different voices bringing it into your kitchen or down through the headphones in the insomniac hours is like a familial loss. Test Match Special is much-loved. For many people its enforced break during the winter will be an absence that goes beyond sport, a missing beat in the rhythms of the day.And yet there are limits to this. The sense of mild hysteria, the social media suggestion that losing TMS for a few months is “worse than Brexit” seems a little overdone. For a start someone should probably check on Jonathan Agnew, who seems to think his employer being outbid for some broadcast rights is a national disaster on the scale of the death of Princess Diana and that ice skating woman falling over all rolled into one. Imagine Princess Diana falling over in an ice skating race, thereby accidentally derailing Charlotte Dujardin’s quest for dressage gold, while simultaneously being denied the right to broadcast cricket on the BBC. That’s how bad we’re talking.Or at least this appears to be the case judging by Agnew’s funereal tweets on the subject. Not only is the self-righteous tone a provocation to every other working broadcaster involved in covering the sport, it also does a disservice to the genuine depth of feeling around this.There are good reasons why cricket on the BBC is an emotive issue. The corporation played a hand in keeping the sport going when it might have died after the second world war, re-spinning its mass popularity into the fabric of the summer. Plenty of us wouldn’t have known cricket existed but for the BBC – Peter West, Tony Lewis and all that, smiling avuncular men in blazers staring right into the camera on a grey Tuesday morning in the dog days of the summer.Plus on a more basic level Test Match Special does a fine job, credit to some brilliant journalists and producers. Simon Mann, Charles Dagnall, Isa Guha, Daniel Norcross and the rest are all excellent. Vic Marks, also of these pages, offers the kind of voice you do not often hear on any media, determinedly anti-sensational voice, wryly humorous in hectoring times. TalkSport will have a huge job on its hands just trying to meet the same standards of analysis and reporting.It should be said Agnew is also a brilliant broadcaster, and hugely popular too, the best out there at simply pointing himself at his sport and talking, with a wonderfully easy style. But he is also a part of why some may welcome a bit of variation, those moments where the sense of vital work being done, of weepy self-importance slips into something else. Imagine the phrase “Bumptious BBC self-regard” baked in a nuclear reactor until it finally grows arms and legs, escapes, kits itself out in chinos and begins talking in a cosy, righteous tone about delivering a vital national service.There is nothing in the rules that says this is the way cricket must be presented, or that everyone will like it. The endless goodbye to Henry Blofeld, for example, was fair enough but I’ve also heard cricket-loving kids say the Blofeld tone is why lots of other kids their age think cricket is just for posh, entitled people. They cringe at the idea of introducing their football-loving schoolmates to the great summer sport only to find Blofeld on, flapping about cakes and pigeons and dear old things. You what, mate?On the other hand new things can be good. Competition can be good. Giving someone else a go can give everyone a lift. At which point enter, to the sound of Darth Vader’s march, the dreaded TalkSport. The new kid will not be to everyone’s taste at first. It can be blokey and relentless, far more tabloid in style and tone. Not to mention overly obsessed with wood stain and van hire, adverts that will jar with the rhythms at first, although past broadcasts suggests this quickly fades.There are deeper currents too. TalkSport is owned by Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp, which bought the Wireless Group two years ago. Plenty will object to the most ruthless and iconoclastic of media families taking over the presentation of their beloved five-day game. On the other hand the cricket boards of Sri Lanka and West Indies will be grateful for extra funds the BBC would not stretch to.Plus there is plenty of evidence to suggest the product will be decent. Early rumours suggest the excellent Steve Harmison and – yes – even the great David Lloyd may be regulars. Change, different voices, a new audience: these are things cricket has needed for a while. So save the tear-soaked cake crumbs, the sense of bumptious entitlement. You never know, the new world may not be so terrible after all."},{"url":null,"title":"virtual reality by the guardian","story":"Experience a whole new world of Guardian journalism in two simple steps.  1.

Her single-minded determination is a subject that comes up again and again when talking to her close – and very passionate – family and friends about her rollercoaster career.After an injury five years ago, Perri had to learn to walk again and switch disciplines from hurdles to sprinting. And this month, despite doctors and physiotherapists setting her chances of a full recovery at around zero, she’s competing as a member of Team England in the 400m and 4x400m relay at the Gold Coast 2018 Commonwealth Games in Australia.“She wasn’t so focused at first,” says Chris Zah, her trainer for the past 18 years. “When we started working together, I made her do everything from 60m sprinting to cross-county. She hated it, and didn’t see the point. As a kid from east London, she really wasn’t keen on mud.”Perri’s outlook changed in 2007, after coming second in the 400m hurdles at the European Athletics Under-20 Championships.“She grabbed me and said: ‘What are we going to do about this then?’” Chris says. “From then on, we agreed to think outside the box. I’d watch her competitors and say: ‘This girl gets to the first hurdle in 6.2 seconds, so you’ve got to get there in 6.1.’ She’d reply: ‘Just tell me what to do, and I’ll do it.’”This attitude, along with her natural talent, pushed Perri to the world No 2 spot in women’s hurdles. But in 2013, she suffered a torn ligament and cartilage damage in her left knee at the finals of the World Championships in Moscow, leaving her unable to walk. “It’s when you’re at your fastest that your body is most likely to break down, and I’d just won two gold medals,” Perri says. “I tried to stay positive, but I went to some dark places.”Her family, along with Chris, rallied round to encourage Perri not to give up, even on her lowest days. “I used to be so frightened, I could only watch her run by peeping between my fingers,” says Perri’s mum, Norma. “I’d get so nervous – like it was me on that starting line. I’d tell her to run like she could see me at the finish line with my arms open. So when she got injured, it was a terrible time – I can’t put it into words. There were a lot of tears. It’s amazing to think how far she’s come since she was sitting on the sofa with her leg up, recovering.”Norma is speaking from LA, where she’s helping niece Jodie celebrate her 30th birthday. The pair’s enthusiasm for talking about Perri, who they call “the CEO of the family”, sees them scrambling to finish each other’s sentences.“We grew up together, so she’s more like my sister than a cousin,” Jodie says of Perri. “When she got injured I dragged her out to parties on her crutches. I told her it could be worse, that she’d bounce back. Now, she’s better and stronger than ever, and she amazes me every day.”Part of Perri’s fierce determination is a legacy from her father, Patrick, who for 14 years was one of boxer Lennox Lewis’s fitness trainers. “She’s passionate and competitive, and so am I,” Patrick says. “I’ve always been there in the background to guide her if she comes unstuck and asks her dad for help.“If she’s down, I’m a picker-upper, and I was there for her for physio and hospital appointments. It’s taken determination and grit to get past her injury, but having good people around you, that’s what gets you through.”In 2014, during her rehabilitation, Perri met her fiance, Mike Edwards, an entrepreneur and athlete. Welcomed by the family with open arms – “It’s like I’ve gained a brother and Norma has gained a son,” Jodie says – he helped Perri to connect with the world beyond sport during her recovery.“Perri had a strong desire to get back on top, but I wanted to offer her positive distractions and give her a bigger life beyond track and field,” Mike explains. “With my cigar business, I’d developed myself as a person and, in turn, Perri had achieved athletic goals I was trying to achieve myself. We really inspired each other.“After all she’s been through, she’s bulletproof. It’s great that we’ve been able to support each other.” Perri has come a long way – and as always, her family will be right behind her in Australia. “Everything she feels, we feel, so it’s like we’re all running that race with her,” Jodie says. “We lifted her back up as a family – and when she competes at the games, everyone will see what we see.”npower – proud sponsors of Team England and Jerusalem, their official anthem for the 2018 Commonwealth Games.

For there – as medieval maps sometimes warned travelers – “be dragons”.Donald Trump has been lectured repeatedly on this score by various advisers and pundits. Yet word keeps leaking out of the White House that Trump would like nothing more than to fire Robert Mueller. So far, Trump has heeded the warnings. But how much longer, one wonders, can a man who famously bragged that he could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue and get away with it be expected to resist temptation to dismiss the special counsel?Since May 2017, Mueller, dogged as Inspector Javert in Les Misérables, has been investigating assorted misdeeds allegedly committed by Trump and his aides – from “collusion” with Russians meddling in the 2016 presidential election to the payment of large sums of hush money to a porn actor and a former Playboy model. Mueller has already either indicted or wrung guilty pleas from 19 people, including Trump’s former campaign chair. What’s more, it appears that Mueller is following a trail left by former FBI director James Comey, whom Trump did fire last year, on a possible obstruction of justice charge against the president.Clearly, Trump is feeling pinched and would like the cause of his pain to vanish. So let us review the short history of that golden rule everyone keeps warning him about.The investigation into Trump and his team appears to encompass allegations of\u0026nbspcollusion,\u0026nbspobstruction of justice,\u0026nbspabuse of power\u0026nbspand charges specific to\u0026nbspTrump aides and former aides.Any case along these lines against the president would be historic. Both of the presidents to face impeachment proceedings in the past century, Bill Clinton and Richard Nixon, faced obstruction of justice and abuse of power charges.It\u0027s important to note that the work of the\u0026nbspspecial counsel\u0026nbspis secret, and the public has no way of knowing for certain what charges prosecutors may be weighing against the Trump team or,\u0026nbspin what would be an extraordinary development,\u0026nbspagainst the president himself.Mueller\u0026nbspis authorized to investigate any links andor coordination between the Russian government and iniduals associated with the campaign of President Donald Trump and related matters. In other words, potential collusion during the 2016 election.But so-called “collusion” is only part of it. The\u0026nbspspecial counsel\u0026nbsphas the broad authority to build a prosecution wherever the inquiry may lead. The investigation has already resulted in charges against former Trump aides such as tax fraud that do not relate directly to election activity.In the course of the investigation,\u0026nbspTrump\u0027s past business practices\u0026nbsphave also\u0026nbspcome under scrutiny. With his first indictments of people in Trump\u0027s orbit, the special counsel has demonstrated an appetite for the prosecution of\u0026nbspalleged white-collar crimes.\u0026nbspThe president has denied all wrongdoing.On Friday, 19 October 1973, Watergate special prosecutor Archibald Cox issued a subpoena for copies of tape recordings made by Richard Nixon in the Oval Office. With that, Nixon decided he’d had just about enough of Cox, an upright and highly respected attorney and Harvard law professor.The very next day, Nixon ordered his attorney general, Elliot Richardson, who had appointed Cox the previous May, to fire him immediately. Richardson refused and resigned. His successor in the justice department’s chain of command, the deputy attorney general, William Ruckelshaus, likewise refused and resigned. Next up was the solicitor general (and acting attorney general), Robert Bork, who obeyed the president’s order, fired Cox and kept his job. The White House announced the firing – soon dubbed “the Saturday Night Massacre” – at 8.35pm that same night.As a member of Time magazine’s Watergate reporting team, I well remember that night 45 years ago. Normally, by 8.30pm on a Saturday night, the magazine was entering the final stages of its weekly production cycle. But on this Saturday night, Time’s Washington bureau was in all-out crisis mode – correspondents, including me, were frantically phoning sources in Congress, in the White House, in the justice department, at the FBI and anywhere else imaginable, trying to learn what precisely had happened and why and what the ramifications were. Until the previous December, I had been on a three-year assignment, covering the Vietnam war. So I was not unfamiliar with what it felt like to report under pressure. But this situation was something completely new to me. We all understood that a political volcano had just erupted, and I think many of us sensed that the US was on the brink of being changed forever. Not since the civil war had an American president seemed so close to impeachment and never before had the list of impeachable “high crimes and misdemeanors” against a sitting president been so lengthy. The words “constitutional crisis” were on just about everyone’s lips as the full impact of the Cox firing began to be felt during those hectic hours of crash reporting, writing and filing by telex and phone that were necessary in order for us to get the news into the magazine that would be in mailboxes and on the stands 48 to 72 hours later.Soon, Congress also swung into action. At least 22 impeachment resolutions were quickly introduced in the House, along with 12 bills and resolutions, sponsored by 94 Democrats and four Republicans, calling for the appointment of a new special prosecutor. So ferocious was the public and official outcry that within 12 days, a new special prosecutor, Leon Jaworski, was indeed appointed, and would win access to the Nixon tapes before the supreme court. In the meantime, the Senate select committee on Watergate continued its televised hearings, uncovering layer on layer of criminal and unconstitutional behavior.Eventually, the tapes obtained by Jaworski provided the “smoking gun” of Nixon’s involvement in the Watergate cover-up, which in turn led the House judiciary committee to approve three articles of impeachment on bipartisan votes, and forced Nixon’s resignation in disgrace less than a year after the Saturday Night Massacre.As for me, I knew Nixon was doomed politically when, just a week after the massacre, I received a letter from Irene Cloud, my aunt who lived in the tiny town of Kingman, Kansas, some 50 miles or so west of Wichita. Cloud was a dedicated Lincoln Republican in the moderate, anti-slavery Kansas tradition that had existed from the civil war to the 21st century, when the far right captured the state house. An unmarried grammar school teacher, Cloud wrote me rarely but always to a purpose. When I opened the envelope, I found inside a light blue sheet of note paper on which in her perfect, schoolmarm’s hand, she had written “Dear Stanley, I have reached the conclusion that Mr Nixon is a bad man …”If Nixon had lost my Aunt Irene, he had lost the nation.Not everyone today believes that Donald Trump will necessarily suffer the same fate as Nixon should he fire Robert Mueller. At least two good friends of mine who are experts in measuring public opinion – and who are not themselves conservatives – told me recently that they believe Trump’s “base” in the Republican party will stick with him in a way that Nixon’s base, including my Aunt Irene, did not. “They would think firing Mueller was just another example of Trump bringing Washington to heel,” said one.Perhaps so. But there are still dragons out there.Stanley Cloud was part of Time magazine’s Watergate team, and went on to become Time’s Washington DC bureau chief"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de03e30848280398bb5db0a62a717679b709f0b5/0_184_4356_2614/master/4356.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=1f4d0464fe2fa8ca33b7cee30e84d40b 1240w","title":"us syria arab force replace american troops saudi arabia egypt uae","story":"Saudis confirm government is talking to Washington about raising such a force but plan faces obstacles and could worsen Syrian conflictThe Trump administration is renewing an effort to replace US troops in Syria with an Arab force, but the proposal faces substantial obstacles and could potentially exacerbate the conflict.The Saudi foreign minister, Adel al-Jubeir, said his government was talking to Washington about raising such a force, confirming a report in the Wall Street Journal that said the new US national security adviser, John Bolton, had called the Egyptian intelligence chief, Abbas Kamel, to ask Cairo to play a part in building one.There are about 2,000 US troops in Syria fighting Islamic State, but Donald Trump has repeatedly expressed a desire to withdraw them.The idea of an Arab coalition force playing a role in Syria to combat extremist groups and contain Iranian influence has surfaced several times since 2015, but faces severe problems. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are bogged down in a brutal war in Yemen, and have little manpower and few military resources to spare. They are also locked in a dispute with Qatar, another potential contributor to a force, while Egypt is much closer to the regime of Bashar al-Assad in Syria than its would-be Gulf partners. Middle East experts said it was feasible Arab states could fund an army run by private contractors and possibly help recruit soldiers from developing countries such as Sudan. Erik Prince, a Trump ally who founded the military contractor Blackwater USA and now advises the UAE, is lobbying to play a role, according to the Wall Street Journal. A similar offer he made last year to replace US troops with private contractors in Afghanistan was turned down by the Pentagon.But Prince may have more traction in the White House over Syria. Bolton has argued that the US has taken too much of the military burden in Syria and Arab states should supply troops and material assistance in the fight against Isis.Meanwhile, the Saudi monarchy and its regional allies are uneasy that events on the ground in Syria are being dictated by external powers, none of which are Arab.Emile Hokayem, the senior fellow for Middle East security at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said: “The idea of an Arab expeditionary force emerges every couple of years, and it’s always seen as a politically brilliant idea to create a sense of ownership in the region.“In reality, the politics of putting a force like that together are almost impossible.“The question is: have the Saudis consulted the other countries before speaking on their behalf? The Saudis thought Egypt and Pakistan would come to help Yemen and they didn’t.”The Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, has launched an Islamic military counter-terrorism coalition, which held its first high-level meeting last year, but it has not appeared to be intended for combat.Charles Lister, the director of the extremism and counter-terrorism programme at the Middle East Institute (MEI), attended the inaugural conference and said the force was intended for training and assistance programmes, rather than combat operations.Lister said there was “no precedent” for an Arab expeditionary force in Syria. Any Saudi troops deployed to Syria would find themselves directly confronting Iranian fighters and their allies, which could prompt a dangerous escalation in the conflict. Randa Slim, who directs the back-channel Track II diplomacy programme at MEI said: “It is one thing for the Saudis to pay for other ‘Islamic forces’ to do the job, and a totally different thing to send their men to a conflict theatre where they are bound to enter into direct confrontation with an entrenched Iranian-Hezbollah force.“The other factor to consider is: what is Turkey’s response to this proposal? I do not see Ankara welcoming the positions of Egyptian andor Emirati forces on its border,” Slim said. The Obama administration also looked at the possibility of Arab allies deploying counter-terrorist forces against Isis in Syria, but Saudi Arabia and the UAE were drawn into the battle for Yemen against Iranian-backed Houthi rebels.Nicholas Heras, a fellow at the Center for a New American Security, said: “They preferred to send intelligence officers and money, rather than put troops on the ground.“But for the Saudis, the trouble is their territory is being breached by Houthis every day. It doesn’t make sense for them to shift their ground forces when they have trouble securing their own border.”Heras said it was more likely Saudi Arabia would seek to outsource recruitment to countries such as Pakistan and Sudan. “I’m sure the Saudis are up for fighting in Syria to the very last Sudanese soldier,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bd673b1b51c09e2540fe115527a06191bd63bea3/0_27_1428_857/master/1428.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=75fa8643351789ab5c1f2d04c5fb0ea2 1240w","title":"raul castro cuba step down leader miguel diaz canel","story":"Cubans view shift with indifference, not hope, as current vice-president Miguel Díaz-Canel is expected to replace Raúl CastroWhen Cuba’s president stands down this week, it will mark the first time in nearly six decades that the island will be led by somebody whose last name is not Castro.On Wednesday, the country’s national assembly selected the current vice-president, Miguel Díaz-Canel, as the sole candidate to replace Raúl Castro, in a nomination likely to be backed unanimously and officially announced on Thursday. The handover will mark the end of an era: Cuba without the Castros has been the holy grail for Florida-based Cuban exiles – and a policy vigorously pursued by a dozen successive US presidents. But on the streets of Havana, indifference – not hope – is in the air.No posters or billboards referring to the changeover are to be seen, the identity of the new leader is hardly a topic of conversation, and nobody doubts that the existing political system will remain intact. As the Cuban saying goes: nobody can fix it, but nobody can knock it down.“A new president isn’t going to change anything so it’s not important for me,” shrugged María Victoria Esteves, 27, on her way to buy bread. “I think everything’s going to stay the same.”Yadiel Sintra, 30, a builder working in Cuba’s private sector, said he wasn’t even aware the country was about to get a new president. “I’ve just found out talking to you!” he said.Díaz-Canel is widely expected to represent continuity, and few Cubans expect any dramatic shift, said Rafael Hernández, a political analyst and member of the Communist party.  There are no direct presidential elections in Cuba. When legislators for the National Assembly were elected this March, 605 candidates stood unopposed. Every one was elected.“If a new president were to represent a fundamental change in people’s lives, Cubans would be very focused on this,” he said. “But the fact is they don’t see it like this.”Though relieved of the presidency, Castro, 86, will remain a political presence, staying on as first secretary of the Communist party until 2021.“The new president will have more power in the day-to-day,” said Hal Klepak, author of a biography of Raúl Castro. “But whenever there are crises or major problems with the US, foreign policy, or the economy, Raúl’s word will remain the last word.”Díaz-Canel, a cautious reformist hand-picked by Raúl Castro, will be expected to walk the tightrope of implementing more market-oriented reforms without sacrificing Cuba’s social policies.Health and education remain free at the point of use in Cuba. The country has the most doctors per capita of any country in the Americas, and life expectancy is 79. And while Cubans on state salaries feel the pinch when buying meat and vegetables, essential foodstuffs are guaranteed by the state.Human rights groups say that the government continues to punish dissent and public criticism. The number of long-term political prisoners in Cuba dropped significantly under Raúl Castro, as the government shifted from long-term incarceration to short-term arrest and release, which typically lasts hours. But the Cuban Commission for Human Rights and National Reconciliation say that last year more than 5,000 people were arrested for political reasons. Although he has been in government for over a decade, Díaz-Canel’s politics are unknown to most Cubans. His relative obscurity reflects the top-down way public affairs are practised on an island where there is only one legal political party, and where political campaigning is prohibited by law.A former minister of higher education, Díaz-Canel has been criticised for coming across as stiff in his occasional media appearances, but his image is radically different from the late Fidel Castro and his brother Raúl. As the first secretary of the provincial Communist party in Villa Clara province in the 1990s he was known for his long hair, riding his bicycle and walking around in Bermuda shorts. He was a strong advocate for LGBT rights at a time when homosexuality was frowned upon in the province and by many in the party.Crucially, he was born after the Cuban revolution. If elected, Díaz-Canel will also be the first non-soldier in charge of the nation since 1959.“Accusations that Cuba is a military dictatorship have cut deep,” said Klepak. “It’s useful to have somebody who has come up through the system and didn’t arrive there through the use of arms.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b7a8d18d50465429559737ea9344aab8b9f29406/0_75_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=102a8e98f28b2d210fca2100238f0525 1240w","title":"royal canadian mint sues australia possum magic coins","story":"The Canadian mint alleges the Australians used a patented printing method to create Possum Magic book and Remembrance Day coins The Royal Canadian Mint has demanded that its Australian counterpart destroy a set of coloured coins celebrating the popular children’s book Possum Magic amid a legal battle over rights to the process used to create them. A lawsuit filed in December in Australia’s federal court alleges that the Royal Australian Mint had – without permission – used a patented method of printing colour on metal to print 500,000 commemorative Remembrance Day $2 coins featuring a red poppy.The Canadians said they had flagged the patent issue two years earlier, only to have their concerns met with an assertion that the method being used in Australia was “sufficiently different to have not infringed” the patent. The lawsuit launched by the Canadian crown corporation also seeks to force Australian mint – which is part of the Australian government – to surrender any profits and pay damages. Recently, the Canadian mint expanded its lawsuit to include several other $2 coins, including a 2017 release featuring designs from Possum Magic and Olympic-themed coins. While the coins in question include 12 colourful designs printed on an estimated 15m coins, the Canadian mint said it is not seeking the destruction of any coins already in circulation.Their demands have been countered with another lawsuit – this week the Australian government filed a counter claim asking that the Canadian patent be declared invalid on the grounds that it is not enough of a “novelty” over what has been done previously.The duelling mints are also business rivals who rely on developing new technologies in order to secure contracts around the world. In recent years, the Canadians’ list of clients has ranged from Indonesia to the United Arab Emirates.The Royal Canadian Mint has said that its lawsuit is aimed at protecting what sets it apart on the global market. “As a crown corporation mandated to operate in anticipation of profit, our technologies are vital to maintaining our competitive standing, and the mint undertakes all steps necessary to protect its intellectual property rights,” a spokesperson told the National Post earlier this year.

A retired nurse who gave the woman CPR for 20 minutes as the jet descended rapidly, with passengers screaming behind emergency oxygen masks, said afterwards: “There were a lot of really heroic and thoughtful things that went on during the flight. I was very proud of everyone involved.”The pilot, Tammie Jo Shults, a former fighter jet pilot in the US navy, was described as displaying “nerves of steel” as she brought the aircraft in to land in Philadelphia. A preliminary examination of the jet engine that broke up and threw debris into the fuselage, breaking a window, showed evidence of “metal fatigue”, according to the National Transportation Safety Board. On Tuesday afternoon, a huge bang rocked the flight en route from New York to Dallas. Moments later, as the aircraft ed and shook vigorously, metal that had sheared off was flung clear of the engine casing, which is supposed to contain debris in such a situation, and broke the window.Jennifer Riordan, a New Mexico bank executive and mother of two, was sucked out as far as the waist as the cabin rapidly depressurised, passengers later reported. Several men grabbed hold of Riordan and managed to bring her back into the plane, but she was gravely injured and witnesses recalled the men’s hands being covered in her blood. Peggy Phillips, a retired registered nurse, told a local ABC news station she heard “a big whoosh of air”. Then she responded to a call for someone who could perform resuscitation.  “If you can possibly imagine going through the window of an airplane at about 600mph and hitting either the fuselage or the wing with your body, with your face, then I think I can probably tell you there was significant trauma,” Phillips said of Riordan. Passengers laid Riordan in the aisle and Phillips continued to perform CPR even as the plane descended fast and came in for a hard landing. Some passengers reported thinking they were going to die and many texted goodbyes to relatives and friends.“I thought, OK, this might be it,” said Phillips. After landing, Shults, the captain, walked through the cabin and thanked all the passengers, asking them if they were all right. “She has nerves of steel. That lady, I applaud her,” said Alfred Tumlinson, a passenger from Corpus Christi, Texas. “I’m going to send her a Christmas card … she was awesome. Unknown to the passengers at the time, Shults had remained absolutely calm as she attempted to save the jet, as revealed by her communications with air traffic control (ATC), captured in a recording. “Southwest 1380 has an engine fire. Descending,” she tells ATC in a monotone. “You are descending right now?” an incredulous voice on the other end says. A voice asks her where she would like to land. With just the faintest hint of exasperation, Shults replies: “Give us the closest … we are looking at Philly.” The communications continue calmly, as the captain tells ATC she has injured passengers and relays from her cabin crew: “They said there is a hole and someone went out.” After landing, Shults tells the ATC personnel: “Thanks, guys, for the help.” Diana McBride Self, a passenger, thanked Shults on Facebook for her “guidance and bravery in a traumatic situation”. “This is a true American Hero,” McBride wrote. Others on social media agreed and compared Shults with Captain Chesley “Sully” Sullenberger, who guided his US Airways plane to safety in New York’s Hudson river in 2009 after birds flew into the engines after take off. When contacted by the Washington Post, Shults declined to be interviewed. But family told how she had battled from the late 70s onward, against almost blanket refusal from the military, to become a fighter pilot, eventually succeeding. She was among the first female fighter pilots for the US navy, according to her alma mater, MidAmerica Nazarene University, from which she graduated in 1983, and among the first women to fly an FA-18 Hornet for the navy. Her mother-in-law, Virginia Shults, said that as soon as she heard the pilot’s voice on the radio transmission online, she said, “That is Tammie Jo.” “It was just as if she and I were sitting here talking,” Virginia Shults told the Washington Post. “She’s a very calming person.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/20e46ed80782a93f5edf3dd424b92fb4276bbe57/963_31_3540_2125/master/3540.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=d45a9e9e9912108c2acb2b0688339250 1240w","title":"spanish minister contradicted claim that catalans misused funds says judge","story":"Finance minister asked to explain why he said no public money had been spent on referendumThe Spanish supreme court judge investigating the Catalan independence referendum has asked Spain’s finance minister to explain why he claimed that no public money was used to stage the vote, saying the assertion contradicts one of the key allegations facing the former regional president and other members of his sacked government.Carles Puigdemont and several of his former ministers are currently under investigation over allegations of misuse of public funds, rebellion and sedition relating to their roles in last October’s illegal vote on splitting from Spain.However, in an interview published on Monday, the finance minister, Cristóbal Montoro, told the Spanish newspaper El Mundo that while he did not know where the funds for the vote had come from, “I do know it wasn’t public money”.The claim prompted a ruling from the judge, Pablo Llarena, two days later ordering Montoro “to provide, as soon as possible, the specific objective basis for those assertions”.Llarena also noted that several of those under investigation had seized on the minister’s statement as proof that the misuse of public funds allegations were unfounded.“Some of those under investigation,” he wrote on Wednesday, “have based their arguments on statements from the finance minister in which he allegedly expresses the certainty that no public money was spent on the vote held in Catalonia on 1 October 2017.”The judge also said such statements “contradicted evidence sources gathered during this investigation”.Puigdemont, who fled to Belgium following the referendum and the subsequent unilateral independence declaration, is currently in Germany facing extradition to Spain under an international arrest warrant.Two weeks ago, a court in Schleswig-Holstein rejected the extradition request over the rebellion allegations but said Puigdemont could be extradited over possible misuse of public funds.On Tuesday, the Spanish supreme court hit out at the German court, accusing it of “a lack of rigour” in its handling of the rebellion allegations.The legal investigations come as Catalan MPs struggle to form a new government after last December’s elections, which saw the pro-independence parties retain their parliamentary majority. Efforts to reappoint Puigdemont have come to nothing, while attempts to invest two other jailed Catalan leaders have been headed off by the Spanish courts.If a new government is not in place by 22 May, the region will return to the polls in July.On Wednesday, the speaker of the Catalan parliament said a new election was “not at all in the interest of Catalonia” and accused the Spanish authorities of thwarting the political process.“It is the Spanish government and the institutions of the state, and in particular the courts, that are blocking the swearing-in from happening.”Catalonia has been under the control of the Spanish government since the end of October, when the prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, used the constitution to sack Puigdemont’s government and call elections."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a7c8c49603e451ff4549845248130136c03d3b8d/0_0_2726_1635/master/2726.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=ce066730c9982b5fe57ca8a62c8d3221 1240w","title":"turkey to hold snap elections on 24 june says erdogan","story":"Turkish president says country urgently needs to make switch to an executive presidencyTurkey has brought forward elections that could pave the way for a single-party state with few checks on the power of the president to 24 June, a year and a half ahead of schedule.Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, announced the new date after meeting Devlet Bahçeli, his ally and head of the nationalist bloc in parliament, who had called on Tuesday for early presidential and parliamentary elections.“We have decided that elections should be held on 24 June 2018,” Erdoğan said at the presidential palace. “Our preference has been to try to hold out till the date in November 2019. However, whether it be the cross-border operation in Syria, or the historic developments in Iraq and Syria have made it so that it is paramount for Turkey to overcome uncertainty.”The winner will assume the presidency of the Turkish republic with broad powers that were approved after a constitutional referendum last year. The elections are likely to take place under a state of emergency that has been in place since a coup attempt in July 2016.Before Wednesday Erdoğan had repeatedly pledged to hold the elections in 2019 as originally planned, but fears of an economic downturn had recently rekindled speculation that he might change his mind. Bahçeli’s proposal and its quick acceptance by the president was a stunning turnaround that will leave just two months before elections that will transform the political scene in Turkey, sealing its evolution from a parliamentary democracy into an executive presidency with sweeping powers.Turkey held a referendum on presidential powers in April last year. Narrowly approved by voters, the constitutional amendments abolished the office of prime minister and allowed the president to be a member of a political party, appoint unelected vice-presidents, and have a greater say in appointing judges to the highest judicial board in the country, as well as issuing decrees with the force of law.On 16 April 2017 Turkish voters narrowly approved a package of constitutional amendments granting President Erdoğan sweeping new powers.The amendments will transform the country from a parliamentary democracy into a presidential system – arguably the most significant political development since the Turkish republic was declared in 1923.Under the new system - which is not due to take affect until after elections in June – Erdoğan will be able to stand in two more election cycles, meaning he could govern as a powerful head of state until 2029.\u0026nbspThe new laws will notionally allow Erdoğan to hire and fire judges and prosecutors, appoint a cabinet, abolish the post of prime minister, limit parliament’s role to amend legislation and much more.The president\u0027s supporters say the new system will make Turkey safer and stronger. Opponents fear it will usher in an era of authoritarian one-man rule.\u0026nbspThe government, led by Erdoğan’s Justice and Development party (AKP), has launched a wide-ranging crackdown on dissidents in the aftermath of the coup, which is widely believed to have been carried out by followers of Fethullah Gülen, an exiled preacher based in Pennsylvania.The crackdown has gone beyond the Gülenists to encompass opposition MPs, academics and the media, with dissident journalists imprisoned or facing prosecution for allegedly abetting terrorist groups. Turkey this year was the world’s biggest jailer of journalists, ahead of China and Egypt. “I think 24 June is going to be a historic day in Turkey,” said Soner Çağaptay, director of the Turkish programme at the Washington Institute and author of a biography of Erdoğan. “It is when the office of prime minister will cease to exist, when the president will be able to rule by decree and the executive presidency will fully form. We will be switching from one Turkey to another, and it will be a dramatic day.” Bahçeli, whose Nationalist Movement party (MHP) entered into a formal electoral alliance with the AKP, had called on Tuesday for elections to be held in August.. Erdoğan said Turkey’s ongoing campaigns in Syria and Iraq, where it has intervened to fight Islamic State militants and Kurdish paramilitaries, as well as the need to more rapidly implement the new presidential system, made it necessary to hold early elections. Turkish-backed rebels in Syria recently achieved victory in a campaign to conquer the Kurdish enclave of Afrin near the border, a military operation that was widely popular in Turkey. But experts and observers say the early elections are meant to get ahead of the effects of economic troubles. An ongoing steep fall in the value of the Turkish lira, coupled with warnings of an overheating economy and a widening current account deficit, threaten the popularity of the AKP, which has often banked on a healthy and growing economy as a key element of its popular strength. The party is also likely to capitalise on nationalist sentiment, which is on the rise after the Afrin operation. Early elections may also leave Erdoğan with a limited field of competitors. The main secularist opposition bloc, the Republican People’s party (CHP), has failed to win successive elections for 16 years and struggles to field credible presidential candidates. Selahattin Demirtaş, the charismatic leader of the pro-Kurdish People’s Democratic party (HDP) has been in prison for over a year and his party has been decimated by arrests of mayors, cadres and MPs, with lawsuits stripping the latter of their immunity. Meral Akşener, a popular nationalist leader who defected from Bahçeli’s party last year to set up her own, may face procedural hurdles for her party to run in the elections because of a rule that requires political parties to hold a general congress at least six months before the polls. She was billed as a credible opponent to Erdoğan due to her nationalist credentials and the fact that she is a practicing Muslim with secular views on government, and her ability to target both centrist voters and others from the president’s base. Akşener may still be able to run for the presidency even if her party does not qualify to run for parliament.

Karan Bilimoria, the British Indian entrepreneur and life peer, insisted Modi’s priority was a free trade deal with the EU.Britain is nevertheless lavishing diplomatic attention over Narendra Modi, the Indian prime minister, thanking him for breaking a decade of Indian indifference to the Commonwealth by personally attending the Commonwealth summit and so giving the post-colonial assembly greater relevance.Modi did not attend the Commonwealth summit in Malta two years ago, and his predecessor, Manmohan Singh, missed the 2011 summit in Australia and its successor in Sri Lanka in 2013.But Modi, who was personally courted by both Prince Charles and Theresa May to attend the talks, regards the Commonwealth as a useful multilateral forum from which China, India’s great rival, is absent. He is also looking for allies in any trade war with the US.In common with most Commonwealth leaders, Modi also sees the visit as a chance to woo the City of London and court foreign direct investment. The Indian prime minister has been rewarded for his commitment to the Commonwealth with Wednesday’s lengthy bilateral meeting with May, an audience with the Queen, a visit with Prince Charles to the Science Museum and a commitment that British intelligence will help fight Pakistan-based militant groups.In a further sign of British respect, Modi’s plane from Sweden was greeted at Heathrow by the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson. Modi’s aides also claimed he was travelling in a limousine when many other heads of state were due to travel to a Windsor retreat in a bus.At a packed town-hall-style meeting in Central Hall Westminster, Modi spoke of his rise from tea seller to visitor to a royal palace, and said the days of incremental change in India were over. Throughout the day he was also pursued by hundreds of demonstrators protesting gainst his attitude to Kashmir, Hindu nationalism and the failure to act against horrific instances of sexual violence against women, including the rape of an eight-year-old Muslim girl.British ministers say a free trade deal with India is a priority after Brexit, but the joint Indian-UK statement issued after the bilateral meeting acknowledges that the UK cannot sign any new deal until the Brexit transition period ends. The EU is also locked in talks with India over a free trade deal, a subject Modi will raise with the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, in a stopover before he returns to India from London.After Brexit the UK will initially simply seek to replicate the EU-Indian free trade deal, but any bespoke agreement will be hard to negotiate since India will be looking for concessions on visa travel from India to the UK.The lengthy bilateral deal signed by the two countries covers cyberspace, technology sharing, solar energy, sustainable urban development, water management, animal husbandry, safe use of nuclear energy, artificial intelligence and big-data analytics.The joint agreement said a “secure, free, open, inclusive and prosperous Indo-Pacific” was in the interests of India, the UK and the international community, adding: “The UK and India will also work together to tackle threats such as piracy, protect freedom of navigation and open access, and improve maritime domain awareness in the region.”India regards the statement as significant given Beijing’s tough approach to disputes to the South China Sea and attempts to increase its footprint in the Indo-Pacific region."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c31c2ed28ea024346811adb5468369249c9f6a40/0_0_3702_2490/master/3702.jpg?w=720\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=2ca10c14700bc6b4d5d3af7410ce4477 1440w","title":"how to buy your first house","story":"Many of us aim to own our own home. But with buoyant house prices and stagnant wages, what are the steps to getting on the property ladder?If you’re dreaming of buying your first home, it’s not surprising. It will mean the freedom to put your stamp on a place that’s truly yours, but some say you’ll also save money. According to research published by the Bank of Scotland in February 2018, buying a home is cheaper in terms of monthly costs than renting, and saves first-time buyers between £590 and £2,190 a year around the UK, on average, depending on area. So how can you join them?How much you can potentially borrow will also have a bearing on how much you need to save. “As a very general rule of thumb, you’ll usually be able to borrow around four times your salary, which, if you earn £30,000, means a potential mortgage of £120,000,” says Wallis. “The difference between your borrowing power and what you have to pay for a property is the minimum you should save.”In addition, Audhlam-Gardiner suggests that a Lifetime Isa is more flexible in terms of the type of house you can buy: if outside London, the most you can pay for a property with a Lifetime Isa is £450,000, rather than £250,000 with a help-to-buy Isa (for Londoners the limit is the same as for a Lifetime Isa). Plus, with the help-to-buy Isa, the government bonus can only be used on completion, whereas it can be used towards a deposit or split up across the process with a Lifetime Isa. Finding the right first home for your savings is just half the battle. “First-time buyers can take years to save for a deposit for their dream home,” says Lisa Hardstaff of credit reference agency, Equifax. “But a lack of understanding about the mortgage application process – including how credit information is used – could push their dream back even further.” About half of first-time buyers take between one and five years to save a deposit, says Hardstaff. “It is worth using this time to get your credit report in good shape.” David Hollingworth, from mortgage broker London \u0026amp Country Mortgages, agrees: “Ensuring that you are on the electoral roll where you live is a simple thing to do but could make a big difference. Having one or two well-managed credit cards can help, while having none could go against you. Regular use of payday loans could result in a straight decline from a lender.” "},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Drivers accept process which allows operation of 10-minute Dart serviceFormer EC secretary general Catherine Day says EU will continue to enlargeMinister faces questions in D\u0026aacuteil over information he provided about INM acquisitionGarda\u0026iacute are investigating incident on the N11 at the junction with Greenfield ParkSF leader says it was not appropriate for Naughten to relay his opinion to \u0026Oacute NeachtainLabour\u0026rsquos Brendan Howlin says Ireland \u0026lsquoalmost unique\u0026rsquo in not having such a bodyUHW is only designated emergency cardiac centre not offering 247 cover \u0026ndash lobby groupSenator Frances Black witnesses old people crying in pain and for their loved onesPOA wants action on assaults by prisoners, not \u0026lsquohugging philosophy\u0026rsquo from managersAlmost 1,000-strong club to inform Ulster Rugby of dismay at Jackson and Olding sackingsSave the 8th tells \u0026lsquoIrish Times\u0026rsquo podcast most voters unaware of Yes vote implicationsRoad \u0026lsquoreservation corridor\u0026rsquo required in new Poolbeg development zoneMounting insurance costs could close pre-schools and playgrounds, TDs hearIranian national, living in Ireland more than 25 years, not told basis of \u0026lsquosecurity\u0026rsquo decisionDoctors in Ireland have told Aaron McMahon there is nothing more they can do for himChristina Joyce makes no application for bail after hit and run at Dublin checkpoint\u0026lsquoMy life has changed completely,\u0026rsquo she tells High CourtFianna F\u0026aacuteil says school-building programme is \u0026lsquonot keeping up with demand\u0026rsquoThank you for signing up.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3466275.1524084930!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"eu might integrate more smoothly once permanently reluctant uk leaves","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tWill the EU Survive Brexit?: former European Commission secretary general Catherine Day gave the Barrett Family Lecture at Newman University Church. Photograph: Nick BradshawThe European Union might integrate more smoothly after Brexit, once it no longer has a “permanently reluctant member in the room”, the former European Commission secretary general Catherine Day has said.Speaking at Newman University Church in Dublin, where she gave the Barrett Family Lecture 2018, Ms Day said that she saw “no room to hope” the UK would change its mind about leaving the European Union. But she also said that she saw no “domino effect” and that Europe would continue to enlarge, taking in countries in the Balkans “one or two at a time”.In the absence of the UK, she predicted in Will the EU Survive Brexit?, the “euro and Europe” would become synonymous, with smaller states that had resisted the single currency now being “pushed” into joining it. She also said that security and defence were “an area where Europe would have to step up to the plate”. Although most states would remain in Nato, “economies of scale” in European defence forces could deliver similar “boots and helicopters”.Ms Day told the audience, many of whom were students of the Nanovic Institute for European Studies at the University of Notre Dame, the steward of the church, that Brexit could ultimately be good for relations between Britain and Ireland, as Britain seeks an external relationship with the EU. “It is just that we need a bit more enlightenment in certain parts of London for that to happen.”She said in many ways the EU had not played fair with Turkey, keeping it “dangling” for 40 years. But she added that there were many things to consider, including that Turkey would become the unions’s largest member state on entry and that some countries would raise the issue of Christian and Muslim differences. Of the future of the EU, she said, “It may not last 1,000 years, but it will be here for a long time to come.”Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orceThank you for signing up.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3465450.1524036022!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"there s a hole and someone went out southwest pilot tells air traffic control","story":"  April 18, 2018Plane violently depressurized after fragments from the explosion burst through window Invalid email or password."},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/04/12/TELEMMGLPICT000002395664_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq6L3Bx11x18zbsv4k04trOP3QFo7fDZgyggOOCRYToPs.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"cant think rationallywithout emotions feature not bug","story":"Future AIs might be susceptible to something like depressionDoes intelligence have to be conscious?

They were sitting on a powder keg in the last quarter of the 19th century. What was happening in football was also happening in society,” Fellowes said of the era’s class struggles.Many of the characters will be taken from real life - among them Lord Kinnaird, the Old Etonian who played in nine FA Cup finals and was president of the Football Association for 33 years until his death in 1923 and Fergie Suter, a Glasgwegian stonemason who joined Darwen FC in Lancashire, and became one of England’s first professional players.“We are telling a story about a real game and real people,” Fellowes said.A cartoon image of Arthur, Lord Kinnaird, who played in nine FA Cup finalsFergus \u0026#39Fergie\u0026#39 Suter, one of the first professional footballers to play in EnglandEton College claims credit for the development of English football, noting that the rules of the modern game were based on those developed in public schools. Before the establishment of the Football Association in 1863, there were different rules - even different balls - depending on where games were played and who was taking part.Fellowes said: “As football turned from boys and girls kicking a ball around the street into a proper game, it went through these extraordinary convulsions.“You had the Etonians trying to control it and set the rules, and at the same time it was growing in popularity through the Midlands and the North in recently industrialised communities who were identifying with their local football teams. You had this power struggle.“When it came to paying players, on one hand you had the former public schoolboys thinking it would make the sport vulgar and open it up to bribery. And then you had the working class teams saying, ‘It’s all very well for them because they have all the time in the world to practise. But how can we get our standards up when we have to go out to work?’Julian Fellowes at Highclere Castle, the setting for Downton AbbeyFellowes described Lord Kinnaird as a “visionary” figure. “He started out thinking, \u0027Eton has got it right and these are the rules and we are gentlemen\u0027. But he came to understand its importance to communities all over Britain.”Fellowes said his interest in football was sparked when his son took him to watch Manchester United play “East Ham or West Ham”.“I am not a fan in the sense of always being on the terraces. But my son took me to see Man United and suddenly I was able to tell that this game was like a ballet,” Fellowes said.“It was so beautifully done, so measured, so skilful that I came away with a completely different feeling about the whole thing. I understood there is an artistry to this, as there is to anything.”SpaceX launch NASA\u0026#39s new planet-hunter - watch live Leaders make lasting commitment on malariaTeenager admits killing nurse who was unwittingly caught in acid attack crossfire The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story, episode 8, review – a killer resolution is all this series needsComment: Prince Charles would be a worthy successor as head of CommonwealthDale Winton, the TV presenter, has died at the age of 62Police give green light to anti-royal wedding protestersComment: The Windrush scandal is heartbreaking, but it should not be used as an excuse to stop sensible migration controlsDavid Cameron says he doesn\u0026#39t regret EU referendumDonald Trump calls Mike Pompeo \u0026#39great guy\u0026#39 as nomination for Secretary of State hits trouble Donald Trump breaks his silence on porn star Stormy Daniels\u0026#39 affair claimsRudd clings on by her fingertips as PM says Home Office should do more to help Windrush citizensDuchess of Cornwall hails The Archers in helping to lift \u0026#39shroud of silence\u0026#39 about domestic abuse\u0026#39White coat syndrome\u0026#39 is real: blood pressure readings at home 50 per cent more accurate Reversing Brexit would pose threat to Europe, warns Francois Hollande Around 16,000 rally in Armenia against new PMBath Abbey to be heated by the hot springs of the Roman baths Elon Musk says walking out of long meetings and hanging up on boring calls is how to get ahead in businessWe rely on advertising to help fund our award-winning journalism.We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The Telegraph website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Thank you for your support.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day 18 april 2018","story":"A tarantula burger, Margot Robbie at the Formula E launch tour and a great egret are some of Wednesday\u0027s pictures of the daySpaceX launch NASA\u0026#39s new planet-hunter - watch live Leaders make lasting commitment on malariaTeenager admits killing nurse who was unwittingly caught in acid attack crossfire The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story, episode 8, review – a killer resolution is all this series needsComment: Prince Charles would be a worthy successor as head of CommonwealthDale Winton, the TV presenter, has died at the age of 62Julian Fellowes: how Old Etonians took on the working classes at football - and lostPolice give green light to anti-royal wedding protestersComment: The Windrush scandal is heartbreaking, but it should not be used as an excuse to stop sensible migration controlsDavid Cameron says he doesn\u0026#39t regret EU referendumDonald Trump calls Mike Pompeo \u0026#39great guy\u0026#39 as nomination for Secretary of State hits trouble Donald Trump breaks his silence on porn star Stormy Daniels\u0026#39 affair claimsRudd clings on by her fingertips as PM says Home Office should do more to help Windrush citizens\u0026#39White coat syndrome\u0026#39 is real: blood pressure readings at home 50 per cent more accurate Reversing Brexit would pose threat to Europe, warns Francois Hollande Duchess of Cornwall hails The Archers in helping to lift \u0026#39shroud of silence\u0026#39 about domestic abuseAround 16,000 rally in Armenia against new PMBath Abbey to be heated by the hot springs of the Roman baths We rely on advertising to help fund our award-winning journalism.We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The Telegraph website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Thank you for your support.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"brexit uk economy worse off government bespoke trade deal scenario","story":"The government’s preferred Brexit scenario would leave the UK public finances £615m per week worse off than staying in the EU, according to new analysis.That would mean the country has the equivalent of almost £1bn per week less to spend on public services than the £350m positive benefit that the Leave campaign claimed would result from leaving the EU.A study for the think tank Global Future carried out by Jonathan Portes, a professor of economics at King’s College, London, looked at each of the three scenarios assessed by the government in its own leaked analysis.Using that analysis, the new research calculates that the government’s preferred option of a “bespoke deal” would mean about £40bn more in annual public borrowing than under the status quo by 203334 - the same time period over which the government worked out its impact assessmentsThat equates to £615m per week, or 22 per cent of the NHS budget, after translating that into today’s prices, the research claims. It bases this scenario on the Prime Minister’s recent Mansion House speech which outlined the Brexit she hopes to deliver.This would mean leaving the single market and customs union whilst maintaining access to EU markets with minimal tariff and non-tariff barriers. It would also include the flexibility to erge from Brussels regulations, negotiate trading relationships with other non-EU countries and implement restrictions on immigration.The research estimates that this outcome would leave the country better off than a no-deal Brexit but worse off than under the “Norway model” or under an average free-trade agreement such as the one Canada has with the EU.The Norway model, in which the UK would stay in the single market and adhere to EU rules and regulations but leave the customs union, would have a negative fiscal impact of £262m per week while the Canada option would cost around £877m per week, Mr Portes finds. The figures are the equivalent of  9 per cent and 31 per cent of the current NHS budget respectively. A no-deal Brexit in which the UK trades with the EU under World Trade Organisation terms is estimated to cost £1.25bn per week. No scenario is more beneficial than staying in the EU.The analysis takes into account the benefits from lower financial contributions to the EU budget and a new trade deal with the US as well as costs arising from new customs controls, tariffs, and reduced migration. A survey conducted as part of the research found that 72 per cent of Leave voters thought that £615m a week would be too high a price to pay for a bespoke Brexit deal, while 78 per cent said it was worse than they had hoped for when they cast their vote in June 2016.Among all EU referendum voters polled, just 23 per cent said they thought the estimated cost would be worth paying.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Selfridges\u0027 Bobble 550ml filtered water bottle costs £12.95 and includes a replaceable carbon filter that filters water as you drink, removing chlorine and organic contaminants in the process. You can buy it from selfridges.comIt is estimated that the UK throws away around 2.5bn disposable coffee cups a year and almost all are incinerated, exported or sent to landfill because their plastic lining makes them expensive to recycle. The new Latte Levy in the UK means there will now be a 25p charge on every disposable coffee cup bought by consumers. Pret A Manger announced that it will double its discount to 50p in an effort to reduce waste. By swapping to a reusable cup you will be able to help cut the cost of disposable coffee cups. This Keep Cup Brew, cork edition, travel cup in Fika is just one of the many available to purchase.

You can buy this particular cup for £19.99 from trouva.com.An eco-friendly alternative to an ordinary plastic bag is this lightweight shopping bag.

You can purchase them from Bali Boo on Amazon.co.uk for £13.99.“The main issue is that effectively the price per tonne to the waste management companies received for cups has meant it hasn’t been economic for them to take the cups to the paper mills – there hasn’t been enough profit it in it  for them,” he said.“We realised that was actually the hurdle we had to overcome if we were going to cut through this, and as the market leader we felt we should.”To address the shortfall, Costa Coffee has agreed to pay an additional £75 per tonne to waste management companies, making it economically viable to transport cups to the paper mill.In doing so, it predicts the number of cups recycled at the UK’s facilities will rise from 14 million cups to 100 million this year.The company has entered into a partnership with five national waste collectors – Veolia, Biffa, Suez, Grundon and First Mile – that between them cover public spaces across the UK including hospitals, universities and transport hubs.The coffee giant is also working with paper mills to ensure their products are recycled effectively. James Cropper, for example, has plans to “upcycle” 500 million cups a year to create plastic-free packaging.“We’ve developed these processes over a number of years because we recognise the need for brands to consider their packaging design and explore plastic-free alternatives,” said Phil Wild, chief executive officer at James Cropper.By building more partnerships with waste contractors in every region, Costa intends to hit its half a billion mark within two years.With one report predicting the number of takeaway drink cups thrown away in the UK is set to rise by a third by 2030, and the government recently failing to back a “latte levy” to discourage cup use, it falls to businesses to act on the huge amount of waste from their products.Commenting on the announcement Environment Minister Therese Coffey, said: “Congratulations Costa on taking this significant step to help coffee lovers do the right thing and increase recycling. We all have a responsibility to our environment and this is a significant step by a British business which should dramatically increase the number of disposable coffee cups we recycle in this country.“We want to help companies become plastic free and through our 25 Year Environment Plan we are putting in place the ambitions to encourage all of us to play our part in ending the scourge of plastic waste in our natural environment.”    “We’re hoping that via this announcement our other competitors will come on board with us as well – we can’t see why they wouldn’t,” said Mr Paul.Concern about plastic waste,and the harm it is causing to the marine environment in particular, has led to many communities up and down the UK attempting to eradicate single-use plastics such as disposable coffee cups altogether.As awareness has grown among the public, companies have felt the pressure to act on their disposable coffee cup waste.  The Independent’s Cut the Cup Waste campaign has found that the majority of the British public would support a 25p charge on disposable coffee cups, investigated the use of china cups in major coffee chains and featured calls on businesses and government to take responsibility for their waste.“What the campaigns have done is increase customer focus on this area – quite rightly – and it has actually been helpful for us because it has enabled us to move quicker with some of the waste management firms than we would have done otherwise,” said Mr Paul.“It’s helping us do the right thing.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

But with economic growth expected to come in weaker in Q1 owing to the snowy weather, and the need for further evidence of rising wage pressures, it will be a less clear-cut affair than anticipated,” said Tej Parikh of the Institute of Directors.Earlier this week sterling had risen to its highest level against the dollar since the Brexit vote - $1.4335 – as expectations grew of a May rate rise by the Bank of England.Sterling suffered a record intra-day plunge against the dollar of more than 11 per cent on the night of the June 2016 referendum, falling to $1.32.In January 2017 it hit a low of $1.21, before recovering over the course of the year.Despite the pound’s gradual clawing back of post-referendum losses against the dollar, the trade-weighted value of sterling – which values the UK currency against a basket of the currencies of our major trading partners – still stands 10 per cent down on its level before the Brexit vote.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

We all have a responsibility to our environment and this is a significant step by a British business which should dramatically increase the number of disposable coffee cups we recycle in this country.“We want to help companies become plastic free and through our 25 Year Environment Plan we are putting in place the ambitions to encourage all of us to play our part in ending the scourge of plastic waste in our natural environment.”    “We’re hoping that via this announcement our other competitors will come on board with us as well – we can’t see why they wouldn’t,” said Mr Paul.Concern about plastic waste,and the harm it is causing to the marine environment in particular, has led to many communities up and down the UK attempting to eradicate single-use plastics such as disposable coffee cups altogether.As awareness has grown among the public, companies have felt the pressure to act on their disposable coffee cup waste.  The Independent’s Cut the Cup Waste campaign has found that the majority of the British public would support a 25p charge on disposable coffee cups, investigated the use of china cups in major coffee chains and featured calls on businesses and government to take responsibility for their waste.“What the campaigns have done is increase customer focus on this area – quite rightly – and it has actually been helpful for us because it has enabled us to move quicker with some of the waste management firms than we would have done otherwise,” said Mr Paul.“It’s helping us do the right thing.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Job prospects and and a disillusionment with politics are among the issues still pushing many millennials, like generations before them, to move away. Except now, things are supposed to be different. Brexit has the potential to undermine the Good Friday AgreementTwenty years ago, on 10 April 1998, peace came to Northern Ireland. After 30 years of brutal sectarian conflict, in which more than 3,600 people were killed, political groups agreed to reject violence and work together to solve problems democratically. It was called the Good Friday Agreement. A devolved assembly would be established for both sides to govern together and while unionists were assured of their British identity, a united Ireland was acknowledged as a legitimate political goal for republicans. Some 71 per cent of people in Northern Ireland voted to accept the agreement in a referendum, with the DUP being the only party to reject it. David Trimble and John Hume were pictured on stage with Bono after brokering the Good Friday Agreement (AFPGetty)The years that followed saw continued political instability and fringe paramilitary activity but largely, the deal held. By 2003, voting patterns in Northern Ireland shifted considerably. While Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader David Trimble and Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) leader John Hume had been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for their efforts in 1998, their parties were gradually sidelined.Instead, the electorate moved towards more hardline options. The DUP, led by the formidable Rev Ian Paisley, with their staunch Presbyterian values, and unwavering loyalty to Britain overtook the UUP and Sinn Fein, the unapologetically republican party with former IRA prisoners among its ranks, effectively replaced the SDLP.And yet, they managed the unthinkable. In 2008, Ian Paisley and Martin McGuinness led the two parties into power sharing for the first time, and were seen not just working together, but laughing together.But while violence faded from the streets, a cultural battleground began to open up politically – not just over the very narrative of the Troubles, but over parading, flags and language, with the DUP fighting for a retention of all things British, while Sinn Fein vouched for Irish culture to be given the equal weighting it was promised in the agreement. Naomi Long is the leader of Alliance, a small, centre ground party with members from both communities. She says even at the height of the conflict, politics was not as starkly ided as it is now.“I think there has been a reliance on the use of the politics of fear, and using that as a rather lazy means to garner votes in elections,” she explains. “The big political parties essentially ask people to vote for them to keep other people out, rather than as a positive expression of what their ambitions and aspirations for the future might be.”Power sharing has now been suspended at Stormont in Belfast since January 2017 (Getty)But whether the parties are setting the agenda from their offices at Stormont, or whether they are merely responding to the wishes of the people on the street, both the DUP and Sinn Fein are totally in step with their ever hardening bases.One of the best litmus tests is The Nolan Show, “the biggest show in the country” broadcast every morning on BBC Radio Ulster. The impassioned, angry, and often downright bigoted views expressed by callers have made the very name of the show synonymous with sounding off. A recent standoff heard a unionist man refuse to call Sinn Fein’s Mairtín O Muilleoir by his Irish name, because a previous republican caller refused to even call the country “Northern Ireland”. As they argued among themselves, Stephen Nolan spoke for many listeners when he muttered, “This is pathetic.”The DUP have found themselves on the unfashionable side of social issues that Sinn Fein have championed, including LGBT rights (PA)It would be pessimistic to suggest that the show’s more colourful callers are representative of Northern Ireland as a whole, but it would be a blatant dismissal of the region’s political stalemate to suggest it is not. Just as the callers cannot agree, increasingly, Sinn Fein and the DUP can’t either.On 9 January last year, Martin McGuinness resigned his position as deputy first minister over a political scandal that implicated DUP leader Arlene Foster – although she denies any wrongdoing. Declaring it “the right time to call a halt to the DUP’s arrogance”, Northern Ireland’s mandatory power sharing coalition meant his resignation also removed Foster from her position as first minister, collapsing the assembly.His statement, an astonishing swansong delivered two months before his death, also laid out a litany of claims against the DUP. After 10 years of working together, McGuinness concluded that, “the equality, mutual respect and all-Ireland approaches enshrined in the Good Friday Agreement have never been fully embraced by the DUP.”Martin McGuinness resigned in protest against the handling of a botched energy scheme (Getty)This brought everything crashing down, and in the election which followed, both the DUP and Sinn Fein increased their popular vote, but one side had clearly benefited. Unionism lost its overall majority for the first time ever, and Sinn Fein were suddenly just a hair’s breadth behind their rivals.To their detriment, the DUP have also found themselves on the unfashionable side of social issues that Sinn Fein have championed, including LGBT rights and abortion reform. The general election of June 2017 brought this to the attention of the British mainstream after their confidence and supply agreement with Theresa May’s Conservatives. Talks to restore power sharing remain unresolved, with Sinn Fein requests for parity with the rest of the UK on language rights and marriage equality being rejected by the DUP. Arlene Foster has been criticised for saying she would leave the country in the event of a united Ireland (Getty)Michelle Gildernew was part of the first Sinn Fein delegation ever received at Downing Street by Tony Blair in 1997 and is now a Westminster MP. She doesn’t feel her party is asking for anything more than what people are entitled to.“We’re looking at rights that people have across these islands,” she says, “whether that’s legacy rights, rights for LGBT citizens, for Irish, Scots, Welsh language speakers. There are rights for people everywhere across these islands, except for the six counties. I think that is a completely unacceptable situation. I’m raising three children here and I want them to have the same rights as their friends and neighbours, wherever they are.”Talk to the average person on the street in Northern Ireland and they’ll criticise politicians, for putting cultural issues and minority rights ahead of health, housing and education – budgets for which have all been squeezed during the impasse. But every election returns the same reality. People vote in huge numbers for the DUP and Sinn Fein to hold their corners.Former Irish taoiseach Bertie Ahern signed the Good Friday Agreement alongside Tony Blair, and maintains that bigger hurdles were overcome then. The restoration of power sharing, as ingrained in the Good Friday Agreement signed by Tony Blair and Bertie Ahern, is vital (PA)“I think everybody has to compromise,” he tells me. “If you cast your mind back 20 years ago we were dealing with the big issues of prisoners’ release, decommissioning, a new criminal justice system – they were major issues. Now I don’t want to trivialise the issues now and say they’re minor, but they’re certainly not at the magnitude of what we had to crack in 1998.”The fundamental problem is that while the war is over, unionists and republicans remain locked in a psychological battle for the very soul of Northern Ireland. Is its future still within the United Kingdom, or are we moving towards a united Ireland? While the Good Friday Agreement acknowledged that Northern Ireland would remain a part of the UK, it was also agreed that when a majority of people in the north and the south of Ireland wanted to reunify, a referendum could be held, and the result would be honoured. Republicans saw this as a starting gun for their goal of reunification, and while this angered some unionists, most seemed confident it wasn’t of immediate concern – something leaders within the DUP and the UUP have felt the need to reiterate in recent weeks, with diminishing certainty.Murals in Belfast serve as a reminder of Northern Ireland’s violent past (Getty)For most of the past two decades, the public discourse has maintained that republicans cannot hope to win over a majority for a united Ireland because most centre ground voters are too well off in the UK – including many nationalists who are quietly accepting of the situation. But now that seems about to change.If Brexit stunned the country, it shook Northern Ireland to its core, where 56 per cent of people voted to remain. The European Union served not just as a guarantor for the Good Friday Agreement, but accommodated a kind of harmonisation across Ireland that contented many nationalists. An invisible border allows people to move, live and work across the island, as if it were indeed united.Gildernew’s Fermanagh and South Tyrone constituency shares a great length of that border with four counties of the Irish Republic.“I cross it probably every day,” she says. “People cross it for work, for business, for school, for caring responsibilities, to visit family, even just to walk the dog. We’ve spent decades trying to remove the border, not just the physical infrastructure, but in people’s hearts and minds, and any changes to that will be resisted by the communities on either side of it.”The invisible border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland allows people to move, live and work across the island, as if it were indeed united (Getty)Indeed, the prospect of a border returning has also mobilised politicians in the south to take a stand, with taoiseach Leo Varadkar claiming that “no Irish government will ever again leave Northern nationalists and Northern Ireland behind”.It’s increasingly clear that by campaigning for a patriotic cause they probably never believed would have consequences, the DUP shot unionism in the foot. Suddenly, Sinn Fein were handed a card to play which made a united Ireland a plausible, realistic and economically sensible option. It would be lazy to assume that the 56 per cent who voted remain would automatically want to remain within the EU by means of a united Ireland, but it has certainly made the option much more appealing. In the past two weeks, Sinn Fein vice president Michelle O’Neill has called for a unity referendum to be held within five years, while Arlene Foster was criticised after saying she would leave the country in the event of a united Ireland. The DUP were asked to provide comment for this feature, but neglected to put anyone forward.Alex Kane is a former communications director for the UUP and believes there are strong arguments to be made for staying within the UK.“Even if there was a referendum, I’m not convinced unionism would lose it at this point,” he says. “But I think there are more challenges for unionists now than there have been in my lifetime. I think it’s an existential challenge for unionism.”Michelle O’Neill (left) wants a unity referendum to be held within five years (Getty)Kevin Meagher is the author of A United Ireland: Why Unification Is Inevitable and How It Will Come About. He believes it could happen by 2022, as a result of a demographic shift in nationalism’s favour, and quite possibly, Jeremy Corbyn in 10 Downing Street. He warns that the vote could be won despite the apparent polarisation of Northern Irish politics.“An agreed Ireland is not a precondition for a united Ireland,” he stresses, “and what I’ve been saying to British politicians is if you think you can kick the can down the road until everybody gets on and everything is forgotten, you’re not going to have that option. The reality is, by 2022 you could have an electoral majority who want a united Ireland, and you’re going to have to facilitate that.”The ultimate irony is that by so flagrantly risking the interests of Northern Ireland to carry out the will of Little Englanders, the Conservatives have put Irish reunification further up the agenda than Sinn Fein ever could have done alone. Unionists may see this as their worst nightmare, but Meagher – a former special adviser in the Northern Ireland Office – believes it wouldn’t bother the British government much at all.“If presented with a way out that was reasonable and effective for British ministers of either party, frankly they would have had to take an option of Irish unity 20, 30, 40 years ago. It’s been looming in British politics that this is the direction of travel.”Theresa May is promising no return to a hard border in Ireland (Getty)As government predictions show the GDP of Northern Ireland would be reduced by 12 per cent under a no deal Brexit, economic safety within the UK is no longer a certainty. The Irish economy, on the other hand, is growing three times faster than any other European country. The question now shifts from whether people want to risk their livelihood by joining a united Ireland, to whether people can actually afford to stay in the UK.As it currently stands, Theresa May is promising no return to a hard border in Ireland, which is pleasing nationalists, republicans, the Irish government and the EU. She is also promising no border down the Irish Sea, to keep the DUP happy. And yet, she is carrying out the will of a British majority, whose primary concern in voting for Brexit was immigration Loughs, Brexit and fishermen in Northern IrelandLoughs, Brexit and fishermen in Northern IrelandEnda Craig, a member of the Loughs Agency Advisory Forum, holds a map of Lough Foyle in Moville, IrelandOyster farmer William Lynch puts on his wellington boots on his oyster farm on Lough Foyle in Culmore, Northern IrelandWomen walk along the shores of Carlingford Lough with Northern Ireland seen across the lough in CarlingfordA poster hanging on a wall of a house reads: No to the ferry, referring to a proposed new car ferry that would run from Northern Ireland to the Republic of Ireland through Carlingford Lough in GreencastleSkipper Shay Fitzpatrick (L) and boat owner Brian Cunningham navigate out of Warrenpoint harbour into Carlingford Lough in Warrenpoint, Northern IrelandA woman with flowers walks past an old fuel station in Carlingford, IrelandA boat is seen at sunset on Carlingford Lough in Greenore, IrelandA mandries off after swimming in Carlingford Lough in Omeath, IrelandA derelict house is seen on the shore of Carlingford Lough in Omeath, IrelandSkipper Shay Fitzpatrick dredges mussels from Carlingford Lough in Warrenpoint, Northern IrelandBagged-up farmed oysters at a cleaning facility to get them ready for overseas shipping in Moville, IrelandA man walks his dog in matching hi-vis outfits on Carlingford Lough in Greenore, IrelandCarlingford Lough and in the distance Northern Ireland are seen at sunset from Omeath, IrelandA sign that reads: \u0027In 1771 nothing happened here\u0027 is seen on the shores of Carlingford Lough in Carlingford, Ireland. Will they really stand for the kind of soft or non-existent border the prime minister is promising Ireland? Someone, somewhere down the line, is going to be betrayed.Deputy leader of the SDLP Nichola Mallon says it’s now time for May to deliver solutions of substance, not just empty rhetoric.“This for us is not an orange and green issue, it’s not about the constitutional question on the island, this is about ensuring we have the best deal for people across the island, and we believe this is best served by Northern Ireland remaining in the customs union and the single market,” she says.The prospect of a hard border returning has mobilised politicians in the south to take a stand (AFPGetty)So Northern Ireland is waiting for a solution on the border, but also for a political landscape that works for everybody. Surely, after two decades, that isn’t too much to ask?“I thought within 20 years, something is bound to be different other than the fact we’re not shooting each other,” Alex Kane says, “and that’s good, but it’s not enough. Not killing each other is normal, but also normal is parties making decisions, going into government together, having choices. We don’t seem any closer to that.”I\u0027m ashamed of the state of the world, says PopeClinton says Good Friday Agreement anniversary is an chance for peaceThreat of \u0027serious trouble\u0027 in Northern IrelandBut the restoration of power sharing, as ingrained in the Good Friday Agreement, is a must. It may require unpalatable concessions from both sides, but a Stormont assembly is essential, whether you want to remain in a UK of devolved governments, or – as Bertie Ahern points out – if you are aiming for that referendum on Irish unity.“You have to have stable institutions and sustainable development going forward before you do that,” he believes. “The clause to have referendums is part of the Good Friday Agreement, so it doesn’t seem logical in my view to be talking about a referendum when you don’t even have the agreement fully in place.”The evidence suggests that the winds of change are blowing in favour of Northern Ireland’s nationalists, but the hard work of honouring the Good Friday Agreement is crucial to achieving a new Ireland of equals for all.Email cannot be used.

The UK is also a top destination for wealthy Russians to spend their money on art collections, expensive cars and private schools for their children. In return, the UK often grants them visas and, in some cases, citizenship“We are going after the money,” Boris Johnson promised after being questioned on the absence of specific measures to impose sanctions and financial penalties on the UK assets of Russian oligarchs closely aligned to President Putin. But when pressed by MPs on why decisive action was not being taken, the foreign secretary replied: “This is not a country where we in the government can say ‘Oi! We think this so-and-so deserves to have his or her collar felt’. This is not how it works.” While Theresa May may yet impose sanctions against Putin-supporting billionaires in response to the attempted murder of the Russian spy Sergei Skripal, her government’s track record has been marred by procrastination and prevarication.   Privately, the prime minister regards the exploitation of London as a haven for dirty Russian money as a serious problem. She once listened in stunned silence as a senior MI6 officer briefed her on the activities of Russian organised crime and certain oligarchs in the UK. And in 2016 she authorised the National Security Council to review why and how wealthy Russians buy property in London. But she has been nervous about taking action. For the past three years she has dithered on implementing a legally-enforceable register that will force all foreign companies that own UK property to disclose the identity of their owners.Russia claims Skripals poisoned using toxin possessed by UK and USRussia has been spying on the Skripals for at least five years- UKRussia stock market crashes after US imposes sanctions on oligarchsFreezing property assets is the key to inflicting pain on the Russian state and its compliant plutocrats. Since 2004, £190m of UK property has been subject to criminal investigation as suspected proceeds of corruption. The London property market has been skewed by laundered money, as The Independent revealed exclusively in 2014. Prices are being artificially driven up by wealthy, influential, foreign men who want to hide their assets in the UK.Multi-million pound payments are accepted without their origin being questioned. Oligarchs hide ownership behind anonymous shell companies registered in secretive jurisdictions while a London address offers a veneer of legitimacy and prestige that helps launder reputations as well as cash. Transparency International estimates that Russians account for £729m of the £4.4bn acquired in UK property via what it regards as “suspicious wealth”.There is no suggestion that all London property bought by Russian oligarchs is derived from illegal or criminal sources. For some Russian plutocrats buying luxury property in London is a symbol that they have been accepted by the British establishment. This is illustrated by the eleven bedroom Regency house on Belgrave Square that Oleg Deripaska, regarded as one of Putin’s favourite oligarchs, snapped up for £17m through an offshore company registered in the British Virgin Islands in 2003 and now worth £45m.Oleg Deripaska’s 11-bedroom Regency house on Belgrave Square is seen as a symbol of acceptance by the British establishment (Alamy)Built in the 1820s, it was formerly the home of Sir Henry “Chips” Channon, society host, Conservative MP and notoriously indiscreet diarist. It was designed for entertaining royalty and diplomats with its grand staircase, Madame Récamier sofas and flamboyant decor. When Harold Nicolson arrived at the house for dinner, he exclaimed: “Oh my God, how rich and powerful Lord Channon has become.” The equally grand and historic mansion Beechwood House, set in 11 acres of land in Highgate, north London, was bought by the powerful oligarch Alisher Usmanov in 2008 for £48m from the Emir of Qatar. Usmanov is a major shareholder in Arsenal football club and has amassed a £14bn fortune from metals and commodities and has long been regarded as a pro-Putin figure. And his fellow football-loving oligarch Roman Abramovich owns houses on Kensington Palace Gardens and Chester Square, Belgravia, and apartments on Eaton Square and Manresa Road, Chelsea.  One Hyde Park, one of the wealthiest residencies in the world, was famously bought up by Russian oligarchs (Alamy)It is not just prestigious houses that attract Russian billionaires. The UK is also a top destination for wealthy Russians to spend their money on art collections, expensive cars and private schools for their children. In return for their cash, the UK often grants them visas and, in some cases, citizenship.  Since 2008 iniduals have been able to obtain “golden visas” if they invest as little as £2m in a UK business. And for £5m, they gain the right to become a UK resident on a temporary basis and then, after five years, a British citizen. By 2014, almost 700 rich Russians had paid for entry using this method, with Roman Rotenberg, son of Putin’s former judo partner Boris Rotenberg, being the most prominent example. He owns a mews house on Cadogan Lane in Belgravia.The government is taking some action to stop London becoming what David Cameron described as a haven to hide “dodgy foreign cash”. The National Crime Agency (NCA) is investigating a list of wealthy iniduals, not just oligarchs, to assess if they have used the UK to launder their fortunes.An estimated 149 iniduals are restricted on their travel and ability to conduct business in the UK. And the Unexplained Wealth Orders is now law, whereby the NCA can demand that the oligarch explain the origin of his wealth. But the problem with this order, according to a Russian businessman, is that the inidual in question could too easily lie about his source of wealth and instead produce a document that shows his fortune was based on, for example, share idends. Roman Rotenberg gained entry to the UK using the ‘golden visas’ method (Getty)Boris Johnson protests that the government cannot act directly against the pro-Putin brigade because it cannot interfere in criminal investigations. But it could make specific changes to the law, notably an amendment to the Sanctions and Money Laundering Bill, which would give Magnitsky-type powers to freeze the UK assets of relevant iniduals, including intelligence agents or other officials who have abused human rights.  The government could also implement the register of inidual owners of foreign and offshore companies that own UK property. But that bill has been delayed until 2021 and campaigners smell a cover-up after the government announced that one reason for the delay is that the Business Department has commissioned research on the impact of the register on investment decisions. “This is a crucial moment for the UK’s future trading relationship with the rest of the world, and we must proceed with as good an understanding as possible of the potential impacts on legitimate inward investment,” said foreign office minister Lord Ahmad. Skripal attack aftermath – in picturesSkripal attack aftermath – in picturesInvestigators in protective clothing remove a van from an address in Winterslow near Salisbury in Wiltshire, as police and members of the armed forces continue to investigate the suspected nerve agent attack on Russian double agent Sergei SkripaA police officer on duty near the protective tent which covers the bench where a man and woman were apparently poisoned with what was later identified as a nerve agent, in SalisburyMilitary in protective clothing prior to removing vehicles from a car park in SalisburyPersonnel in protective coveralls and breathing equipment cover an ambulance with a tarpaulin at the Salisbury District HospitalHome Secretary Amber Rudd visits the scene of the nerve agent attack in SalibsuryMembers of the emergency services in hazard suits fix the tent over the bench where Sergei and Yulia Skripal were foundOfficials in protective suits check their equipment before repositioning a forensics tent A poice officer stands guard outside a branch of the Italian chain restaurant ZizziDetective Sergeant Nick Bailey, who assisted the Russian ex-spy targeted with a nerve agent, was also hospitalisedSergei Skripal days before he was exposed to a mystery substance that has left him fighting for lifeSergei Skripal speaks to his lawyer from behind bars seen on a screen of a monitor outside a courtroom in Moscow.Yulia Skripal, who is thought to have been poisoned along with her father, Sergei SkripalProgress to legislation has thus been painfully slow. An insight into why political rhetoric has not resulted in legislative action can be gleaned by the recent flotation on the London stock exchange of the Russian energy company En+, then owned by Deripaska and chaired by former Conservative energy minister Lord Barker. For it revealed a fundamental dispute between MI6 and the financial regulators on how to make oligarchs who park their assets in London more accountable and transparent.MI6 and the prime minister’s national security advisor, Sir Mark Sedwill, were furious with the Stock Exchange and Financial Conduct Authority for failing to consult them and conduct the required due diligence of En+. Their main concern was about whether Rusal, a subsidiary of En+, had been manufacturing aluminium powder used by Russian arms firms for military purposes. Rusal adamantly denied it – yet its own website previously indicated that the defence industry was among the users of the type of aluminium powder it manufactured.Sir Mark Sedwill was furious when the required due diligence of En+ was not carried out ahead of its flotation on the London stock exchange (Getty)The En+ group could be a candidate for new sanctions as the Russian state-owned VTB Bank is a major shareholder with a 4.35 per cent holding, while Deripaska is known for being close to the Russian President. Leaked US diplomatic cables described Deripaska as “among the two to three oligarchs Putin turns to on a regular basis” and is “a more-or-less permanent fixture on Putin’s trips abroad”.Indeed, when the US imposed sanctions on seven oligarchs and the 12 companies they own or control last week, shares tumbled. Deripaska was among those affected, as was Rotenberg.  Still, Britiain cannot follow suit. And the anger of National Security officials and MI6 En+\u0027s flotation last year stemmed precisely from their belief that it typified the complacent approach to Russian money in London, which the infamous oligarch Boris Berezovsky once told me was “70 per cent dirty”. The inability to impose sanctions is similarly emblematic.The London Stock Exchange has long been a vehicle for Russian companies and oligarchs to raise money in shares and bonds – an estimated $200bn (£140bn) since 2004. Last summer, Russia’s largest gold producer Polyus, controlled by Suleyman Kerimov, a Russian senator awarded the Order of Merit by Putin, raised $879m. There are now 57 predominantly-Russian companies listed on the London Stock Exchange, more than anywhere else outside Moscow.   The wealthiest Russian oligarchs who call London homeA little-noticed loophole to avoid sanctions is that Russian sovereign debt is permitted to be sold in London. “We are allowing Russian sovereign debt to be sold in the UK and that debt is being used to reimburse Russians to bring back their money onshore in Moscow terms,” said the Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee. “As that gold is moving towards Moscow, we are quite extraordinarily enabling those bond and debt auctions...This is one of those areas where sanctions on businesses are being compensated by the Russian state.”Just hours after Theresa May’s retaliation against the poisoning of Sergei Skripal, Gazprom issued a $750m eurobond in London and the following day the Russian government joined in by issuing a $4bn bond in the capital. Within hours, the Russian Embassy issued a revealing tweet: “Business as usual?”Could the nerve-agent attack in Salisbury be the unwitting catalyst for finally cleaning up dirty Russian money in London? (Getty)But the irony is that it is the attempted assassination of a Russian spy and double agent living in Salisbury and the murder of Russian businessman Nikolai Glushkov in Surrey that could be the unwitting catalysts for finally cleaning up dirty Russian money in London.Mark Hollingsworth is the author of “Londongrad – From Russia with Cash’’ Email cannot be used.

Colin Drury delves into the inside story of the battle to save 17,500 trees being felled in a single cityJenny Hockey still shivers when she remembers the moment, almost 18 months ago, she was woken by police hammering at her door. It was 5am. When she looked outside, she momentarily wondered if a terror incident was unfolding.“It was that kind of scene,” the 71-year-old says. “Multiple cars, officers swarming everywhere, flashing lights. We had no idea what was happening.”It was 17 November 2016 and, under the cover of darkness, officers from South Yorkshire Police had descended on Sheffield’s Rustlings Road, one of the city’s most sought-after addresses. Cordoning off the street and banging on doors, they ordered residents to get dressed and move their vehicles or have them towed away. Within the hour, Hockey, a retired sociology professor, would become one of three neighbours arrested and locked up for eight hours.227-year-old tree planted by George Washington pulled down by windBut this dramatic pre-dawn raid – described by Nick Clegg, then the local MP, as like something “you’d expect in Putin’s Russia” – was not carried out in search of terrorists or criminals.Rather, it was in support of council contractors hired to chop down eight street trees, which residents had spent more than a year petitioning to save.Amid the confusion, Hockey and two others – including another woman in her seventies – attempted to stand under one of these century-old limes, only to be detained. All charges were later dropped.“We wanted to protect something we loved,” she says. “And our right to do that – our democratic right – was taken away, really, by state force. It was so horrible and disempowering.”Indeed, by the time the trio were freed, the trees which had always overlooked their homes were no more.Contractors cut down the final tree in Rustlings Road (PA)Yet a bigger battle was just beginning: one which has since spread across the city, seen mass protests and riot police on suburban streets, and ultimately revealed an astonishing secret plan – hidden within a £2.2bn PFI contract – to cut down almost 20,000 street trees…Sheffield has long boasted of being Europe’s greenest city – in part because a third of it sits in the Peak District. But it is also due to the sheer number of trees that line the roads. Some 36,000 of them arch over highways and footpaths.But around 2015, talk of what the Woodland Trust called a “tree massacre” started to emerge.Sheffield’s Labour council had agreed for 17,500 street trees to be axed as part of a highways improvement scheme  (PA)The eight limes in Rustlings Road were not the only ones marked for the chainsaw. Under then-redacted clauses in a £2.2bn contract, Sheffield’s Labour council had agreed for 17,500 street trees to be axed as part of a vast highways improvement scheme being undertaken by the infrastructure giant Amey.Company and council both said – and still say – such felling was necessary. Targeted trees, they argued, were either dying, dangerous or had roots causing irreparable damage to roads and footpaths. Every one taken down, they added, was being substituted with a younger sapling: “We assess every single tree and only replace them as a last resort,” says Darren Butt, account director with Amey, today.Targeted trees, the council argued, were either dying, dangerous or had roots causing damage to roads and footpaths (Sheffield Tree Action Group)Yet, as this felling increased, questions started to be asked. There was shock when two cherries commemorating Second World War heroes disappeared one day. At Christmas, a row decorated with charity festive lights were hacked back – with fellers cutting through wires and all.A feeling spread that perfectly healthy and safe trees were being chopped unnecessarily. A suspicion grew that the policy was actually about increasing Amey’s profit margins. Over the length of the company’s 25-year highway maintenance obligations, so ran the theory, a newly planted sapling is far cheaper to look after than older, larger arboreta.“People were going to work in the morning and coming home to entirely different-looking streets,” says Paul Selby, a city resident and leading member of Sheffield Tree Action Groups, known as Stag. “It was ecological destruction carried out, in secret, by a multinational company with the explicit support of the local authority and the police.“And people were angry. These trees were part of their lives and they didn’t want them taking. These weren’t anarchists or hardline activists from other towns. They’re Sheffielders furious they hadn’t been given a voice in what was happening in their streets. So they came out and fought to be heard.”Almost 6,000 trees have been chopped down. But in the face of overwhelming and increasingly nationalised pressure, a pause on felling was announced last week.Sheffield City Council has put this down to the “dangerous tactics” of protestors. Yet the support in favour of Stag – both within the city and from names including Jeremy Corbyn, Michael Gove, Ken Loach and Jarvis Cocker – probably had something to do with it too.Hopes are now high the whole policy can be reconsidered. “We don’t take anything for granted,” says Selby, a civil servant with the Department for Work and Pensions. “But, after so long fighting, surely dialogue is now the sensible way forward.”Tensions rose, with fellers and protestors accusing each other of intimidation (Sheffield Tree Action Group)Certainly, it has been a troubled road to here: the irony perhaps being that this all started with a real city victory.In 2012 the government handed Sheffield £1.2bn to improve its roads, an economic godsend for a place locals had taken to calling Pothole City. Amey – a subsidiary of the Spanish company Ferrovial – won the work contract, promising to upgrade and maintain every highway, pavement, bridge, subway and street light for 25 years.“This is work that is good for everyone living here,” says Paul Billington, director of culture and environment with the city council. “It is already bringing investment and opportunities back into the city because it is making our infrastructure world-class.”Replacing damaging or dying trees, he argues, is key to that success continuing. Doing it now, he adds, is important because, as a 2007 survey showed, a large majority of trees are so old that to delay action would store problems for future generations.“No one disagrees that dying or damaging trees should be looked at – if they really do fall into those categories,” says Alison Teal, a Green Party councillor in the city. “But this went beyond that. We still didn’t know how many were due to come down but everywhere you looked, these magnificent trees were disappearing.”Demonstrations were civil enough to start with. People at home would spot Amey vans and go out to stand under targeted trees so they couldn’t be axed. Others started taking the bus to work, leaving their cars blocking access to endangered arboreta.Cups of tea were offered while people stood about. They debated the merits of the trees: their beauty, the environmental benefits, the wildlife. Occasionally, they talked about their favourite. An endangered elm in the Nether Edge area ended up being shortlisted for the 2016 England Tree Of The Year Award.Yet things hardened after the Rustlings Road raid (“In hindsight, it was poorly handled,” says Darren Butt). While many still supported the replacement scheme, opinion started to harden in favour of the so-called tree-huggers.

Stumps of trees already cut were painted blood red as a mark of anger. Stag supporters – now numbering in their thousands – took to organising daily spotter patrols and flying pickets.“When someone saw an Amey van near an endangered tree, they put a message in a WhatsApp group or online, and whoever was available would go and protect that tree,” says Teal.In this way dozens of limes, cherries, oaks and birches across several neighbourhoods were saved.But as tensions rose – with both fellers and protestors accusing each other of intimidation – police started to appear.Jenny Hockey (left), Freda Brayshaw and a third neighbour were arrested and locked up for eight hours (PA)At one demonstration in leafy Chippinghouse Road in January 2017, nine people were arrested, some while stood in their own gardens. None were ever charged. At another picket last month, a specialist police protest removal unit turned up. It was the first time it had ever been deployed on South Yorkshire’s streets.Arrest numbers grew – yet there were vaguely comedic elements to many. A 57-year-old woman was detained after blowing a pink trumpet, while a retired couple – Dr John and Sue Unwin – found themselves being questioned by CID officers (and later cleared) about the suspected poisoning of a cup of tea they gave a feller.“It sounds like the plot from an Agatha Christie novel,” Dr Unwin told the Daily Mail.One 73-year-old was detained for intimidation. Alan Simpson, a retired firefighter and great-grandfather, says: “I’ve never been in trouble in my life and was there with my wife. I don’t think I could have cut a less intimidating figure if I tried.” His charge, too, has been dropped.“If it wasn’t so serious,” says James Whitworth, cartoonist on local newspaper The Star, “it would be farcical, and I mean that literally: there is enough material here to make an actual farce.“As a cartoonist, it’s a dream because the whole thing is so ridiculous. You think you can’t possibly say anymore on the issue – and then they arrest a woman for blowing a plastic trumpet. But as a city resident: I’m pretty neutral but, really, maybe leave our trees alone?”Local newspaper cartoonist James Whitworth’s take on the Sheffield tree massacre (James Whitworth)As news of the ongoing demonstrations spread, meanwhile, concern grew it was damaging the city’s reputation. When Sheffield was left off The Sunday Times Best Places to Live list this year, authorities blamed the campaigners: “it is regrettable the increasingly extreme actions of a small number of protestors is having this impact,” a council spokesperson declared.Demonstrators themselves were not above ridiculous assertions either: at a packed council meeting, one compared Amey’s workers to Nazi guards, just doing their jobs.Lavender and tea tree oils could be giving boys breasts, study warnsChina reassigns 60,000 troops to plant trees in bid to fight pollutionHow the Japanese fought suicide in the ‘Sea of Trees’For now, however, the potential turning point arguably came in March when a freedom of information request, asked by Paul Selby, forced the council to reveal it had indeed asked for 17,500 trees to be chopped down. The figure was so astonishing all three city MPs – all Labour – called for a rethink.In a disastrous interview on local radio, council cabinet member for environment Bryan Lodge – who declined to be interviewed for this piece – denied the figure was a target but could not explain what it actually was. Days later the suspension of felling was announced.What happens next is the question the city is asking itself.“We’ve already lost 6,000 trees,” says Selby. “Of course, there are some that should come down if they really are dying or doing irreversible damage to footpaths. But all other solutions should be sought first. Trees are a sign of a civilised city. We should be doing everything we can to save them.”Email cannot be used.

But with economic growth expected to come in weaker in Q1 owing to the snowy weather, and the need for further evidence of rising wage pressures, it will be a less clear-cut affair than anticipated,” said Tej Parikh of the Institute of Directors.Earlier this week sterling had risen to its highest level against the dollar since the Brexit vote - $1.4335 – as expectations grew of a May rate rise by the Bank of England.Sterling suffered a record intra-day plunge against the dollar of more than 11 per cent on the night of the June 2016 referendum, falling to $1.32.In January 2017 it hit a low of $1.21, before recovering over the course of the year.Despite the pound’s gradual clawing back of post-referendum losses against the dollar, the trade-weighted value of sterling – which values the UK currency against a basket of the currencies of our major trading partners – still stands 10 per cent down on its level before the Brexit vote.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The situation is made more urgent by the fact that the UK cannot even begin to negotiate replacement deals with other countries until it has left the EU.“It has become clear that negotiating our trade framework after Brexit will be a complex and time-consuming matter,” the MEPs wrote in the letter.“As political representatives of farmers and food exporters we are deeply concerned that the underestimation of the difficulty of this process should not impact negatively on them and hence on British trade.Molly Scott Cato, a Green MEP representing the strongly rural and agricultural South West, and one of the letter’s signatories, said: “Liam Fox’s infamous claim that securing a trade deal with the EU post Brexit would be the ‘easiest in human history’ has been exposed as total bluster and bravado. Boris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

the\u0026nbspalleged attack in DoumaTheresa May has won a second symbolic vote on her decision to launch airstrikes after another day of fraught parliamentary debate on Syria.The prime minister’s advisers believe the result shows she has successfully navigated difficulties arising from her move to push ahead with a military operation without first consulting MPs.But Jeremy Corbyn used the debate to demand that the House of Commons “take back our control” of decisions to launch any military action, with a new “War Powers Act”.The development came as inspectors were set to finally make it to the site of the alleged Douma chemical weapons attack on Wednesday, with Ms May accusing Moscow of preventing the scientists from doing their work.Ahead of the Commons vote on Syria, Ms May told MPs that coming to parliament before undertaking military action would “compromise the effectiveness of our operations and safety of British servicemen and women”.She attacked the suggestion of a War Powers Act, claiming it would remove “vital flexibility” from situations which are “by definition unpredictable”.She went on: “Making it unlawful for Her Majesty’s Government to undertake any such military intervention without a vote would seriously compromise our national security, our national interests, and the lives of British citizens at home and abroad.“And, for as long as I’m prime minister, that will never be allowed to happen.”She concluded by saying that after two days of debate no one could doubt her commitment to be held accountable by parliament, and also that the tone of the debate had been supportive to the strikes.A vote related to the Syria action was already won by the government on Monday, though it was not on a substantive motion – one that explicitly seeks to approve the action or not.The motion of Tuesday’s vote, which stated the Commons has “considered parliament’s rights in relation to the approval of military action by British forces”, was also neutral in tone.But Mr Corbyn called on his own MPs to vote against it, despite Labour having called the debate, to show opposition over how they believe the government sidelined parliament in relation to the military action.Before the motion was passed by 317 to 256, Mr Corbyn’s speech was met with bad tempered heckling from Tory MPs, who consistently tried to intervene while the Labour leader was talking.Speaker John Bercow gave warnings to Conservative backbenchers such as Alec Shelbrooke and Mark Harper during the course of the debate.Outlining his proposed War Powers Act, the Labour leader said it was for the Commons “to take matters into its own hands and take back our control”.He added: “There’s no more serious issue in decisions made by parliament on matters of war and peace, and the government taking planned military action.“That convention was established in 2003, it was enshrined in Cabinet in 2011, and the then the foreign secretary gave every indication that he supported the principle of parliamentary scrutiny and parliamentary approval of such a major step.“I’ve outlined the caveats that are there in a case of overriding emergency, but I do think it is very important that the House of Commons, as one of the oldest parliaments in the world, holds the government to account.”Earlier in the day the prime minister accused Moscow of preventing inspectors for the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) from reaching Douma.Russian officials at OPCW headquarters in The Hague later said arrangements were being made for the inspectors to travel

development”.Speaking at a press conference in Dublin, Yury Filatov suggested the strikes were intended to impede the investigation so nobody would know the truth, adding that experts have not yet found any traces of chlorine or any other toxic agents.“As far as we can see there was no attack,” he said. “Not a single local resident was able to confirm that a chemical attack had actually taken place.”Mr Filatov said the suspected chemical attack had “definitely been staged”, and that the images had been “fabricated”.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

They said if Florida were a separate country, it would be the world’s 26th largest carbon polluter.“The Sunshine State gets less than one per cent of its energy from solar power,” said Oscar Psychas, 20, from Gainesville, the oldest of the plaintiffs.Speaking at a press conference in the state’s capital, Tallahassee, he added: “Last spring I walked to 280 miles from my home in Gainesville to Tallahassee to demand our state’s leaders protect our wild places. During my walk I saw climate change firsthand during the hottest spring ever recorded in Florida and forests dying from sea level rise along the Gulf Coast. “I’m back in Tallahassee today because I’ve seen that when our leaders destroy a stable climate, everything we care about — our wild places, our communities, our basic rights to life, liberty, and property – is endangered.”Guy Burns, who is serving as lead counsel for the young plaintiffs said that Florida had an amazing opportunity to make use of its renewable energy sources, that included solar, wave and wind. Instead, he claimed the state government had promoted the use of fossil fuels. “It is the responsibility of the state to uphold the constitution, and these young people have a fundamental right to a stable climate system,” he said.The civil lawsuit is not seeking financial damages. Rather, it wants the court to order a science-based climate recovery plan and for the state government to acknowledge climate change is real and that climate change impacts are harming the youth plaintiffs. Turkey\u0027s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan announces early presidential and parliamentary elections for June 24, 2018, at the Presidential Palace, in Ankara.

This year\u0027s transition is seen as a test of whether the Cuban Communist Party can continue its one-party rule in the absence of its more well-known leaders.Mr Diaz-Canel has served as vice president of the powerful Council of State since 2013, when he was appointed by party leadership and approved by the National Assembly.

He started as a member of the Young Communists\u0027 Union in 1987, and became the first party secretary in Villa Clara province by 1994. He has also served as Cuba\u0027s minister of education, and lead delegations to Russia, China, Japan, North Korea, and several South American countries.Mr Diaz-Canel was born after the Cuban Revolution – one year after Fidel Castro took office – but has shown no signs of abandoning his revolutionary predecessors\u0027 policies.I believe in continuity, he told reporters who asked about his vision for Cuba\u0027s future, according to CNN. I think there always will be continuity.Mr Diaz-Canel is expected take office after Mr Castro retires this week, after serving two successive five-year terms. Mr Castro took over from his brother, Fidel, when he resigned in 2008. The two brothers have ruled the country since the revolution in 1959.Rual Castro is remembered for opening up the Communist country up to slightly more private enterprise, and for restoring diplomatic relations with the US under President Barack Obama. He will continue to serve as president of the Communist Party – a powerful government role. He attended and applauded Mr Diaz-Canel\u0027s nomination on Wednesday.Cuban elections are a multi-pronged process that start with the election of municipal representatives and end with the selection of the president. Candidates for many roles – including the president and vice president – are selected by government bodies.

The whole descent took about 15 minutes.It was reported that the passenger who died, Jennifer Riordan, was a Wells Fargo banking executive and well-known community volunteer from Albuquerque, New Mexico.She was reportedly on the way back from a New York business trip, where she had sent a tweet on Monday showing the view from her hotel in Midtown Manhattan with the caption: “Great business stay.” Her Facebook page shows she was married with two children.After the emergency landing ensured the survival of everyone else on board, Ms Shults was unofficially identified by passengers, rather than by Southwest Airlines.She is now being compared to Chesley ‘Sully’ Sullenberger, the pilot who in 2009 successfully landed a stricken US Airways passenger jet on the Hudson River, and whose life saving feat was turned into a film starring Tom Hanks. Turkey\u0027s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan announces early presidential and parliamentary elections for June 24, 2018, at the Presidential Palace, in Ankara.

Others wrote “#Iambreakingthelaw”.Weibo, which is similar to Twitter in format, appeared to then ban the hashtags and deleted many of the 150,000-plus comments related to them.The company’s Nasdaq shares fell in value on Friday amid the controversy.In an update on Sunday, Weibo said the “clean-up” would “no longer target gay content”.Censors will “primarily focus on pornographic and violent material,” the social network said, adding: “Thank you everyone for your discussions and suggestions.” The company had previously said it was acting in accordance with China’s cybersecurity laws.The Cyberspace Administration of China, the country’s internet regulator, has not commented.But the People’s Daily, the official paper of China’s ruling Communist Party, also appeared to criticise Weibo in an editorial on Sunday. “Intellectually speaking, there should be a consensus around respecting other people’s sexual orientation,” the column said, adding that comparing homosexuality to pornography and violence and regarding it as “abnormal” would go down badly with the public. Turkey\u0027s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan announces early presidential and parliamentary elections for June 24, 2018, at the Presidential Palace, in Ankara.

However, a traditional, conservative preference for conventional marriage and childbearing creates barriers for LGBT+ people. Following Weibo’s initial announcement on Friday, more than a million users have viewed hashtags in support of LGBT+ rights.Hua Zile, the founder of Voice for China LGBT, Weibo’s first LGBT-themed account, said he was encouraged by the widespread anger over the site’s censorship plan. “The response shows that we LGBT people in China are slowly realising our rights,” Mr Hua said. “Gay people who would not have spoken out years ago are now letting their voices be heard.” He said a Weibo manager had told him to stop posting while the “clean-up” was taking place.He complied, and his announcement that Voice for China LGBT would be going on hiatus was shared nearly 40,000 times. After Weibo’s u-turn, Mr Hua called on the firm to apologise to the LGBT+ community. “Like China, which has developed so quickly in such a short time, sex education in the country is a work in progress,” he said. On Sunday, an LGBT+ group of more than 100 people took part in a marathon in the city of Nanjing, holding rainbow flags to raise awareness of gay rights.The group had planned to take part in the marathon months in advance, but its organiser, Lucas Chen, said Weibo’s announcement gave it “added significance”. The main objective of joining the marathon was to “help everyone courageously come out of the closet,” Mr Chen said. “So it was meaningful that people online were also bravely speaking out and showing that they were not defeated by negativity.” or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

We are leave the customs union and will establish a new and ambitions customs arrangement with the EU while forging new trade relationships with our partners around the world.\u0026rdquoPALord Kerr said businesses want a customs unionLord Kerr was the diplomat responsible for drawing up Article 50, the legal mechanism for Brexit.Opening the debate this afternoon, he insisted businesses want a customs union.He told peers his amendment was phrased in such a which would require the Government to negotiate for a customs union deal.The Government would then need to explain to Parliament what it had done to try and secure it.GETTY IMAGESThe House of Lords vote is likely to reignite the debate over the UK\u0026rsquos customs union membershipIt would then ultimately be up to the EU to decide whether it wants to accept the terms, he said.Those in favour of the amendment insisted it would benefit Britain.Crossbench peer Lord Bilimoria said the change was needed to limit the damage caused by Brexit by keeping the UK in a customs union.Labour\u0027s Baroness Hayter of Kentish Town said the change was good for the governance of this country and would save the economy \u0026pound24billion over the next 15 years.What\u0027s the purpose of the House of Lords? How do you become a Lord? What are the House of Lords traditions? All these answers explained.1 of 25But UKIP Deputy Leader, Mike Hookem MEP lashed out at the House of Lords, branding the upper house of Parliament an an unelected nest of vipers who seem determined to reverse the EU referendum result\u0026rdquo.He said: Keeping the UK in the Customs Union is an absolute betrayal of Brexit, and the Lords know this.Under the proposals, the UK would have to continue to pay millions each week into the EU continue with open borders for EU citizens continue to implement EU law, and, most worryingly, join the developing EU army framework known as PESCO.I am in no doubt that the vast majority of the 17.4 million people who voted to leave the EU will be absolutely disgusted by the subversion of our democracy in the Lords today.

And all this will be subject to a research project led by Westminster University, to find out whether the English population will take to yoga and these sorts of treatments.Whether they will be helped by it and finally whether it will reduce the call on NHS resources leading to less GP consultations, hospital admissions and operations.During the visit the prince and the prime minister, who met in India when Charles briefly toured the country last year, were guided through an exhibition about Indian science and innovation.Their joint visit came ahead of the start of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) on Thursday, a two-day summit for world leaders which will be officially launched by the Queen.GETTYCharles was guided through an exhibition on Indian innovation during the eventCharles embodied the Anglo-India event by arriving in the I-Pace, Jaguar Land Rover\u0027s first fully electric car, to demonstrate links between British and Indian science and engineering as Jaguar is a subsidiary of Tata Motors, the Indian car company.Ian Blatchford, director of the Science Museum, said: I was very struck by the strong personal chemistry between the prime minister and Prince Charles actually. They were having a great time going round the exhibition together.The point of the exhibition is although we think Indians talk about the British empire a lot they don\u0027t really because we\u0027re a very tiny part of the story of India. The Indians were doing amazing stuff in mathematics and engineering long before us.Asked about the Science Museum\u0027s role in the Commonwealth he added: I\u0027m a great believer in the kind of work we do in terms of international cultural relations, it couldn\u0027t be more important than ever really.If we\u0027re going to do lots of trade deals with the Commonwealth we have to be talking about things that are not just transactions but our deep cultural bonds as well.
