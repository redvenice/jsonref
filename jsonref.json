Kate gazes adoringly at her newborn little...Kate Middleton royal baby LIVE: Latest news on new prince\u0027s...Share this articleAccording to a source, Kate and William are ‘very keen’ to make sure George and Charlotte are as involved as possible with their new brother, ‘hence the dash back to KP’ before bedtime last night.The couple are also determined to keep things as normal as possible for George, as he has just gone back to school for the summer term and they do not want his routine disrupted.For his part, William is good with the children in the nursery — one quality of his father Prince Charles that Diana acknowledged.    Prince George talks to his great-grandmother Queen Elizabeth ahead of the Christening of his sister Princess Charlotte  Prince Charles with Prince William and Harry pictured inside Kensington Palace (left) and the family with Princess Diana (right)          The grounds of Kensington Palace where the new prince has been taken this evening following his arrival today           An official pictured released for Prince George\u0027s birthday           Prince George, wearing a white dressing gown, greets Barack and Michelle Obama          Prince George plays with the Cambridge\u0027s family dog Lupo in the grounds of Kensington Palace‘It’s the home of a modern couple, lots of photographs of the children and the bits of artwork they bring home from school,’ says a friend.‘It’s a welcoming home, but William does guard their privacy and he limits the number of outsiders who are let in to the family circle.’ Evenings are often spent in front of the television with a take-away curry from Malabar in Notting Hill — collected by one of the orderlies, not delivered.          George and Charlotte wait in the window of Kensington PalaceWilliam has succeeded in creating something of the warm family atmosphere he found with the Middletons when he first knew Kate. But, as working royals, he long ago accepted that his and Kate’s home could never be quite like theirs. He’s matched them in one area, however — like them, he now has three children.By last night everything had been made ready in the Peter Rabbit-themed nursery to welcome home George and Charlotte’s new baby brother. I gather there are some new additions to the nursery, but no fresh licks of paint.There are, however, lots of new soft toys already — some from George and Charlotte — and many baby presents have also been delivered to the Palace.Officially, the couple say they won’t be hiring a maternity nurse to help with the early days of the new arrival. Insiders say Kate plans to breastfeed her new baby, but no one would think less of her if she did decide to call in specialist help, particularly during the night (a maternity nurse will normally sleep with the newborn and take the baby to its mother to be fed).After the birth of Prince George in 2013, Kate was on her knees with exhaustion because he hardly slept, and wanted his mother’s constant attention.When George was born, William and Kate had the builders in at Kensington Palace and were still living in cosy two-bedroom Nottingham Cottage.They almost immediately headed off to the Berkshire home of the Duchess’s parents.          The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge pose for photographs in the garden of Kensington Palace with their son George and dogsBy the time Charlotte arrived two years later, the £4.5 million refurbishment of Apartment 1A had been completed. With five reception rooms, three master bedrooms with adjoining dressing rooms and bathrooms, there is certainly plenty of space.The imaginative transformation includes a night nursery where Charlotte and George sleep, and a day nursery for playtime.On the first floor are the master bedrooms with en-suite bathrooms, and his-and-hers dressing rooms.          Prince Harry and Meghan Markle appeared in the grounds of Kensington Palace, where they live in Nottingham Cottage, after they announced their engagement.On the top floor, reached by a lift, are nine further bedrooms for staff, while a basement area where the photographer Earl of Snowdon once had his darkroom is now a well-appointed gym with laundry and luggage rooms nearby.The kitchen, on which the couple spent £170,000 of their own money, is the heart of this royal home, and where they like to entertain close friends and family.For more formal occasions guests, who arrive through a bright and airy entrance hall with intricate cornicing and black and white flagstones, are shown to one of the two drawing rooms — in one there is a grand piano and cream sofas with floral scatter cushions.Soon enough, the latest addition to the House of Windsor will no doubt be crawling all over them with mischief in mind."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/22/13/4B6C251F00000578-0-image-m-14_1524400230755.jpg","title":"Kate Middleton baby Prince Charles Middletons expected visit new royal baby","story":"Dress like a Duke in William’s blazer by Polo Ralph LaurenShop it here at MATCHESFASHION.COMThe whole Cambridge family were pictured at the Lindo wing at various points of the day that the newest addition arrived.

I had just got my first car: an enormous 1999 Crown Victoria, an ex-police car I bought off a Russian cab-driver in North Hollywood for $900. Why Philly? I had a mate living there, so with my new wheels I figured this was an ideal time to hit the road and see the country. It turned out to be fairly gruelling. I’d miscalculated the distance – and the quality of my vehicle – so what I thought would be a three-day drive was a solid five-day slog with little time for stopping. It was intense: a foot-down, white-knuckle, bald-tyres, 4,000-mile drive.Minneapolis was one of the few stops I made, four days in. It was a crisp Sunday morning and I decided to go for a wander with my camera. The streets were empty. It was a ghost town: there was nothing catching my eye. Then I turned a corner and was met with this scene in front of the courthouse: barristers marching around and maybe 60 or 70 Muslims milling about, the women separate from the men. I had no idea what was going on but things seemed a little tense.I knew I only had seconds to get this shot. I walked towards them, lifted my camera and managed to get one photo before they got up and moved. You can see in the image that the women in black look like they’re trying to hide – they weren’t happy I was taking a picture. The one in pink didn’t move, though. She just stared right back at me, which I think is what makes the image interesting. To me, she serves as a bridge: at a time when there is so much Islamophobia and judgment in the western world towards Muslims, it was a moment of connection.Later that day, I looked into what had been happening: it turned out a couple of Somali Americans had been accused of funnelling money to some extremist groups in Somalia. The court was in session and this group of women were the wives, family and friends of the men involved.I don’t trawl the streets looking for this kind of thing, but the subject matter is as interesting as the composition itself. I didn’t crop it, although I may have straightened up some of those lines. Taking photos of people when they don’t want you to isn’t my favourite thing. And the truth is, most people don’t want you to take their photo. But if you ask someone, often you lose whatever it was you wanted to capture. And there’s the rub. You can say that it’s in the cause of art, and this noble profession of documenting the world, which is an important thing to do. But I don’t think that gives you licence to do whatever you like. The key here was proximity: I was maybe 70ft away. I wasn’t in these people’s faces. I don’t think I was making them physically uncomfortable. I’m happy to photograph people from a distance.There are, of course, brilliant American photographers capturing life in the US. But personally, I’ve always been triggered by being in a foreign place. I am more likely to be analytical, to notice every little thing.

Showing the work of 15 leading international photographers in unique locations, this year’s theme, Up, centres on a subtle call to action. The festival’s directors, Lucille Reyboz and Yusuke Nakanishi, say participants were asked to illustrate how social change can be encouraged through self-awareness, action and creation.The use of unusual architectural spaces, from a disused printing works to the sanctuary of a temple, gives the festival a distinct flavour and adds another atmospheric dimension to each photographer’s work.The South African-born photographer’s installation, presented in a former ice factory and anchored by a series of portraits and video exploration of devastated living spaces, seeks to connect people affected by flooding and the catastrophic impact of industrial and environmental change. The Tidelines series is a collection of water-damaged photographs that provide a moving testament to the memories of family life before the floods.Exhibited in the depths of the disused ice factory is the astonishingly personal work by Alberto Garcia-Alix. Renowned for his raw, hedonistic portraiture, the maverick Spanish photographer’s early images focus on some of the people in his life. The photos set the scene for a dreamlike, retrospective film that is woven together with video, still images and his poetic narration, detailing a life led against the grain of convention and the lost aspirations of youth.Regarded as one of the most radical and influential photographers of his generation, the Fukase retrospective is a festival highlight. The extensive exhibition features the acclaimed series Ravens, which explores the artist’s battle with depression, as well as his vivid photographs showing the wild side of his beloved cat, Sasuke. The jewel in the crown is his early colour work, which was previously published but never exhibited. Viewed in its entirety, the Fukase display gives a deeper understanding of the variety and complexity of the photographer’s work.Izumi Miyazaki, one of the rising stars of the festival, is also the star of her work. Reminiscent of Magritte, at first glance her vivid use of colour and character seems whimsical, but her intent is a serious exploration of surrealism that leaves the viewer charmed and unsettled in equal measure. Miyazaki draws inspiration from her daily life, including what she has eaten.The Kyoto central wholesale market is the inspired venue for K-Narf’s tribute to the proud work ethic that is respected in Japanese culture. On the opening day of the festival, the photographer’s almost lifesize portraits of market traders caused a stir of excitement as members of the local community recognised their friends and colleagues. The project is centred on the local people and preserving their respect for the next generation, K-Narf says."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/22a4ce6071fb05850576dc9803e5cef3d12555ce/0_0_2000_1604/master/2000.jpg?w=720\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=5c392f66f989fcee71009b96512d9ace 1440w","title":"persimmon investors revolt bonus pay vote","story":"Housebuilder’s pay policy approved despite shareholder anger as many abstain from votePersimmon shareholdershave revolted against the “grossly excessive” and “totally and utterly unjustifiable” £75m bonus handed to the housebuilder’s chief executive, Jeff Fairburn.Several shareholders took to their feet at Persimmon’s annual meeting in York on Wednesday to express their outrage at the “enormous sums” awarded to Fairburn and other senior managers at Britain’s second biggest housebuilder. Stirling said that Fairburn’s offer to reduce his bonus from his legally entitled £110m to £75m “does not even get close to acceptable”. He said being the chief executive of a FTSE 100 company “requires a personal motivation that goes beyond simply amassing a fortune”.“Regardless of any moral or societal duties, company directors have a legal responsibility to act in the best long-term interests of the company that employs them,” Stirling said. “Today’s remuneration results suggest that the executive directors at Persimmon have lost sight of that because the long-term success of the company is being endangered by the reputational damage associated with grossly excessive pay.”Andrew Engleby, a private shareholder, told Persimmon’s board that he was sad, disappointed and angry that the “totally and utterly unjustifiable” awards were being paid. The huge bonus has been attacked by politicians, charities and corporate governance experts, who described it as “obscene”, “corporate looting” and a reward based on “taxpayer subsidies”. Vince Cable, the leader of the Liberal Democrats, said the “scale of this bonus is obscene” and built on a “government subsidy”. “It is reminiscent of the worst excesses of corporate greed that helped to create the financial crisis, when short-termism was heavily incentivised and long-term planning ignored.”Persimmon is one of the biggest beneficiaries of the government’s help-to-buy programme, which has lifted sales and boosted house prices across the UK.Fairburn did not respond to the shareholder outrage to his bonus, leaving Persimmon’s interim chairman, Nigel Mills, to field the criticism. He repeatedly apologised to shareholders for the flawed bonus scheme. Mills took on the interim chairman position after former chair Nicholas Wrigley resigned over his role in overseeing the bonus scheme, which was not capped to prevent an excessive payout.However, Mills said the board was powerless to force Fairburn and other senior managers to give up a greater proportion of their bonuses because of “contractual entitlements”. He added: “Please let me take this opportunity to apologise unreservedly to our shareholders. This could have all have been handled better. Indeed it should have been. It is a matter of profound regret that we got to the position where we had a company with an exceptional management team, delivering exceptional, market-beating performance , that has been overshadowed by a row over pay.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a30905547f41cd434ba8905d9734729b02d5f088/0_0_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8a4aa0b710bcb07dd380009c99450bde","title":"tsb online banking mobile app paul pester business live","story":"Some customers find that internet banking is restricted - or still not working, despite CEO saying it’s up and runningPenny Simpson has got back in touch, to report that she still can’t log into TSB’s internet banking service.Can we not dispel the myth that the online system is working, because if you have to spend hours everyday attempting to get in, then it isn’t working.TBS insists that things are running smoothly for the ‘vast majority’ of customers.Some, though, are still experiencing problems - such as Andy Sharps of Shropshire. He says TSB’s site crashed this afternoon as he tried to withdraw his money:TBS say they’re ‘working around the clock’ to put things right:TSB also warns that some customers are experiencing a delay in receiving text alerts, or may not receive them at all.It’s also taking longer than usual to isssue replacement debit and credit cards.Both these problems might not be fixed until the end of April.Despite CEO Paul Pester claiming that TSB’s internet banking is “Up and running”, some services are still in the “down and out” category.According to TSB’s service status page, there are still several problems.For example, internet and mobile banking customers still can’t view their mortgages online (which explains why some people found their loans had vanished this morning)Business banking customers are seeing errors when they try to reset their log-in details, and some also can’t see their standing orders in their banking app.Neil De Silva, a DJ and part-time model from Glasgow was unable to pay for additional luggage because he couldn’t get his TSB card to work, leaving him stranded in Thailand:“I ended up missing my flight to Singapore after my card was declined. Things then went from bad to worse as I couldn’t log into my bank account to transfer some savings to pay for a new flight.”Stacey and Louie Brown, who have recently been married in Thailand, had to borrow money from weddings guests to cover their costs.“My husband’s card was blocked but luckily we had friends and family with us who we borrowed from to pay for food and accommodation. We would have been sleeping on the beach otherwise,” says 31-year-old Stacey from Dorset, adding:“We’ve been trying to sign up to a emaster course as part of our honeymoon, but now the internet banking is down we can’t transfer any money. We’re now living on water and toasties and down to our last £40. Hopefully we will have access to our money again soon.”This is similar to the case of Matt, covered earlier in the blog.TSB’s online banking system still looks like a lottery, 11 hours after CEO Paul Pester tweeted that it was working again.Some customers, such as PA Liza Young, have managed to overcome its problems......but others, such as historian Guy Walters, are still frustrated.Breaking away from TSB briefly, UK housebuilder Persimmon is being given a bloody nose by shareholders.Investors at its AGM are angry at “totally and utterly unjustifiable” multi-million bonuses paid to its chief executive and senior managers, including a £75m award for CEO Jeff Fairburn. Stirling said that Fairburn’s offer to reduce his bonus from his legally entitled £110m to £75m “does not even get close to acceptable”. “The important point I referred to is that regardless of any moral or societal duties, company directors have a legal responsibility to act in the best long-term interests of the company that employs themToday’s remuneration results suggest that the executive directors at Persimmon have lost sight of that because the long-term success of the company is being endangered by the reputational damage associated with grossly excessive pay!”The Church of England has also weighed Persimmon in the balance, and found it wanting:The owner of the UK’s first and oldest luxury leather lingerie brand is also caught up in the TSB IT crisis.Jules Hawkins, 54, who owns Bristol-based Lux Tenebrae, has been unable to pay her staff through her TSB accounts.

It’s the end of the month and they have rent and bills to pay. Also, are my automated payments still going out? Did I just pay my tax? Don’t even get me started on trying to input my end of year tax return.”Matt from South Wales is on holiday in the Canary Islands and has been unable to pay for goods and services thanks to TSB’s botched IT migration:“I arrived on Saturday for a five night break and this has totally ruined my holiday. My card was declined in a restaurant I went to and I had to walk 50 mins back to my hotel as I didn’t have enough money to pay for a taxi.

I feel for everyone that’s having these problems and I can’t wait to get home to speak to someone from in person.They are not keeping their customers updated and they will lose a lot of customers due to this terrible service. How can we trust them after this?”Louise (not her real name) is a sole trader who holds both a business and current account with TSB: “The whole thing is a fiasco. I knew that the site would be down as TSB said they were ‘upgrading’ the business banking and instead of the trusty card reader that I’ve been using for years they would be introducing a system which uses an app instead. “Although I’m a web designer and tech savvy I didn’t want to install the app for various reasons (size, privacy, just don’t want it on my phone!) but did so reluctantly. The amount of permissions the app wanted was outrageous so I emailed them to say that I wasn’t happy and that from 25 May when GDPR comes into force I’d be contacting them every day to delete the unnecessary data that they were collecting via the app. “A very rapid response suggested that I order one of their basic devices instead, which I did. Credit where credit is due, it arrived promptly yesterday, just in time for the new system to be live. Except of course it’s not live. The system is still down. Also the basic device seems incapable of doing anything at all. This is one of those ‘upgrades’ that seems completely futile and designed to annoy customers.”A stream of TSB customers are reporting that they can’t get their TSB internet passwords to work.Penny Simpson tells me that she has been frozen out of her account, because the bank’s new IT system isn’t recognising customers’ existing passwords and memorable information.She says she’s not alone:I have spoken to more than a dozen people and nobody has managed to get through. Have we really gone through all this pain to install a system that can’t cope with 1.9m customers?Penny was eventually forced to drive eight miles to her nearest branch, Gillingham in Dorset. Staff looked like they’d “been in an earthquake”, she says.To take money out they have to use handwritten slips like the old credit cards. I wanted to know my balance which, after two or three attempts they were able to access.My direct debits have been going out - what a pity Paul Pester couldn’t have reassured customers that despite the problems, standing orders etc were being processed.However, I was told that this branch will be closing in May. My next nearest branch will be 26 miles away. Totally unacceptable.... I will move banks as soon as the system is running again.Another TSB customer, Louise Pennington, found herself at the back of a long queue:Other TSB customers are also reporting similar problems when they try to log on:Clean Sheet, a charity that helps former offenders to find work, can’t log into its TSB account to pay staff -- another sign that the IT meltdown isn’t fully fixed yet. readers have been in touch about how they’ve been affected by the TSB IT failures.Angela from Kent is concerned about her upcoming holiday:“We are going away on Saturday and can’t transfer money from our savings to buy holiday clothes and travel money.

I can live with all of that but yesterday my son couldn’t eat as I couldn’t transfer funds to his Parent Pay account. Everybody can have issues but the true measure is how you rectify them. TSB’s contingency has been very poorly thought out and will undoubtedly cost them long-term loyal customers.”Jos is on a low income, with no credit cards or savings accounts and unable to use his debit card:“I have £3.14 in my pocket, my wife is disabled and we can’t shop for food.

I don’t want to be in this family. I’m going to live somewhere else for ever.”By “somewhere else”, it turns out he means “on the front doorstep in East Finchley” by “live” he means “stand sulking” and by “for ever” he means “45 seconds”. There’s my little chip off the old block! He really has inherited his father’s rugged inidualism, defiance of convention and hunger for distant horizons.But both of us are put to shame by the unnamed Australian 12-year-old who, when his mum and dad cancelled the family holiday to Bali, thought, “Bugger that for a game of soldiers”, and went anyway. That is, he made free with the parental credit card, booking flights and a nice hotel online, then grabbed his passport and did one.He was reported missing, but nobody thought to check the airports (why would anyone have thought to check the airports, to be fair?) so it was nine days before it emerged that he had hopped on a plane in Sydney, changed in Perth and smartly checked into the Bali hotel he had booked, saying he was waiting for his sister to arrive.The report I read did not, regrettably, specify how he was found, but I like to think he was on a sun lounger in some garish board shorts, sporting a large soft drink with an umbrella in it, smiling winningly at the passing ladies. He is quoted as saying of his unaccompanied jaunt: “It was great because I wanted to go on an adventure.”What a little scamp! This unnamed lad joins a distinguished lineage of literary runaways that includes Treasure Island’s Jim Hawkins, Frankenstein’s monster (last seen “going on an adventure” on an arctic ice floe), most of Joseph Conrad’s heroes, and Macaulay Culkin in Home Alone 2: Lost In New York – which, unless I miss my guess, is where he learned how to talk his way into a hotel.As much as our reaction to this story will be to tut-tut about safeguarding procedures and joined-up policing, and how unimaginably awful it would be had our own children absconded like that, there’s a part buried in all of us that just thinks: what a baller! The adult face is a mask of horror the inner child yelps with envy. How many of us earnestly packed the contents of our piggy banks, a penknife or catapult and some essential provisions into a knotted hanky and ran away from home – only to be scooped up by our parents three-quarters of an hour later, having stopped to eat our Marmite sandwiches at the bottom of the street? In reality, running away from home – really running away from home – more often than not ends badly. Yet that does nothing to quash the romantic fantasy of circuses, a life at sea, or – as in this case – white sands, palm trees and drinks with umbrellas in them.And the fantasy has a grip on us because the older we get, the less courage we have. We may long to leave our lives and head out on the road like Woody Guthrie, Jack Kerouac and Reacher or The Littlest Hobo, but we won’t. Even when we were younger and less sensible, we didn’t. But we like to imagine we would have. So much so, that sometimes we pretend we did. Do you remember Tony Blair’s claim, soon debunked, that as a child he had tried to stow away on a flight to the Bahamas?Bali boy really did it, and he did it, in a sense, on behalf of all of us. Next time Jonah heads for the front door, I’m going to clasp him proudly to my bosom, slip my credit card into his pocket and whisper: “Run, Forrest, run!” into his ear. I may catch a certain amount of uphill from my wife, the police and members of the below-the-line commenting community, but it will be worth it.

References to the unhappy state of loneliness are scattered throughout the Bible. As the 17th century poet John Milton reminded us: “Loneliness is the first thing which God’s eye named not good.” However, it was only in the early modern era that people started talking about loneliness as a standalone problem. Until the 19th century, loneliness tended to be associated with the physical state of being apart from society or company. During the 19th century, loneliness became associated with people’s inner state, and philosophers such as Kierkegaard were preoccupied with the fear of loneliness.Until the 21st century, loneliness was principally a problem addressed by theologians, philosophers, sociologists, poets and artists. In recent times it has become an issue for health professionals. Unfortunately, once a dimension of the human condition becomes framed in the language of medicine, it is only a matter of time before it acquires the status of an epidemic. Inevitably, health professionals in the US have sounded the alarm on the loneliness epidemic.Loneliness is the fashionable new problem in the UK. Earlier this year the UK government appointed Tracey Crouch into the newly established post of minister for loneliness. The appointment follows a series of alarming reports about the prevalence of loneliness among elderly people this month the problem expanded to include young people. The Office for National Statistics reported that “young adults are more likely to feel lonely than older age groups”. Earlier this week, a study claimed that “lonely millennials” faced a variety of health and social problem.The medicalisation of loneliness mystifies a condition for which there is no cure. Loneliness often expresses the difficulty that we have in understanding our place in the world. When people struggle to come to terms with their self and find it difficult to gain affirmation, loneliness can assume the form of an existential crisis. The philosopher Hannah Arendt described loneliness as “that nightmare which, we all know, can very well overcome us in the midst of a crowd” when we feel “deserted by oneself”. She argued that this nightmare is a symptom of the difficulty we have in engaging with ourselves.Arendt believed that the destructive effects of loneliness could be contained through the habit of conversing with oneself. She called this “silent dialogue of myself with myself” solitude. For Arendt, solitude had a positive connotation. She wrote that “though alone, I am together with somebody (myself) that is”.Arendt’s attempt to convert loneliness through an inner dialogue into solitude offers one way of coming to terms with our estrangement from ourselves, Others, such as the writer Maya Angelou, found refuge in music. “I could crawl into the space between the notes and curl my back to loneliness”, she wrote. Still others, such as the existentialist feminist writer Simone de Beauvoir, embraced loneliness and sought to harness its creative force. What they all understood was that we can exist with loneliness through finding value in our solitude. Meaning, rather than a cure, helps us deal with the problems of existence.• Frank Furedi’s How Fear Works: Culture of Fear In The 21st Century will be published in June by Bloomsbury Press."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0394e7c40126085879289e828deed1196e0630a6/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2126e6a9e2013db0d760ada484b63e6c","title":"biggest style secret designer meghan markle royal wedding dress","story":"With less than a month to go until the royal wedding, speculation is mounting, with Stella McCartney, Erdem and Christopher Bailey among the runners and ridersThe London-based label designed by thirtysomething Australian couple Tamara Ralph and Michael Russo is the odds-on favourite. Britain’s only haute couture house would be a patriotic choice with a full-service couture atelier handily situated close to Markle’s Kensington home. What’s more, the aesthetic – think superyacht glamour – has the requisite scale for the cathedral proportions of St George’s Chapel. January’s haute couture show closed with a wedding dress in double-faced duchess satin with a draped sweetheart bodice embroidered with Swarovski jewelled leaves, grand flounced skirt with pearlescent micro beads and scalloped lace veil. A semi-sheer black gown by Ralph \u0026amp Russo was the most eyecatching look in the couple’s portfolio of engagement photos. A “well-placed source” has apparently been briefing the press from the atelier that there is “talk of lace”, possibly the least revealing revelation in bridal fashion history. The duo have “declined to comment”.The woke choice. The strongest statement Markle could make would be to emphasise ethics with a sustainable, ethically sourced and made gown by Stella McCartney. When I interviewed her last week, McCartney definitely did not deny being The One. (On the other hand, having your name on lists like this one is good PR, so why deny it, even if the phone never rang?) Markle has worn Stella McCartney several times, including the caped gown she chose for the Queen’s birthday party at the weekend. Plus, the McCartneys are, in a way, British royalty. But while McCartney has made wedding dresses, including a corsetted gown with a long train for Madonna’s Scottish castle wedding in 2000, she is not really known for frills or romance. Her sleek, streamlined aesthetic is a more natural fit for Markle’s everyday wardrobe than for a wedding day. Very possibly a contender for a slinky gown for the evening reception.A persistent outlying rumour links Christopher Bailey, the outgoing Burberry designer, with the wedding dress. Bailey has a longstanding relationship with Markle, having dressed her character on Suits. “I wear a lot of Burberry on the show because Rachel’s whole aesthetic is someone who comes from money and has a real classic design sensibility,” Markle has said. Points in favour: Burberry is a marquee name of British fashion the fashion industry would be utterly charmed by a royal swansong for the universally liked Bailey he is a discreet, mature character who could handle the palace and be trusted to keep a secret. Burberry is known for trenchcoats, not fairytale glamour gowns, but Lily James’s inky red-carpet showstopper at February’s Baftas was by Burberry. So you never know. Backstage after Erdem’s most recent London fashion week show, he explained that his inspiration this season was Adele Astaire, Fred Astaire’s sister, who married into the British aristocracy. Later that day, at a fashion week reception at Buckingham Palace, his long-term client the Duchess of Cambridge made a beeline across the room for a chat. So I did ask, obviously, but he just giggled and raised his eyebrows. Make of that what you will. Erdem has Canadian connections in common with Markle, who lived in Toronto for six years. She has also worn Erdem’s clothes for years, choosing a printed maxi-dress for a wedding she attended with Harry in Jamaica last year. The recent expansion of Erdem’s small London team has added fuel to this fire. Aesthetically, this would be the most fashion-forward choice. Last year, he took the young Queen Elizabeth’s meeting with Duke Ellington at a jazz club as a starting point for a catwalk collection of rewired, quirky royal glamour. A charteuse silk gown with a tulip shaped skirt featured dense black embroidery and three outsize red silk bows at the breastbone, worn with flat mules and a quiff. Two words: Norman Hartnell. The logic against Sarah Burton creating a spectacular Alexander McQueen gown for the royal wedding is that Burton created a spectacular Alexander McQueen gown for the last royal wedding seven years ago. But history shows that this does not rule Burton out. Norman Hartnell designed the Queen’s wedding dress in 1947, and her sister Margaret’s in 1960. A second dress commission would strengthen the ties between the royal family and Alexander McQueen, perhaps the most iconic British fashion label of modern times. The royal family set a lot of store by trust, and Burton did an exemplary job both of designing the dress and of not breathing so much as a word about it. The “Fab Four” of William and Kate plus Harry and Meghan is a compelling new framing of the royals, and this would give it an elegant symmetry."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a101f4ff3abc24541e7476bd7dac5296a7915884/0_110_5102_3060/master/5102.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e0dec33bce1077a21395e3b0425ab144","title":"nico 1988 film velvet underground tribeca","story":"The director and star of a drama about the latter years of the cult singer talk about her unusual life and how she battled against her beautyAccording to the director of a daring new movie about Nico, the most notable aspects of the late singer’s life had nothing to do with the Velvet Underground, Andy Warhol, or her glamorous roles as model and muse. “Most people think that after her experience with the Velvet Underground and the Factory, Nico simply ‘became a fat junkie’ and disappeared,” said Susanna Nicchiarelli. “But to me, the second part of her life is so much more interesting than the first. That’s when she really became herself.”Not that it’s an entirely pleasant, fair or rational person that she became. That’s made clear in Nico 1988, which makes its US debut this week at the Tribeca film festival before a summer release. Unlike every previous dramatic portrayal of the star, which focused on her Dolce Vita years, when she attracted lovers from Jim Morrison to Jackson Browne to Alain Delon, Nico 1988 chronicles the final two, uncelebrated years of life. By then, she was an addict, shooting heroin into whatever covert part of her body she hadn’t yet poked. Nico was also overweight and, sometimes, malodorous. “I very rarely take showers,” her character boasts in the film.As a personality, Nico is often portrayed in the movie as obstinate, self-involved, paranoid and reckless. But she also displays a punky defiance and she had enough focus to create some of the most unusual, important andmost personal music in her career, on solo albums like The Marble Index, Desertshore and The End. At her concerts in the 80s, several of which I caught in New York, Nico exuded a morbidity so transfixing it later inspired some observers to cite her as the first goth, presaging artistic ghouls from Siouxsie Sioux to Bauhaus. As portrayed in the film, Nico also possessed an inner life as strange and haunted as her music. It’s captured in exquisite detail by the Danish actor Trine Dyrholm, who plays the star and sings all of her songs. Though she neither looks like nor sounds exactly like Nico, she nails her sad and dreamy core. Finding the right approach for the vocals proved tricky. The clumsiness of Nico’s singing meant that recreating it precisely could have seemed like a satire. Somehow Dyrholm found a sweet spot between accuracy and invention – as well as between sincerity and irony. “When she sang, Nico was often out of tune, and sometimes she sounded really awful,” Dyrholm said. “But that doesn’t matter. She told a story in her songs. I viewed her songs as monologues to capture the emotional state of the character.”Her state often reflected a hard past. The movie opens with a scene of a young Nico watching her city, Berlin, burn at the end of the second world war. “She was old enough at the time to understand what the defeat of her country meant,” Nicchiarelli said. “She grew up in terrible conditions. She suffered hunger. That was something that shaped her character.”Nico also struggled with guilt over her father’s role in the war. She often lied about his circumstances, falsely reporting to many that he helped rescue Jews. “It’s interesting that Nico was born in 1938 and died in 1988, a year before the end of the cold war,” Nicchiarelli said. “She never saw her country reunified. It’s as if the war never ended for her.” During much of the time that the film takes place, Nico lived in Manchester, a city she tells a local radio DJ she had chosen because it reminded her of the ruined Berlin. Other parts of the interview demonstrate her frustration with the endless interviewers who only want to know about the Velvet Underground. When the DJ introduces her as “Lou Reed’s femme fatale,” she barks: “Don’t call me that.” When asked if she wants to talk about the Velvet Underground, she growls: “No, I don’t.” And after the DJ rudely muses that 1968 must have been the best year of her life, she drily sneers: “Well, we took a lot of LSD.” “I like the fact that she’s not a pleaser,” Dyrholm said. “She’s a no bullshit type.” At the same time, Dyrholm admits “she’s obviously not likable”. Nicchiarelli calls Nico “infuriating”. Much of the movie follows the singer on the road in Europe, as she tussles with her band, a largely untalented group of misfits. It’s much the same ground covered by the 1993 memoir The End, written by the group’s keyboardist, James Young. While Young’s vivid account couldn’t be more withering, or hilarious, Nicchiarelli takes a more balanced approach. She finds an earnest core for her story by spending key time on Nico’s relationship with her son, Ari, with whom she reunited late in her life. Born out of wedlock, Ari is widely reported to have been fathered by Delon, though the French actor has always denied it. Even so, his parents wound up raising the boy when Nico proved unfit for the task. “I believe the love of her life was Ari,” Nicchiarelli said. Ari has seen the film and, according to the director, came away greatly impressed by Dyrholm’s interpretation of his mother. Nico suffered significant guilt over her inability to care for her son, blaming herself for the mental health problems he faced, which are harrowingly depicted in the film. The movie also deals with Nico’s battle against her beauty. “She wanted to destroy it,” Dyrholm said. “Imagine being so beautiful that it becomes a burden.”Nicchiarelli sees in Nico’s rejection of beauty a kind of strength. “While many women and men don’t accept that we change, she dealt with it,” she said. “At the same time, she was very careful about her new look. She always dyed her hair and she always wore makeup, even if it was weird. She would paint her face white.”Before the end of her life, Nico cleaned up to some degree by switching to methadone. She was staying with Ari in Ibiza when she suffered a cerebral hemorrhage, leading to her death. The music she made in her later years, culminating in 1985’s Camera Obscura, got at something dangerous and deep. “In her music, you can hear that she’s carrying around a knowledge of death,” Dyrholm said. “She had this deep darkness in her but also a really strong energy.”“Ultimately, what I like about her is that she’s not the cliche of the fragile woman,” Nicchiarelli said. “She knew what she wanted. She wanted to make her own music, and she did it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1cc1329955f64b1f583a81696403febf14b89a2d/316_57_1956_1174/master/1956.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eb5b14541fec30bd5eb3088ab4167f5a","title":"arsene wenger leave arsenal not my decision","story":"• Speaking before Atlético tie, manager says he will not retire• ‘With two or three additions, this team can fight for title’Arsène Wenger has provided the clearest indication yet that he did not want to leave Arsenal by revealing the timing of the decision was not down to him. The manager of almost 22 years announced last Friday he would depart at the end of the season, with the understanding being he jumped before he was pushed.Gazidis and the rest of the club’s hierarchy had been increasingly worried about the team’s poor Premier League performance and it had become clear they did not want to retain Wenger for the final season on his contract.Wenger was asked on Wednesday – before the first leg of the Europa League semi-final against Atlético Madrid at the Emirates Stadium – why he was quitting when he had another year to go on his deal. “The timing was not really my decision,” he replied. “For the rest, I have spoken about it already.”The 68-year-old made it plain that he intended the seek another job in management – “I will continue to work, that’s for sure,” he said – while he believes his successor will inherit a team that, with a few correct moves, can win the Premier League title.“This group of players deserves something special. I want to do it for them, to achieve something with them because I feel they have a special mental quality. My biggest satisfaction would be to be successful together with the group of players that I have. I’ve seen them behave the whole season and they deserve it.“It will be a Champions League night, of course – on a double level. First of all, a ChampionsLeague position is at stake, more for us than them and secondly because the two teams are two clubs who are used to playing in the Champions League. That is why I believe it is a Champions League night.”Luis Enrique, the former Barcelona manager, is the favourite to take over from Wenger. Arsenal’s head of football relations, Raul Sanllehi, worked with Enrique at the Camp Nou and is believed to be pushing his case.“I have a high opinion of Luis Enrique,” Wenger said. “I do not want to influence the job for the next manager but of course I have a high opinion of him.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/86b044242ca09d89c983d6f0278cbe05c7627cc8/0_0_2265_1359/master/2265.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=069cf8ba9a9105d3538d79ae6be04b72","title":"jorge mendes wolves efl comply","story":"The EFL has announced that it is satisfied with the status of the Portuguese agent Jorge Mendes at Wolverhampton Wanderers, following concerns raised by Leeds United and other Championship clubs.The EFL said Mendes’ involvement - as an agent and as an advisor to the club and to its owner, the Chinese conglomerate Fosun - does not amount to a formal role. Because Mendes is not a director nor formally representing Fosun or controlling Wolves’ dealings, the EFL concluded following “a comprehensive review of the detail” Wolves supplied, that he did not have to be cleared under its owners and directors test, formerly known as the “fit and proper person test.”Now promoted from the Championship, Wolves’ ownership structures and relationship with Mendes will be scrutinised further by the Premier League, whose executive chairman, Richard Scudamore, is understood to have been asked by at least one club to bear in mind the concerns raised in the Championship.The Leeds owner, Andrea Radrizzani, tweeted last month that the Wolves ownership arrangements were “not legal and fair” because Fosun also owns a stake in Mendes’ agency Gestifute. Radrizzani then wrote to the Football Association, EFL and Premier League seeking clarification of the relationship with Mendes.The EFL statement in response deals with only part of the clarification sought. FA rules prohibit a company or person who owns a club to also own a stake in an agency Wolves’ arrangements are thought to pass because the stake in Gestifute is not directly held by Fosun but by a company owned by its chairman, Guo Guangchang.The FA’s rules aimed at preventing conflicts of interest also forbid an agent from being in a position to exercise any material, managerial or “any other influence over the affairs of a club” whether directly or indirectly.Wolves’ managing director, Laurie Dalrymple, confirmed last week that Mendes advises the club’s owner, has given advice on players – the manager, Nuno Espírito Santo, is a longstanding Mendes client - and that players “connected” to Mendes have been signed. Dalrymple maintained that no rules have been broken. The FA has not commented."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c365a51f70b5dd39240ad42d2d776277df84349f/0_60_2878_1726/master/2878.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ed21efa183c2e70e4f16982fe7c5148f","title":"jurgen klopp liverpool roma champions league semi final","story":"The manager’s measured assessment of the exhilarating 5-2 Champions League semi-final victory contrasts with the blame game of his Roma counterpart Eusebio Di FrancescoUefa ranked Liverpool the No1 team in Europe in February 2009 based on a five-year period of success and consistency under Rafael Benítez. A month later they revelled in that status with a 4-0 destruction of Real Madrid that took Benítez’s team into the Champions League quarter-finals, following a semi-final appearance in 2008, a runners-up spot in 2007 and the ultimate triumph in 2005.Klopp’s Liverpool cannot compare with that body of work in only his second full season as manager. His team have, however, reached a level of exhilarating attacking brilliance in this Champions League campaign that their predecessors would envy. And just like the quality of Salah’s goals, they are improving.The 5-2 first leg romp over Roma made it 38 goals in the Champions League this season for Liverpool. It is 44 when the qualifier against Hoffenheim is included. With 10 goals apiece, Salah and the crucial Roberto Firmino now share the record for most goals in a single European campaign by a Liverpool player. Along with Sadio Mané, who should have had a hat-trick on Tuesday, they form the most prolific forward line in the competition – 28 goals and counting. And Liverpool have scored in each of their six European away fixtures this term.Roma’s obligation to attack in Stadio Olimpico next Wednesday will whet Liverpool’s appetite for more. “I learned tonight that we can win the second leg, too,” admitted Klopp, though he was in no mood to celebrate after losing Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain to a serious knee injury.Post-match interviews are framed by emotion but the contrasting approaches of the managers in the aftermath of the first leg also bodes well for Liverpool’s pursuit of a sixth European Cup.Eusebio Di Francesco, the Roma coach, abdicated responsibility for the high defensive line and three-man rearguard that invited Salah to destroy his former club with one of the finest inidual performances in Europe that Anfield has witnessed.It was his players’ fault, Di Francesco claimed, for losing too many inidual duels and allowing the Liverpool midfield to launch the “lethal” breaks that Roma had focused on stopping in training. “My Roma players don’t need to tell me about Salah,” ran the headline on the ’s interview with Di Francesco this week. Someone should have done.“We don’t need miracles” was the gist of the Roma coach’s message as he inevitably invoked memories of their quarter-final comeback against Barcelona. As others quickly pointed out, Liverpool achieved a level of dominance over the Italian side on Tuesday that the Spanish league leaders never did, not even during their 4-1 first leg victory at Camp Nou.Roma were given hope at Anfield by the two late away goals that followed Salah’s substitution. It is unlikely to be hope but the magnificent Egyptian that kills them in the return.Klopp took a different line to Di Francesco by accepting responsibility for a scoreline that everyone at Liverpool would have embraced before kick off. “If someone wants to say it is my mistake they scored two goals because I changed the striker I have no problem with that,” he said, having pointed out that it was one defensive lapse and one penalty decision that enabled Roma to close the gulf.The real threat of Salah’s exit was to limit Liverpool to five. Just the five goals, in a Champions League semi-final, and with Oxlade-Chamberlain adding to an ominous injury list Klopp had every reason to protect the forward line that is slicing through Europe.Oxlade-Chamberlain has been an increasing influence on the Champions League campaign but is not expected to play again this season after his knee buckled when challenging Aleksandar Kolarov at Anfield. Adam Lallana and Emre Can are also long-term absentees, although Can does have a chance of returning from a back injury before 26 May. His rehabilitation may just have stepped up a notch at Melwood today.Georginio Wijnaldum was formidable when he replaced the England international against Roma, however, while Jordan Henderson and James Milner – whose nine assists are the record for a Champions League season – were again outstanding in Europe as they turned the semi-final in Liverpool’s favour. The last three senior midfielders standing at Anfield will get no relief in the days ahead. On to Stoke."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb8a9370d80af599fb0d73d0640715d47bbc3f53/0_30_2636_1582/master/2636.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=53d9d594e6150d8e5f6bb3d6fdb56ca9","title":"james milner liverpool in vogue barney ronay","story":"Sometimes the cock crows at midnight, the cats bark a dawn chorus and the cow does indeed jump over the moon. Just as every now and then a football statistic crops up that goes against every prevailing metric and trend, which seems not so much an anomaly as a case of football simply kicking off its shoes and enjoying itself.Only the stoniest heart could fail to be cheered a little by the news that James Milner is now out there alone as the most incisive creative player over the course of a single season in Champions League history.Not only has Milner contributed more goalscoring assists than Lionel Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo, Neymar, Andrés Iniesta and Xavi. He has done it having played fewer minutes than all of them, and while shouldering close to zero creative expectation, performing in effect as a defensive midfielder and occasional full-back.As Roma wobbled and reeled like a boxer punched out of shape in the second half at Anfield on Tuesday night, Milner’s right-wing corner was headed in by Roberto Firmino to take his own total to a record nine assists this season in world football’s premier club competition. This probably should not be happening. Milner himself was moved to tweet a typically wry response to Uefa’s celebration of this achievement, in the process sub-referencing and also contradicting his own Boring Milner persona (do keep up).And yet there it is all the same, tribute to Milner’s underrated precision at set pieces, his fine, accurate crosses with both feet, and indeed to Liverpool’s own strikingly well-drilled team dynamic. All this with a second leg in Rome and quite possibly a final in Kiev to come. For Milner these are some hard-earned, late-breaking high notes to a career spent close to, but often a little in the shadows of, the main stage.Milner does not start every week for Liverpool. He probably would not have played on Tuesday night if Emre Can were fit. But he is now unavoidably central to Jürgen Klopp’s plan for the remainder of the season following the trauma of Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain’s knee injury in the first half at Anfield.As things stand Liverpool will face Roma, Chelsea and quite possibly Real Madrid or Bayern Munich with only Jordan Henderson, Gigi Wijnaldum and – yes – Europe’s deadliest provider of assists to fill the central midfield.Not that this should be a concern judging by Tuesday night. Milner’s performance against a team who had beaten Barcelona last time out was good enough to earn him a 7.5\u0026nbsprating from the notoriously sniffy Gazzetta Dello Sport, below only Mohamed Salah and Roberto Firmino. And yet there is still an element of double-take to Milner’s presence as a key part of the finest attacking display at this stage of the Champions League since Bayern’s World Cup winners-in-waiting walked through Barcelona’s era-defining club team five years ago.Perhaps the most intriguing part of the current Milner Supremacy is that there are no obvious changes to his game. This is not an act of alchemy, the dramatic discovery of some hidden superpower by Professor Klopp, wheeling himself in through the conservatory doors, cranium throbbing. At Anfield Milner was simply himself once again, a footballer without a turn of pace, with no eye-catching technical skills, or obvious extreme qualities beyond the vital ones of intelligence, stamina and versatility.As Liverpool wrestled with Roma’s power and craft in the opening 20 minutes Milner was diligent and compact. As Liverpool surged into that annihilating Red Zone midway through the half Milner was diligent and compact. As Roma scored two late goals Milner was still diligent and compact, not to mention a little unlucky to concede a late penalty.He remains Milner the mule, an endearingly dogged, biddable figure, approaching each box-to-box shift like a plucky Soviet tractor steadily ploughing its way to the horizon and back again. Alongside the more deep-lying version of Henderson he provides a vital element of stillness at the heart of this attacking whirl of a team. Milner knows where to stand, where to cover, is free of the kind of creative ego that might lead him galloping into the wrong part of the pitch.His success points to the best part of Liverpool’s fine run, to the primacy of team and system that has so many players in this XI performing to their maximum capacity in bespoke, and perhaps untransferable tactical roles. Just as Roberto Firmino is the perfect Klopp centre‑forward, with no need to measure him against others doing other jobs in other teams, so the presence of Milner-Henderson at the peak of European club football points to the importance of balance over starrier qualities.In isolation Henderson+Milner might look a pretty ordinary collection of footballing attributes. But just as Klopp has talked about needing everyone to push the train, the players just component parts, so Milner and Henderson are the perfect piston engine behind the whistles and sparks and steam of that eye-catching attack. This is probably the best explanation for those assist stats too, a sign not of inidual brilliance but of a functioning and indeed highly specialised team. Milner’s job in that midfield three is to close the space, to get the ball and to give it to the people who score the goals, something he has done with great efficiency.Should Liverpool make it to Kiev no doubt some will suggest Milner might be tempted from international retirement, that a midfield two that can perform at such a level might just be England’s best bet in Russia. This would be to misunderstand the best parts of Milner’s success in the Champions League. Were England looking to replicate the Liverpool style, to play fast-pressing shock‑metal football then it might well be an ideal fit. But England play slowly under Gareth Southgate. This is lounge-jazz football, a carefully geared soft-metal style that requires if anything a little acceleration in midfield.Instead the lessons of late Milner are the primacy of the system, the value of versatility and those hard‑won game-management skills. And beyond that of a player who, like a footballing version of late‑career Johnny Cash, is fashionable once again simply by walking at the same speed, doing the same things, waiting for the right team, the right moment to take shape around him."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bea52af437c2a71cebe3edae2be2a2f048fcf6c5/0_300_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d5a97f52a068f0024cb4ce5958b2575f","title":"bayern munich v real madrid champions league semi final first leg live","story":"Welcome to the ’s minute-by-minute coverage of first leg of the Champions League semi-final between Bayern Munich and Real Madrid at the Fußball Arena München, the 25th time these heavyweights have met in European competition.

If you’re looking for nuance in the kitchen, this is not for you. But\u0026nbspif you are time-poor, appliance-shy or incompetent,\u0026nbspthen it is. It is so straightforward to make, so utterly bake-by-numbers, I half-expected to find it came with a sachet of enzymes to help you digest the thing. Alas not.Dr Oetker launched its baking kits late last year with little fanfare. The German-owned food company’s UK branch is based on an industrial estate in Lancashire opposite Crossleys, a company that repairs caravans – another sort of box. Yet Dr Oetker has become one of the leading manufacturers of frozen foods and baking equipment. It dominates the market. Put simply, the bake in the box cake is evolution.I get my hands on the lemon and poppy seed loaf (other varieties include banana and choc chip, and double chocolate). To make it, you remove the lid and empty the mix into the box. Whisk seven tablespoons of milk in using a fork (since we’re on a convenience tip, I use the same tablespoon) and pop into an oven, preheated to 190Cgas mark 5. Remove after 10 minutes, score a 1cm-deep groove down the middle of the cake and return to the oven for a further 20\u0026nbspminutes.This is convenience food from the same school as boil in the bag and microwave meals: all designed to help “overcome the barriers consumers face when it comes to home baking”, says the company. It’s a valid argument, although there’s something conflicting about the almost tyrannical convenience and the fact that it still takes 30 minutes to bake. But it works, and the cake is fine: lemony, dense, too sweet but adequate.The good news is that Dr Oetker didn’t try to gender it with a pink box, or deploy a fun font to make it look hip. The bad news – and I discovered this after eating the cake\u0026nbsp– is that Dr Oetker has a Nazi past. Richard Kaselowsky, a past owner of the firm, was a “leading supporter” of Hitler. The company’s president at that time – and son of the original doctor – Rudolf-August Oetker joined the Nazi party in the 1930s, news that was later exposed by his son, August Oetker – to his credit – because, according to a spokesman: “The business felt it important to be transparent about any mistakes that were made in the past, set the facts straight once and for all and do everything to prevent anything like the Third Reich happening again.” So\u0026nbspthere you go.But back to the cake. Dr Oetker’s Bake in the Box is ridiculously simple to make – it would take a colossal muppet to mess it up and yet, I did. Halfway through, I\u0026nbspdecided to add lemon juice to zhoosh it up – but in my attempt to rip up the rulebook, as it were, I\u0026nbspended up ripping the box.

But what do you think? Send us your thoughts and responsesOur community of 70 families is facing being made homeless by our landlord, who wants to knock down our estate to build executive-style houses to sell for profit. They are rare houses of a specific construction – built by the National Coal Board in the 1950s – and can be modernised without being knocked down. We have organised a lot around this application. We’ve put signs up with our “Save our homes” logo and have a banner prominently displayed. We have residents’ meetings, a regular newsletter updating residents, a website and a change.org petition, as well as a Facebook account and are hoping to have a local demo in May. We have even organised a bat survey on the building to see whether any bats shelter in the property – which protects a building from being demolished, as a last resort. We feel our landlord is making contradictory statements about whether we will get to keep our tenancies. In some cases they say they won’t be able to decide on the tenure of the new homes until they have planning permission, but at other points they have said it is unlikely we will be forced out or that we would be made to leave at all. This is confusing, as the planning application – to bulldoze over where we live and replace it with new houses – has always stayed the same. Our campaign has had some success so far. There are lots of objections on the planning site, not just from our estate but from friends and family outside, and others who have heard about our campaign. Due to the large number of objections the decision will go before a panel where we will get the chance to have our say, probably in June. But amid all this campaigning, we are fearful it may amount to nothing. While many of us on the estate are low-income families, we are all private tenants, and feel it is harder to get the same national attention and outrage that is received when social housing is being demolished. How can we protect our homes and stop the demolition of these rare, truly affordable homes that are so vital to our sense of community, home, and the right to be housed for low-income groups in Leeds?What an impressive campaign, and what a sad situation. A local demo will be a good way to broaden your appeal. Think about holding it earlier – with local elections coming, you can show politicians you are serious, and that local people care about this campaign.Look through Leeds council’s local plan, and check whether this development disagrees with its aims in any areas, be it around affordable housing, the environment, or conservation – this is important for the panel. Refurbishment is generally a greener option than demolition, and that should play a strong role in the council’s considerations. And think about other possible interest groups you can bring in, like ex-mining communities that care about the legacy of these properties.I spoke to successful housing campaigners for you. Glyn Harries, from the New Era campaign says to start thinking about direct action. Decide for yourselves: what happens if push comes to shove? What are you willing to do? And are there concrete actions you can start developing now? Make it clear that you are willing to take non-violent direct action. One simple thing, is deciding to make a clear statement on whether you plan to leave your homes. Dr Stuart Hodgkinson from Leeds University says: “They might be private renters with fewer rights, but if all 70 say they have no plans to leave, it will be a big financial operation to evict them all.”Consider your options: could you create a non-profit organisation and seek to buy the homes yourself, with fundraising? If you don’t want the homes to be demolished, you should also get expert advice. Find out what all the costs will be – of eviction, redevelopment, or potential homelessness – so you can make people aware of what costs the private developer may be avoiding, and who will end up paying for it – for example, in their tax bill. And look at the cost of alternatives, like bringing these homes up to a decent standard instead of demolition.Look into the developer too: find out what other companies it has links with, look into its accounts at companies house, see what other developments it owns, and talk to residents from those homes to see how they live – all these things will help you to know what you’re up against, and just what kind of company it is.You have a lot of friends out there – activists who have won successful campaigns, like New Era and Sweets Way have offered their contacts, and the Butterfield estate could have good advice. Let me know if you want more details. Generation Rent has agreed to put you in touch with iniduals where you are. Hodgkinson has asked me to pass on his number.Finally, say Harries and Hodgkinson, celebrity doesn’t hurt. You’re a well-oiled machine, but if you had a well-known Yorkshireperson backing your cause, it would bring huge public attention. Think about who that might be.• What do you think?

But if these weren’t reasons enough already to start the NHS Couch to 5k programme and register for a free local run, then here is another: parkrun makes you happier.Aside from the physical effects of regular exercise on the body, it is clear that one of the reasons parkrun has such a positive impact is its sense of community. As Ian Young, who lives with PTSD, has competed in the Invictus Games and is also a run director for parkrun in County Durham, says: “There is a huge sense of belonging and achievement and both Strava and parkrun are a great way to meet up to run, socialise and make new friends – providing me with a great support network.”A 2017 survey showed that GPs, nurses and physiotherapists now even “prescribe” parkrun to their patients. Paul Sinton-Hewitt, who created parkrun in 2004, has said: “Belonging to such social and supportive networks, which show the joy that regular physical activity brings, can be a significant catalyst for it becoming a lifelong habit”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/971d4bcf64fbaef30f3f6839807761e52483317d/134_0_3270_1963/master/3270.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4f1931b0e1592c9cc993e30237141ba9","title":"uk among the worst in western europe for press freedom","story":"Latest global ranking places Britain behind Uruguay, Samoa and Chile for restrictions on reportersThe UK has one of the worst environments for press freedom in western Europe, according to a global ranking that places Britain below the likes of Uruguay, Samoa, and Chile for restrictions on reporters as they seek to hold power to account.Reporters Without Borders, which campaigns for journalistic freedoms, said the UK ranked 40th out of 180 countries on its annual World Press Freedom Index, leaving it ranked between Trinidad \u0026amp Tobago and Burkina Faso.The campaigning organisation cited proposals to introduce tougher press regulation, the government’s campaign to limit encryption on services such as WhatsApp, and restrictions by Labour and the Conservatives on journalists’ access to politicians during the 2017 general election as evidence of a “heavy-handed” approach towards the media in the UK.Other concerns include law firm Appleby using British courts to sue the  and the BBC over the publication of the Paradise Papers, plus the fact the BBC political editor, Laura Kuenssberg, required a bodyguard for her protection while attending last autumn’s political party conferences. Reporters Without Borders’ UK bureau director, Rebecca Vincent, said Britain’s ranking was “unacceptable for a country that plays an important international standard-setting role when it comes to human rights and fundamental freedoms”.“We must examine the longer-term trend of worrying moves to restrict press, and hold the government to account,” she added.Scandinavian countries scored highest on the list, with Norway taking top spot. Italy was the only western European country to have a lower ranking than the UK. Canada ranked 18th, Australia was 19th, while the US came in at 45th. New Zealand gained five place to rank eighth.  editor, Katharine Viner, launched the report at the ’s office in central London, warning the worldwide “situation in terms of press freedom is getting worse”. She said journalists should not forget to campaign for press freedom in the UK, in addition to other countries. James Harding, who until recently was in charge of the BBC’s news operation, said that while misinformation on social media was widely discussed it was often the actions of governments that caused real damage.“For all the discussion of fake news, there is much more pervasive problem of state news, which is the problem of governments and politicians encroaching on the media,” he said.They were joined by reporter Matthew Caruana Galizia, the son of murdered Maltese journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia, who said the public should be aware that even in Europe journalists were being killed as a result of their work.“Her murder has really resulted in a national trauma that is going to take us decades to recover from,” he said. “There is no one who has stepped up to claim that spot and continue the fight that she was fighting.”He urged others to step up and continue her work. “It was easy for the people she was reporting on – all they had to do was eliminate her and they thought that would eliminate the story.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/165594c0a018e5bc8fd44af1d6f1e0afe783a7f1/0_259_4368_2621/master/4368.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=89b37447697d392ce493954db0ee14b2","title":"help to buy agency writes down loan on flat over grenfell style cladding","story":"Woman whose London flat has slumped in value is told she can pay back £10,000 of £95,000 loanThe government has agreed to virtually wipe out a help-to-buy loan on an apartment in a London block with cladding similar to that used at Grenfell Tower, it has emerged.It will make the write-down on the grounds that the value of the flat in Greenwich has been reduced from £500,000 to £50,000 because the developer has no plans to remove the cladding. The concession raises the prospect of multimillion-pound losses for the government scheme on any flat that goes into negative equity. This is because, unlike high street mortgages, help-to-buy loans can be redeemed on the sale value of the property rather than the value of the original loan.Homes England, the agency responsible for the loan, wrote to Cecile Langevin last week to say it had agreed she could pay back her loan at the knock-down valuation. She recently got her flat revalued in light of the cladding issue and discovered that it had collapsed in value. The developer and freeholder Galliard is locked in a legal dispute over the cladding and has no immediate plans to remove it. Langevin wrote to Homes England in March to ask if she could now pay back the loan at the current value and, after some delay, it has now responded to say that under the rules this is possible. “Homes England has now determined that you may proceed with the redemption of your help-to-buy equity loan based on the valuation provided … ie at a market value of £50,000,” it said in a letter.Homes England declined to comment on Langevin’s case but said: “Every case received by the Homes England mortgage administration team is considered on its own merits and will take in to account the local circumstances of each building. We will allow redemption of a loan if it is within the rules of the scheme.”A charity that is campaigning for leasehold reform in the UK to liberate home owners from onerous contracts with freeholders said it was time the government took action forcing the removal of such cladding. Martin Boyd, a trustee at Leasehold Knowledge Partnership, said: “The leaseholders in cladding flats have faced a huge amount of stress and worry over the last 10 months and have now seen their homes massively devalued. If the government is also going to suffer by having to write down these help-to-buy loans, it might finally encourage the sector to help develop a more workable solution. It’s not just the private and shared owners impacted by this problem.”He said social housing landlords would also be experiencing significant devaluation on their properties, which could put them in breach of their loan covenants.

Corbyn’s political secretary, Katy Clark, is currently carrying out a wide-reaching review of democracy in the party, which some fear could result in proposals that would make it easier for backbenchers critical of the leadership to be removed by their local parties. McCluskey says he is “personally not in favour” of mandatory reselection but “lost that argument overwhelmingly”.McCluskey’s pointed intervention came as Corbyn attempted to show he was getting to grips with the antisemitism row, after Jewish leaders expressed disappointment about the outcome of a meeting on Tuesday night.About 40 MPs marched with their colleague Ruth Smeeth to a party disciplinary hearing.The Labour leader’s spokesman said on Wednesday that Formby would make tackling antisemitism her top priority, and Corbyn would “lead the drive to eliminate antisemitism in the party”.He said there were currently 90 cases under investigation – with 18 waiting to go through the NCC (national constitutional committee) – Labour’s most senior disciplinary body. He added that over the last three years there had been 300 complaints and 20 people had been suspended in the last fortnight alone. understands the McCluskey article was not cleared with Corbyn’s office in advance.On Wednesday about 40 Labour MPs and peers marched in support of their Jewish colleague Ruth Smeeth before she gave evidence at an expulsion hearing against an activist accused of berating her at the launch of Labour’s antisemitism inquiry.MPs including the shadow environment secretary, Sue Hayman, the former shadow Northern Ireland secretary Owen Smith and the Jewish Labour movement chair, Luciana Berger, formed a protective ring around Smeeth as she entered the hearing in London.The Labour activist Marc Wadsworth will have his case heard by the NCC, which has the power to expel members. The hearing comes 22 months after the first complaint was made against Wadsworth, who challenged Smeeth at a the launch of Shami Chakrabati’s inquiry into antisemitism, accusing her of working “hand in hand” with the media.Labour Against the Witch-Hunt, a campaign group set up to protest against expulsions, turned out to support Wadsworth at the hearing in Westminster. Several people shouted: “Free Palestine,” as the MPs walked past.Berger said the MPs who had joined Smeeth were “looking for action” against antisemitism. “Warm words are nice, but in and of themselves they are not enough, and that’s why we’re here with our colleague Ruth Smeeth. She has an incredible amount of support,” she said.MPs said they had decided to support Smeeth because she had initially been told by the party she would be responsible for her own security walking to the hearing. Streeting, who organised the delegation to accompany Smeeth, said: “I was proud to see so many Labour MPs and peers from across the party – including shadow ministers – accompanying Ruth this morning in a show of friendship and solidarity. But no victim of abuse should ever have to walk through a protest against them to give evidence to a hearing. It is an appalling state of affairs.”Other MPs accompanying Smeeth included prominent backbenchers Stella Creasy, Jess Phillips, and Margaret Hodge, alongside Smeeth’s fellow Stoke-on-Trent MP Gareth Snell. Also there were Lord Dubs and the chief executive of the Holocaust Educational Trust, Karen Pollock. Creasy said other MPs were likely to need similar support at future hearings. “No one should go through something like this in the movement they dedicate their lives to fighting for. Sadly, more MPs may be likely to need support in many more hearings like this in the coming months,” she said. Labour MP Chris Williamson, a former shadow cabinet minister, also attended the hearing as a witness supporting Wadsworth.Speaking outside the hearing, Wadsworth said he was not antisemitic and that he had endured “almost two years of trial by media”. He added that much of the reporting around his case had been incorrect. Asked whether he thought he would get a fair hearing, he said: “I reserve my view on that.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4249f6b5ff27933de03aede83f01aa7578cd666b/0_77_2400_1440/master/2400.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=90d509e4efe8b3d3954b700a0b0360f4","title":"resistance to joint proposal to wto leaves uk and eu divided us australi reject brexit trade plans","story":"Show of unity breaks down after US, Australia and others reject post-Brexit trade plansResistance to a joint UK-EU proposal to the World Trade Organization on trade after Brexit – which was once celebrated by the trade secretary, Liam Fox, as “real progress” – has triggered a break down in unity, with London and Brussels ided on a way forward.Fox had described the plan on how much meat, butter and wheat the rest of the world could export to the UK and the 27 member states on low or zero tariffs as a sign of the country “forging ahead”, and boasted: “It’s a sign we can make progress when both sides choose to do so.”Yet, in recent months the united EU and UK front has splintered in the face of a strident rejection of their proposals from the US, Australia and New Zealand, among others, the  understands.Brussels has proposed another way forward. But London has yet to agree and has left open the prospect that ithe UK could go its own way in talks with the world’s biggest trading powers.To add to the tensions, the UK is also seeking to speak during the 21-month transition period after Brexit with an independent voice at the WTO, where large multilateral trade deals are negotiated, something the European commission is resisting.Until Brexit, the EU has a schedule spelling out how much of each agricultural product from each country that can be imported into the bloc without attracting high tariffs.After Brexit, the plan had been for the UK and EU, as independent WTO members, to ide the current quotas between the two according to historical flows of trade in each product. This plan was described as a “technical rectification”.However, EU sources said an initial objection from the US, Argentina, Brazil and New Zealand over the joint plan, hammered home in a fiery letter last October, had not gone away, proving Brussels’ initial belief that the plan would “not fly”.Brussels is now pushing for a new tactic under which they would go through the more arduous procedure of a full renegotiation with WTO members over key agriculture products, offering compensation where necessary, via what is called an article 28 procedure.The UK also insists it could unilaterally liberalise its tariff regime from Australia and elsewhere, in a move that could be damaging to EU trade flows, but would receive immediate agreement from those countries resisting the original joint plan.A senior EU official told the : “We think we will we have to go through a more difficult procedure. The UK wants to go for the simplest way we are saying we are not against it but politically it will not fly at all and we will have to do it the other way and even then it will be contested.“I think some have a case. With New Zealand and their lamb, they might say that we send our meat via Rotterdam or elsewhere to Britain, and you are making our trade arrangements more rigid.“For the first plan to work, the changes have to be perceived as technical adjustments for which there are no political issues. The other is a real correction, a real adjustment when you go through an approval process. And they take their time.”Alan Matthews, a professor of agricultural policy at Trinity College Dublin, said: “Rectification was always a crazy idea which would never be accepted as clearly what the UK and EU propose goes way behind what is covered by rectification.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0f5877424d8edc5068c755c50b3a11f77e414cde/48_0_2400_1440/master/2400.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d84580e8db9ec7a2a4da47d8039adbc6","title":"pmqs may corbyn david davis amber rudd windrush questioned by commons brexit committee politics live","story":"Rolling coverage of the day’s political developments as they happen, including Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn at PMQs, Amber Rudd giving evidence to MPs on Windrush and David Davis giving evidence to MPs on BrexitThis is from my colleague Amelia Gentelman, who broke the Windrush story and who has led the reporting on the issue.Cooper says it sounds as if Rudd is saying that the only problem was that the Windrush people did not have the proof they needed.Rudd does not recognise that the problem is with the system, with the way it demands a high level of information and does not allow a right of appeal, Cooper says.Cooper says there are other similar problems coming down the track, for example with immigration detention.

She says the intention would be to reduce the number of cases that go to appeal.What Rudd said a few minutes ago about callers to the Windrush helpline not facing immigration enforcement action if their application gets turned down (see 5.44pm) reflected what Theresa May said earlier at PMQs.But the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants says on its Twitter feed that the person running the hotline has told it something different.Rudd says the scheme she has set up for Windrush migrants will cover all Commonwealth migrants affected by this problem, not just those from the Caribbean.Lucy Moreton, general secretary of the ISU, the immigration workers union, has just told Sky News that the Home Office does have targets for the removal of illegal immigrants – contrary to what Rudd told the committee earlier.

In one house an old man was smashed on the skull so that he fell into the fire in the open hearth, where his body was charred to the bone. In another a teenage boy, possibly trying to flee, tripped over a body lying on the floor, and died where he fell.Such an aura of horror clung to the site that when archaeologists went in to uncover the gruesome facts, local people warned them they should keep well away from the green mound within the low stone wall.After three seasons of excavation, with less than a tenth of the site excavated, the team which publishes its findings today in the journal Antiquity, believes they have uncovered evidence of a catastrophic end to the life of the village – “a single event that made time stop – like a shipwreck but on land”.In the mid 5th century Sandby Borg had been a prosperous village built within the walls of a ring fort. After the attack nobody ever came back either to bury the dead, to loot their precious possessions or to take their valuable livestock. The dead – nine in just one house – rotted where they fell, lying in their houses until the roofs decayed and collapsed in on them, or sprawled in the village street, and their animals starved to death in their pens.Scattered among treasures including Roman gold coins, silver gilt jewellery, silver hair ornaments, intricate glass beads and cowrie shells from the Mediterranean, the archaeologists even found scraps of the last meals, including half a herring still lying by a hearth, and cooking pots where they were last set down until crushed by the collapsing roof.Ludwig Papmehl-Dufay, an archaeologist from the team at the local museum, which began excavations after warnings that the site was being targeted by treasure hunters, said that while no written or oral history of the massacre survived, there were persistent stories that it was regarded locally as a dangerous place. “I do find it most likely that the event was remembered and that it triggered strong taboos connected to the site, possibly brought on through oral history for centuries.”The archaeologists hope to return to the site this summer, but after three seasons of excavation have uncovered enough mysteries to keep them busy through several winters.  Stuffed into the skull of one man they found four sheep’s teeth.  Papmehl-Dufay suggests that they may represent a final insult, the opposite to ancient beliefs of placing a coin or other small valuable with the dead to pay for passage to the afterworld, instead a contemptuous curse to prevent it. Nearby they found one bone from a tiny arm, the first evidence that children were not spared.Among all the covetable possessions found among the three houses excavated and the 26 bodies discovered, they found no weapons – they speculate that they may have been taken as trophies, and could still lie dumped as a ritual offering into a nearby bog.Öland is a low island off the Swedish coast in the Baltic Sea, and in the Roman period it was wealthy. The Roman gold coins, and the luxury imports found among the scattered corpses, may represent wages earned fighting as mercenaries. The island has rich archaeology including foundations of more than 1000 stone houses, thousands of cemeteries and graves, and at least 15 ringforts – of which only Sandby Borg seems to have come to such a gruesome end in the turbulent decades when the Western Roman Empire collapsed and local tribes vied for power. The Kalmar county museum has a small exhibition about the site, and hopes to create a larger permanent display on a story which even the archaeologists working on it found uniquely disturbing. Only three of the 53 houses have been fully excavated, but test pits show that many more human remains still lie waiting for their story to be told at last."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/36250707976b45a28ccf0405b475d72c9392b786/145_0_3750_2250/master/3750.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=899815c399d1f841f1ecb6f95db94b63","title":"the largest thing in the universe cosmic collision 12bn years ago created mega galaxy","story":"A spectacular pileup of 14 galaxies soon after the Big Bang has been seen and recorded for the first timeThe cosmic pileup occurred 12.4 bn years ago and the resultant gigantic galaxy will have continued to snowball in size ever since. Calculations suggest that by the present day, hundreds more galaxies would have been swallowed up by the cluster, propelling it to a mass equivalent to 1,000 trillion suns, which would make it the largest known object in the universe.The observations reveal at least 14 galaxies packed into an area only four times the diameter of the Milky Way’s galactic disk. An adjoining blob of light that has not yet been resolved into inidual objects suggest that the total number of galaxies heading for a collision could be closer to 30.The light from the merger began travelling to us 1.4bn years after the big bang, when the universe was just a tenth of its current age.“Having caught a massive galaxy cluster in throes of formation is spectacular in and of itself,” said Scott Chapman, an astrophysicist at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Canada and co-author. “But, the fact that this is happening so early in the history of the universe poses a formidable challenge to our present-day understanding of the way structures form in the universe,” he said.During the first few million years of cosmic history, normal matter and dark matter began to clump together, eventually giving rise to galaxy clusters. In the present day, these clusters may contain as many as a thousand galaxies, vast swathes of dark matter, immense black holes, and clouds of gas that reach temperatures of over a million degrees.Current theories suggest that clusters as massive as the one observed, known as SPT2349-56, should have taken about twice as long to evolve, however.“How this assembly of galaxies got so big so fast is a bit of a mystery, it wasn’t built up gradually over billions of years, as astronomers might expect,” said Tim Miller, a PhD student at Yale University and coauthor on the paper.Computer simulations of the galaxies predict that over time the cluster will have assembled into one of the most massive structures – perhaps the most massive known object – in the modern universe.“It would exceed anything we’ve seen in the local universe,” said Carlos De Breuck, an astronomer at the European Space Observatory.The 14 galaxies seen heading towards each other are known as starburst galaxies due to the vigorous star formation. In such galaxies, thousands of stars are born every year, compared to just one in our own Milky Way. The galaxies would have blazed bright and then burnt out quickly because they consume their gas at an extraordinary rate.The galaxy cluster was first spotted as a faint smudge of light, using the South Pole telescope and the Herschel space observatory. Astronomers then used the Atacama large millimetersubmillimeter Array (Alma), a telescope comprising 66 antennas spread over 16km in the Chilean Andes, to make more detailed observations. The findings are published in Nature."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3e29af52542700fb806aee1c7f8f11a2e78a3ba9/75_293_2042_1224/master/2042.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7ee180c9712b08b6f3832f2e1b8108cd","title":"australia ball tampering mickey arthur pakistan coach test ireland england","story":"Mickey Arthur hopes that Australia’s recent ball-tampering scandal will be “a reality check for world cricket” that makes everybody “sit back and take\u0026nbspstock”.Arthur, who was the head coach of Australia between 2011 and 2013 and is now in charge of Pakistan, spoke on Wednesday about his disappointment with the team but also said he felt “really sorry” for the three banned players – Steve Smith, David Warner, and Cameron Bancroft. He feels they should be allowed to play county cricket this summer because “they were really stupid but have paid a big price already”. Surrey have said they would be open to signing Smith and Warner, pending approval from the England and Wales Cricket Board.“Australia always play their cricket really hard,” Arthur said. “They’ve pushed ‘the line’. I just want to know where the line is because I’m not sure many people do know where that line is and what it is. They’ve always played that way but I think it got to a point where perhaps, hopefully, this is a reality check for world cricket and just makes everybody sit back and take stock. Hopefully something good comes out if it.”Actions speak louder than words, of course, and Arthur will have a chance to be as good on his in the next few weeks, during which his Pakistan team play a Test against Ireland and then two against England.Arthur was full of praise for England on Wednesday, saying: “It’s a little bit early to get too controversial.” There have been plenty of bad-tempered series between Pakistan and England although though the last one in Britain, in 2016, was a lot less fractious than the two before it, which were marred by ball-tampering and spot-fixing scandals.Arthur is certainly pushing through major changes in the way Pakistan go about the rest of their cricket as part of an attempt to “resurrect” their Test team after two years of bad results.In that time they have beaten West Indies four times but lost all the other nine Tests they have played. Which is one reason why their squad for this tour is so fresh. It includes seven men who are 24 or under, and five who have never played Test cricket before. Altogether the squad have only 242 Test caps, while Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad have more than that between the two of them. “They are a young group,” Arthur adds. “There is a lot of vibrancy in this team. They are fit and raring to go. This bunch have a first crack at rebuilding the side.”There are some conspicuous omissions, such as Wahab Riaz. Arthur has been blunt about his reasons for dropping him. “He has not won us a game in two years,” he said this year. He was just as tough on Kamran Akmal, who has not played a Test in seven years but was in the limited-overs side last year and has been in superb form in the Pakistan Super League. “If you can’t field you can’t play for Pakistan,” Arthur said. “It’s as simple as that.”Fawad Alam, who has scored more than 10,000 runs at 55 in first-class cricket, also missed out on selection. He has signed to play with Clitheroe in the Lancashire League instead.The chair of selectors, Inzamam-ul-Haq, explained that last decision by saying that he had seen “better players in the last three years”. One of them is his own nephew, Imam-ul-Haq, who is one of the five new boys in the Test squad. Inzamam explained that he left the room when Arthur and his assistant Grant Flower were deciding whether or not to pick Imam for the tour. It all means Arthur has come in for some fierce criticism back in Pakistan, where Abdul Qadir described him as an “incompetent white man who has never played Test cricket” and “someone who was kicked out by South Africa and Australia”.Arthur has been too busy working to worry. He ran a four-week camp in Lahore before this tour and the team also have two first-class games organised, against Kent and Northamptonshire. But still, Yasir Shah is recovering from a stress fracture, which means the spin bowling will be done by the 19‑year‑old Shadab Khan. And Mohammad Amir, who is by far the most experienced of thefast bowlers quicks in the squad, arrived late because he had problems getting a visa.Arthur said: “We are a young team, a team that’s a little bit short on Test-match experience but a team that’s really skilful and talented.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/beb197a4ef8aec1fc9c5b036d8ea40e661cefc3f/0_88_3440_2064/master/3440.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=94b42b17a895f69f13e505b53bf2ffd9","title":"moeen ali england test side ipl interview","story":"The England all-rounder’s appraisal of his Ashes and New Zealand tour reveals something of an identity crisis but he is relishing the IPLWhen Moeen Ali was taken aside by Joe Root in Christchurch last month and told he would sit out the final instalment of England’s troubled Test winter, the overriding emotion that followed was not one of frustration.Having never before been dropped during a 50-cap run in the side – one that was interrupted only once by injury – Moeen actually thanked Root for his honesty and sticking by him for so long. But by his own admission, this hook from the stage should have come sooner.“When I didn’t play the last Test in New Zealand it was a relief,” says Moeen at the Taj hotel in Mumbai during what is a hectic Indian Premier League schedule with his new team, Royal Challengers Bangalore.“I could have been dropped three Tests earlier – I probably should have been – but Joe said he sees me as a match-winner and, with 50 matches of experience, they wanted to give me a longer run. It was almost like: ‘Right, now I can actually work on my game and mentally have a break from the pressure of playing.’ When it’s my time again, I will be ready.”But how did it come to this? Only last year Moeen was the toast of the England team, with the beaming smile that sits above a luxuriant beard dominating the sports pages during a man-of-the-series performance against South Africa. His 252 runs and 25 wickets – the latter including a hat-trick at The Oval – was an English record for an all-rounder over four Tests.The Ashes, however, was a different story. Injured in the buildup, Moeen went on to average 19 with the bat and 115 with the ball over the course of the 4-0 defeat. His own appraisal reveals something of an identity crisis for a player whose selfless, team-first approach had seen his role forever in flux.“I have been up and down the batting order and it’s difficult. People don’t always realise that. If you look at my last 18 months, I went to from batting four and five in India – scoring two hundreds – then to No 7 as second spinner at home before dropping to No 8. When we got to Australia I was down to bat six, then went to seven when the series started. You don’t really know your role.“You do your best but I think I’m going to try and get back in as a batsman first, spinner second. The problem is, because I have played more than others – say if Jack Leach is in the same team, or Liam Dawson or Adil Rashid before – I’ll still get seen as the senior spinner because I’m more experienced.”Has he been too nice for his own good? “I have been told in the past that’s my downfall but I’d rather be too nice to be honest. I set out in cricket to make friends. I’d rather people say they enjoyed playing with him and he’s a good guy, not he’s a good player but a bit of a so and so.”Moeen has always viewed himself as a batsman first and only Root, 11, and Alastair Cook, seven, can boast more than his five Test centuries since his debut in 2014. However the 30-year-old talks of his game “missing something” – perhaps a ruthlessness – and he cannot yet put his finger on it.Gary Kirsten, the former South African left-hander who heads up the RCB batsmen, is being tapped up for insight but whatever follows, we all hope it does not come at the expense of those buttery drives.The above could paint Moeen as a cricketer licking his wounds but it could not be further from the truth. Just as he did not get carried away last year, he is not down now either. He is loving his time in the IPL even if a lack of game time hampers his Test ambitions in the short-term.“If you asked me to play in the IPL for free, I would have done,” says Moeen, whose auction price of £187,000 was around a seventh of that of Ben Stokes. “I literally would have come for the experience, especially with the players at RCB like Virat Kohli, AB de Villiers, Brendon McCullum and Quinton de Kock.“And I’m wanting to train all of the time. Even today we’re not down to but I have asked to do some extra time. Sometimes in the same environment, you maybe lose a bit of that. So I think the IPL has come at a great time, getting different ideas from new voices.”Such as? “For example I have never worked on power-hitting. I’ve just always batted and when days have gone my way, it’s been nice. But with Trent Woodhill, one of the coaches, I’m learning different ways to hit the ball.“In Twenty20 it’s not always about straight drives and high elbows. It’s amazing how far you can hit the ball. I’ve always been able to hit the ball far but not consistently like I have in practice over here. I’m enjoying it so much.”With that Moeen heads off to his extra training session. Doubtless Worcestershire, two defeats from two upon their return to Division One this year, could do with his services and when it is put to him that this first-class absence means the Pakistan Test series at the end of May will likely come too soon, he replies: “It will be tough. But I know my time will come again.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/96c689d9124cca9254e30f39c3c6024b046ffd2f/37_0_1500_900/master/1500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4c4fb9ffef62e0e056f29725c38e73cc","title":"the two pizza rule and the secret of amazons success","story":"Jeff Bezos’s firm is good at selling things to shoppers, but that is the tip of its commercial iceberg In the early days of Amazon, Jeff Bezos instituted a rule: every internal team should be small enough that it can be fed with two pizzas. The goal wasn’t to cut down on the catering bill. It was, like almost everything Amazon does, focused on two aims: efficiency and scalability. The former is obvious. A smaller team spends less time managing timetables and keeping people up to date, and more time doing what needs to be done. But it’s the latter that really matters for Amazon.The thing about having lots of small teams is that they all need to be able to work together, and to be able to access the common resources of the company, in order to achieve their larger goals.“You can add new product lines without adding new internal structure or direct reports, and you can add them without meetings and projects and process in the logistics and e-commerce platforms,” Evans notes. “You don’t need to fly to Seattle and schedule a bunch of meetings to get people to implement support for launching makeup in Italy, or persuade anyone to add things to their roadmap.”Amazon is good at being an e-commerce company that sells things, but what it’s great at is making new e-commerce companies that sell new things. The company calls this approach its “flywheel”: it takes the scale that can smother a typical multinational, and uses it to provide an ever-increasing momentum backing up its entire business. The faster the flywheel spins, and the heavier it is, the harder it is for anyone else to stop it.Perhaps the best example of that approach in action is the birth and growth of AWS (previously called Amazon Web Services). That’s the ision of Amazon that provides cloud computing services, both internally and for other companies – including those that are competitors to Amazon in other areas (both Netflix and Tesco use the platform, for instance, despite Amazon also selling streaming video and groceries).It started, like so many things at Amazon, with an edict from the top. Every team, Bezos ordered, should begin to work with each other only in a structured, systematic way. If an advertising team needed some data on shoe sales to decide how best to spend their resources, they could not email analytics and ask for it they needed to go to the analytics dashboard themselves and get it. If that dashboard didn’t exist, it needed to be created. And that approach needed to cover everything.From there, it was almost an afterthought to take the obvious next step, and let others use the same technology that Amazon made available internally.AWS is large enough that it is dealt with on the same tier as the entire rest of the world. AWS is large enough that Netflix, a company that accounts for around a third of all internet traffic in North America, is just another customer. AWS is large enough that in 2016 the company released the “Snowmobile”, a literal truck for moving data. The companies that work with AWS move so much information around that sometimes the internet simply cannot cope. So now, if you want to upload a lot of data to Amazon’s cloud, the company will drive a truck to your office, fill it with data, then drive it back. If you need to upload 100 petabytes – that’s roughly 5m movies in 4k with surround sound – it turns out there’s no quicker way to do it than driving it down the freeway at 75mph.While AWS saw Amazon open up its internal technology to external customers, another part of the company does the same trick with Amazon’s actual website. Amazon Marketplace launched in 2000, allowing third-party sellers to put up their own wares on the site. The feature has expanded over the years to become a major plank in the company’s quest to be the “everything store” – the one destination on the internet you need to go to to buy anything in existence.Marketplace goes one better than the pizza rule, allowing Amazon to expand into new sectors without needing to employ a single extra employee. The variety of things sold on Amazon is now so huge that its internal computer scientists faced a problem. “E-commerce companies such as Amazon … process billions of orders every year,” a team of Amazon researchers wrote. “However, these orders represent only a small fraction of all plausible orders.” The solution? Train an artificial intelligence purely to generate plausible fake orders, to better guess how to market brand-new products.Increasingly, then, Amazon resembles less a big-box retailer such as Tesco or Walmart, hovering at the edge of town sucking up commerce and killing the local high street, and more a shopping mall: independent retailers can exist, and even make a tidy living, but only if they get a slot in the mall itself – and if they always remember that the real moneymaker is the landlord.Since 2014, Amazon has added a third flywheel to its business: artificial intelligence. The company has always been near the leading edge of the industry, most obviously in its neural-network-powered recommendation algorithms. But, until recently, that approach was scattershot, segmented, and hardly world-class (think of the last time you bought something on Amazon only to have it recommended to you for weeks afterwards. “You like duvets? Why not buy 10 more?”). That changed when the company decided to build the hardware that would become the Echo. In classic Amazon fashion, it started at the end and worked backwards from there, writing a “press release” for the notional future product and then trying to figure out what expertise needed to be developed – or bought – to make it. Need a personal assistant? Buy Cambridge-based True Knowledge, once working on a Siri competitor, and you get Alexa. Require far-field voice recognition, letting you hear people on the other side of the room? Start working on that now, because no one’s really cracked the problem.Institutionally, the bulk of the Alexa AI team still sits under AWS, using its infrastructure and offering another tranche of digital services to third parties who want to build speech control into their devices. But the economies of scale that come to AI are unique. There’s the value to the data, of course: the more people use an Echo, the more speech samples it has to train with, and so the better the Echo becomes. And beyond that, machine learning technologies are so fundamental, and so general purpose, that every advancement Amazon makes ricochets throughout its business, increasing efficiency, opening up new fields, and suggesting further avenues of research.But nothing lasts forever, and even Amazon has its weak points. The two-pizza rule, for instance, may be a good strategy for building an infinitely expandable company, but it doesn’t lend itself to a pleasant, stress-free working environment. Amazon has long faced criticism over its treatment of warehouse workers: as with many companies in its sector, huge valuations and high-tech aspirations sit uneasily alongside the low-paid, low-skilled work that makes the company tick over. Where Amazon differs from companies such as Deliveroo, Apple and Facebook is that the highly skilled employees sitting in the headquarters have almost as many complaints. A New York Times exposé from 2015 described employees crying at their desks and suffering near-breakdowns from the pressure they were put under. The company’s rapid employee turnover is legendary, with insiders describing a sort of Forth Bridge of technical debt: someone leaves, and someone else has to rewrite all their code to make it understandable to the people still there – but by the time the rewrite is finished, the person doing the rewriting has also left, requiring someone else to start the whole process again.But the one thing that’s been true from day one is that Jeff Bezos sits at the top of the food chain, with direct control of a $740bn (£530bn) business matched by few other bosses. It would take a bold gambler to bet against the company right now."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/da8f70cca6dd9de6a2e0632fe04108d6bf980319/0_604_4096_2457/master/4096.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=da744d519edeb8c23d941db462bbf69b","title":"european commission ai artificial intelligence","story":"Move to boost AI research amid concerns Europe is losing ground to US and ChinaBrussels has called for a €20bn (£14bn) cash injection for artificial intelligence research, while pouring cold water over controversial plans to give robots human rights.The European commission wants governments and private companies to boost research and innovation spending on AI, amid rising concern that Europe is losing ground to the US and China, where most leading AI firms are based.Health, transport and agriculture are among the areas the commission would like researchers to prioritise. But the commission distanced itself from proposals to give the most advanced robots the legal status of personhood.“I don’t think it will happen,” Andrus Ansip, a commission vice-president in charge of digital single-market policy told journalists. “I don’t think my vacuum cleaner has to get human rights.”Last year a committee of MEPs argued that robots should have a form of electronic personhood, raising the idea of machines being sued in law courts. The proposals were made under the parliament’s own-initiative powers, meaning they had no implications for EU law.The commission said it would appoint a committee to draw up ethical guidelines on the use of artificial intelligence. The group of experts from business, civil society and academia will be convened by July to consider AI and its impact on society, including work, social inclusion and privacy.Commission officials stressed they wanted a human-centric approach to AI policy. “Robots will never become humans,” said Elżbieta Bieńkowska, the European commissioner for industry.Researchers have said Europe risks being left behind, as the US and China ramp up spending. US tech firms have been luring top British PhD researchers with six-figure salaries. In an attempt to stop the brain drain, leading scientists have drawn up plans for a vast multinational European AI institute. Named the European Lab for Learning and Intelligent Systems – or Ellis – it would have centres in a number of countries, including the UK.Last month Emmanuel Macron, the French president, announced €1.5bn in public funding for artificial intelligence by 2022, in a move to turn France into a “startup nation”.To meet the €20bn target, the commission promised to increase its spending by €1.5bn in 2018-20, under the EU research programme known as Horizon 2020. It hopes this will trigger €2.5bn in extra spending through public-private partnerships.The UK is among a group of 24 European countries that signed a declaration this month pledging a European approach to artificial intelligence. “It can ... solve key societal challenges, from sustainable healthcare to climate change and from cybersecurity to sustainable migration,” the ministerial declaration said.Against the backdrop of Brexit, tensions have flared over Britain’s role in EU scientific projects. The UK is considering plans to launch its own satellite navigation system as a rival to the EU’s Galileo, amid a row over information security.Greg Clark, the business secretary, has taken legal advice on whether the UK can reclaim €1.4bn it has invested since the project’s launch, the Financial Times reported.Bieńkowska, who will be delivering the project, said she would be speaking to the secretary of state later on Wednesday. “The fact is that the UK, Britain, will become a third country from 30 March next year and of course we are assessing the consequences ... both for the 27 member states and for the UK.”She said it was “the right time to start thinking about adjusting cooperation” on Galileo, adding that her main priority was to deliver the satellite navigation system “on time and on budget”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/71316fe786e10dce40aaa2a492f087f4adc390f1/95_35_809_485/master/809.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a18ef68170fe79cd32ff34b3eae49164","title":"google gmail new ai confidential mode features smart replies greater offline access expiring emails improved safety features headline redesign","story":"Smart replies, greater offline access, expiring emails and improved safety features headline Google’s major redesignGoogle is implementing the biggest overhaul of its popular Gmail webmail service in five years, bringing a new look, advanced AI-powered features and improved privacy.Two years in the making, the redesign is intended to help Google better compete with Microsoft’s Outlook on the business side and modernise consumer email by bringing features from its Inbox email client into the main Gmail experience.“This is an entire rewrite of our flagship, most-used product,” said Jacob Bank, product manager lead for Gmail, which 1.4 billion people use each month.For consumers, headline features include the ability to snooze emails, as you would with an alarm clock, until a specified time or date, and what Google calls “nudge”, which displays messages with quick reminders that you haven’t responded to certain messages so that “nothing slips through the cracks”.The smart reply feature, found within Google’s Gmail app on smartphones that suggests quick reply phrases based on the content of the email, will also be rolled out to the web. Google said its new AI-powered features required Gmail to be underpinned by its self-developed Tensor processing chips, and that it had also restructured email storage databases, unifying three duelling systems for syncing messages across devices as part of the overhaul.Cosmetic changes also bring Gmail in line with Office, placing Google’s calendar, tasks and note-taking services within the same page as emails and alongside existing instant messaging options.Google has also improved Gmail’s phishing protection, with new, more dominant warnings about suspicious emails, and a new “confidential mode” that allows users to send emails with expiration dates, prevent the forwarding, copying, downloading or printing of emails and revoke previously sent emails. Emailers can also dictate that recipients have to input a one-time password to read certain messages, in an attempt to ensure that only the intended recipient receives the information.How this will work between Gmail and other email systems such as Microsoft’s Outlook or similar remains to be seen, but recent high-profile corporate data breaches have increased the company’s desire to lock down email.While many of the new features will be rolled out to the consumer version of Gmail first, it’s clear that Google’s approach for its email service has changed from consumer-centric to business-centric as it pushes its commercial G Suite products to business. Google is accelerating its efforts to poach business from Microsoft’s dominant Office system of email and apps, using Google Docs, Gmail, calendar and Hangouts instant messaging systems. Analysts estimate G Suite generated about $2bn in revenue last year, 10 times behind Office.One of the things holding G Suite back for businesses has been limited offline capabilities. Gmail now offers up to 90 days of emails offline, allowing users to search, write and manage messages without internet access in the browser.The changes to Gmail will roll out over the next few weeks with consumers able to opt into the new look by selecting the “Try the new Gmail” option under settings once it is available. Changes to the G Suite system will require system administrators to turn on options before they are available to workers using the Google tools."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb62211994aef7c3a63fc44367ac27e122b87d2d/0_129_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6372adc3d04ad52b639259c360b57920","title":"jeff bezos the boy who wanted to colonise space","story":"From a young age, the Amazon founder had dreamed up unlikely-sounding schemes. And then one took offIn 1994, Jeff Bezos held 60 meetings with family members, friends and potential investors in an attempt to persuade them to invest $50,000 (£35,000) in his revolutionary idea to create an online bookshop. He failed to convince 38 of them, and 24 years later some of them still cannot bring themselves to talk about what life might have been like if they had taken a punt on Bezos and this “Amazon thing” that the then 30-year-old hedge fund manager wouldn’t shut up about.They have given away $68m of it through their Bezos Family Foundation, which focuses on education. The foundation’s mission statement is a Winston Churchill quote: “What is the use of living, if it be not to strive for noble causes and to make this muddled world a better place for those who will live in it after we are gone?”Bezos’s parents have also given $65m to Seattle’s Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. Jackie Bezos, who was 17 and still in high school when Jeff was born, said the donation was: “The gift of time for all those people who will benefit from new treatments and cures. It’s the gift of more hugs, more graduations and more moments.” Bezos tweeted: “My parents rock.”Many industry experts reckon Amazon – which has spread its tentacles into webhosting, TV production and high-end grocery chain Whole Foods – is growing so fast that it will overtake Apple, (Alphabet) Google and Microsoft to become the first trillion-dollar company. Amazon has a market value of $750bn (£538bn) – at Monday night’s share price – making it nearly three times the size of Walmart and more than 30 times the size of the UK’s biggest retailer, Tesco.Bezos has been very, very rich for a long time, but he has only recently started to really spend his billions. In 1999, when he was already worth well north of $9bn, Bezos and his wife, MacKenzie, were still living in the one-bedroom apartment in Seattle they had rented when they moved to the city to set up Amazon five years earlier. That year the couple bought their first big house, a $10m mansion on Lake Washington, in the city’s most chichi neighbourhood.Today, however, Bezos owns almost a dozen homes across the US, and is the country’s 25th-largest landowner, according to the Land Report, a magazine that tracks US land ownership. He has made his first tentative steps into giving away a fraction of his fortune, but Bezos seriously lags behind his technology billionaire contemporaries in philanthropy. Bezos would still be the world’s second-richest man if Microsoft founder Bill Gates had not given away more than $36bn. Gates, along with Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg, Netflix’s Reed Hastings and dozens of the world’s other billionaires have signed up to the Giving Pledge commitment to give away at least half of their fortunes. So far, however, Bezos has not joined up. After being questioned about his apparent reluctance, he tweeted a request for ideas for a “philanthropy strategy”. Last year, he tweeted to thank his 400,000 followers for their input and promised “more to come”.Bezos made his first big donation earlier this year: a $33m grant to a scholarship fund for undocumented immigrants who were brought to the US as children. TheDream.US donation will fund scholarships for 1,000 participants of Barack Obama’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival (Daca) programme, who are often called Dreamers. Undocumented immigrants are not eligible for federal grants or loans, and are prevented from accessing state aid for tuition in 44 states. President Donald Trump has made life harder for Dreamers by announcing the end of Daca.Bezos’s previous biggest donation was also political: $2.5m to a campaign to defend same-sex marriage law in Washington state (the state that includes Seattle) in 2012. Jennifer Cast, a former Amazon employee who is a lesbian, emailed Bezos directly on a Sunday asking him to please consider donating between $100,000 and $200,000. “I want to have the right to marry the love of my life and to let my children and grandchildren know their family is honoured like a ‘real’ family,” Cast told Bezos. “We need help from straight people. To be very frank, we need help from wealthy straight people who care about us and who want to help us win.”Bezos replied on the Tuesday: “Jen, this is right for so many reasons. We’re in for $2.5m. Jeff \u0026amp MacKenzie.”Bezos, whom Trump has repeatedly attacked for avoiding tax at Amazon, did not acknowledge the politics of his Dreamers donation. He said the gift was in recognition of the help given to his father, who was one of 14,000 students who fled to the US from Cuba in the early 60s. His mother married Mike when Jeff was four years old, and he was legally adopted.Jorgensen, a unicyclist and bicycle shop owner, did not know he was the father of a billionaire until he was tracked down by journalist and author Brad Stone. In research for The Everything Store, his biography of Bezos, Stone turned up unannounced at Jorgensen’s Road Runner Bike Center shop in Glendale, Arizona in 2013.“I didn’t know where he was, if he had a good job or not, or if he was alive or dead,” Jorgensen told Stone. Jorgensen died in 2015.By all accounts, Bezos was gifted from a very early age. When he was a toddler he used a screwdriver to dismantle his cot because he wanted to sleep in a real bed. His genius at school is recorded for posterity in a 1977 book Turning On Bright Minds: A Parent Looks at Gifted Education in Texas, which profiles a sixth-grade Houston pupil called “Tim”. Tim, who was enrolled in a gifted children programme, is described as reading dozens of books far in advance of his years and of being incredibly interested in science. The author described him as “friendly, but serious” and of general intellectual excellence, but according to his teachers “not particularly gifted in leadership”. Tim was revealed in Stone’s book to be a pseudonym for Jeff Bezos.While Stone was widely praised for such an intimate portrait of Bezos, one reviewer on Amazon gave his book one star (the lowest possible). The reviewer was MacKenzie Bezos, who said it was littered with “numerous factual inaccuracies”.Bezos met MacKenzie at D E Shaw, a hedge fund run by computer scientist David Shaw, who is known as “King Quant” because of the firm’s pioneering role in high-speed quantitative trading. Until he met MacKenzie, when he interviewed her for a job at the hedge fund, Bezos had attempted to apply analytics to finding love. He called it “women flow” and reckoned he could increase the number of women he’d have a chance with if he took up ballroom dancing.In a profile of MacKenzie to promote her novel Traps, she told Vogue that it was she who had chased Bezos and not the other way round. Within three months, they were engaged and after another three months they married. Shortly afterwards Bezos described his idea for selling books over the internet, and while admitting she had “no business sense whatsoever” she could see “how excited he was” and agreed they should leave New York for Seattle to explore his idea. Seattle was chosen because it was close to a big book distributor and under US law the company was only required to collect sales tax for in-state sales.At high school near Miami, Bezos decided he wanted to go into space when he grew up. But, his ambition was not to be an astronaut he wanted to colonise space. He was named valedictorian of his high school class and when he graduated in 1982, the Miami Herald asked for an interview. The 18-year-old Bezos told the paper he wanted to “build space hotels, amusement parks and colonies for 2 million or 3 million people who would be in orbit”. “The whole idea is to preserve the Earth,” he told the paper. “The goal was to be able to evacuate humans.

It is a collaboration of 18 media organisations in 15 different countries, including the , Reuters, Le Monde and the New York Times.The project is the first to be led by\u0026nbspForbidden Stories, an international network of journalists who stand ready to take over when colleagues are silenced through imprisonment or murder.The project will publish a series of fresh revelations, setting out the dangers that alleged political corruption and poor controls on money laundering inside Malta pose to law and order in Europe.Caruana Galizia died before being able to publish any findings from the leak. However, three energy experts in London have examined the files. They contain pricing information and contracts that Malta’s current government has so far refused to share with the public. Some of the material concerns a deal with Azerbaijan’s state-owned oil and gas company Socar, worth more than €1bn, under which Malta agreed to import all the gas needed to supply its power stations for the next 10 years.Over the past year, Malta has paid at least €131.6m ($153m at annualised exchange rates) for its gas – nearly twice the open market rate.Maltese taxpayers were losing money “hand over fist”, according to one expert.The deal was struck with Socar in 2015. Benchmarking indicated Malta was paying a significantly higher rate than similar purchases from the wider market negotiated at that time by Greece, Italy and Turkey. Estimates by the  suggest Socar paid $40m less for the gas than the sum it charged Malta.The gas is transported in liquid form, known as liquefied natural gas. Experts said there were questions to answer about why Socar, which had no relevant experience in producing or trading LNG when the deal was signed, was chosen as Malta’s partner. There is no suggestion of wrongdoing by any of the parties involved. However, the lack of a public tender for the gas contract, and the absence of public information about its structure and costs, have hampered scrutiny and debate about whether the government secured the best deal for taxpayers, opposition politicians claim.Malta’s Labour government says its energy market policy has been a success. By switching its power stations from fuel oil to cheaper, cleaner gas, it has slashed household electricity bills by a quarter.The former Nationalist party leader Simon Busuttil said: “There was a total lack of transparency on this contract.“It took the government two years to publish it and even then, the juicy parts were blacked out. There is now the inexplicable involvement of Socar, when the gas could have been purchased directly from Shell at a cheaper price.“There is a fixed price for an unreasonably long time. And there is also a huge markup being made by Socar for no contribution at all, at the expense of Maltese taxpayers.”The leaked material concerns a company called Electrogas, which is one third owned by Socar.Electrogas has played a key role in Malta’s transition from using fuel oil to LNG. Liquefied gas can arrive by sea, which is crucial to the island nation because it has no gas pipelines connected to mainland Europe.In 2013, Malta held an open competition for a company to build facilities at Delimara on the southern tip of the main island. The company would import LNG, store it, convert the liquid back into gas and pump it into turbines operated by the state-owned utility Enemalta.The winning bidder was also required to build turbines of its own, to supply Enemalta with electricity. The Electrogas consortium was selected, in a public process in which 18 bidders expressed an interest. Leaked tender documents show Enemalta requested a fixed price for the first five years. Because the price of the gas was included in the cost of the bid, there was no separate public tender for the LNG supply contract. In 2015, Electrogas signed contracts to buy all the gas Malta needed from Socar. Regular deliveries began in April 2017, once its facilities at Delimara were built.Azerbaijan is a major oil and gas producer, but it does not produce LNG. The Daphne Project has established that Socar is not supplying the gas from its own reserves. It is in fact buying the gas from Shell and selling it on to Electrogas at a profit. Socar does not handle the gas, organise its transportation or add value in any physical process.The most recent delivery from Shell, on 22 March, appears to have come from fields off Trinidad and Tobago, via a tanker called Maran Gas Apollonia.Until now, Malta’s taxpayers were in the dark about the exact figures, because the government has only published the relevant contracts in redacted form. The Daphne Project has seen the originals.Since April 2017, when regular LNG shipments to Malta began, Socar has apparently benefited from the discrepancy between the fixed and market rates. Oil and gas prices tumbled between 2014 and 2016, and are only just beginning to recover. The cost of LNG is still well below the fixed price Malta is committed to paying.Simon Pirani, a senior visiting research fellow at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies, said: “If I were a Maltese taxpayer, I would want to know why such a poor deal was signed, and why a Socar subsidiary had been brought in as a seller of LNG.”Two other specialists, who asked to remain anonymous, reviewed the contracts and said a five-year commitment on the agreed terms was unheard of.“Socar are getting paid double by the Maltese utility,” said one. “That’s a huge margin. Malta should push to renegotiate that contract, because they are losing money hand over fist.”Konrad Mizzi, the Maltese tourism minister, steered the project through in his previous role as minister for energy. In a six-page letter to the , he said his government’s initiatives had secured hundreds of millions in investment from corporations and banks. The switch from oil to gas had lowered electricity prices and improved air quality.He said Malta’s energy sector had been “in desperate need of a complete overhaul”, with Enemalta in debt despite charging some of the highest prices per customer in Europe.The state provider’s financial woes were one of the main reasons for outsourcing the whole gas supply chain, he said. The decision had been shaped by advice from international law firms and specialist consultants, he said, and received financial backing from a consortium of leading banks.Mizzi argued the cost of the five-year fixed term was worth paying because “security of supply and price stability were paramount”.The European commission, which says it was made aware of the pricing details, raised no objections and approved the deal in January 2017.A spokesperson for the commission’s directorate general for competition, which approved the deal, said its role had been to check Electrogas was not being overpaid by Enemalta, rather than inspect the deal with Socar in isolation. It had concluded that the rate of return for Electrogas was “in line” with similar projects. However, among the leaked material is a report by a UK consultancy hired by Electrogas to analyse the costs, in order to convince banks to invest. In the report, the consultancy questioned Socar’s involvement. “The arrangement is unusual,” an adviser noted, “and typically one would expect the LNG supplier, in this case Shell, to contract directly with the project.”In a convoluted chain, the gas Malta needs is sold by Shell to Socar, which then sells it to Electrogas, which sells it on to the majority state-owned grid operator, Enemalta. For the first five years of the 10-year contract with Socar, Malta has committed to a fixed price of €9.40 ($11.50) per mmbtu, a unit of gas. Since deliveries began in April 2017, the average price per unit on the UK NPB, a widely used indicator for Europe’s wholesale liquified gas market, has been $6.20 – nearly half the Maltese fixed rate.This does not include transportation costs, whereas the €9.40 does. But Socar is still paying much less for the gas than the price at which it sells to Malta.Malta buys a minimum of 14m mmbtu per year under the deal with Socar. Using average exchange rates for the past year, Malta paid an estimated $153m to Socar for gas.This represents a potential $40m profit for the Azerbaijani energy company. Socar declined to comment on pricing, saying it was restricted by confidentiality clauses.Malta could not have foreseen the sustained oil and gas price crash that has made its deal with Socar look like poor value. However, it has the option to redraw or cancel the agreement. Other countries have done this: Lithuania secured a price cut from its supplier, Statoil, and the Italian energy company Edison went to court to reduce the cost of its deal with Algeria."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf37d174f4d3f2de9926560d3f2720d825b114a0/0_95_5174_3104/master/5174.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e2a63a3066be6006dca6cb398893b0c2","title":"un eu conference syrian aid","story":"UN says $9bn is required to help those in need and some programmes may need to be cutSyrian refugees are facing a large shortfall in aid after a two-day joint UN-EU pledging conference in Brussels fell billions of dollars short of the UN target for 2018. The $4bn (£2.9bn) raised was less than half of the $9bn the UN says is needed this year to help those in need inside Syria and living as refugees in neighbouring countries. The shortfall prompted UN agencies to say some programmes may need to be cut.Mark Lowcock, the UN under-secretary for humanitarian affairs, said the shortfall would require the UN to prioritise, stressing help should go to those most in need and most vulnerable, but that that would require more UN staff inside the country.“We would have liked our appeal to be fully funded. We are talking about a vast sum of money and there is a lot of pressure on the financiers,” he said.The $4bn is lower than the sums raised at a similar conference last year, partly due to a delay in a $1bn US pledge and continued discussions between the EU and Turkey over the details of a package agreed two years ago, designed to help Turkey handle 3.5 million refugees.UN officials nevertheless described the aid package for 2018 as a good start and said the figure could rise on the basis of progress last year.The bulk of the money raised at the conference itself came from Germany, the EU, and the UK. British hopes of a large pledge from Gulf states did not materialise. Britain itself pledged a further £250m, including help to train doctors and nurses in trauma care.The funds are not designed for the reconstruction of Syria, something Federica Mogherini, the EU foreign affairs chief, said could only start after a full peace settlement was in place.The relatively low level of funding came despite strong appeals from ministers in three of the countries bordering Syria – Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan – that extra funds were badly needed to prevent tensions between its nationals and Syrians spiralling out of control.The Lebanese prime minister, Saad Hariri, who is facing elections in two weeks, said: “The bitter truth is conditions have deteriorated for refugees since last year,” adding “Lebanon remains a big refugee camp”. He said: “Tensions between Syrians and the Lebanese community is on the increase due to competition for jobs.”The Turkish deputy prime minister, Recep Akdağ, blamed the EU for “a disappointing failure to share the refugee burden”. He said his country had played a major role in preventing one of the major crises of the EU by agreeing to control the irregular flow of people across the Aegean.He said the EU had not fulfilled its pledges on visa liberalisation for Turks to enter the EU, a central part of the initial deal that has led to a cut in the number of people crossing the Aegean from 7,000 daily to fewer than 50.The Jordanian foreign minister, Ayman Safadi, said that unless the international community stopped simply managing the crisis it would leave a well of bitterness among the 1.3 million refugees inside Jordan, and “a new army of Islamic State” would come into being in 10 to 15 years. He stressed a political and not an aid settlement was required, and that that involved accepting new realities.The UN special envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura, fresh from talks in Moscow at the weekend, also briefed the conference saying the recent western attacks on Syrian chemical weapons sites had been a wake-up call prompting high-level diplomatic discussions.He suggested the Russian-led Astana peace process, sometimes regarded as a Russian and Iranian rival to the UN process in Geneva, was in danger of showing its limits. He pointed out there had been a re-escalation of violence in 2018 and a failure after a year to deliver on the issue of detainees, prisoners and missing people.He also said there had been no follow-up to an agreement at a large peace conference, hosted in the Black Sea resort of Sochi by Vladimir Putin, to set up a constitutional commission on the future of Syria. “Sochi risks being considered to have produced a stillborn unless there is more proactivity about the constitutional commission,” he said.Even though the idea of a large constitutional commission was proposed by Russia, the idea was rejected by Bashar al-Assad as a foreign-inspired move. Russia has made little public reference to the plan since then, but foreign ministers from Turkey, Russia and Iran will meet in Moscow this weekend.

He has no retirement fund in place and would use the Lifetime Isa to save for the long-term futureUnfortunately, the nature of being self-employed means there’s no regularity in how often I’m paid. Projects can be sporadic and uncertain. Invoices can be delayed, projects can drag on or I can just not win work for a while. If I don’t work, I don’t make money. It’s a scary and risky career but it’s very rewarding at times.I pay myself a set salary that helps me limit how much I spend each month, and keeps the money I shouldn’t spend in my business. I also put some of this salary into my savings. Anything extra I earn at the end of the year usually goes into my savings too. It’s definitely stressful though. I sometimes worry if I’ll carry on making enough money as each year passes, but if I can stay organised with my business and earnings, I can relax a lot more.As well as having an unreliable income, it’s also challenging having to calculate how much I’ll spend in expenses for my business and how much tax I’ll owe each year. There are days I wish I was employed again, so I could rely on a steady stream of income and know how much I can actually put into my savings each month. However, the upside of being freelance is that I can earn a higher amount each month than I normally would when working for a company, which makes the opportunity to save far greater.The main attraction of a Lifetime Isa for me is the prospect of having a retirement fund for when I’m older. Being self-employed, I don’t currently have a pension and it’s scary knowing I have nothing to fall back on. I’m hitting 30 this year and having a Lifetime Isa or a pension is a must for me now. I’m always one to want to find the best option possible and other Isas currently on the market don’t feel worthwhile any more.There’s nothing worse than constantly saving and never enjoying your money. My wife and I are hooked on travel and like to see as much of the world as possible. Aside from wanting to build a financial safety net for the future, our main saving goal is to have enough to enjoy ourselves along the way.Laura Lucas, 29, is a marketing assistant in Manchester and a lifestyle blogger in her spare time. She is considering a Lifetime Isa to save for her first houseI blog most evenings, which doesn’t provide much income, but I hope it’ll be my main job one day. Blogging is good in that I can save money that I might have otherwise spent on dinner out or a new outfit, because I’m lucky enough to get gifted these sorts of things. I feel like I’m currently working two jobs, one that I love but which doesn’t pay, and my main job that I rely on for income. My partner and I got engaged over Christmas, so we’re saving for a wedding in about two years’ time, as well as starting to think about buying our first home together. We’ll probably do the wedding on a budget with some special bits and bobs thrown in, but we’ll have to plan ahead to make sure we can afford the extravagant extras. I’d also love to have an engagement party in the next few months and it’s my partner’s 30th birthday this year, so even though we want to celebrate these occasions in style we might have to dial them down a little to save money. We both work really hard, so we don’t want to cut out anything like holidays or evening drinks with friends. I like to think I’m a good saver, and a Lifetime Isa would help us to save for our first house. It’s great to have something backed by the government to help young people save. It’s challenging these days but a Lifetime Isa encourages you to think long term about home ownership and retirement. I already have a couple of savings accounts that I sometimes dip into for Christmas and birthdays, holidays and more expensive purchases, but setting these accounts up can be stressful. It takes a lot of research and background work to fully understand what you’re getting when you sign up.At the moment, I’m not quite sure where I want to be money-wise. I’m grateful for my living situation and being able to live comfortably. However, there are many more things we’d love to do, like decorating our apartment and travelling more, but with our wedding and buying a house on the horizon, we’re trying to be a bit more sensible and only invest small amounts at a time in things we know we need."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c7367799adc822bdfd24c4f8625cef7eff67e830/0_80_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=35d69f76f4e11be8bdd1e38e50a78438","title":"my financial future can i have my brunch and eat it too","story":"The options appear to be: never socialise and stay in to save for a house, or live a normal, modern urban life and spiral into debt. But is there a third way?Sitting firmly in the middle of the millennial generation (those born 1981-2000) and I’m told I could easily afford to buy my first home in London if I just give up: coffee, my gym membership, an annual weekend away, takeaway food, and a mobile upgrade, or one night out a week, for five years – or avocados.Sure, London living is afforded by renting the equivalent of a dodgy hostel dorm, nights out revolving around two-for-one deals, and “side-hustles”, which is a glorified term for my three jobs. So, should I accept that I can’t have my brunch and eat it too? Living paycheck to paycheck isn’t the dream and maybe neither is owning a home, but there must be a way I could at least consider the option.I’m certainly not alone, but maybe we’re placing too much value on “Yolo” – apparently a typical habit of young people today – so I’ve asked Paul Bridgwater, head of commercial and proposition at financial services provider OneFamily, and millennial lifestyle and personal finance expert Lisa Rowan from The Penny Hoarder what they think – and luckily neither suggested a five-year period where I give up all that I hold dear.Is it really that hard to save in a big city or am I being led astray?Rowan suggests that, unfortunately, it’s not all in my head. “Affordable, low-amenity units are being replaced with luxury buildings that are simply out of reach for many people, especially young people in the early stages of their careers,” she says. “This competitive housing environment means more workers in their 20s and 30s are enduring long commutes from the suburbs or are living with several roommates in order to make the most of their budgets.” But, Bridgwater says, while it can feel unattainable without the help from “the bank of mum and dad” we do have the benefit of living in a connected, digital age that can help us achieve our financial goals.I really value my social life – do I have to give up a chunk of it for five years?No, says Rowan, but there are some hacks to help make sure you don’t spend most of your monthly wages during the excitement of payday. In short, be at least a bit prepared. “Knowing the type of activity upfront can help you determine whether an event is a social and financial priority for you – then, it’s easier to make compromises. You may skip on the 12-person birthday dinner at a fancy restaurant, but you can still meet the group for drinks or dessert afterward. You can still go on a bar crawl with your friends, but perhaps eat a hearty meal before you leave the house,” she says.Bridgwater agrees, and says it’s safe to assume that most of your friends are in the same boat, so be straight up with them. “Money is a bit of a taboo subject for any age group, especially in the UK. On a practical level, earnings, savings and debts are not really discussed and perhaps they should be,” he says. “Like anything else in life, by talking and sharing issues, interesting solutions will come to light.”OK, so maybe I should be budgeting. What are some handy guidelines?Bridgwater says that budgeting isn’t the same for everyone, but taking away the temptation to spend is often the easiest way to save. “Create different accounts for your big expenses (housing, bills and savings) and then set up a standing order into these accounts one to two days after your wages go in from your main account. You’ll then know the money you have left in your main account is money you can spend,” he says.So, can I think about saving for a big purchase and still keep seeing my friends?Yes, says Rowan: “You can have your instant and delayed gratification at the same time.” A product like OneFamily’s stocks and shares Lifetime Isa is a good start when considering your options. With a Lifetime Isa, for every £4 put in, the government adds £1 – so save up to £4,000 a year and get £1,000 as a bonus (available after 12 months). Lifetime Isas are available either based on cash investments, which can be preferable for first-time house purchases in the short-term or stocks and shares investments, which might be preferable if you are aiming to buy your first home in five or more years, as they offer potentially better returns over the longer term, but be aware that capital is at risk.For information on the OneFamily stocks and shares Lifetime Isa, visit OneFamily.

You have a responsibility to get informed.”Mr Murphy was joined by Minister for Health Simon Harris, Minister for Education Richard Bruton, Minister for Justice Charlie Flanagan, Minister of State Jim Daly and a number of Senators.Mr Harris said men should not feel excluded from the debate, insisting it is a matter for them too and that they cannot absent themselves from the conversation.Many have had to travel abroad with their partners from every single town and county throughout the country, Mr Harris added.“If it was a woman in our life, if it was a woman we know, would we want her to be treated with compassion and care – or would we want her to feel the cold shoulder?” he said.Mr Daly urged public representatives not to focus exclusively on the Yes or No side, because there is a huge middle ground that genuinely do not know how to vote.The Minister of State said it was the role of each TD and Senator to reach out to these people and ask them to understand the realities of abortion.“If this was my daughter in the morning who had a crisis pregnancy, what would I want for her? Would I want her to have the ability to obtain a termination here or have to go under a cloud of darkness and fear and guilt abroad to deal with it?”Fine Gael has a vote of conscience on this issue, but all senior Ministers are united on the question of repealing the Eighth Amendment.There are ided views on the legislation to replace it.

Early in the hours of April 14th, Macron used his constitutional power as commander in chief for the first time, joining the US and Britain in launching cruise missiles against three chemical weapons installations in Syria. The goal, Macron said later, was to convince Bashar al Assad and Vladimir Putin that the international community was more than a “nice” and “weak” body they could push around.In a further exercise in persuasion, Macron volunteered for a combative, 2½ hour live television interview on Sunday night, during which he made the surprising claim that, “Ten days ago, President Trump said the US would pull out of Syria. We convinced him it was necessary to stay for the duration.”The White House later issued a statement saying Trump’s view had not changed, and the French president made an embarrassing climbdown on Monday, claiming he “never said” the US or France would remain militarily engaged in Syria for the long term.Perhaps Macron, whose nickname is “Jupiter”, is threatened by hubris, the sin of pride that afflicted Greek gods.The rest of the week was one long attempt to convince Europeans and the French of the rightness of his positions. Macron – who has become the de facto leader of Europe – received the heads of the three Baltic states who have teamed up with five other northern EU countries, including the Netherlands and Ireland, to thwart his efforts to further integrate the euro zone.Then, before a more sympathetic audience at the EU parliament in Strasbourg, Macron pleaded with proponents of liberal democracy to wake up and oppose the populist authoritarians who deny European values. Macron then travelled to Berlin in yet another effort to enlist German chancellor Angela Merkel’s support for his European reform agenda.On Monday, Macron will go to Washington for a three-day state visit, the first of Trump’s presidential term. Although the two men have clashed on climate change, the Iran nuclear accord, trade protectionism and the rise of Eurosceptical populism, Trump appears to have been charmed by the young president, who says Franco-American co-operation is crucial in the fight against terrorism.As the first anniversary of Macron’s election approaches on May 7th, and a half century after the May 1968 revolution, a different kind of spring is flowering in France. For the first time in decades, the country is reversing its post second World War decline, and the persuasive Macron is turning France into the world’s greatest soft power.There is, of course, discontent. It wouldn’t be France if there wasn’t. This week Macron also confronted striking railway workers in the Vosges, telling them to “stop taking people hostage.” The country is struggling through a rolling strike over the reform of the SNCF railway company.And despite Macron’s best efforts to reassure them, many in France suspect their young president is out to destroy the familiar but dysfunctional “French social model”. In their eyes, Macron is pushing France into the chasm of savage, race-to-the bottom capitalism.So what do they make of him in his home town? The  travelled there to find out.Macron was born in Amiens, the capital of Picardy, 40 years ago and lived here until just before his 17th birthday. From age 11 to 16, he studied at the Jesuit school La Providence.Built in the graceless concrete style of the 1950s, “La Pro” is an elementary, secondary and technical school for 2,000 pupils, spread over several acres. Aside from occasional crucifixes, calendars of Pope Francis and portraits of St Ignatius of Loyola, the religious footprint is light. The teachers are lay people. The priest visits only once a week now.Not a single plaque or photograph records that the president and first lady of France passed through these corridors. Yet this is where Macron asked to be baptised at the age of 12, and where, at 15, he fell in love with his future wife, a French and drama teacher called Brigitte Trogneux Auzière.Macron has always been drawn to older people. His maternal grandmother, Germaine “Manette” Nogues, died in his arms five years ago, at the age of 97. The Protestant humanist philosopher Paul Ricoeur was a spiritual father to him the progressive socialist millionaire Henry Hermand his political mentor. “He’s attracted by knowledge, by people who have experience,” his neurologist father, Jean-Michel (67), says over lunch in Amiens.At La Pro and subsequently at Henri IV, France’s leading lycée and prep school in Paris, Macron often stayed after class to talk to teachers.Marc Defernand (78) taught Macron history and geography here, and was principal of Macron’s section. “He was more mature than other students,” says Defernand. “He always asked a lot of questions. Sometimes he would pick up a conversation we’d started eight days earlier, exactly where we’d left off.”In the autumn of 2016, Defernand queued in a local bookshop to ask Macron to sign his autobiographical manifesto, Révolution. The retired educator is moved, recalling what happened. “He grabbed me by the hand and said, ‘Monsieur Defernand! It’s so good to see you!’” Macron inscribed the book: “To Marc, this ‘Revolution’, which owes more to him than he knows. In friendship, Emmanuel.”We visit the 700-seat theatre where Emmanuel Macron and Brigitte Trogneux Auzière adapted a play by Eduardo De Filippo together.“He was dynamite,” Defernand says. “I told him that if he continued, he would be the Gérard Philippe of the 21st century. It was difficult for others to act in the same play with him. In the same way, it’s difficult for his cabinet ministers now.”Defernand wasn’t aware of the relationship at the time, though he knew Macron went often to Auzière’s house. “I assumed there was a flirt between him and her daughter Laurence,” he says.The scandal of a married teacher with three children having an affair with a student nearly 25 years her junior has been transformed into romantic legend. Everyone would rather forget the trauma.“Jesuits never pried into people’s private lives. There was no morality investigation,” Defernand says. “There were unmarried teachers living together at the time. I was more worried about students taking drugs.”The fact that Brigitte continued to teach at La Pro for years after her lover’s departure, and then transferred to Lycée St Louis de Gonzague when they began to live together later in Paris, is further evidence of tolerance, Defernand says.A tragic love story, known to most French people, occurred a quarter-century earlier and helped pave the way for Macron and Auzière.Schoolteacher Gabrielle Russier (32) had an affair with a lycée student half her age, Christian Rossi, in Marseille. The youth’s parents filed a complaint against the teacher and had their son placed in a mental hospital. Russier was given a suspended prison sentence and took her own life. The story became the subject of books, films and songs. Asked about it at a press conference, former president Georges Pompidou famously quoted a poem by Paul Eluard that was sympathetic to women accused of having slept with German soldiers during the war.The historian Jean-François Sirinelli\u0026nbspcompares the Russier and Macron stories in his book Les Révolutions françaises, to show how much France evolved in a single generation. “Gabrielle Russier takes her own life in 1969. Emmanuel Macron and his teacher start an affair in the 1990s, and in May 2017, Brigitte Macron becomes first lady of France.”Macron’s parents learned of the affair by chance. “My wife was much more upset than I was,” Prof Macron says. “It may sound macho, but I thought he’d get over it. He didn’t . . . I thought it was a little early. It wasn’t the way I envisioned life, but it wasn’t my life. I raised my children to be free and independent.”The Macrons didn’t consider filing charges against Brigitte Auzière, but they asked to meet her. “I was requisitioned to impose authority,” Prof Macron laughs. “I told her, ‘He’s a minor. I want him to complete his studies. After that, he’s free to do what he wants.’”The president’s parents have been hurt by press reports that they sent their son to Paris to get him away from Auzière. “He was going to go to Henri IV anyway. It was planned,” Prof Macron says, nonetheless admitting that perhaps Emmanuel “went a little early”.At La Pro, I ask a class of 14-15 year-olds, Macron’s age when he met Brigitte, if they could fall in love with a teacher. The teenagers laugh and say yes. “If it happened to someone our age, it would shock me,” says a student called Grégoire. “But now that he’s an adult, it doesn’t bother me.”The students say it’s “cool” that Macron is president. “He was elected because there was Marine Le Pen,” pipes in Ayoub, of north African origin. Perhaps parroting their parents’ opinions, the youths object to rising taxes and praise the appointment of cabinet ministers who are not professional politicians. For the future, they predict flying cars and tell me France will never know full employment.On a scale of one to 10, they give the young president an approval rating of seven. “He has to prove himself,” one explains. Like France, Macron’s successors at La Pro are waiting to see.The Amienois may seem blasé about their president, but his father attributes this attitude to the “taciturn, reserved” character of Picard people. The region particularly suffered in both world wars, has a miserable climate and has been decimated by de-industralisation.His son is an atypical Picard, “an extrovert” infused with the sun of the southwest on the side of his mother, Françoise Nogues-Macron.History and bloodlines led me to Macron père, to find out more about the family’s English ancestry. In February, Macron spent an evening with the Presidential Press Association. As the representative for foreign journalists, I was part of the welcoming party. I gave him a sepia postcard of English soldiers in Amiens in 1918. \u0026nbspMacron studied the photograph closely. “You know, they found me an English great grandfather,” he said with a laugh, staring at the postcard. “He was called George Robertson.” The president scrutinised the English faces for a long moment. He was looking for a face that resembled his own.Towards the end of last year’s presidential campaign, Brigitte Macron mentioned to British journalists that her husband had a great grandfather called “Mr Robertson from Bristol”. The London Times, Mirror and Daily Mail researched the story and told the Macrons more than they had ever known about “Mr Robertson”.George William Robertson was born in Bristol in December 1887, and is believed to have fought in the Battle of the Somme. Distant relatives in England have preserved his war medals.Robertson married Macron’s great grandmother, Suzanne Leblond, in the town of Abbeville, 40km from Amiens, in 1919. They had three daughters. The middle daughter, Jacqueline, born in 1922, was Emmanuel Macron’s paternal grandmother.“He disappeared from one day to the next,” Prof Macron told me. “No one in the family ever heard from him. Suzanne raised three daughters alone. She kept a very modest grocery shop in Abbeville. My parents sent me to live with her and my aunts for two years as a child.”The failed marriage to an Englishman “was never, never talked about. The family kept no trace of him. I never saw a picture,” Prof Macron continues. George Robertson married again, settled in east London and kept a grocery shop, like his ex-wife, Suzanne. A step-daughter told the Mirror that he liked to sing Roses of Picardy, which he had learned in the trenches.Had a butcher from Bristol not fought in the Somme, married a Frenchwoman and fathered her children, Emmanuel Macron would not exist, would not be president of France today.Macron’s intellectual precociousness and his relationship with Brigitte meant he “skipped his adolescence”, his father says. In the autumn of 1993, three months short of his 17th birthday, the future president moved to a garret near the Lycée Henri IV in Paris. \u0026nbspHe continued his relationship with Brigitte. “When I went to see him in his chambre de bonne, sometimes he called through the door for me to come back later,” Prof Macron laughs. “I knew she was there with him.”Christian Monjou taught Macron American and British civilisation for three years at Henri IV. Though he did not know about the romance, Monjou noticed that Macron raced off to Amiens the moment classes ended on Saturday. “It was a case of\u0026nbsp ‘the ided self’,” Monjou says in an interview in his book-lined study.Macron obtained his baccalauréat with honours, but twice failed the entrance exam for the École Normale Supérieure, which trains French academics. It was the only failure of his life. Had it not been for the distraction of romance with Brigitte, Monjou says, Macron would have succeeded in the exam and become an academic.Against all odds, Brigitte Macron eventually orced and moved to Paris to live with Emmanuel. They married in 2007. “Without her, I would not be me,” Macron said during the campaign.Macron went on to earn a doctorate in philosophy, then reoriented his life towards politics with degrees from Sciences Po and the École Nationale d’Administration (ENA). “He used failure as a launching pad,” says Monjou. “That is typical of a leader.”“Have you brought your helmet and bulletproof vest?” the taxi driver who takes me to the Whirlpool clothes dryer factory in north Amiens asks. It’s a joke, of course, but the “Whirlpools” are notoriously hostile. A year ago, Marine Le Pen promised their factory would not close if she became president. Macron ignored advice and plunged into the crowd of angry strikers, saying, “If you listen to the security guys, you’re dead.”The factory will move to Poland at the end of May. Most of the 290 workers have been promised retraining or jobs building “intelligent” refrigerators by the factory’s new owner. But they’re still angry. On the day I visit, management proposed a clothes dryer in lieu of a severance bonus.“Macron, Macron. He’s not a god. We’re losing jobs. We don’t give a damn about Macron,” François Gorlia, the in-house union leader, tells me on the phone when he refuses to come to the gate to talk to me.“He’s a right-wing guy. Everything for the rich. Nothing for the poor,” Sibylle (39), an assembly line worker says as she arrives for the 1pm shift. She’ll benefit from Macron’s investment in training for the jobless, but she isn’t convinced. “Training is fine and dandy, but there are no jobs.”After lunch in a simple bistro, Macron’s father Jean-Michel guides me through a maze of streets under construction, to the music conservatory where his son studied piano for nine years. When he failed the conservatory exam after his first year, Macron’s mother told his biographer Anne Fulda, the boy insisted on having the same examiner the second year, an early sign of his determination to convince. He played well, Prof Macron recalls, mastering Bach’s devilishly difficult Goldberg Variations.Prof Macron gives me the address of the modest, two-storey brick bungalow where Emmanuel and his two siblings grew up, and where the neurologist still lives with his second wife. “It’s not Neuilly,” Macron père says laughing, referring to the Beverly Hills-like Paris suburb where Nicolas Sarkozy came from. Though they are both doctors, Macron’s parents earned low, public sector salaries. “They weren’t neurosurgeons with private jets,” comments a presidential adviser.The Trogneux chocolate shop, near the cathedral in central Amiens, is where Brigitte Macron’s family have made chocolates and macaroons for five generations. They also own the local Renault dealership.Black-and-white photographs of successive generations of the Trogneux chocolate dynasty hang inside the shop. There is no photograph or mention of Brigitte Trogneux Auzière Macron. Jean-Alexandre Trogneux (57), the first lady’s nephew and godson, agrees to be photographed, but refuses to talk about the presidential couple. “We’ve made it a golden rule,” he says. “We don’t talk about them and they don’t talk about us.”Fabien Dorémus (32) heads the political book section of a shop in central Amiens. Macron’s Révolution sold more than 400 copies there, an “enormous” number, Dorémus says. He had no desire to read it, and dismisses the book – and Macron – as “all slogans and clichés”. A former journalist whose local online newspaper failed for lack of funding, Dorémus is close to the far left party France Unbowed.\u0026nbspSince Macron’s election, Dorémus says, “I’m not optimistic for workers, pensioners and people who need public services. I am very optimistic for the rich.”The bookseller mentions various left-wing grievances against Macron, arising from a handful of disparaging remarks since 2014: Macron referred to slaughterhouse workers who were losing their jobs as “illiterate” Macron told a heckler wearing an anti-Macron T-shirt, “The best way to buy a suit is to get a job” Macron called protesters against his labour reforms “slackers” and accused strikers of wanting to foutre le bordel, or wreak havoc.It’s hardly “let them eat cake”. But the president has been hanged and burned in effigy by protesters. “You have to put yourself in the place of the people who get told they are slackers and freeloaders,” Dorémus says. “He’s contemptuous of the lower classes. People started hating him because they feel disrespected.”Another criticism, made by Macron’s former teachers, is that his speeches are often so long and intellectual that they can be difficult to follow.And attempts to control the president’s image can be counterproductive. The novelist Emmanuel Carrère was given exclusive access to the president and first lady. In two interviews with Macron, there was “one really strong, beautiful sentence”, Carrère wrote in the . “And this really strong, really beautiful sentence was off the record. In its place I was given permission to use a perfectly dull, perfectly formatted variant.”In the course of a day in President Macron’s home town, there is not a single photograph of him to be seen.Brigitte Fouré, the city’s mayor, tells me the poverty rate is two percentage points higher than the national average, and 80 per cent of inhabitants qualify for social housing. Amiens is ided between disadvantaged north and middle-class south. It was ruled by a communist mayor for 18 years in the 1970s and 1980s.Macron spent less than 17 years in Amiens, Fouré notes. He “went up” to Paris nearly a quarter of a century ago. “People here don’t know him. A lot of people are proud that the president is from Amiens, but that’s it. There has never been a real relationship between him and the city. There is no emotional tie.”On a beautiful spring day, the Élysée Palace feels light years away from dreary Picardy. The top-floor office of a close presidential adviser has a view over the gardens and the Eiffel Tower in the distance.Macron’s entourage is comprised mostly of fervently devoted young men with backgrounds similar to his own. No one at the Élysée, other than the president, can be quoted by name. “Our rule is that no one gets inidual credit for anything,” the adviser explains.The adviser reportedly thought up the slogan used by Macron when Trump pulled out of the Paris accord on climate change, “Make our planet great again!” But he refuses to confirm this. “We work collectively. Everything we do belongs to the president.”The adviser counts a resurgence of French pride as Macron’s greatest achievement so far. “It’s been a long time since the French have been proud to be French, in the eyes of the world,” he says. Though it contradicts my experience in Amiens, the statement rings true. Most people in the professional milieus of Paris adore Macron and are proud of his presidency.A few doors from the president’s office, the adviser lists Macron’s “important victories”: the revision of the labour code and the taxation of capital investments the overhaul of the country’s education system changes to the EU’s posted workers directive ending the giant squat at Notre-Dames-des-Landes and dismantling the nuclear reactor at Fessenheim. The last two issues had festered for decades. “They seemed impossible for any preceding majority,” the adviser says.Macron is doing as much for the disadvantaged as for the rich, the adviser insists. “We have increased basic payments to the poor, the disabled and the elderly. We’re decreasing social charges on lower salaries. The pendulum has swung much more towards the least advantaged than the most privileged.”So why isn’t that message getting through? Why do polls indicate that a majority consider Macron the “president of the rich”?For one reason, the adviser says. “He was an investment banker. What’s more, at Rothschild the most symbolic bank in the world. For many people, that proves his competence. The thing that makes him hated by some is the reason why he is respected by others.”Because Macron worked for four years as an investment banker, “everything he does that is perceived as right-wing or for the rich is blown out of proportion”, the adviser says.“And everything he does for the underprivileged, that would be seen as left-wing, is discounted. It’s a problem of perception.”Opinion polls can be read two ways. An Ifop-Fiducial poll published on April 10th gave Macron a 55 per cent approval rating, high for France, 11 months into a presidency. But a BFM poll published four days later showed that 44 per cent of voters are “disappointed”.Nine years of piano and the rigour of France’s best schools have honed Macron’s powers of concentration. On April 17th, he took questions from MEPs in Strasbourg for three hours, without notes, without so much as jotting down a question – a regular performance for Macron.“He is someone with a great capacity of attention and concentration,” says Monjou. “People who’ve met him often tell me they were struck by the intensity with which he looks at them, as if, for the time they are with him, they are all that matters.”“When you talk to him, it is as if he is downloading your brain,” says a former cabinet minister who sometimes advises Macron.Geraldine Byrne-Nason, now Ireland’s Ambassador to the United Nations, is doubtless the Irish official who knows Macron best. She became friends with the future president when both were “sherpas”, responsible for briefing and accompanying Irish and French leaders to EU summits, between 2012 until 2014. Byrne-Nason represented the taoiseach’s office, Macron the Élysée Palace.“We spent hours and hours in corridors through the night while the heads of state and government were locked in meetings,” Byrne-Nason recalls. “Emmanuel would be one of my first points of repair. If you’re going to be there for seven hours, you want someone interesting to talk to.”Byrne-Nason calls Macron “an insider-outsider” who has mastered the system but is able to regard it with detachment. “He has a healthy disrespect for bureaucracy, and Brussels is the home of process and procedure,” she says. “In that regard, we were kindred spirits. There was a slight impatience with the weight of slow-turning wheels.”Macron was particularly understanding of Irish difficulties during the bailout, Byrne-Nason says. She believes he was responsible for support offered by then president François Hollande.Byrne-Nason sent glowing reports about Macron’s potential to Dublin, long before he became a presidential candidate. Last September, she listened to what she calls his “extraordinary speech in favour of international co-operation and law” at the UN General Assembly. “It was poetic. It was powerful. It lit up the place.” Ireland could have signed off on every word, Byrne-Nason says, calling Macron “a superstar president who generates both respect and influence here amongst the 193 countries of the UN”.If Macron were Irish, he might be a hybrid of President Michael D Higgins and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar: part poetic intellectual, rooted in left-wing Christianity and fascinated by ideas part dynamic young liberal, determined to make the economy flourish.When Christian Monjou was Macron’s teacher at Henri IV, he says Macron talked a lot about the Fabians, the centre-left British intellectuals who founded the London School of Economics. The Fabians believed in “the inevitability of gradualness, the idea that everything that is gradual you won’t be able to go back on,” Monjou says. “It is totally anti-French, with our tradition of revolution, not evolution.“French political life is saturated in ideology,” Monjou continues. “With Macron, there is something you might call empirical or pragmatic. It’s familiar to an Anglo-Saxon, but it stands out in France. I suspect this slightly Anglo-Saxon approach may come from listening to me for three years.”Macron’s adviser stresses he is more than a mere pragmatist who would be content to solve one problem after another. “The two legs of Emmanuel Macron are action and reflection,” he says. “He always does both.”Macron’s en même temps mantra seeks to reconcile irreconcilabables, such as liberalism and social protection. The challenge is most obvious in his self-described “humane but realistic” immigration policy. Measures such as the Collomb circular, which authorises police to search emergency shelters for illegal migrants, have alienated some of Macron’s closest allies.In 1997, Macron’s spiritual father Paul Ricoeur delivered a lecture titled Foreigner Myself. Ricoeur cited Leviticus, about “the stranger that dwelleth with you”, and the Gospel of Matthew, which says: “I was a stranger and you took me in.” Opponents of Macron’s tough immigration policy say he has betrayed Ricoeur’s ideals. The criticism must sting, but Macron believes that unless he calms fears of unlimited migration, extreme right-wing populists will continue to gain ground, in France and across Europe.The necessity of ending the “society of status” in which family background, education and profession determine all aspects of one’s life, “gives coherence to everything we are doing”, says the presidential adviser.Philippe Aghion, who teaches economics at Harvard, the London School of Economics and the Collège de France, has greatly influenced the president’s economic thinking.Contrary to Thomas Piketty, the French author of the best-selling Capital in the 21st Century, Aghion and Macron believe that increasing social mobility, not high taxation, is the most effective way of reducing income inequality.Aghion wants to wean France off its post-second World War reliance on the Keynesian welfare state, in which government spending stimulates demand. He is inspired by John Maynard Keynes’s exact contemporary, the Austrian-born economist and Harvard professor Joseph Schumpeter, who believed that innovation and technical progress are the basis of a prosperous economy.Aghion’s theories underlie Macron’s reform of the French labour code last year, and the ongoing reform of professional training. It is, Aghion admitted in an interview, a liberal economic policy. But, he insists, it is also a social policy.Schumpeter believed in creative destruction, “which means you constantly have new jobs replacing old jobs, new firms replacing old firms”, Aghion says. It’s a hard sell to a French public that craves security and is adverse to change.Aghion advocates Danish-style “flexicurity” that combines labour market flexibility with unemployment benefits and retraining for laid-off workers. “In a nutshell: innovation, social protection and social mobility. That’s the triangle you want to achieve,” he says. Listening to him is like hearing Macron speak.Macron’s parents were left-leaning agnostics who did not baptise their children. At the age of 12, probably under the influence of his surroundings at La Pro, Macron asked to make his First Communion. A black-and-white photograph provided by one of his teachers, Gérard Banc, shows the future president making his profession of faith.Macron’s intellectual affiliation has been with the Christian left, with Ricoeur and Esprit magazine, for which he wrote a half-dozen articles, and whose board he sat on. French media interpreted gestures at Macron’s campaign rallies as signs of mysticism, for example when he asked his followers to “show benevolence”, or ended rallies Christ-like, with outstretched arms. On the night of his election, he concluded his speech in front of IM Pei’s glass pyramid at the Louvre with the words, “I will serve you with love”.During his evening with the Presidential Press Association, I asked Macron if, 28 years after his baptism, he still has faith. Personal belief is a taboo subject in secular France. Embarrassed laughter rippled across the room, but he addressed my question.“I believe in something we don’t see, yes,” Macron said. “I have faith in the generic sense of the term. If one doesn’t believe in one’s lucky star, in good fortune, in one’s country, one doesn’t do what I’m doing. I believe in a form of transcendency.”Following Macron’s April 9th speech to French bishops, leftists and Freemasons accused him of attacking la laicité, which has been France’s official policy of state-enforced secularism since 1905.“We share the confused feeling that the link between church and state has been damaged, and that it is as important to you as it is to me to repair it,” Macron said.\u0026nbsp The purpose of laicité was “certainly not to deny spirituality” he argued. \u0026nbsp“For biographical, personal and intellectual reasons, I have the highest opinion of Catholics.”There is something Jesuitical, indeed monklike, about Macron. Unlike his predecessors, he shows no need to eat, sleep or chase women. Asked what has been the “greatest trial” of being in office, the French president said he has “measured the weight and the solitude and the end of innocence” that come with power.“I do not think it is a trial,” Macron continued. “The French have authorised me to do what I committed to do. One thing is certain. There is no respite, which may explain why I sometimes look pale. I do not feel authorised to enjoy any form of leisure. I take time to reflect. I read and write. But in the times we live in, there is no room for respite. That may be the trial of power, though I don’t live it as such. There is undeniably a form of asceticism.”Macron sees his rise to power as the result of a troubled epoch. “I don’t forget where I come from and why I am here today,” he said. “I am the fruit of a form of brutality in history, of a break-in, because France was unhappy and uneasy. If I forget that for one moment, it will be the beginning of the trial.”"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"Ahmed Abu Hussein worked for Al-Shaab radio and had protective vest marked \u0026lsquoPress\u0026rsquoGovernment U-turn after no African country willing to accept migrants on Israel\u0026rsquos termsHassan Rouhani says US president lacks qualifications to assess nuclear dealDamascus Letter: Residents alternate between \u0026lsquonormal\u0026rsquo and \u0026lsquowar normal\u0026rsquo livesIsis focus on Arab world may starve western intelligence as affiliate groups go dormantMany children reportedly among dead and injured in attack on party in isolated villageAngel Gahona was reporting on damage done during anti-government protestsOne daughter under investigation for allegedly throwing water at a business meetingTwo Palestinian refugee civilians killed in adjacent Palestinian camp of YarmoukForeign minister says Tehran could restart nuclear activities if Trump exits pactMore than 100 wounded in attack outside voting registration centre in KabulOPCW delegation has reportedly taken samples from the site in DoumaOver 120 wounded, say Palestinian sources, but number protesting falls significantlyAir strikes target rebel enclave as Assad moves to strengthen position near capitalUS says has credible information that Russia and Syria sought to \u0026lsquosanitise\u0026rsquo Douma gassing siteJihadis in villages of non-Muslim Yazidi Kurds persecute them for their faith and ethnicityLeaders mark decades of progress but failure to deliver peace among country\u0026rsquos many problemsAdvance UN security detail forced to withdraw from Douma after being fired uponNumber of executions on judicial assembly line raises fears of miscarriages of justice"},{"url":null,"title":"stormy daniels michael cohen acts like he is above the law","story":"  April 17, 2018Michael Cohen forced to disclose Fox News presenter\u0026rsquos name during court hearing "},{"url":null,"title":"telegraph launches next phase words chosen brand campaign","story":"The  has launched the second phase of the Words Chosen Well brand campaign which aims to showcase its award-winning quality journalism and raise brand awareness.The campaign started with a new television advert debuted during the commercial break of Channel 4’s Gogglebox on Friday 20th April. Created by adam\u0026ampeveDDB  in collaboration with The ’s in-house marketing and creative teams, it builds on the success of last year’s campaign with a bigger and bolder creative that utilises important cultural references and leans on some of the most emotive and impactful events of our times, highlighting iconic moments when words have been considered and chosen well.The ’s new campaign seeks to demonstrate the influence and importance of the spoken and written word, and the role that quality journalism plays in providing news, insight and analysis.

Children in developing countries who cannot access care are particularly vulnerable, Dr Zaidi added..html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:0}.html-embedponent .quoteponent ponent-content{margin-right:16px}.quote__source,.quote__author{white-space:normal}@media only screen and (min-width:730px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-60.83px}.html-embedponent .quoteponent .quote__content:before{margin-left:-12pxpadding-right:1px}}@media only screen and (min-width:1008px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-82.33px}}People don’t think of vaccines as a poverty reduction tool but they areDr Anita Zaidi“Rotavirus is a disease that can kill within hours. Children can become severely dehydrated and die on the way to a clinic or hospital. But it’s not just about deaths. I’m a paediatrician and it’s important we do whatever we can to keep kids out of hospital,” she said.The Gates Foundation is highlighting the importance of vaccines with the launch of a video by Aardman Animations, creators of Wallace and Gromit. According to data from the World Health Organization there has been an 84 per cent fall in the number of measles deaths since the introduction of a vaccine against the disease. And so far this year there have been just eight cases of polio thanks to the global vaccination campaign.Heather Wright, executive producer at Aardman, said the campaign had a simple message: to urge parents and carers to get their child vaccinated.\u0026quotYou would throw yourself in front of a bus to protect your child so why wouldn\u0027t you get your child immunised?\u0026quot she said. According to the latest data 95 countries have introduced a vaccine against rotavirus, and 22 have plans to do so. These include many high-income countries such as the UK and the US, and low-income countries which receive financial help from Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance.However, around 75 countries have not introduced the vaccine: these include middle income countries such as China, Russia, Egypt and Chile which do not qualify for support from Gavi. Dr Zaidi said that countries had many competing priorities but stressed that the vaccine was not only good for a nation’s health, but also economic prospects. In many countries, where there is no system of health coverage, people face financial ruin when they or members of their family are hospitalised.Vaccines | Global coverage by the end of 2016A recent study looked at the impact of the introduction of various vaccines, including rotavirus, on 41 low and middle-income countries between 2016 and 2030. It predicted that as well as averting 819 deaths for every one million people vaccinated the rotavirus vaccine would also prevent 242,000 people from facing catastrophic health costs.Dr Zaidi said: “People don’t think of vaccines as a poverty reduction tool but they are. People in low income countries need to recognise what powerful tools vaccines are for reducing the health and financial burden of the poor.”Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security Alfie Evans\u0026#39s father threatened private murder prosecution against doctors treating the toddlerShooting victim may have been killed for bringing rape gang to justiceAlexis Jay inquiry finds police chiefs need better training to deal with child sex abuseRodrigo Duterte orders deportation of 71-year-old Australian nun for joining protest in PhilippinesVenice to segregate tourist walking routes through city ahead of weekend onslaught Comment: How Brexit’s Mr Breezy almost lost his coolRoyal baby boy: When will the name be announced and what was his weight?Royal baby latest news: New prince meets family as world awaits name announcementEmmanuel Macron rebuts Donald Trump on climate change and Iran nuclear deal in Congress addressCouncil rakes in up to £400,000 in six months by fining parents on the school runKnow your rights as a TSB customerNearly 20m children around the world miss out on life-saving vaccinesGerman state orders all government buildings to display cross to reflect ‘cultural identity’ Pakistan pins hope on typhoid vaccine as it battles superbug outbreakBeekeeper says 700,000 of her insects may have been killed by rival in arson attack The dark ‘incel’ internet subculture praised on the Facebook page of the Toronto van attack suspectAlfie Evans\u0026#39 father threatens to privately prosecute three NHS doctors on conspiracy to murder charges Skeleton of child trying to shelter from Vesuvius eruption uncovered in PompeiiWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"royal baby boy names runners riders prince cambridge kate middleton","story":"As the Royal baby name wait goes on, observers will no doubt look into the history books in search for the couple\u0027s motivation.When the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge pick a name for their newborn son, it is likely to be one that carries the weight of history with it something meaningful something with precedent.So while Ethan, Logan and Jaxon were all popular last year, they are unlikely to be bestowed upon the younger brother of Prince George and Princess Charlotte. So what, then, are the runners and riders for the name of the latest Prince of Cambridge?Arthur has been the bookmakers\u0027 favourite for a boy, followed by Albert.

Former prime minister David Cameron has a son called Arthur.Queen Victoria used to insist that the name Albert was used as a middle name by her descendants, if not a first, in honour of her much-loved consort Prince Albert.By choosing Albert or Bertie for a boy, the Duke and Duchess would be honouring Queen Elizabeth II\u0027s father, George VI, who was actually Albert Frederick Arthur George but always known to his family as Bertie.Shy, stammering Bertie was forced to become king when his brother Edward VIII abdicated, but won the nation\u0027s affection by standing firm in London during the Second World War.A lasting tribute to the Duke of Edinburgh might see the new Prince of Cambridge called Philip.Both Prince Charles and Prince William have Philip as a middle name.The Duke of Edinburgh - known for his dedication to duty and his acerbic wit - has been married to the Queen for more than 70 years and is the nation\u0027s longest serving consort.A Prince Freddie of Cambridge would have a historical link to the 1st Duke of Cambridge.Prince Adolphus Frederick lived from 1774 to 1850 and was a son of George III.He was apparently very fond of interrupting church services by bellowing out \u0026quotBy all means\u0026quot if the priest said \u0026quotLet us pray\u0026quot.William may want to pay tribute to his father - but perhaps as a middle name as it may be considered too similar to Charlotte.James could be chosen to signify the Duchess\u0027s affection for her brother, the baby\u0027s uncle, James Middleton.William already has a cousin James, the Earl and Countess of Wessex\u0027s son, Viscount Severn.James is a Stuart name. James I, son of Mary, Queen of Scots, had been king of Scotland for 36 years as James VI when he became king of England in 1603.They could choose William as a middle name for a boy, but also perhaps Michael as a middle name out of respect for Kate\u0027s father.Kate\u0027s grandfather on her paternal side was called Peter, while on her maternal side, her grandfather was Ronald.Thomas also appears several times in Kate\u0027s family tree, as does Francis.When it comes to godparents, the youngest Cambridge child might well be dealt the best hand yet.

all kinds of things that prevent people from being able to safely get around. \u0026quotIt just doesn\u0027t really encompass the range of vision problems that people have, and it\u0027s quite misleading in that very few people have no vision at all,\u0026quot she told the Daily . \u0026quotWe\u0027re trying to create more of a positive image of people because actually there are people who are severely sight-impaired who are doing incredible things and living really independent lives. \u0026quotWe started a project to help young children and families, and we\u0027ve been told at the hospital when a child gets a diagnosis, and they give them a leaflet, you can see the parents physically react in shock to see the words \u0027Association for the Blind\u0027. \u0026quotWe took a phone call the other day and someone asked what our charity name was and they were really upset by it and really shocked by it.\u0026quotShe suggested the new name could incorporate \u0026quotpositive\u0026quot words such as \u0026quotvision\u0026quot which have a \u0026quotdouble meaning - with our vision for the future\u0026quot.The charity has already received a number of suggestions for their new identity, but the final decision will be a joint one, said the Association\u0027s director Clive Cure.Mr Cure said: \u0026quotWe\u0027ve had quite a few suggestions come in already for the new name, but no decisions have been made yet.\u0026quotWe\u0027ve been aware for a while now that our name could be a barrier to visually impaired people who may not see themselves as blind.\u0026quotThis is a great opportunity to refresh our image, bolster our presence and make people aware of our services.\u0026quotOther charities had already stopped using the term \u0026quotblind\u0026quot.

 which is currently reviewing whether to keep part of their £6.3bn endowment fund invested in fossil fuels - amid increasing pressure from both staff and students. Bob Dudley, the company\u0027s chief executive, came under fire after telling an industry conference: \u0026quot\u0026quotWe donate and do a lot of research at Cambridge so I hope they come to their senses.\u0026quotThe comments reignited the row just a week after 350 academics including Professor Sir David King, who was Britain’s Special Representative for Climate Change after his stint as the government’s Chief Scientific Advisor, and Professor Sir Thomas Blundell, the former president of the UK Science Council, wrote an open letter to Cambridge. “We ... call on the university’s investment office to immediately freeze any new investments in fossil fuel companies, and to est from direct ownership and any commingled funds that include fossil fuel public equities and corporate bonds within five years,” it said.Cambridge University has repeatedly clashed with both academics and students over their investments in fossil fuels, part of the largest endowment fund in the UK, partly due to concerns over research funding.BP, ExxonMobil and Shell have all donated money to the university and it has said in the past that it needs to consider the \u0026quotconsequences of any estment\u0026quot.  BP have emphatically denied that comments by Bob Dudley, pictured, represented any sort of threat In 201516 BP gave grants worth around 1.4 million pounds and in 2000 a 22 million pound donation from BP helped to create the BP Institute for Multiphase Flow, which researches ways of producing oil and gas more efficiently. Activists in the Cambridge Zero Carbon Society Cambridge\u0027s said that Mr Dudley\u0027s comments mean that \u0026quotCambridge\u0027s academic independence is under threat\u0026quotThey added: \u0026quotUniversity authorities are in hock to private interests, as demonstrated by this outrageous threat from BP’s Chief Executive... \u0026quotIf the University is unable to est its endowment in line with the democratic wishes of students and staff due to these threats, then there is no longer academic independence at Cambridge.\u0026quotCambridge University refused to comment on the row, instead referring to BP\u0027s press office.The oil company emphatically denied that Mr Dudley\u0027s comments represented a threat. A spokesman said: \u0026quotBP has long worked closely with the University of Cambridge - and we don’t expect this to change. One should not infer from Bob’s comments that he was in anyway linking our support of Cambridge with the University’s decision on whether or not to est from the oil and gas industry. That decision is up to the University and the University alone.”Cambridge Zero Carbon Society responded by saying that if it was not an attempt at \u0026quotblackmail\u0026quot then \u0026quotthe last of University management\u0027s justifications for inaction is null and void. Do they have any actual reason for trampling on democracy other than not wanting to upset their corporate pals?\u0026quotCambridge’s University Council will decide whether to change their investment in the coming weeks, with the campaign group calling on them to est \u0026quotnot just for the sake of democracy, but also to salvage Cambridge\u0027s integrity.\u0026quotNewcastle, Southampton and Durham universities have all ested from fossil fuel. Cambridge MP Daniel Zeichner said: \u0026quotI think that they were poorly judged comments from Mr Dudley. I think that that principle of separating scientific research from Government interference is a good thing and I am very happy that companies like BP invest but that doesn\u0027t give them any say over the direction of the research.\u0026quotHe said that it is \u0026quotabsolutely right that the pressure is kept up on Cambridge\u0026quot as the estment has broad support, including from within the institution, and they should use their global reputation to lead the way and \u0026quotfollow the science\u0026quot. University of CambridgeAlfie Evans\u0026#39s father threatened private murder prosecution against doctors treating the toddlerShooting victim may have been killed for bringing rape gang to justiceAlexis Jay inquiry finds police chiefs need better training to deal with child sex abuseRodrigo Duterte orders deportation of 71-year-old Australian nun for joining protest in PhilippinesVenice to segregate tourist walking routes through city ahead of weekend onslaught Comment: How Brexit’s Mr Breezy almost lost his coolRoyal baby boy: When will the name be announced and what was his weight?Royal baby latest news: New prince meets family as world awaits name announcementEmmanuel Macron rebuts Donald Trump on climate change and Iran nuclear deal in Congress addressCouncil rakes in up to £400,000 in six months by fining parents on the school runKnow your rights as a TSB customerNearly 20m children around the world miss out on life-saving vaccinesGerman state orders all government buildings to display cross to reflect ‘cultural identity’ Pakistan pins hope on typhoid vaccine as it battles superbug outbreakBeekeeper says 700,000 of her insects may have been killed by rival in arson attack The dark ‘incel’ internet subculture praised on the Facebook page of the Toronto van attack suspectAlfie Evans\u0026#39 father threatens to privately prosecute three NHS doctors on conspiracy to murder charges Skeleton of child trying to shelter from Vesuvius eruption uncovered in PompeiiBanking heiress Kate Rothschild victim of a £500,000 jewellery burglary while her children sleptWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/04/25/TELEMMGLPICT000161495829_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqdTSan_LNDPP3QEi8Lkq48cm66Dsv9ACvsGijAjUzMgc.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"council rakes 400000 six months fining parents school run","story":"Woodcote Primary in Coulsdon, south London, which was one of three schools where the council rolled out a road-closure schemeA council has raked in up to almost £400,000 in motoring fines in just six months by targeting parents on the school run.The crackdown was the work of Croydon Borough Council, who closed off roads to those dropping children to and from three primary schools in the capital. Officials claimed it was to manage congestion, but during the six-month scheme up to £380,120 worth of fines were handed out to parents. The pilot project saw parents banned from driving through roads outside Heavers Farm Primary, St Chad\u0027s and Woodcote Primary School in south east London.A total of 2,924 penalty notice charges - at £130 each - were issued between October 2 last year and March 2 by Croydon Borough Council.St Chad\u0026#39s Primary School in south LondonA Freedom of Information request showed that the council made a minimum of £190,060 and a maximum of £380,120 in motoring fines.During the six month trial the roads were only closed to school-run parents and the council used automatic number plate recognition to ensure locals could use the roads.Parents were given the chance to pay a discounted fine of £65 if they paid within 14 days.Croydon Borough Council confirmed that as parents became used to the restrictions fewer fines were handed out.A spokesman said: \u0026quotThe council piloted this scheme because inconsiderate school run driving had become a safety risk to children and a nuisance to residents.\u0026quotThe primaries involved have since reported less congestion, a safer road for children to walk to school in and more punctuality, and over time the council has needed to issue fewer fines.\u0026quotHeavers Farm Primary School in south LondonWoodcote Primary in Coulsdon, south London, received the most fines with 1,392, Heavers Farm received 823 and St Chad\u0027s 709.The spokesman added: \u0026quotAny surplus money from parking fines in Croydon is spent on funding the Freedom Pass, a travel scheme for the over-60s in London, and drivers who pay their fine within a fortnight are charged £65 instead of £130.\u0026quotThe council\u0027s traffic management advisory committee will decide later this year whether to make the schemes permanent.\u0026quotPlease review our commenting policyAlfie Evans\u0026#39s father threatened private murder prosecution against doctors treating the toddlerShooting victim may have been killed for bringing rape gang to justiceAlexis Jay inquiry finds police chiefs need better training to deal with child sex abuseRodrigo Duterte orders deportation of 71-year-old Australian nun for joining protest in PhilippinesVenice to segregate tourist walking routes through city ahead of weekend onslaught Comment: How Brexit’s Mr Breezy almost lost his coolRoyal baby boy: When will the name be announced and what was his weight?Royal baby latest news: New prince meets family as world awaits name announcementEmmanuel Macron rebuts Donald Trump on climate change and Iran nuclear deal in Congress addressKnow your rights as a TSB customerNearly 20m children around the world miss out on life-saving vaccinesGerman state orders all government buildings to display cross to reflect ‘cultural identity’ Pakistan pins hope on typhoid vaccine as it battles superbug outbreakBeekeeper says 700,000 of her insects may have been killed by rival in arson attack The dark ‘incel’ internet subculture praised on the Facebook page of the Toronto van attack suspectAlfie Evans\u0026#39 father threatens to privately prosecute three NHS doctors on conspiracy to murder charges Skeleton of child trying to shelter from Vesuvius eruption uncovered in PompeiiBanking heiress Kate Rothschild victim of a £500,000 jewellery burglary while her children sleptWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"french president emmanuel macron addresses us congress watch","story":"Emmanuel Macron demanded climate change action and defended the Iran nuclear deal on Wednesday in a pointed rebuke of Donald Trump’s “America First” foreign policy. Addressing a joint session of the US Congress, the French president called on America to remain engaged in the world in a rebuttal of Mr Trump’s isolationist instincts. Mr Macron said there was no “Planet B” as he predicted the US will one day return to the Paris climate change agreement, reversing Mr Trump’s decision for withdrawal. The French president rebuked the US president for wanting to rip up the Iran agreement, but agreed that the regime must “never” be allowed to get nuclear weapons. And on tariffs, Mr Macron warned that abandoning “free and fair trade” would “destroy jobs”, “increase prices” and punish the middle class. Brigitte Macron arrives in the House of Representatives ahead of her husband\u0026#39s speech Mike Pence and Paul Ryan watch French President Emmanuel Macron address CongressMr Macron praised America and France\u0027s \u0026quotshared ideals\u0026quot forged in revolution and hardened in fights against the Cold War and Nazism.Mr Macron also said the world’s dangers will spiral and the United Nations (UN) and Nato be weakened if the US stopped fighting for its values overseas. “Today, the call we hear is the call of history,\u0026quot Mr Macron said in an emotive call to arms near the end of his speech. “This is the time of determination and courage. What we cherish is at stake. What we love is in danger. We have no choice but to prevail and together we shall prevail.\u0026quotHe also warned: “We can choose isolationism. But closing the door to the world will not stop the evolution of the world. If we decide to open our eyes wider, we will be much stronger.”The speech ended a three-day US state visit that has seen Mr Macron reaffirm his position as the world leader with the closest personal relationship with Mr Trump. The pair’s touchy-feely series of press engagements have made headlines in recent days and was referenced jokingly by Mr Macron in his address.  But the speech - the first joint session from a world leader since 2016 - showed Mr Macron was willing to publicly challenge the US president on policy. On climate change, Mr Macron asked “what is the meaning of our lives if we spend it destroying the future of our children?” He said it was time to “make our planet great again” - echoing Mr Trump’s campaign slogan - and predicted the US will \u0026quotone day\u0026quot return to the Paris climate change agreement. That triggered the biggest moment of applause as Democrats leapt to their feet while Republicans gave a more lukewarm response - one of a number of points when his speech split the chamber. \u0026quotI believe in building a planet for our children that is still inhabitable in 25 years,\u0026quot he said.In a pointed reference to Mr Trump, he added: \u0026quotSome people think that securing industries and current jobs is more important than climate change ... I hear this concern, but we must find a smooth transition.\u0026quot\u0026quotLet us face it. There is no planet B,\u0026quot he said.On the Iran nuclear deal, Mr Macron pledged France would stay in the 2015 agreement and criticised Mr Trump’s hints he will withdraw. However he repeated Tuesday’s call for a new wider deal that will tackle Iran\u0027s ballistic missile programme and behaviour in Syria and Yemen as well as nuclear issues. And Mr Macron pledged: \u0026quotIran shall never possess any nuclear weapons. Not now. Not in 5 years. Not in 10 years. Never.\u0026quotThe French president did not refrain from expressing his views on Mr Trump\u0026#39s policiesOn wider themes, Mr Macron repeatedly challenged Mr Trump’s instinct to disengage from the world - a prominent foreign policy theme in his 2016 election campaign. Mr Macron said: \u0026quotToday, the international community needs to step up our game and build the 21st century world order based on the perennial principles we established together after World War II.\u0026quotHe also said: \u0026quotWe must remember the warning of President Theodore Roosevelt: Freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction. We didn\u0027t pass it to our children in the bloodstream.

And some vaccines, such as yellow fever, are recommended for particular regions. .html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:0}.html-embedponent .quoteponent ponent-content{margin-right:16px}.quote__source,.quote__author{white-space:normal}@media only screen and (min-width:730px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-60.83px}.html-embedponent .quoteponent .quote__content:before{margin-left:-12pxpadding-right:1px}}@media only screen and (min-width:1008px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-82.33px}}However, poor vaccine coverage is not just a problem in developing countries. Latest data from WHO shows that in Europe there were 21,000 cases of measles in 2017, compared to 5,000 the previous year.And this was partly due to a decline in the number of people vaccinated as well as a shortage in the supply of vaccines and poor disease surveillance, said WHO.The largest outbreaks of the disease were in Romania, where there were 5,562 cases and Italy, where there were 5,006 cases. In Germany there were 927 cases and the disease and in the UK there were 282. WHO launched the Global Vaccine Action Plan in 2011 with a goal to preventing millions of deaths but some key targets are off track.Vaccines | Global coverage by the end of 2016For example, 40 priority countries should have eliminated maternal and neonatal tetanus by 2015 but only 18 countries have met this goal. And by 2016 at least four WHO world regions should have eliminated measles – only one, the WHO region of the Americas, has achieved this. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director general of the WHO, said World Immunisation Week, was an opportunity \u0026quotto remind everyone of the incredible value of vaccines\u0026quot.\u0026quotYes, vaccines work, vaccines prevent disease, vaccines save lives,\u0026quot he said. Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security Alfie Evans\u0026#39s father threatened private murder prosecution against doctors treating the toddlerShooting victim may have been killed for bringing rape gang to justiceAlexis Jay inquiry finds police chiefs need better training to deal with child sex abuseRodrigo Duterte orders deportation of 71-year-old Australian nun for joining protest in PhilippinesVenice to segregate tourist walking routes through city ahead of weekend onslaught Comment: How Brexit’s Mr Breezy almost lost his coolRoyal baby boy: When will the name be announced and what was his weight?Royal baby latest news: New prince meets family as world awaits name announcementEmmanuel Macron rebuts Donald Trump on climate change and Iran nuclear deal in Congress addressCouncil rakes in up to £400,000 in six months by fining parents on the school runKnow your rights as a TSB customerGerman state orders all government buildings to display cross to reflect ‘cultural identity’ Pakistan pins hope on typhoid vaccine as it battles superbug outbreakBeekeeper says 700,000 of her insects may have been killed by rival in arson attack The dark ‘incel’ internet subculture praised on the Facebook page of the Toronto van attack suspectAlfie Evans\u0026#39 father threatens to privately prosecute three NHS doctors on conspiracy to murder charges Skeleton of child trying to shelter from Vesuvius eruption uncovered in PompeiiBanking heiress Kate Rothschild victim of a £500,000 jewellery burglary while her children sleptWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/04/25/TELEMMGLPICT000135643698_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqrnKnv-EZ40EhYX8nU7dr81GwsaKsFlgjiGj2x2RvG-c.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"tsb meltdown shows never accept slaves technology","story":"IT failures at British Airways, the NHS and now TSB have shaken our confidence in companies\u0026#39 use of our data  I remember very clearly my father’s initial scepticism about electric car windows.

walked away and said ‘You know I get right annoyed with that monkey’, referring to me as the ‘monkey’,” the final year student said. He reported the incident to the university on Monday to raise

Rohan Deb Roy says we must rethink research and practice to escape this dark pastSir Ronald Ross had just returned from an expedition to Sierra Leone. The British doctor had been leading efforts to tackle the malaria that so often killed English colonists in the country, and in December 1899 he gave a lecture to the Liverpool Chamber of Commerce about his experience. In the words of a contemporary report, he argued that “in the coming century, the success of imperialism will depend largely upon success with the microscope”.Teenage vandals sentenced by judge to read history booksRoss, who won the Nobel Prize for Medicine for his malaria research, would later deny he was talking specifically about his own work. But his point neatly summarised how the efforts of British scientists was intertwined with their country’s attempt to conquer a quarter of the world.Ross was very much a child of empire, born in India and later working there as a surgeon in the imperial army. So when he used a microscope to identify how a dreaded tropical disease was transmitted, he would have realised that his discovery promised to safeguard the health of British troops and officials in the tropics. In turn, this would enable Britain to expand and consolidate its colonial rule.Ronald Ross at his lab in 1898 Calcutta (Welcome Collection)Ross’s words also suggest how science was used to argue imperialism was morally justified because it reflected British goodwill towards colonised people. It implied that scientific insights could be redeployed to promote superior health, hygiene and sanitation among colonial subjects. Empire was seen as a benevolent, selfless project. As Ross’s fellow Nobel laureate Rudyard Kipling described it, it was the “white man’s burden” to introduce modernity and civilised governance in the colonies.But science at this time was more than just a practical or ideological tool when it came to empire. Since its birth around the same time as Europeans began conquering other parts of the world, modern Western science was inextricably entangled with colonialism, especially British imperialism. And the legacy of that colonialism still pervades science today.As a result, recent years have seen an increasing number of calls to “decolonise science”, even going so far as to advocate scrapping the practice and findings of modern science altogether. Tackling the lingering influence of colonialism in science is much needed. But there are also dangers that the more extreme attempts to do so could play into the hands of religious fundamentalists and ultra-nationalists. We must find a way to remove the inequalities promoted by modern science while making sure its huge potential benefits work for everyone, instead of letting it become a tool for oppression.When a slave in an early 18th-century Jamaican plantation was found with a supposedly poisonous plant, his European overlords showed him no mercy. Suspected of conspiring to cause disorder on the plantation, he was treated with typical harshness and hanged to death. The historical records don’t even mention his name. His execution might also have been forgotten forever if it weren\u0027t for the scientific enquiry that followed. Europeans on the plantation became curious about the plant and, building on the slave’s “accidental finding”, they eventually concluded it wasn’t poisonous at all.Instead it became known as a cure for worms, warts, ringworm, freckles and cold swellings, with the name Apocynum erectum. As the historian Pratik Chakrabarti argues in a recent book, this incident serves as a neat example of how, under European political and commercial domination, gathering knowledge about nature could take place simultaneously with exploitation.For imperialists and their modern apologists, science and medicine were among the gracious gifts from the European empires to the colonial world. What’s more, the 19th-century imperial ideologues saw the scientific successes of the West as a way to allege that non-Europeans were intellectually inferior and so deserved and needed to be colonised.A racist caricature of European scientists visiting Africa. The severed head on the right is that of Ronald Ross (Welcome Collection)In the incredibly influential 1835 memo Minute on Indian Education, British politician Thomas Macaulay denounced Indian languages partially because they lacked scientific words. He suggested that languages such as Sanskrit and Arabic were “barren of useful knowledge”, “fruitful of monstrous superstitions” and contained “false history, false astronomy, false medicine”.Such opinions weren’t confined to colonial officials and imperial ideologues and were often shared by various representatives of the scientific profession. The prominent Victorian scientist Sir Francis Galton argued that the “the average intellectual standard of the negro race is some two grades below our own (the Anglo Saxon)”. Even Charles Darwin implied that “savage races” such as “the negro or the Australian” were closer to gorillas than were white Caucasians.Yet 19th-century British science was itself built upon a global repertoire of wisdom, information, and living and material specimens collected from various corners of the colonial world. Extracting raw materials from colonial mines and plantations went hand in hand with extracting scientific information and specimens from colonised people.Leading public scientific institutions in imperial Britain, such as the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew and the British Museum, as well as ethnographic displays of “exotic” humans, relied on a global network of colonial collectors and go-betweens. By 1857, the East India Company’s London zoological museum boasted insect specimens from across the colonial world, including from Ceylon, India, Java and Nepal.The scientists who used this evidence were rarely sedentary geniuses working in laboratories insulated from imperial politics and economics. The likes of Charles Darwin on the Beagle and botanist Sir Joseph Banks on the Endeavour literally rode on the voyages of British exploration and conquest that enabled imperialism.Sir Hans Sloane’s imperial collection started the British Museum (Paul HudsonWikipedia)Other scientific careers were directly driven by imperial achievements and needs. Early anthropological work in British India, such as Sir Herbert Hope Risley’s Tribes and Castes of Bengal, published in 1891, drew upon massive administrative classifications of the colonised population.Map-making operations including the work of the Great Trigonometrical Survey in South Asia came from the need to cross colonial landscapes for trade and military campaigns. The geological surveys commissioned around the world by Sir Roderick Murchison were linked with intelligence gathering on minerals and local politics.Efforts to curb epidemic diseases such as plague, smallpox and cholera led to attempts to discipline the routines, diets and movements of colonial subjects. This opened up a political process that the historian David Arnold has termed the “colonisation of the body”. By controlling people as well as countries, the authorities turned medicine into a weapon with which to secure imperial rule.New technologies were also put to use expanding and consolidating the empire. Photographs were used for creating physical and racial stereotypes of different groups of colonised people. Steamboats were crucial in the colonial exploration of Africa in the mid-19th century. Aircraft enabled the British to surveil and then bomb rebellions in 20th-century Iraq. The innovation of wireless radio in the 1890s was shaped by Britain’s need for discreet, long-distance communication during the South African war.In these ways and more, Europe’s leaps in science and technology during this period both drove and were driven by its political and economic domination of the rest of the world. Modern science was effectively built on a system that exploited millions of people. At the same time it helped justify and sustain that exploitation, in ways that hugely influenced how Europeans saw other races and countries. What’s more, colonial legacies continue to shape trends in science today.Imperialist Cecil Rhodes planned a railway and telegraph line to connect Africa (Alamy)Since the formal end of colonialism, we have become better at recognising how scientific expertise has come from many different countries and ethnicities. Yet former imperial nations still appear almost self-evidently superior to most of the once-colonised countries when it comes to scientific study. The empires may have virtually disappeared, but the cultural biases and disadvantages they imposed have not.How to fix all of your sleep problems with scienceYou just have to look at the statistics on the way research is carried out globally to see how the scientific hierarchy created by colonialism continues. The annual rankings of universities are published mostly by the Western world and tend to favour its own institutions. Academic journals across the different branches of science are mostly dominated by the US and Western Europe.It is unlikely that anyone who wishes to be taken seriously today would explain this data in terms of innate intellectual superiority determined by race. The blatant scientific racism of the 19th century has now given way to the notion that excellence in science and technology are a euphemism for significant funding, infrastructure and economic development.Because of this, most of Asia, Africa and the Caribbean is seen either as playing catch-up with the developed world or as dependent on its scientific expertise and financial aid. Some academics have identified these trends as evidence of the persisting “intellectual domination of the West” and labelled them a form of “neo-colonialism”.Not all international collaborations are equal (US Army AfricaFlickr)Various well-meaning efforts to bridge this gap have struggled to go beyond the legacies of colonialism. For example, scientific collaboration between countries can be a fruitful way of sharing skills and knowledge, and learning from the intellectual insights of one another. But when an economically weaker part of the world collaborates almost exclusively with very strong scientific partners, it can take the form of dependence, if not subordination.A 2009 study showed that about 80 per cent of Central Africa’s research papers were produced with collaborators based outside the region. With the exception of Rwanda, each of the African countries principally collaborated with its former coloniser. As a result, these dominant collaborators shaped scientific work in the region. They prioritised research on immediate local health-related issues, particularly infectious and tropical diseases, rather than encouraging local scientists to also pursue the fuller range of topics pursued in the West.In the same study, 60 per cent to 70 per cent of the scientists based in developed countries did not acknowledge their collaborators in poorer countries as co-authors in their papers. This is despite the fact they later claimed in the survey that the papers were the result of close collaborations.International health charities, which are dominated by Western countries, have faced similar issues. After the formal end of colonial rule, global health workers long appeared to represent a superior scientific culture in an alien environment. Unsurprisingly, interactions between these skilled and dedicated foreign personnel and the local population have often been characterised by mistrust.For example, during the smallpox eradication campaigns of the 1970s and the polio campaign of past two decades, the World Health Organization’s representatives found it quite challenging to mobilise willing participants and volunteers in the interiors of South Asia. On occasions they even saw resistance on religious grounds from local people. But their stringent responses, which included the close surveillance of villages, cash incentives for identifying concealed cases and house-to-house searches, added to this climate of mutual suspicion. These experiences of mistrust are reminiscent of those created by strict colonial policies of plague control.Polio eradication needs willing volunteers (Department for International DevelopmentFlickr)Western pharmaceutical firms also play a role by carrying out questionable clinical trials in the developing world where, as journalist Sonia Shah puts it, “ethical oversight is minimal and desperate patients abound”. This raises moral questions about whether multinational corporations misuse the economic weaknesses of once-colonised countries in the interests of scientific and medical research.The colonial image of science as a domain of the white man even continues to shape contemporary scientific practice in developed countries. People from ethnic minorities are underrepresented in science and engineering jobs and more likely to face discrimination and other barriers to career progress.To finally leave behind the baggage of colonialism, scientific collaborations need to become more symmetrical and founded on greater degrees of mutual respect. We need to decolonise science by recognising the true achievements and potential of scientists from outside the Western world. Yet while this structural change is necessary, the path to decolonisation has dangers of its own.In October 2016, a YouTube video of students discussing the decolonisation of science went surprisingly viral. The clip, which has been watched more than 1m times, shows a student from the University of Cape Town arguing that science as a whole should be scrapped and started again in a way that accommodates non-Western perspectives and experiences. The student’s point that science cannot explain so-called black magic earned the argument much derision and mockery. But you only have to look at the racist and ignorant comments left beneath the video to see why the topic is so in need of discussion.Inspired by the recent “Rhodes Must Fall” campaign against the university legacy of the imperialist Cecil Rhodes, the Cape Town students became associated with the phrase “science must fall”. While it may be interestingly provocative, this slogan isn’t helpful at a time when government policies in a range of countries including the US, UK and India are already threatening to impose major limits on science research funding.More alarmingly, the phrase also runs the risk of being used by religious fundamentalists and cynical politicians in their arguments against established scientific theories such as climate change. This is a time when the integrity of experts is under fire and science is the target of political manoeuvring. So polemically rejecting the subject altogether only plays into the hands of those who have no interest in decolonisation.Alongside its imperial history, science has also inspired many people in the former colonial world to demonstrate remarkable courage, critical thinking and dissent in the face of established beliefs and conservative traditions. These include the Indian anti-caste activist Rohith Vemula and the murdered atheist authors Narendra Dabholkar and Avijit Roy. Demanding that “science must fall” fails to do justice to this legacy.The call to decolonise science, as in the case of other disciplines such as literature, can encourage us to rethink the dominant image that scientific knowledge is the work of white men. But this much-needed critique of the scientific canon carries the other danger of inspiring alternative national narratives in post-colonial countries.A campaigner during a March for Science protest in Melbourne (Wikipedia Commons )For example, some Indian nationalists, including the country’s current prime minister, Narendra Modi, have emphasised the scientific glories of an ancient Hindu civilisation. They argue that plastic surgery, genetic science, aeroplanes and stem cell technology were in vogue in India thousands of years ago. These claims are not just a problem because they are factually inaccurate. Misusing science to stoke a sense of nationalist pride can easily feed into jingoism.Meanwhile, various forms of modern science and their potential benefits have been rejected as unpatriotic. In 2016, a senior Indian government official even went so far as to claim that “doctors prescribing non-Ayurvedic medicines are anti-national”.Attempts to decolonise science need to contest jingoistic claims of cultural superiority, whether they come from European imperial ideologues or the current representatives of post-colonial governments. This is where new trends in the history of science can be helpful.For example, instead of the parochial understanding of science as the work of lone geniuses, we could insist on a more cosmopolitan model. This would recognise how different networks of people have often worked together in scientific projects and the cultural exchanges that helped them – even if those exchanges were unequal and exploitative.But if scientists and historians are serious about “decolonising science” in this way, they need to do much more to present the culturally erse and global origins of science to a wider, non-specialist audience. For example, we need to make sure this decolonised story of the development of science makes its way into schools.Students should also be taught how empires affected the development of science and how scientific knowledge was reinforced, used and sometimes resisted by colonised people. We should encourage budding scientists to question whether science has done enough to dispel modern prejudices based on concepts of race, gender, class and nationality.Schools need to teach the non-Western history of science (Wikipedia Commons)Decolonising science will also involve encouraging Western institutions that hold imperial scientific collections to reflect more on the violent political contexts of war and colonisation in which these items were acquired. An obvious step forward would be to discuss repatriating scientific specimens to former colonies, as botanists working on plants originally from Angola but held primarily in Europe have done. If repatriation isn’t possible, then co-ownership or priority access for academics from post-colonial countries should at least be considered.This is also an opportunity for the broader scientific community to critically reflect on its own profession. Doing so will inspire scientists to think more about the political contexts that have kept their work going and about how changing them could benefit the scientific profession around the world. It should spark conversations between the sciences and other disciplines about their shared colonial past and how to address the issues it creates.Rohan Deb Roy is a lecturer in South Asian history at the University of Reading. theconversationor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Colin Drury delves into the inside story of the battle to save 17,500 trees being felled in a single cityJenny Hockey still shivers when she remembers the moment, almost 18 months ago, she was woken by police hammering at her door. It was 5am. When she looked outside, she momentarily wondered if a terror incident was unfolding.“It was that kind of scene,” the 71-year-old says. “Multiple cars, officers swarming everywhere, flashing lights. We had no idea what was happening.”It was 17 November 2016 and, under the cover of darkness, officers from South Yorkshire Police had descended on Sheffield’s Rustlings Road, one of the city’s most sought-after addresses. Cordoning off the street and banging on doors, they ordered residents to get dressed and move their vehicles or have them towed away. Within the hour, Hockey, a retired sociology professor, would become one of three neighbours arrested and locked up for eight hours.227-year-old tree planted by George Washington pulled down by windBut this dramatic pre-dawn raid – described by Nick Clegg, then the local MP, as like something “you’d expect in Putin’s Russia” – was not carried out in search of terrorists or criminals.Rather, it was in support of council contractors hired to chop down eight street trees, which residents had spent more than a year petitioning to save.Amid the confusion, Hockey and two others – including another woman in her seventies – attempted to stand under one of these century-old limes, only to be detained. All charges were later dropped.“We wanted to protect something we loved,” she says. “And our right to do that – our democratic right – was taken away, really, by state force. It was so horrible and disempowering.”Indeed, by the time the trio were freed, the trees which had always overlooked their homes were no more.Contractors cut down the final tree in Rustlings Road (PA)Yet a bigger battle was just beginning: one which has since spread across the city, seen mass protests and riot police on suburban streets, and ultimately revealed an astonishing secret plan – hidden within a £2.2bn PFI contract – to cut down almost 20,000 street trees…Sheffield has long boasted of being Europe’s greenest city – in part because a third of it sits in the Peak District. But it is also due to the sheer number of trees that line the roads. Some 36,000 of them arch over highways and footpaths.But around 2015, talk of what the Woodland Trust called a “tree massacre” started to emerge.Sheffield’s Labour council had agreed for 17,500 street trees to be axed as part of a highways improvement scheme  (PA)The eight limes in Rustlings Road were not the only ones marked for the chainsaw. Under then-redacted clauses in a £2.2bn contract, Sheffield’s Labour council had agreed for 17,500 street trees to be axed as part of a vast highways improvement scheme being undertaken by the infrastructure giant Amey.Company and council both said – and still say – such felling was necessary. Targeted trees, they argued, were either dying, dangerous or had roots causing irreparable damage to roads and footpaths. Every one taken down, they added, was being substituted with a younger sapling: “We assess every single tree and only replace them as a last resort,” says Darren Butt, account director with Amey, today.Targeted trees, the council argued, were either dying, dangerous or had roots causing damage to roads and footpaths (Sheffield Tree Action Group)Yet, as this felling increased, questions started to be asked. There was shock when two cherries commemorating Second World War heroes disappeared one day. At Christmas, a row decorated with charity festive lights were hacked back – with fellers cutting through wires and all.A feeling spread that perfectly healthy and safe trees were being chopped unnecessarily. A suspicion grew that the policy was actually about increasing Amey’s profit margins. Over the length of the company’s 25-year highway maintenance obligations, so ran the theory, a newly planted sapling is far cheaper to look after than older, larger arboreta.“People were going to work in the morning and coming home to entirely different-looking streets,” says Paul Selby, a city resident and leading member of Sheffield Tree Action Groups, known as Stag. “It was ecological destruction carried out, in secret, by a multinational company with the explicit support of the local authority and the police.“And people were angry. These trees were part of their lives and they didn’t want them taking. These weren’t anarchists or hardline activists from other towns. They’re Sheffielders furious they hadn’t been given a voice in what was happening in their streets. So they came out and fought to be heard.”Almost 6,000 trees have been chopped down. But in the face of overwhelming and increasingly nationalised pressure, a pause on felling was announced last week.Sheffield City Council has put this down to the “dangerous tactics” of protestors. Yet the support in favour of Stag – both within the city and from names including Jeremy Corbyn, Michael Gove, Ken Loach and Jarvis Cocker – probably had something to do with it too.Hopes are now high the whole policy can be reconsidered. “We don’t take anything for granted,” says Selby, a civil servant with the Department for Work and Pensions. “But, after so long fighting, surely dialogue is now the sensible way forward.”Tensions rose, with fellers and protestors accusing each other of intimidation (Sheffield Tree Action Group)Certainly, it has been a troubled road to here: the irony perhaps being that this all started with a real city victory.In 2012 the government handed Sheffield £1.2bn to improve its roads, an economic godsend for a place locals had taken to calling Pothole City. Amey – a subsidiary of the Spanish company Ferrovial – won the work contract, promising to upgrade and maintain every highway, pavement, bridge, subway and street light for 25 years.“This is work that is good for everyone living here,” says Paul Billington, director of culture and environment with the city council. “It is already bringing investment and opportunities back into the city because it is making our infrastructure world-class.”Replacing damaging or dying trees, he argues, is key to that success continuing. Doing it now, he adds, is important because, as a 2007 survey showed, a large majority of trees are so old that to delay action would store problems for future generations.“No one disagrees that dying or damaging trees should be looked at – if they really do fall into those categories,” says Alison Teal, a Green Party councillor in the city. “But this went beyond that. We still didn’t know how many were due to come down but everywhere you looked, these magnificent trees were disappearing.”Demonstrations were civil enough to start with. People at home would spot Amey vans and go out to stand under targeted trees so they couldn’t be axed. Others started taking the bus to work, leaving their cars blocking access to endangered arboreta.Cups of tea were offered while people stood about. They debated the merits of the trees: their beauty, the environmental benefits, the wildlife. Occasionally, they talked about their favourite. An endangered elm in the Nether Edge area ended up being shortlisted for the 2016 England Tree Of The Year Award.Yet things hardened after the Rustlings Road raid (“In hindsight, it was poorly handled,” says Darren Butt). While many still supported the replacement scheme, opinion started to harden in favour of the so-called tree-huggers.

A 57-year-old woman was detained after blowing a pink trumpet, while a retired couple – Dr John and Sue Unwin – found themselves being questioned by CID officers (and later cleared) about the suspected poisoning of a cup of tea they gave a feller.“It sounds like the plot from an Agatha Christie novel,” Dr Unwin told the Daily Mail.One 73-year-old was detained for intimidation. Alan Simpson, a retired firefighter and great-grandfather, says: “I’ve never been in trouble in my life and was there with my wife. I don’t think I could have cut a less intimidating figure if I tried.” His charge, too, has been dropped.“If it wasn’t so serious,” says James Whitworth, cartoonist on local newspaper The Star, “it would be farcical, and I mean that literally: there is enough material here to make an actual farce.“As a cartoonist, it’s a dream because the whole thing is so ridiculous. You think you can’t possibly say anymore on the issue – and then they arrest a woman for blowing a plastic trumpet. But as a city resident: I’m pretty neutral but, really, maybe leave our trees alone?”Local newspaper cartoonist James Whitworth’s take on the Sheffield tree massacre (James Whitworth)As news of the ongoing demonstrations spread, meanwhile, concern grew it was damaging the city’s reputation. When Sheffield was left off The Sunday Times Best Places to Live list this year, authorities blamed the campaigners: “it is regrettable the increasingly extreme actions of a small number of protestors is having this impact,” a council spokesperson declared.Demonstrators themselves were not above ridiculous assertions either: at a packed council meeting, one compared Amey’s workers to Nazi guards, just doing their jobs.Lavender and tea tree oils could be giving boys breasts, study warnsChina reassigns 60,000 troops to plant trees in bid to fight pollutionHow the Japanese fought suicide in the ‘Sea of Trees’For now, however, the potential turning point arguably came in March when a freedom of information request, asked by Paul Selby, forced the council to reveal it had indeed asked for 17,500 trees to be chopped down. The figure was so astonishing all three city MPs – all Labour – called for a rethink.In a disastrous interview on local radio, council cabinet member for environment Bryan Lodge – who declined to be interviewed for this piece – denied the figure was a target but could not explain what it actually was. Days later the suspension of felling was announced.What happens next is the question the city is asking itself.“We’ve already lost 6,000 trees,” says Selby. “Of course, there are some that should come down if they really are dying or doing irreversible damage to footpaths. But all other solutions should be sought first. Trees are a sign of a civilised city. We should be doing everything we can to save them.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

It\u0027s beyond belief,” Ms Bearder said.The app, Home Secretary Amber Rudd pledged would be easy to use, will not function on iPhones because they do not have the capability to read the chip in a biometric passport.The revelation is likely to further lower the opinion of British immigration authorities in the eyes of European politicians and citizens, hot on the heels of damage done by the Windrush immigration scandal and erroneous deportation letters being sent to EU nationals last year.One year to Brexit: What is still needed to complete a deal with the EU?Speaking after the Tuesday meeting Guy Verhofstadt, the European Parliament’s Brexit coordinator who requested the official visit to Brussels by the Home Office, said he would be writing to UK authorities to resolve various “question marks” about the registration process.The European Parliament says any system should be by way of “declaration” rather than application that the UK government would have to process. MEPs also want the system to be free for EU citizens living in the UK, on the basis that they had no part in the Brexit decision.Mr Verhofstadt also added that each family of EU nationals should only have to make one declaration instead of one for each person in it, and that there needed to be special provisions for vulnerable people or those not able to use a digital registration system.Brexit so far: in picturesBrexit so far: in picturesBoris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

A spokesperson for the European Commission’s Brexit negotiating team said the scheme’s application to the UK would be part of discussions on the future relationship, where chief negotiator Michel Barnier has so far been unwilling to cut special deals for Britain.“Today’s agreement is another important step in protecting the EU’s external borders,” said Valentin Radev, the interior minister for Bulgaria, which is currently chairing the European Council. “By knowing who is coming to the EU before they even arrive at the border, we will be better able to stop those who may pose a threat to our citizens.”On Wednesday, ambassadors from the EU countries confirmed an agreement reached on the ETIAS scheme between the presidency of the European Council and the representatives of the European Parliament, who must agree any new EU laws. The European Parliament will now have to vote on the plan, which will also have to be signed off by the European Council.One year to Brexit: What is still needed to complete a deal with the EU?The EU says the new scheme will “improve internal security, prevent illegal immigration, protect public health and reduce delays at the borders by identifying persons who may pose a risk in one of these areas before they arrive at the external borders”. Because it applies to the whole Schengen passportless area and not just the EU, travellers to countries outside the EU such as Norway, Iceland, and Switzerland would also be hit.Data submitted in the online application would be processed against EU police and Interpol databases, with further checks made against anyone who raises flags. Countries that already need visas to travel to Europe will not be covered by the scheme, given that tighter restrictions are already in place on them. Airlines and ferry lines will also have a new responsibility to check whether travellers who need documents have them, with coach operators scheduled to pick up the same rules three years after the scheme’s introduction.Brexit so far: in picturesBrexit so far: in picturesBoris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

It was only when she was going through customs that she realised she was going into labour.Ms Freeman, a computer specialist in the US Air Force, revealed her amazing story in a Twitter thread, which has since been shared thousands of times. I’m literally gripping the railing trying to make it through the lines. At this point I feel like I’m about to pass out. I’m sweating. I feel like I have to vomit. I’m going through it. Then I’m like wait a minute b*tch are you in labor?!!! pic.twitterp6SMEfunP0Determined not to give birth in an airport, Ms Freeman made it to her hotel room and began searching on YouTube for the best way to deliver her baby. Filling a bath with warm water and grabbing two towels – one to bite onto, and one to wrap the baby in – she began pushing once her contractions started happening every minute. My contractions were already at a minute a part lol I was late as hell. I BARELY made it to my room. 😂😂😂 so I throw the towel in my mouth and start pushing. And I have NEVVVVEEERRRR felt any pain like this in my life. I felt like I was being split open. WHERE WAS MY EPIDURAL?! pic.twitterHGlootcNHuAfter five or six pushes, a baby “popped out” and “floated right on up to the top of the water”.Luckily it happened pretty quickly. I only had to push about 5-6x before a baby popped out. Lol now let me tell you babies are buoyant. That little joker said bloop and floated right on up to the top of the water 😂😂 pic.twitterIuqwKXFb2LAfter checking the sex of her newly-born baby, she was forced to search on Google as to how to cut an umbilical cord without any tools beyond a knife.So I didn’t have any clamps like it suggested but what I did have were shoelaces lol. Hear me out 😂. In Turkey everyone drinks teacoffee so every hotel room had an electric kettle. So I just boiled some water to sterilize the laces so that I could use them as clamps. pic.twitter2vObBQz6euUsing sterilised shoelaces as clamps, she managed to cut the cord before exhaustion began to set in. After cleaning up the bathroom, which looked like the set of a horror movie, she breastfed her newborn son and went to sleep. Waking up the next day, she headed to the airport to find out how she would leave the country with a newborn baby. When I get there the airport workers are freaking out bc you can tell this baby is fresh. I legit didn’t have any baby clothes \u0026amp made him something out of my favorite blue oversized button down (RIP 😢). Anyway they thought I was a human trafficker trying to smuggle out a baby. pic.twitterdc0BCDv75JAfter convincing local police and Turkish Airlines staff of her story, local media organisations were tipped off and she became headline news in the country. Is hypnobirthing the secret to Kate Middleton\u0027s \u0027effortless\u0027 births?Duchess of Cambridge gives birth to boyTwin brothers welcome babies on the same dayMs Freeman was eventually taken to the US Consulate in Istanbul, where she applied for a birth certificate and passport for her son, whom she named Xavier Ata Freeman. After being taken to hospital - almost 24 hours since giving birth - she was given the all clear and spent another two weeks in Istanbul, fully paid for by Turkish Airlines.To wrap up I go to the hospital get checked out everything is fine. He’s perfectly healthy! Lol the doctors were shocked to hear my story. I made national news \u0026amp people would stop us to take pictures all the time \u0026amp a random elderly woman grabbed my boob as I was breastfeeding pic.twittergGp4lJvEvlMs Freeman finally flew back to Nashville, her hometown, at the end of March.Here he is Xavier Ata Freeman born March 7, 2018 in Istanbul, Turkey! My little surprise bundle of international joy!Speaking to The Independent, Ms Freeman said her family were left absolutely stunned.No one had a clue, she said. But they were all extremely excited. It’s my parents\u0027 first grandchild and he makes the fifth living generation on my mum’s side.As soon as I flew back they all came to visit, bearing gifts and spoiling Xavier. They found out about four days after I gave birth to him while I was still in Istanbul. So of course they called every single day, wanting to talk to him and see pictures and videos and checking in to make sure we were okay.Looking back on the birth now, Ms Freeman says despite the risks, she probably wouldn\u0027t change a thing. What it’s like to give birth at the Lindo WingThe experience taught me so much. I learned how to be resourceful and calm under pressure. I was able to bond one on one with my son from his first breaths, she said. I’m thankful that everything went well and I was able to deliver a healthy baby, she added. I know everyone isn’t always so fortunate but I appreciate the experience and hopefully he’ll think it’s an amazing story when he’s older!Though Ms Freeman\u0027s birth was a success, the Royal College of Midwives (RCM) strongly discourages women from giving birth alone. “Whilst the RCM recognises that every woman has the right to give birth without professional assistance, there are potential risks for both mother and baby and for that reason the RCM would strongly discourage women from giving birth by themselves and without professional support or skilled medical help, an RCM spokesperson told The Independent.“The RCM also believes that the more we develop maternity services which enable women and midwives to get to know each other and for women to trust their midwife the less likely women are to choose to give birth without a midwife present.”On the huge reaction on social media, Ms Freeman said: I expected my friends to go crazy reading it but I didn’t expect it to get as big as it did. Though I probably should have, seeing as though everyone who knows the story loses their minds.I think all the tweets broke my Twitter.Read Ms Freeman\u0027s amazing story in full below.I still really don’t understand what’s so shocking about my delivery story. Lol maybe it’ll set in one day.Might as well tell you now lol. Give me a little time though because it’s sort of a long story 😂😂So then I’m in denial for another month after that like there’s no way a Bitch is preggo.

I start talking to myself like Bitch what you’re not gonna do is give birth on the airport floor. So you need to get it together \u0026amp make it to your hotel pic.twitterYwjk9fmsaDIt’s weird how focused a person becomes when they’re adrenaline starts going. Because at no point ever did I freak out. Like I just did what I had to do.So the internet said I shouldn’t start pushing until my contractions where 2mins apart. Bc you don’t want to exhaust yourself too early and then not have any energy when the kids ready to come, you know? And I’m like okay bitch you’ve got a timer on your phone. You can do this! pic.twitterQSi7iJ4vAxLuckily it happened pretty quickly. I only had to push about 5-6x before a baby popped out. Lol now let me tell you babies are buoyant.

Now according to the internet you’re not supposed to pull it out bc it has to seal itself back up or something idk lol.Can I just say that walking around with the umbilical cord hanging out of me totally gave me the impression of what it would be like to have a penis. 😂😂😂 pic.twitterDicpn2ljSqAlmost immediately as I sit down it plops out. The hotel had these sanitation baggies in the bathroom so I just picked it up by the cord and dropped it in the bag. Now it’s still attached to him so now I’ve got to google how to cut an umbilical cord. pic.twitterurJHrIu9mNAnd everyone knows that ya girl stays strapped 😎. I don’t go anyyyyyyyywhere without my knives. And because of this I’ll probably never go anywhere without them again. pic.twittervAbCZ6bb1KNow I haven’t been nervous this whole time but cuttingbthis cord is freaking me out lmao like what if I hurt this man?! So I’m poking the cord with the knife to see if it affects him. pic.twittermkmQfKP7S2Umbilical cord cut and I did a mighty fine job if I do say so myself 😌!

It is surely time the party saw sense.\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoI appeal to the wiser heads in the SNP to persuade Nicola Sturgeon to think again.Both Wales and Scotland expressed concern after the 2016 referendum that Westminster would bring EU treaties into British national law without input from devlolved nations on key policies.\u0026nbspInitially Scotland and Wales presented a united front, and the Mr Drakeford\u0026rsquos announcement will come as a significant blow to Ms Sturgeon and her colleagues.Welsh finance minister Mark Drakeford announced the deal yesterdayThe SNP\u0026rsquos Brexit Minister Mike Russell had previously struck a confident tone on the subject, telling a Scottish Parliament committee last year he \u0026ldquocannot envisage a situation in which Scotland would be content and Wales would not be, or vice versa.Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington hailed the Welsh agreement as \u0026ldquosignificant but added that it was \u0026ldquodisappointing the Scottish Government was dragging its heels.UK Prime Minister Theresa May has highlighted on 24 devolved policy areas where she says UK frameworks are needed after Brexit to preserve the integrity of the country\u0026rsquos internal market.For example, she believes having different labelling standards north and south of the border between England and Scotland could increase costs unnecessarily for consumers and businesses alike.Scottish Brexit Minister Mike Russell had been confident Scotland and Wales would stay unitedBoth the Scottish and Welsh regional governments have argued that powers taken back from Brussels which touch on their responsibilities should be returned to themMr Drakeford said the deal meant powers which were currently devolved remain devolved , adding that all powers and policy areas rest in Cardiff, unless specified to be temporarily held by the UK government.He added: These will be areas where we all agree common, UK-wide rules are needed for a functioning UK internal market.\u0026ldquoThis is a deal we can work with which has required compromise on both sides. Our aim throughout these talks has been to protect devolution and make sure laws and policy in areas which are currently devolved remain devolved and this we have achieved.Contrastingly, Mr Russell told MSPs: The effect of the UK government\u0027s latest proposal remains this: the Scottish Parliament\u0027s powers could be restricted without consent.\u0026nbspThis is not something the Scottish Government could recommend the parliament approves.

Technology has evolved, and the regiment with it.But the regiments reputation for hard work and ingenuity endures. And the bond within tank crews, within squadrons and within the regiment remains undiminished.On February 8, 1952, Her Royal Highness Queen Elizabeth II formally proclaimed herself Queen and Head of the Commonwealth and Defender of the Faith.
