It is about a lifetime of experience and broken US foreign policyYesterday was my dad’s 58th birthday. In 1979 he immigrated to the US from Tehran, in large part because of political upheaval seeded by the US in Iran. His only common language with other high schoolers in America was soccer. He once made his way to a pay phone in an auto shop junkyard with fistfuls of change to place a call home, the only kind of contact he’d have with our Tehran family for months at a time.My father lived with a student exchange family in Rochester, Minnesota. He met my mom, a Korean adoptee relocated to Owatonna, Minnesota, at community college. They transferred to the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities, got married and had me.My three earliest political memories are the Minnesota Senator Paul Wellstone dying in a plane crash, the Clinton impeachment proceedings, and the most consequential event for the rest of my life as an Iranian-American teen with a Muslim-sounding name: 11 September 2001.On TV, Dick Cheney and George W Bush talked about “weapons of mass destruction”, “pre-emptive strikes”, and the “axis of evil”. They named Iran, Iraq and North Korea the enemies of the free world. My friends joked that I was two parts Axis of Evil, even though we all knew my mom was from South Korea, not North Korea. In retrospect, these jokes were just a sad way to cope with our anxiety. It felt like the country my family had fled to had declared war on us.The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan ushered in a new era of hell and social dislocation for any black or brown kid with a Muslim-sounding name. My friends and I were profiled, harassed, and interrogated, in and out of school. Our parents were bullied and blamed at work, in public, on the news and in casual conversations with the white parents of their kids’ friends.For many everyday Iranian-Americans, 911 also reactivated an old traumatic fear of being blamed and villainized by Americans for things the Iranian regime did. Many of them dealt with it by receding from politics in fear.Yet a generation of us – their kids – ran headlong into it all instead.I became one of many second-generation Persian kids who took the haze of Islamophobia and latent white nationalism that came to hang over our lives and did something with it. Today, the Iranian-American friends in my peer generation are organizers, activists, artists, policy aides and political candidates. They fight for voting rights, criminal justice reform, climate action, healthcare access, abortion rights and more.We are a voice for the generation before us, who don’t always feel like they can speak but gave everything for their children to have the chance to. We see the fearful messages between our friends and family back home or here every time something happens that could instigate a war. We fight for an American democracy that doesn’t seem to acknowledge us doesn’t seem to even understand itself, let alone our people.Childhood me didn’t know that in my lifetime I’d fight a Muslim travel ban, battle Iranian family separation, watch a historic Iran deal be created that was decades in the making, then be reneged on by the US one administration later. In 2018, I became the first Iranian-American elected official in Minnesota history. As a city councilwoman, most of my work is for my constituency. But my family stories and the fallout of US foreign policy on my life experience is what propelled me and so many others into politics.For so many Iranian-American families, this moment of precipice has us sick and terrified. It isn’t just detached political analysis and smug Twitter takes to us. It is about a lifetime of broken US Iran policy shaping a volatile current we have swum in for decades.We are your teachers, cab drivers, fast food workers, doctors, engineers, hair stylists, journalists, shopkeepers, restaurant owners, artists, anti-war activists, activists and much more. We need you to see us. We need you to see through imperial narratives. Don’t let liars and warmongers justify more violence in our names. Don’t let our oppressors tell you that questioning yet another one of their endless wars is supporting oppression.Without knowing what will happen or plunging into speculation, what I can tell you on a human level is that this is a terribly dangerous moment in our history. We need your solidarity. We need your congressional action, popular action, anything to prevent war with Iran and to hold to the searing light the truth about the path that got us here.Now more than ever we must fight for our democracy with great determination, in spite of a country that doesn’t always seem to want us."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d29c5a4a04399c1a9cfecb811f867769dbafd01/0_233_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ecc22e23ed7d89aa1caa2f5743b5a9fb","title":"keir starmer left win labour leadership members","story":"He needs to convince members that his pragmatism can align with principles on anti-austerity and immigrationKeir Starmer’s early lead among party members in Labour’s leadership election caused more surprise than it should have. The shadow Brexit secretary was already popular among many members for his pro-remain stance and general air of competence the fact he is not obvious electoral anthrax helps to make him seem a safe harbour in the wake of the Tory tsunami that swept Labour away last month.The bulk of Labour members are not hardcore Corbynites: their shorthand designation would be “soft left”. They backed Jeremy Corbyn largely due to the paucity of alternatives willing to oppose austerity in 2015. After a general election in which triangulation under Ed Miliband had been seen to lose a winnable campaign, many felt they may as well stand up for their principles and die on their feet, not their knees.Now the Tories have secured their biggest majority in more than three decades, that judgment has shifted. Not that Starmer hails from the party’s Blairite near-past – he is anti-Brexit and at least broadly anti-austerity. And his chances have benefited from Rebecca Long Bailey’s ill-judged campaign launch, which was laden with vacuous phrases and empty nostalgia. It is early days, of course, but this leadership election may see members opt for what they see as pragmatism over principle.But pragmatism that departs from principle is not a purely paper exercise. It is true that nobody gains anything from a party that’s not in power. But many members will want to be able to trust the new leadership will “do the right thing” on key issues triangulation in opposition surrenders the definition of what is politically and morally acceptable, while in government it has a human cost.This will be tricky ground for both Starmer and Labour to navigate. The left will set Starmer numerous tests to chip away at members’ trust in him – tests of purity or principle, depending on your perspective. Austerity broke the mainstream leadership candidates in 2015 with Harriet Harman’s infamous “Labstention” on Tory benefit cuts. This time, virtually all candidates will agree on the need to end, and to varying degrees reverse, austerity. But will the party debate choosing between broad tax rises or ditching certain spending pledges? And how will Starmer handle questions on the 2019 manifesto’s nationalisation agenda?Then there is the constitutional question. Advocates of constitutional reform unfurl a long list of magic bullets that will supposedly solve Britain’s political malaise – devolution, electoral reform, an elected second chamber and so on. These are, apparently, issues at the forefront of voters’ minds. Should Clive Lewis or Lisa Nandy make it to the members’ ballot, expect them to drive these on to the Labour agenda.But the biggest iding line may prove to be immigration – which, unlike austerity, is not subject to a broad consensus in the Labour party. Assuming the Tories end free movement for EU citizens, should Labour pledge to restore it? Should similar rights then be extended to non-EU migrants? What specifically does it mean to extend free movement, as Labour’s conference policy mandates? It is hard to see open borders as a winning strategy under the current electoral map it is even harder to morally justify restricting economic opportunity (and environmental safety) on the basis of accident of birth.The unenthusiastic attitudes towards immigration among voters outside Labour’s city heartlands, and the sensitivity of the issue among members, makes this a big potential battleground in the leadership campaign. Both Starmer and Long Bailey will seek an as yet unknown way to harmonise the preferences of Labour members and the British public. The party’s socially libertarian left views Nandy’s campaign with suspicion on this issue. Lewis – perhaps the only candidate who’ll be totally at ease discussing free movement – has an interest in ensuring his rivals are pinned down to more specific positions than “progressive patriotism”. It won’t be pretty, but perhaps it’s time Labour worked out its view of immigration and migrants’ rights once and for all.Regardless, recent decades show us that parties rarely lose power without a recession on their watch. If there isn’t one before the next election, the Tories are surely safe if there is, their new voters may feel betrayed.

That’s why I’m standing• Lisa Nandy is Labour MP for WiganWe are out of power and on the rocks. The shattering collapse in trust among lifelong Labour voters has been a long time coming. Now is not the time to steady the ship or try not to oversteer. Unless we change course, we will become irrelevant.This change starts with empowering people to make change themselves. We’ve been a decade out of power in Westminster, changing our leaders, and commissioning reports and focus groups from offices in central London just to hear what is happening in the country. If we were trying to reinforce the sense that we just don’t get it, we couldn’t do better than this.We’ve been running scared of debate, dissent and constructive challenge. The anger and infighting has to end. We are leaving the EU on the hardest of terms. Laws that defend people’s health and their safety at work, the environment and the minimum wage are unlikely to survive a free trade deal with Donald Trump. A century of progress is at stake. In this fight, Green MP Caroline Lucas is not our enemy. We are an internationalist party, and we should make common cause with others here and around the world. We need to stop waiting for a saviour and have the confidence to believe that change comes from ourselves. Ours is a movement that will graft and toil to deliver change together.To do it, we have to become rooted in our communities again. The GMB union’s campaigns on Amazon and Uber, Unison’s resistance to the privatisation of NHS staffing or Unite’s community campaign on universal credit could create the same groundswell for change that brought us the minimum wage – a beacon of hope in similarly dark times. Labour activists support credit unions and law projects in every nation and region of the UK. They need and deserve real power, resources and respect to allow us, by the strength of our common endeavour, to achieve more than we achieve alone.In the decade I spent fighting for the rights of marginalised children before I became an MP, I learned that winning a vote in parliament is never enough. What is needed is the hard yards of winning the argument, inch by inch, in town halls, workplaces and pubs. This is where we fight to regain people’s trust and win permission to deliver radical change.The luxuries of a hung parliament are behind us. If we want a hearing we will have to go out into the country, create waves, and make it happen. The next Labour leader will have to be up for a scrap – willing to run to the places where we are loathed, take the anger on the chin, and make and win the argument.The belief that this country can be better drives me forward. Bring back universal child benefit, end the benefit cap and build a system that gives people dignity, not just an allowance with conditions set by decision-makers in Whitehall. Reclaim our public services so they are run by empowered frontline professionals, not distant experts. Bring investment to places that have lacked so much for so long to deliver good jobs, not charity. Find the courage to tackle the social care crisis – no longer can we abandon people to die in poverty after a lifetime of work.We could run the economy as if the future matters. More than 1,000 fossil-fuelled power stations are being built across the world, many with the support of UK banks. Their backing equals the whole coal-power capacity of the EU and Australia put together. This will raise flood risks in Britain, threatening everything from our pensions to our planet. It is just one symbol of an economy that puts profit before people – with appalling long-term consequences.By the next election we will be trying to win voters who were toddlers when there was last a Labour government. More than stories about how Margaret Thatcher ruined the NHS, they will need evidence of the real change that comes from our grassroots. Born in 1979, I was 17 before I saw a Labour government, and at times it felt that change would never come. I went into politics to change the world, and that flame has never dimmed. Our biggest asset is the people in every community and workplace I have ever been – MPs, councillors, activists, trade unionists and charities who give their all because they see a spark that, if ignited, might just change the world.Amid the shellshock, anger, hurt and frustration, there is hope. This defeat was shattering, and I never want us to be here again. But rebuilding cannot wait. I am standing to be the leader of the Labour party to defeat Boris Johnson and lead a compassionate, radical, dynamic government that I firmly believe most people want and deserve. That leadership will place at its heart an end to the wholesale patronising of working people as a homogeneous group, to be saved or condemned. We can change Britain, but it doesn’t start in five years’ time. It starts now.• Lisa Nandy is the Labour MP for Wigan"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/144c960d818949fef51942aa678abc550215bef2/0_15_3307_1985/master/3307.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6a8b96dce80c9bcdc98e195e39cd2355","title":"anastacia alice deejay guide to albums 20th anniversary celebration","story":"This year ‘classic’ records such as Kid A and Voodoo turn 20, but it’s the forgotten gems that say more about where music’s at nowNext year is set to be pretty packed out when it comes to 20th anniversaries celebrating so-called classic albums. You’re soon going to get really sick of reading overly reverential tributes to Radiohead’s Kid A and D’Angelo’s Voodoo, though, so here’s a reminder of the records from 2000 you thought you’d forgotten, but that say more about 2020 than we could ever have imagined …Oasis: Standing on the Shoulder of GiantsBack in 2011, Noel Gallagher said the band should have never made their fourth album, explaining: “At the time, I had no reason or desire to make music.” But make it they did and it casually set the wheels in motion for Liam’s hugely successful solo career two decades later, thanks to Gallagher Jr’s first writing credit on the wafty Little James. Funnily enough, Liam didn’t do the song at his recent arena tour, but he did give the album’s Noel-penned Gas Panic! a whirl. Noel must be absolutely livid.Robbie Williams: Sing When You’re WinningHere, Robbie Williams assumed his final form as a consummate, wild-eyed showman. He quit trying to be a knockoff Britpop lad and instead embraced end-of-the-pier charm, chucking in some Ian Dury swagger on Rock DJ and an attempt to rut Kylie on Kids. The former boyband tearaway was now – and still is – the nation’s somewhat unhinged sweetheart.Anastacia: Not That KindThe influence of Anastacia can be most strongly felt in 2020’s look. It’s now pretty much impossible to buy a pair of sunglasses that haven’t been inspired by the severe Matrix-style specs the singer sported on the cover of 2000’s Not That Kind. Brilliantly, Anastacia actually had laser eye surgery in 2005, but continues to wear glasses because otherwise nobody knows who the hell she is.Limp Bizkit: Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored WaterIt is strange to think of how big Limp Bizkit actually were in the early 2000s. They headlined festivals and people willingly watched them play. Fred Durst dated Paris Hilton. They invented the dreadful genre “sports metal”, now being revived by the likes of Poppy and Rina Sawayama. And this album, with a title that referenced both bumholes and urine (they said it couldn’t be done!) became the fastest-selling rock album ever in the US. Proof that people cannot be trusted."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e03a2aab2bfd4aaafc5dc7e3701f368fa82e0723/0_0_2392_1435/master/2392.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e5f097a3dc30aee41dfb531f07a98cb4","title":"greta thunberg sharon twitter celebrity mastermind","story":"Actor Amanda Henderson answered ‘Sharon’ to Thunberg-related question on Celebrity Mastermind – and the teen activist loved itGreta Thunberg has been mocked and called many names since becoming the world’s most famous climate activist.But amid all the bile and rage from her opponents, there’s one name she has likely never been called: Sharon. Until now.On Thursday’s episode of the BBC quiz show Celebrity Mastermind, the host John Humphrys asked actor Amanda Henderson a question that would soon go viral.“The 2019 book entitled No One is Too Small To Make A Difference is a collection of speeches made by a Swedish climate change activist.

In October, Strictly Come Dancing’s Johannes Radebe memorably wore stiletto heels for a choreographed tribute to New York’s Ballroom scene, with Twitter users praising him for “shutting down toxic masculinity across the UK in 2 minutes”.And earlier last year, the singer Sam Smith posted a photo of a heeled boot with the caption: “Tonight I wore heels for the first time to an award show … There was a time when I thought I’d never ever ever be able to be myself like this in front of the industry or anyone.”The fashion designer Marc Jacobs has spent much of this year posting selfies in massive heeled boots too. “I think there is something incredibly refreshing about a male designer such as Marc Jacobs embracing wearing high heels,” said Andrew Groves, a professor of fashion design at the University of Westminster. “High heels have become a potent symbol of both power and status, and paradoxically both dominance and submission.” Indeed the stiletto heel on a man is still an image that provokes outrage earlier this month a nude portrait of the Mexican revolutionary Emiliano Zapata wearing nothing but heels and a pink sombrero caused outrage in Mexico, with a spokesperson for protesters calling it “disgusting”.The gender-blurring 70s are a significant reference point for designers this season, “particularly in the way that masculinity was performed as something which could be both outlandish, decorative and still highly potent”, said Ellen Sampson, the author of the forthcoming book Worn: Footwear, Attachment and Affects of Wear. “The 1970s saw a 1930s40s revival which spurred interest in 1940s shoe shapes, particularly Ferragamo-style platforms, which recently inspired the Gucci platform” .Paradoxically, this year also exposed women’s complicated relationship to the heel. Female workers in Japan battled against an edict of the compulsory wearing of heels at work and in August Women’s Wear Daily published a piece asking “have sneakers made stilettos irrelevant?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9beef9750022d2773fcb52132064c51ae3d088d1/0_23_2700_1621/master/2700.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b34f73dd1ed137f94488359fd4534212","title":"little women female narratives undervalued","story":"Little Women capped a year in which female-driven and directed movies topped the box office, and yet awards still almost never go to films about womenThere’s a scene toward the end of Greta Gerwig’s adaptation of Little Women, a starry-eyed update of Louisa May Alcott’s 19th-century novels, in which headstrong Jo (Saoirse Ronan), the character Alcott modeled on herself, anticipates decades of female creative doubt. A writer struggling to produce the popular, contrived sentimental stories of her day and slogging even harder to figure out what she wants to write, Jo doubts the ability of her own life experience to be compelling, asking her sisters: “Who will be interested in a story of domestic struggles and joys? It doesn’t have any real importance.” To which Amy (Florence Pugh), the youngest, responds: “Maybe we don’t see these things as important because no one writes about them.” Writing things, she says, “is what makes them important.”There are numerous moments in Gerwig’s Little Women that feel as though they’re speaking directly to a young girl’s ambition before, as Amy says, the world is hard on it, but this is, for me, the most poignant one, with a point that I have had to learn over and over: your stories aren’t seen as unimportant because they’re just your life they only seem unimportant because of years of shunting off women’s stories as a side genre, or of diminishing personal stories as vain, or of not seeing those stories at all. That Jo needed such validation both as Alcott’s avatar in the 1860s and as a prismatic onscreen presence in 2019 feels indicative of a familiar rut that, despite a slate of trailblazing, complex and straight-up enjoyable female-driven films and TV this year, we still seem stuck in: the internal doubt that your story is interesting, or the larger one that no one will take it seriously.Gerwig sent up that doubt to devastatingly beautiful effect in Lady Bird, a film that felt genuinely revelatory to me at the time, I didn’t realize that the story of a suburban-ish high school girl in the 2000s with a personal relationship to the song Crash Into Me (by Dave Matthews Band) could be movie-worthy, let alone “good” cinema. In Little Women, Gerwig applies that rare confidence to well-mined and beloved source material, infusing the March sisters – Meg (Emma Watson), Jo (Ronan), Beth (Eliza Scanlen) and Amy (Pugh) – with a recognizably 21st century candor on the limitations, crossroads and ambitions of 19th century womanhood (in white, genteel poverty New England). Jo is particularly strident she chafes at marriage, moves to New York City by herself to make it as a writer, negotiates her own contracts – all while tipping into doubt of her own ability to make it, to speak as herself publicly.The “Little Man” problem explains, in part, why we’re seeing this weird discrepancy now, this dissonance, in which female-driven, directed and starring features and television are gaining increasing visibility and cultural clout – as in many public circles, the promotion of feminism and female perspectives is heralded as an indisputably good thing – yet still this change is not reflected in the most prominent arbiters of cinematic “taste”. There are no women nominated for best director at the Golden Globes this year, despite a plethora of options (Scafaria, Gerwig, Wang, Heller). There have only been five women ever nominated for a best director Oscar, Gerwig among them for Lady Bird, and just one winner: Kathryn Bigelow in 2010 for The Hurt Locker. It’s not just behind the camera a survey of the past 40 years in Oscar prizes uncovers a dismal lack of female-driven storytelling. The closest one gets to a female-led narrative for best picture is Terms of Endearment in 1983, Jodie Foster’s lead role in The Silence of the Lambs in 1991, or Chicago in 2002. This year’s Oscar conversation is mostly circling Quentin Tarantino’s Once Upon A Time in Hollywood and Martin Scorsese’s The Irishman – solidly made films in which women are an afterthought to the story, at best.The point is not that awards are the arbiter of progress, or that they should be determined based on representation. But they do confer importance, even if that importance is sometimes misplaced or clearly and self-reinforcingly lopsided. It’s trite to say that awards are irrelevant to the quality of the movies they’re as relevant as we or, really, the financiers of movies make them. But they do hold a mold of what is considered good, serious, “important” cinema, which still says: men’s stories are the primary stories, the default setting, the norm. Everything else is a deviation. And that tucks in another assumption: female audiences will of course watch a movie outside of their perspective, but don’t expect it to go the other way."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ae69423d05c00dcc12c588b0c6f04fab355dcc10/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c89e40f9b435edf209dadc834a660898","title":"veganuary recipes meera sodhas weekly meal plan part 2","story":"Trying to eat meat-free and plant-based? Our vegan cook has breakfast, lunch, dinner and snack tips to tempt your appetiteWelcome back! When I’ve done Veganuary before, it wasn’t the lamb steak I missed, the hunk of cheddar or a fried egg, but what the Japanese call “kokumi”, which loosely translates to a sense of richness, thickness or mouthfeel – something easy to find in the world of animal products.The booming vegan food industry understands this, which is why there are lots of heavily processed products on the shelves, attempting to recreate it in many forms. But over time I’ve learned there are lots of plant-based ingredients you can get this richness from – if you know where to look. For example, by using ingredients such as tahini, mushrooms, cashews, beans, tofu and miso wisely. So, in this week’s meal plan, I have tried to give you recipes that are quick and easy, but that will also satisfy all your kokumi needs.Don’t get me wrong, there’s some really impressive innovation and “substitutes” out there. Sacla produces a good plant-based mayonnaise, Violife’s cream cheese alternative is reasonable and I like Coyo’s yoghurt in small doses. However, many products still fall short and have a long way to go in terms of flavour.As with last week, the key to success lies in planning and shopping in advance (here’s that link to the blank meal plan again) and also having a few failsafes in the fridge for when life gets in the way of cooking. If you’re starting to wonder about nutrition, then read this article – but in short, pop some vitamin B12 in your basket this week.How about things on toast this week? Channel the French and buy really good bread and top with peanut butter and jam or mashed banana with maple syrup and cinnamon. For savoury toppings, there’s Marmite, or these delicious-looking mushrooms al ajillo from Barrafina’s Angel Zapata Martin. Yes, there’s always avocado, but its popularity has caused its own issues.Weekend breakfasts demand a slower pace and Izy Hossack’s multigrain pancakes are just the ticket.Ottolenghi can do simple! His giant couscous with golden raisins, lemon and almonds looks sprightly and perfectly portable for packed lunches. I love the idea of making a batch of his grilled and marinated sandwich vegetables at the weekend and using them throughout the week on ciabatta or stirred into wild rice.The start of the week is for good intentions, so I suggest making Matthew Fort’s Greek gigantes, butterbeans “served basking in a rich, rollicking tomato sauce”. Matthew might not agree, but I think you could sub his dried beans for two tins of butterbeans and add them with the tomatoes to speed this dish up. I’m going to eat them with a dollop of Sacla vegan pesto, flatbread and a pile of wilted chard dressed with salt, lemon and olive oil.Tuesday night calls for something good and quick, and these stir-fried noodles with cabbage, sesame and peanuts fit the bill.Midweek is a time to whip out something fun, so I’m suggesting my rather filthy-tasting sprout nasi goreng – and I’m going to cook extra jasmine rice just so I can make Thomasina Miers’ sticky mushrooms the day after and feel triumphant when dinner is on the table in just a few minutes.Friday night is curry night, and Will Bowlby’s aubergine and coconut curry has my vote.I’m dedicating my weekend to the perfect Felicity Cloake. Her bean burger looks delicious, and while the burgers are firming and chilling in the fridge, I might just stick her tomato sauce on the hob to blip away. (Top with Violife parmesan, or fried salted breadcrumbs, if need be). I’ll keep some out and freeze the rest for next week.Need something sweet? Make Tamal Ray’s grapefruit Turkish delight (using oil instead of butter for greasing) or Sue Quinn’s olive oil and orange cake.You got this! See you next week.

The Spaniard may well rest regulars against a Blackburn side for whom Lewis Holtby and Ryan Nyambe face late fitness tests. This game, like the other 31 ties, will kick off a minute late as part of a mental health awareness campaign. Alex HessTwo mid-table sides a ision apart meet at Ashton Gate, but this might not be the home banker it looks on paper. City have lost three of their last four home games as their promotion charge has faltered, while Shrewsbury won at Stoke last year before running Wolves close in the fourth round. One player who will be watching with interest is Bristol City goalkeeper Max O’Leary, who has impressed on loan in Shropshire but will not feature on Saturday ahead of a possible recall. Niall McVeighPeterborough think they will be facing a shadow Burnley side when they turn up for an early kick-off at Turf Moor, and they might be right. The FA Cup has come at an awkward time for the Clarets, who have lost six of their last eight league games, are only four points above the relegation zone and face Chelsea, Leicester, Manchester United and Arsenal when the Premier League resumes. Sean Dyche will still try to pick a side capable of winning the tie against League One’s top scorers, but anything could happen. VAR will be in use here, as it will be at all ties hosted by Premier League teams. Paul WilsonLast season these clubs showcased the varying effects a cup run can have on league form. Millwall became embroiled in a relegation fight despite coming within a penalty shootout of the semi-finals, while Newport’s unlikely march to the fifth round began a run that very nearly ended in promotion. The visitors could do with something similar this year, with their last league win having come in October. Millwall, meanwhile, are in with a chance of top-flight football for the first time in three decades – so expect Gary Rowett to shuffle his pack here. Alex HessNewcastle’s appalling cup record during the Mike Ashley era – six FA Cup ties won in 12 years of his ownership – dictates that struggling League One Rochdale kick off with the better recent record in this competition. Steve Bruce has pledged to “take the FA Cup seriously” but Newcastle’s manager travels to Spotland without eight injured first-team regulars as his squad nurses a rash of soft tissue damage. The one bright spot for Bruce is that Matt Ritchie, sidelined by ankle trouble since August, could be fit enough to make the bench. Louise TaylorPaul Warne’s side are second in League One but cannot be accused of taking the FA Cup lightly, rallying from 3-0 down to beat non-league Solihull Moors 4-3 in the last round. Their reward is a Yorkshire derby where they may fancy their chances, despite Hull’s own recent resurgence in the Championship. Freddie Ladapo is the Millers’ danger man with 12 goals in all competitions this season, while Hull manager Grant McCann may opt to keep star man Jarrod Bowen out of the spotlight with the transfer window now open. Niall McVeighThese two sides are at opposite ends of the Championship table, with Brentford chasing a first promotion to the top flight for 85 years, and Michael O’Neill’s Stoke desperate to avoid slipping into the third tier. The league is the clear priority for both sides, but free-scoring Brentford forward Ollie Watkins insists that “a Cup run will be nice. People will definitely fear us if they get drawn against us.” Niall McVeighWith Brighton neither in serious jeopardy nor having much hope of Europe, the FA Cup would seem the most obvious place for Graham Potter to focus his resources in his increasingly impressive inaugural season. Alireza Jahanbakhsh should keep his place after two goals in two games. If Glenn Murray is handed a rare start it may prove to be his farewell, with Potter having hinted at a January departure. For the Owls, top scorer Steven Fletcher is back in contention after illness, while midfield pair Liam Palmer and Massimo Luongo could also return. Alex HessBoth sides go into this tie on the back of hammerings, Cardiff losing 6-1 at QPR and Carlisle 4-1 at Crewe. Cardiff manager Neil Harris is demanding a reaction from his players, saying: “what I can promise the fan base, it won’t happen again under me. Wednesday’s blip aside, Harris has improved Cardiff since replacing Neil Warnock in November. His side are strong favourites against a Carlisle team who are fourth from bottom of League Two and also led by a new manager in Chris Beech. Tom DaviesAston Villa lost their first-choice goalkeeper and centre-forward in the victory over Burnley, so will be keen to avoid more injury woe as they battle to stay in the Premier League. Villa could pick fourth-choice goalkeeper Lovre Kalinic ahead of Ørjan Nyland, with Jed Steer joining Tom Heaton on the treatment table. Dean Smith looks set to continue with the back three which worked well at Turf Moor, while Fulham’s own injury list means the promotion-chasers cannot carry out too much rotation as they seek a morale-boosting FA Cup scalp. Will UnwinHartlepool have had little to cheer in the past few years – sliding out of the Football League in 2017 and toiling in the bottom half of the National League ever since – so an FA Cup day out might come as some respite. Oxford are having an excellent season though: firmly in the promotion race, they also reached the quarter-finals of the Carabao Cup. Pools travel to the Kassam Stadium on the back of a poor Christmas in which they took only one point from three games. Their manager, Dave Challinor, has an aptitude for the big occasion, however, having taken Fylde to a Wembley triumph in last year’s FA Trophy. Tom DaviesAlex Neil will relish the arrival of his former club and the chance for a break from a disappointing league run. Fringe players, such as midfield summer signing Tom Bayliss, will be given their chance to impress as Neil seeks a return to form at Deepdale after the home defeat to Middlesbrough. Daniel Farke has said Norwich need a “miracle” to stay in the Premier League but is still expected to make wholesale changes here. Tony PaleySimon Grayson’s Tangerines strap in for the 476-mile round trip to Berkshire where underwhelming form and tough opposition conspire against their hopes of making the fourth round for the first time in three years. The 1953 Cup winners are winless in their past five League One matches, while four straight wins have seen Mark Bowen’s hosts surge clear of the Championship relegation battle. Semi-finalists five years ago, Reading lack a forward to match Blackpool’s 14-goal finisher Armand Gnanduillet, but have conceded just once in their past five games. Stuart GoodwinRalph Hasenhüttl has dug his team out of relegation trouble, winning 10 points out of the last 12, but the Southampton manager insists the FA Cup is no distraction. “We want to take this challenge very seriously. Last season we lost in the third round and we want to do better”. The hosts should be confident of doing so against Danny Cowley’s inconsistent side, who have relegation worries of their own. Hasenhüttl looks set to hand Che Adams a rare start after ruling out a January loan for the misfiring forward. Niall McVeighNigel Pearson will surely rotate his team after a hectic Christmas schedule where Watford picked up three wins and a draw, which may mean a debut for new Brazilian attacking recruit João Pedro. Premier League survival is unquestionably Pearson’s priority, but keeping that winning run going should be achievable even for a second-string side against League One strugglers Tranmere. One man the hosts must watch carefully is Morgan Ferrier the former Watford youth player has four goals in the Cup this season. Niall McVeighTwo teams bereft of form collide, with both perhaps wishing they had the weekend off instead. Saturday’s meeting does offer both sides the chance to end terrible runs, with the hosts winless at home since 2 November and Luton without an away win since September. Eddie Howe is likely to rest key players with Bournemouth in the Premier League relegation zone. Graeme Jones’ side, and top scorer James Collins in particular, may fancy their chances of an upset when the team sheets are published. Stuart GoodwinPortsmouth are two-time FA Cup winners, while Fleetwood have never reached the fourth round. Despite that, Joey Barton’s side will start as favourites against their League One play-off rivals, after just one defeat in their last 11 matches across all competitions. Pompey fans could be forgiven for forgoing the 600-mile round trip to the Lancashire coast for a teatime kick-off – although on their last visit to Highbury, they recorded a 5-2 win. Niall McVeighWriting off a cup competition would contradict the winning culture that Brendan Rodgers is trying to foster at Leicester, so he will deploy a line-up that is expected to dispose of Championship strugglers Wigan. Fringe players such as defender Filip Benkovic are likely to be given rare opportunities to impress, against a side who won at Birmingham on New Year’s Day to end a 13-match winless streak, but will have a job on their hands to progress here. Paul DoyleThe holders’ defence begins against a Port Vale side who are 10th in League Two and whose striker, Tom Pope, tweeted in summer he’d “love” to face John Stones along with other, more colourful comments about Manchester City’s centre-back. Vale’s captain may get his chance to take on Stones, but it would rank among the competition’s all-time shocks should his team somehow win here – they are available at 45-1 to do so. Jamie JacksonWolves dumped United out at the quarter-final stage last season and will be confident of doing the same again. Ole Gunnar Solskjær had to send home Jesse Lingard and Anthony Martial on Friday due to illness, leaving him light of options in the final third. Nuno Espírito Santo has his own striking problems with Diogo Jota ruled out, and Patrick Cutrone set to feature. Injuries aside, both sides will make changes ahead of their involvement in the Europa League knockout stages. Will UnwinThis should be a lively battle between two promotion-chasing League One sides in contrasting form. Rovers, who haven’t been past the third round since their memorable run to the quarter-finals in 2007-08, come into the game having picked up two points and scored one goal in four matches. Coventry have won three on the bounce, with striker Matt Godden having scored back-to-back hat-tricks. John AshdownThe Cobblers have been past the third round just once in 30 years (in 2003-04) but they still have a better record than Burton, who have reached the fourth round only once in their entire history. Albion have every chance here though – they have lost once at home in the league since August, while Northampton’s League Two promotion push has been hampered by their indifferent away form. John AshdownWith East Street Investments completing their takeover of Charlton this week, there is finally some positivity at The Valley – although Thursday’s defeat at Swansea was a reminder that Championship survival remains the priority this season. The Addicks manager, Lee Bowyer, says he will not make wholesale changes for the match against another team whose focus may be elsewhere. West Brom are currently second in the table and on course for a return to the Premier League under Slaven Bilic. Will UnwinA bug has swept through Chelsea before Sunday’s game, and even Frank Lampard has been struck down – the manager left the pre-match media duties to his assistant, Jody Morris. Lampard should be on the touchline on Sunday afternoon and he will want to see a ruthless performance from his inconsistent team, who have lost their last three home games in the league. Forest, fourth in the Championship, will hope to see heavy rotation from Chelsea as they bid to avoid a second straight third-round exit at the Bridge. Jacob SteinbergThis is a League Two v Championship cup tie that could well be a League One fixture next season. It could also prove an awkward assignment for second-tier Barnsley, who have at least given themselves a shot at survival after a recent upturn in form. Crewe, meanwhile, have every chance of promotion out of League Two and have lost at home only once since September. John AshdownWayne Rooney pays a visit to his former England manager, Roy Hodgson, having given pointers – and plenty of actual pointing – towards his new midfield role in Thursday’s win over Barnsley. The Derby player-coach’s display raised questions over his ability to play twice in four days, but the rare chance to be a giant killer may prove hard to resist. Hodgson says Connor Wickham will feature, buoyed by his first league goal in more than three years, but several regulars will be rested. A third run to Wembley after defeats in 1990 and 2016 does not seem high on Hodgson’s to-do list. Stuart GoodwinJonathan Woodgate, the Boro manager and former Spurs centre-half, had plenty of disagreements with José Mourinho’s good friend, Aitor Karanka, during his tenure at the Riverside, so the body language between the two technical areas could prove interesting. Boro enjoyed four straight wins and three clean sheets over the festive period, and will aim to darken the mood Mourinho left St Mary’s in after the New Year’s Day loss to Southampton. Louise TaylorWednesday’s 6-1 victory over Cardiff will give QPR a confidence boost as they take on a team nine places above them in the Championship table. Mark Warburton’s side may need it. They have a bleak recent record in the competition, with last season’s run to the fifth round their first since 1997. The Swans ran eventual winners Manchester City very close in the quarter-finals last season, but Steve Cooper and his young squad will not be looking so far ahead this term, with ambitions of a top-six finish. Will UnwinThis is the first time the semi-professionals of Fylde, currently embroiled in a National League relegation skirmish, have played a Premier League side. Yet with Chris Wilder having pledged to make “11 changes” in order to rest players fatigued by the Christmas schedule, a repeat of the embarrassing home defeat to Barnet last term is not out of the question. One lesser-spotted player expected to be on view for the home side is midfielder Jack Rodwell, who has agreed a short term contract with United. Louise TaylorWith Jürgen Klopp looking to sustain momentum and Carlo Ancelotti trying to generate it, both managers kept rotation to a minimum during the festive programme. This fixture will probably be where the changes come, with new signing Takumi Minamino likely to be among the “fresh legs” promised by Klopp. Dominic Calvert-Lewin, who started all nine of his side’s games in December, may get a rest with Moise Kean stepping in. Everton’s last win at Anfield came in September 1999 – five months before the Italian forward was born. Alex HessWest Ham have made a perfect start to the second coming of David Moyes, thrashing Bournemouth on New Year’s Day, and they will be keen to keep spirits high here. Moyes could do with a good FA Cup run, after Manuel Pellegrini suffered a couple of memorable humiliations against lower league opponents. The Hammers were dumped out of the competition by Wimbledon last year, and thumped 4-0 by Oxford in the Carabao Cup earlier this season. Jacob SteinbergMikel Arteta knows first-hand the joys of being an FA Cup winner with Arsenal and is hoping to repeat the trick from the dugout. “We have to be challenging for the cups,” he said this week, and he hopes to field a strong side against Leeds in an attempt to perpetuate the good feeling around the club. There is only limited scope for rotation given a lengthy injury list, although Dani Ceballos could return. Whatever side Arteta puts out, Marcelo Bielsa’s Championship leaders will fancy their chances of springing a surprise.

Even so, it’s possible to make out the phrase: “Your community is rich: Let’s have a fair share.”Several miles farther on, past endless rows of carefully cultivated palm trees, it’s a slogan that bears little relation to reality. Gbenee Town is a small huddle of huts surrounded by a plantation more than six times the size of London’s Richmond Park.The townspeople say that the benefits of the plantation’s expansion have passed them by and they have been duped by a government that took the land they were living off and gave it to foreign investors.“The level we’re living here is very deplorable,” says G Hilary Gbah, one of the town’s elders. “We are starving to death.”Gbah, 54, remembers the arrival in 2012 of Equatorial Palm Oil, the London-headquartered company that owns the plantation. “We embraced the company because we wanted development,” he says, remembering the promises of schools and clinics if local people gave up land.“We were expecting education for our children, employment, healthcare.”He still has a dog-eared list distributed by Liberia’s government. It promised huge rewards if farmers agreed to the clearance of their land, at fixed amounts per plant for crops such as rubber and cassava. “They came and encouraged us … that if we gave them the land then they were going to develop it, all the crops that we had on the land they were going to pay good prices.” People talk of receiving $100 or less for the clearance of crops that could have sustained them for life. The clinics and schools never materialised. One local expert on community compensation, who asked not to be named, said the prices – promised by the government rather than the company – were always wildly unrealistic.But those in nearby communities such as Blayah Town say they had no reason to doubt what they had been told. “They only fooled us and took our land,” says Gbah.Now farmers who once grew their own crops rely on charity or the offer of work from friends in neighbouring towns.The palm oil industry, meanwhile, is thriving. Oil milled from palm fruit is something of a miracle product that has become indispensable to billions of consumers around the world, spawning $60bn industry that continues to grow. Palm oil is found in everything from chocolate to bread, cereal and shampoo. It keeps crisps crispy and stops ice-cream from melting. There is a global process designed to promote ethics in the industry – the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) – but it has limited power to effect change.Around the world palm oil continues to play a significant role in deforestation, threatening wildlife and fuelling the climate crisis. In rural Liberia, one of the world’s poorest countries, the immediate concern is the impact that the industry’s appetite for land is having on the people who live here.For many people in Gbenee and nearby towns, land is the only thing of value that they have. Those who have given up their land, even after compensation offers were drastically reduced, say they did so for one reason alone: fear.In communities from Blayah Town to Qwarkpojlian and Paye Town, elders and women’s representatives recount a similar story.When EPO arrived in 2012 to survey the land it had been awarded by the government, local people concerned that they had not been consulted gathered to protest. The company’s representatives were accompanied by an armed police unit, a terrifying sight in a country still recovering from civil wars that left hundreds of thousands dead.“Since the war finished in Liberia, that was the first day to see arms,” said Garamondeh Banwun. “We were afraid.” Banwun, like many people here, reports beatings handed out by police, some of whom – it is claimed – rode in EPO vehicles.The company is keen to expand further in Grand Bassa but communities that were once open to development no longer trust the process to improve their lives. The alleged role of Liberia’s underesourced state in this dynamic is crucial.But the companies involved are struggling to develop in a way that benefits those whose ancestral land has been sold from beneath them.Historically, few of these communities have been included in the proper consultation process that advocacy groups refer to as free, prior and informed consent (FPIC). James Otto represents the Sustainable Development Institute (SDI), a non-governmental organisation based in Liberia’s capital Monrovia with strong ties to palm oil communities.“Companies continue to knowingly rob communities of their land and forest resources to their disadvantage – posing serious threats to their livelihoods and living spaces,” says Otto.SDI wants communities to be properly consulted over the benefits they will receive – such as schools, clinics and employment – and is calling for signed memorandums of understanding. “Consistent failure of oil palm companies including EPO to fulfil their social and environmental commitments continues to weaken the trust of communities and has dented the opportunities of communities for development,” he says.“Financiers of oil palm companies should ensure that the companies are in compliance with FPIC, respect labour rights and environmental standards.”EPO, however, is not certified by the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil. SDI and the communities in Grand Bassa are not inherently opposed to the palm industry, which has the power to create jobs and help develop infrastructure. And there has been at least some progress in ensuring that communities have more robust powers to protect themselves.The Land Rights Act, which was passed last year, is key to that effort. It gives communities ownership of ancestral lands, allowing them to make demands of firms that want to exploit it. But it does not apply retroactively and, in a country with limited state presence, there are lingering doubts about whether it leads to the desired outcomes.In some cases, the new law is having unintended consequences. A hundred miles south-east of Grand Bassa, down a mud-bath of a road lined with the rusting hulks of broken-down cars and trucks – lies the town of Shampee in Sinoe County. Here, EPO did bring benefits: employment and much-needed schools and clinics, staffed by teachers and nurses paid by the company.But a protracted land dispute between neighbouring communities has deterred the company from further investment. Earlier this year it announced plans to pull out.Like many of the staff in the clinic and school, midwife Caroline Weah was a contractor. She has worked in the company’s clinic for six years but has limited redundancy rights. What’s more, she says the company began slowing supplies to the clinic months ago.“They usually gave us drugs every quarter,” she says. “From July we don’t have medicine so the patient load starts going down. Right now, no medicine. Somebody come, If I assess what they need, I don’t have it. I give them prescription and they’re not able to afford to buy.”“What will become of the pregnant women and the children?”EPO’s departure appears to have hit Shampee as hard as its arrival in Gbenee.Such cases have convinced SDI that Liberia would be better off with smaller community-run plantations that could supply multinational firms’ thirst for palm oil and put the wealth into the community. This model, says Otto, is the “only hope for prosperity and development that recognises rights and protects the environment”.Traidcraft Exchange, a UK-based campaign group, wants to see pressure applied through legal safeguards in markets such as the UK where demand for palm oil is created. “Things would have been very different if EPO had been required to consider the impact of these big land deals on local people,” said senior policy adviser Tom Wills. “That’s why Traidcraft Exchange and others are calling for new legislation that would make UK companies assess what risks they pose to human rights, and hold them to account in the courts for any abuses.”Equatorial Palm Oil is listed on London’s Alternative Investment Market (Aim). Its ultimate majority owner is Malaysian firm Kuala Lumpur Kepong Berhad.EPO declined to comment on the record. However, the company indicated that allegations about its role in violence by state police dated from some time ago. It also said it had been working hard to build consensus with local communities and indicated that the Liberian government had agreed to assume responsibility for the clinic in Shampee."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ed6c624afe0788b191c0d67d3f4bff59d2986352/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2e732aa4f89964b733169ceac3f3c57a","title":"before meeting my girlfriend i saw escorts how do i get over my past","story":"It’s worth exploring why you paid for sex, says Annalisa BarbieriI’m a 31-year-old man in a committed relationship of two years. I had a rather strained and difficult childhood, and experienced a lot of problems with anxiety and depression. When I grew up, I had few female friends, and a lot of difficulty with dating. I never really had a serious relationship until now.As a result, I (regrettably) sought the services of escorts. I have a well-paid job, so for a couple of years it was never difficult to arrange no-strings encounters with attractive women. In the midst of this, I was able to start dating, and built up the social skills and self-confidence to meet women on my own. Before asking out my current girlfriend, whom I met at work, I stopped seeing escorts.We have a very loving relationship, and I haven’t told her about these prior encounters – and don’t intend to. I have never been unfaithful to her, and never intend to be. Where I have trouble is in adjusting from being with escorts to being with a girlfriend. Although we have fulfilling sex, I find myself frequently daydreaming and reliving the encounters I had with these women. At times I am tempted to seek out their services again, even though I know I could never live with being unfaithful. The thought of this makes me feel guilty and sad about my past, and about my ability to bond with my girlfriend sexually. I need to somehow get over my history in order to be more satisfied with my current relationship, but find myself stuck.There were some contradictions in your letter. You’re very happy in your relationship, but you’re not satisfied. I think there are a few issues going on. In one way, what you’re describing is pretty universal: you have fantasies (in your case, sex with escorts) that don’t sit easily with a committed relationship. Lots of fantasies stay as just that, but you know that yours are achievable: you have crossed that boundary and made them real.I consulted Dr Stephen Blumenthal, a clinical psychologist and psychoanalyst who specialises in helping people with psychosexual difficulties. (I want to make it clear that neither Blumenthal, nor I, are justifying or condoning sex work, but instead coming at this as neutrally as possible in order to help you.)We talked, at length, about why people pay for sex, and how this differs from, say, picking up a stranger for a one-night stand. The handing over of money is important, because it makes the person paying feel in control, not just of the sex, but of the emotional side. It is controlled and fake intimacy, and it may stop the person feeling overwhelmed by another’s feelings. In your letter you also mention your well-paid job. This is important, too. Simply put: money equates to freedom, independence and autonomy. There is probably something far in your past that means this has become important. To you, independence and detachment means safety.Blumenthal thought your hint at a difficult childhood was interesting “especially the link between your recent past (the money and escorts), and the distant past (the anxiety and depression)”. He went on to explain that seeing escorts enabled you to overcome your difficult past, and learn to form a relationship and have sex with a woman whom you didn’t pay.In your case, what is being reactivated is the part of your past that you are running away from, and for which the escorts were a coping mechanism. But this time, escorts cannot be the answer, because you risk losing your relationship.How you get “unstuck” is by understanding more about what those childhood difficulties were, and what caused these anxieties. You’ve realised on some level that your past coping mechanisms don’t work in your current situation, so you have to find new ones. I think some really focused therapy would pay idends for your future now.• Send your problem to annalisa.barbieri@mac.

But does minimalism really make us any happier? By  Kyle ChaykaSonrisa Andersen’s childhood home was a mess. Her parents split when she was eight years old and she moved to Colorado Springs with her mother. Then she realised she was living with a hoarder. It might have been grief over the lost marriage that caused it, or maybe it was a habit that had grown worse as her mother’s dependence on drugs and alcohol intensified. On the kitchen table there were piles of clothes stacked all the way to the ceiling, things they would get for free from churches or charities. Furniture that Andersen’s well-meaning grandmother found on the street accumulated. An avalanche of pots and pans spilled all over the kitchen counters and floor. Anything her mother could get for free or cheap, she would bring into the house and leave there.As a child, Andersen kept her own space under control, but, beyond her bedroom door, the mess persisted. At 17, she left home, joined the air force and moved to New Mexico. Over time, her career took her to Alaska and then to Ohio, where she now lives with her husband, Shane, and works as an aerospace physiology technician. But the anxiety over her oppressive surroundings at home never left. Clutter was creeping back in, she realised, even though this time she thought she was fully in control.Andersen wanted all the things she had lacked in childhood, the comforts her colleagues and neighbours enjoyed. She wanted to be like the people in adverts, with their immaculate stage-set living rooms. Each new purchase brought a small dopamine rush that faded as soon as the thing was out of its box and taking up space. As she began to acquire more and more stuff and more and more debt, she began to feel as if she was falling into the pattern set by her mother.She went online for a solution. The search turned up blogs about “minimalism”: a lifestyle of living with less and being happy with, and more aware of, what you already own. The minimalist bloggers were men and women who, like her, had an epiphany that came from a personal crisis of consumerism. Buying more had failed to make them happier. In fact, it was entrapping them, and they needed to find a new relationship with their possessions – usually by throwing most of them out. After jettisoning as much as they possibly could, the bloggers showed off their emptied apartments and shared the strategies they used to own no more than 100 objects. The advice gained them large followings and they began soliciting donations or selling books. Presiding over them was Marie Kondo, a Japanese cleaning guru whose books were becoming international bestsellers. The principal commandment of Kondoism was to abandon anything that didn’t “spark joy” – a phrase that soon became familiar around the world.What the bloggers collectively called minimalism amounted to a kind of enlightened simplicity, a moral message combined with a particularly austere visual style. This style was displayed primarily on Instagram and Pinterest. Certain hallmarks of minimalist imagery emerged: clean white subway tiles, furniture in the style of Scandinavian midcentury modern, and clothing made of organic fabrics from brands that promised you would only ever need to buy one of each piece. Next to the products were monochromatic memes with slogans such as “Own less stuff. Find more purpose.” The trend wasn’t as subtle as its name suggested minimalism was a brand to identify with as much as a way of coping with mess.Andersen bought the minimalist books and listened to the podcasts. She removed everything from the walls of her home, cleared every surface and installed furniture made of light pinewood so that the rooms glowed in the sun. Without buying new stuff, the couple had enough money to pay off their bills and Shane’s student loans. Andersen felt a weight being released that went beyond the absence of clutter. She felt consumerism’s spell over her had been broken. “You don’t have to want things,” she said. “It’s a meditative thing, almost like repeating a mantra.”I met Andersen in 2017 in Cincinnati, where we were both attending a lecture on minimalism held at a local concert venue. We had come to see a pair of ebullient bloggers named Joshua Fields Millburn and Ryan Nicodemus, who started calling themselves the Minimalists in 2010. Both had enjoyed six-figure salaries in technology marketing, but amid mounting debt and addiction problems, they hit the reset button, turning to blogging instead – blogging about how they got rid of everything and started over. The Minimalists self-published books and accrued millions of podcast listeners. In 2016, their documentary about minimalist practices across the country was picked up by Netflix. Most of the fans I talked to in Cincinnati cited the film as their conversion moment to minimalism.I had been tracking the rise of this minimalist movement and the style that it produced for a few years, but its momentum still surprised me. It was a new social attitude that took its name from what was originally an avant-garde art movement that started in 1960s New York. How could that have happened? Minimalism in the context of visual art was not particularly mainstream (certainly not on the level of Andy Warhol’s pop art) nor even well understood, all of 50 years later, and yet it was also a viral hashtag. There in Cincinnati were suburban commuters and retirees discussing how they had embraced minimalism. Millburn and Nicodemus told me that they had found fans as far away as India and Japan.Over the following two years, minimalism kept popping up around me – in new hotel designs, fashion brands and self-help books. “Digital minimalism” became a term for avoiding the overwhelming information deluge of the internet and trying to not check your phone as much. But when I caught up with Andersen, I learned that she had left her local minimalism Facebook group and stopped listening to the Minimalists’ podcast every week. It wasn’t that she didn’t believe in minimalism any more. It had just become an integral part of her life, the basis for her entire approach to the stuff around her. She noticed it was sometimes more trendy than practical: there were people who liked talking about minimalism more than actually minimising, she said.On one hand there was the facade of minimalism: its brand and visual appearance. On the other was the unhappiness at the root of it all, caused by a society that tells you more is always better. Every advertisement for a new thing implied that you should dislike what you already had. It took Andersen a long time to understand the lesson: “There was really nothing wrong with our lives at all.”In the 21st century, across the developed world, most of us do not need as much as we have. The average American household possesses more than 300,000 items. In the UK, one study found that children have on average 238 toys, but only play with 12 of them on a daily basis. We are addicted to accumulation. The minimalist lifestyle seems like a conscientious way of approaching the world now that we have realised that materialism, accelerating since the industrial revolution, is literally destroying the planet.Yet my gut reaction to Kondo and the Minimalists was that it all seemed a little too convenient: just sort through your house or listen to a podcast, and happiness, satisfaction and peace of mind could all be yours. It was a blanket solution so vague that it could be applied to anyone and anything. You could use the Kondo method for your closet, your Facebook account or your boyfriend. Minimalism also seemed sometimes to be a form of inidualism, an excuse to put yourself first by thinking, I shouldn’t have to deal with this person, place or thing because it doesn’t fit within my worldview. On an economic level, it was a commandment to live safely within your means versus pursuing dreamy aspirations or taking a leap of faith – not a particularly inspiring doctrine.Minimalism, I came to think, is not necessarily a voluntary personal choice, but an inevitable societal and cultural shift responding to the experience of living through the 2000s. Up through the 20th century, material accumulation and stability made sense as forms of security. If you owned your home and your land, no one could take it away from you. If you stuck with one company throughout your career, it was insurance against periods of future economic instability, when you hoped your employer would protect you.Little of this feels true today. The percentage of workers who are freelance instead of salaried grows each year. House prices are prohibitive in any place with a strong labour market. Economic inequality is more severe than ever in the modern era. To make matters even worse, the greatest wealth now comes from the accumulation of invisible capital, not physical stuff: startup equity, stock shares and offshore bank accounts opened to avoid taxes. As the French economist Thomas Piketty points out, these immaterial possessions grow in value much faster than salaries do. That is, if you are lucky enough to have a salary in the first place. Meanwhile, crisis follows crisis and mobility now feels safer than being static, another reason that owning less looks more and more attractive.Most of all, the minimalist attitude speaks to the feeling that all aspects of life have become relentlessly commodified. Buying unnecessary items on Amazon with credit cards is a fast and easy way to exert some feeling of control over our precarious surroundings. Brands sell us cars, televisions, smartphones and other products (often on loans that inflate their costs) as if they will solve our problems. Through books, podcasts and designed objects, the idea of minimalism itself has also been commodified.If I am a minimalist, then, it is by default. In the New York apartment where I lived while writing this, I could look around and count the objects that belonged to me. Not the couch, bed, TV, console or dining table, which came from my one roommate. Just a desk and a bookshelf that held most of the things I cared about: books, papers and a few pieces of art. Unless you are wealthy or creative enough to afford a lot of space, there are two responses to living in New York: one is overstuffing a tiny space that eventually becomes unbearable, the other is living like a minimalist. Without basements, spare closets or extra rooms to stash stuff in, you are always Kondoing.The great recession of 2008 also seemed to usher in a larger minimalist moment. An aesthetic of necessity emerged as the economy came to a standstill. Shopping at thrift stores became cool. So did a certain style of rustic simplicity. Brooklyn and Shoreditch were filled with faux-lumberjacks drinking out of mason jars. Conspicuous consumption, the ostentation of the previous decades, was not just distasteful, it was unreachable. This faux blue-collar hipsterism preceded the turn to high-gloss consumer minimalism that happened once the economic recovery kicked in, preparing the ground for its popularity.Dissatisfaction with materialism and the usual rewards of society is not new, but minimalism is not an idea with a straightforward chronological history. It is more like a feeling that repeats in different times and places around the world. It is defined by the sense that the surrounding civilisation is excessive, and has thus lost some kind of original authenticity, which must be regained. The material world holds less meaning in these moments, and so accumulating more stuff loses its appeal.I began thinking of this universal feeling as the longing for less. It is an abstract, almost nostalgic desire – a pull toward a different, simpler world. Not past or future, neither utopian nor dystopian, this more authentic world is always just beyond our current existence, in a place we can never quite reach. Perhaps the longing for less is the constant shadow of humanity’s self-doubt: what if we were better off without everything we have gained in modern society? If the trappings of civilisation leave us so dissatisfied, then maybe their absence is preferable and we should abandon them in order to seek some deeper truth. The longing for less is neither an illness nor a cure. Minimalism is just one way of thinking about what makes a good life.For some of its devotees, minimalism is therapy. The spasm of getting rid of everything is like an exorcism of the past, clearing the way for a new future of pristine simplicity. It represents a decisive break. No longer will we depend on the accumulation of stuff to bring us happiness – we will instead be content with the things we have consciously decided to keep, the things that represent our ideal selves. By owning fewer things, we might be able to construct new identities through selective curation instead of succumbing to consumerism.At least, that is the model popularized by Marie Kondo’s books, social media accounts and the instantly famous Netflix series that launched at the beginning of 2019. The KonMari Method, described in Kondo’s English-language debut The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up, is curiously rigid, with a ritualistic appeal from the process of handling each item in turn and deciding if it stays or goes. Only by following Kondo’s disciplined tenets can the reader be fully successful. Despite her claims that everyone should find their own version of tidiness, she critiques those who follow “erroneous conventional approaches” to cleaning. One must begin with clothes, then proceed on to books, papers and household miscellany. Sentimental items such as photographs or memorabilia are last, because only by the end will you have built up the appropriate sensitivity to joy being sparked to evaluate such potent objects.Kondo promises the illusion of choice. You decide what stays in your house, but she tells you exactly how it should be folded, stored and displayed – in other words, how you should relate to it. When you pull everything out of its nooks and crannies, you realise just how much stuff you own, and how much of it you do not really need. It is like learning what actually goes into junk food: being forced to think about what you put into your life is enough to instill the habit for ever. Kondo boasts that none of her clients has ever relapsed. “A dramatic reorganisation of the home causes correspondingly dramatic changes in lifestyle and perspective,” she writes. Readers trade the orthodoxy of consumerism for the orthodoxy of tidiness. KonMari might be vaguely anti-capitalist, but then there is the fact that you have to buy a suite of Kondo books to practise it. She has been fully transformed into a brand: her company now sells luxury Kondo boxes to organise your stuff in, certification classes for would-be Kondo acolytes and a range of crystals, as well as a “therapeutic tuning fork”.Minimalism was already being commodified when Kondo emerged, however. She was only the crest of a larger 2010s wave of writers adopting the idea. Her English-language predecessors emerged out of the online lifestyle-blogger community, with blogs such as Joshua Becker’s Becoming Minimalist, starting in 2008 Courtney Carver’s Be More With Less, in 2010, and The Minimalists, who had already self-published their book Minimalism: Live a Meaningful Life in 2011.The literature of the minimalist lifestyle is an exercise in banality. It is saccharine and predigested, presented as self-help as much as a practical how-to guide. Each book contains an easy structure of epiphany and aftermath, recounting the crisis that leads its author to minimalism, the minimalist metamorphosis and then the positive ways the author’s life changed. The books are often broken up into subheadings, and important phrases are bolded like a high-school textbook. Each one offers more or less the same vision as the others: “I don’t need to own all this stuff,” as Becker writes. Minimalism’s rewards are more money, more generosity, more freedom, less stress, less distraction, less environmental impact, higher-quality belongings and more contentment, as Becker reels off in a series of bullet points. The books’ sameness of content is matched by a shared design of visual serenity. Their covers are all soft colours and soothing typefaces, suitable for Instagramming – even if you don’t read them, they can still be inspiring. The serene covers of these books are just one example of how minimalism’s visual appeal makes its doctrine of sacrifice easier to swallow. Its aesthetic of fashionable austerity is like a brand logo. It is identifiable anywhere, and serves to remind us of the air of moral purity associated with simplicity, even if the minimalist product to be consumed has no moral content whatsoever.The KonMari Method and minimalist self-help as a whole works because it is a simple, almost one-step procedure, as memorable as a marketing slogan. It is a shock treatment demonstrating that you do not need to depend on possessions for an identity you still exist even when they are gone. But as Kondo conceives it, it is also a one-size-fits-all process that has a way of homogenising homes and erasing traces of personality or quirkiness, like the sprawling collection of Christmas decorations that one woman on the Netflix show was forced to decimate over the course of an episode. The overflow of nutcrackers and tinsel was a clear problem (as was her husband’s piles of baseball cards), but with their absence the home was sanitised and homogenised. Minimalist cleanliness is the state of acceptable normalcy that everyone must adhere to, no matter how boring it looks.The most famous proponent of minimalism – or at least minimalism as a lifehack – was probably Steve Jobs. In a famous photograph from 1982, Jobs sits on the floor of his living room. He was in his late 20s at the time, and Apple was making $1bn a year. He had just bought a large house in Los Gatos, California, but he kept it totally empty. In Diana Walker’s photo, he is seen cross-legged on a single square of carpet, holding a mug, wearing a simple dark sweater and jeans – his prototypical uniform. A tall lamp by his side casts a perfect circle of light. “This was a very typical time,” Jobs later remembered. “All you needed was a cup of tea, a light and your stereo, you know, and that’s what I had.” Not for him, the usual displays of wealth or status. In the photo he looks content.Yet the image of simplicity is deceptive. The house Jobs bought was huge for a young, single man with no use for that excess space. Wired magazine later discovered that the stereo setup resting in the corner would have cost $8,200. The lone lamp that illuminates the scene was made by Tiffany. It was a valuable antique, not a utilitarian tool.Not only is simplicity often less simple than it looks, it can also be much less practical than it seems. People often conflate the phrase “form follows function” – the idea that the external appearance of an object or building should reflect the way that it works – with the self-conscious appearance of minimalism, as in Jobs’s house or the design of Apple’s iPhone. But Jobs’s empty living room was not particularly usable. Instead of the mantra that “form follows function”, Jobs echoes a slogan that could be glimpsed not long ago in one upscale New York shop front: “Fewer, better.” Possess the best things and only the best things, if only you can afford them. It was better to go without a couch than buy one that wasn’t perfect. That commitment to taste might be rarified, but it probably did not endear Jobs to his family, who might have preferred a place to sit.Apple devices have gradually simplified in appearance over time under designer Jony Ive, who joined the company in 1992, which is why they are so synonymous with minimalism. By 2002, the Apple desktop computer had evolved into a thin, flat screen mounted on an arm connected to a rounded base. Then, into the 2010s, the screen flattened even more and the base vanished until all that was left were two intersecting lines, one with a right angle for the base and another, straight, for the screen. It sometimes seems, as our machines become infinitely thinner and wider, that we will eventually control them by thought alone, because touch would be too dirty, too analogue.Does this all really constitute simplicity? Apple devices have only a few visual qualities. But it is also an illusion of efficiency. The company strives to make its phones thinner and removes ports – see headphone jacks – any chance it gets. The iPhone’s function depends on an enormous, complex, ugly superstructure of satellites and undersea cables that certainly are not designed in pristine whiteness. Minimalist design encourages us to forget everything a product relies on and imagine, in this case, that the internet consists of carefully shaped glass and steel alone.The contrast between simple form and complex consequences brings to mind what the British writer Daisy Hildyard called “the second body” in her 2017 book of the same name. The phrase describes the alienated presence that we feel when we are aware of both our inidual physical bodies and our collective causation of environmental damage and climate change. While we calmly walk down the street, watch a film or go food shopping, we are also the source of pollution drifting across the Pacific or a tsunami in Indonesia. The second body is the source of an unplaceable anxiety: the problems are undeniably our fault, even though it feels as if we cannot do anything about them because of the sheer difference in scale.Similarly, we might be able to hold the iPhone in our hands, but we should also be aware that the network of its consequences is vast: server farms absorbing massive amounts of electricity, Chinese factories where workers die by suicide, devastated mud pit mines that produce tin. It is easy to feel like a minimalist when you can order food, summon a car or rent a room using a single brick of steel and silicon. But in reality, it is the opposite. We are taking advantage of a maximalist assemblage. Just because something looks simple does not mean it is the aesthetics of simplicity cloak artifice, or even unsustainable excess.This slickness is part of minimalism’s marketing pitch. According to one survey in a magazine called Minimalissimo, you can now buy minimalist coffee tables, water carafes, headphones, sneakers, wristwatches, speakers, scissors and bookends, each in the same monochromatic, severe style familiar from Instagram, and often with pricetags in the hundreds, if not thousands. What they all seem to offer is a kind of mythical just-rightness, the promise that if you just consume this one perfect thing, then you won’t need to buy anything else in the future – at least until the old thing is upgraded and some new level of possible perfection is found.Adapted from The Longing for Less: Living with Minimalism by Kyle Chayka, which will be published by Bloomsbury on 21 January• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b8cf2466113a3dfe43c0907add54ef10870e3b2f/0_1033_2400_1440/master/2400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=38cdb0efc917eb62b60c915bd1d2b387","title":"female ultra athletes leading field women less ego","story":"From swimming the Channel four times to outrunning every man, we meet the women at the top of their gameAt the top of a wind-scoured hill outside Edinburgh, Jasmin Paris’s dog, Moss, patiently waits for his owner. He is, I think, wondering what on earth is taking her so long. The answer, I’m afraid, is me.We are in the Pentland Hills near her home – easy terrain for a skilled fell runner. For me, it’s a painful reminder that road marathons and track races do not help in the hills. I spend my clumsy descents looking at my feet, and each time I look up, Paris is defying gravity – not so much dropping as floating down.In January, Paris, then 35, made headlines across the globe when she won the Spine Race, one of those almost comically difficult events that sounds less like a run and more like a sadistic punishment: 268 miles, nonstop, along the Pennine Way. Paris took a week off from her PhD in veterinary science to compete, and thrashed every man in the field in the process.The race is billed as the world’s toughest endurance contest, and with good reason. It’s dark two-thirds of the time. Racers traverse the Peak District, Yorkshire Dales, North Pennines and cross over Hadrian’s Wall to the Cheviots, sleeping only in snatches. Yet Paris’s time of 83 hours, 12 minutes and 23 seconds beat her nearest male rival by nearly 15 hours. And she did it while expressing milk for her baby daughter in aid stations en route – ensuring more than her allotted 15 minutes of fame when she crossed the line. But it’s a fame she clearly finds a little baffling: it’s a fair bet no one has taken up fell running in a bid to become rich or famous.“That last day of the race, in the Cheviots, was so remote and so, so beautiful,” she tells me. Where we are in the Pentlands feels fairly remote on a windy day, but it is only a bus ride from Edinburgh town centre. “I think I saw one person in about 10 hours. It was one of those mountain days that you remember for ever. I had stopped thinking about the outside world. It’s a simple existence: you put one foot in front of the other and keep going. Emerging from the darkness to what came after – the whole world seemingly wanting to talk to you – was such a stark contrast. But that wasn’t the reason I wanted to do it. It was a challenge, a personal challenge.” The thing is, I think that might be why she won.When it comes to speed, men will always be first across the line. No woman will outsprint Usain Bolt. No woman will hit the side of the pool ahead of Michael Phelps’s world records. Yet a remarkable phenomenon seems to have gathered pace over the past few years: the longer and more brutal the event, the more women seem to be winning outright, or surpassing men’s achievements.In September this year, the US swimmer Sarah Thomas (already holder of the world record for the longest open-water swim) completed another breathtaking feat of endurance. The Channel Swimming Association records 1,652 solo, observed, unassisted swims (no neoprene wetsuits or flotation devices) of the Channel since 1875. Thirty-four people have swum it there and back without stopping. Four people have swum it three times in a row (two men, two women). But only one – Thomas – has swum it four times. It took her 54 hours and 10 minutes, and though the crossing at its narrowest point is 20 miles, because of the strong tides pushing against her, she actually swam not 80 but close to 130 miles.This was despite battling nausea and throwing up everything she ate for the first two crossings. A day into her swim, she was almost ready to bail, but her team told her: just keep going. “So that’s what I did,” she said. “I swam until the sun came up and I started to feel better.”So what is going on here? Are we witnessing the beginning of a brave new world, or are these extraordinary women simply outliers?Those looking for a definitive scientific answer may be disappointed. Until about the age of 10, girls and boys are, athletically speaking, the same. Top running speed is the same for boys and girls, as is top swimming speed. Then puberty happens and testosterone changes everything. By 14, boys have bigger hearts, stronger arms, bigger shoulders, longer limbs, greater muscle mass. More power, and more speed, for life.However, when it comes to very long endurance events, the data is limited. While ultrarunning is experiencing something of an explosion in popularity, there aren’t that many 200-mile-plus races, and relatively few women are running them.So is it not possible that after a certain mileage the relative advantages that male hormones bring just, well, run out? The renowned sports scientist Ross Tucker is doubtful. He points out that the success rate among women in ultra-distance races is probably down to the fact that these are niche events – the tiny numbers of ultra-committed female athletes who do compete make any kind of analysis or extrapolation meaningless. However, intriguingly, he does wonder whether a woman’s body composition might prove to be an advantage when it comes to long-distance swimming. “The higher relative body fat percentage is probably enough to offset the differences in strength between men and women, particularly for cold water,” he says. A higher body fat percentage helps in buoyancy, which in turn reduces energy expenditure. It also helps insulate in cold water.Then there’s the theory that women do so well in ultra races because they are better than men at burning fat for fuel – making them more efficient. But if that were true, Tucker would expect the gap between the sexes to narrow as the reliance on fat gets larger – which doesn’t seem to be the case.“In running, from 100 metres to 90 kilometre ultramarathons, the gap between men and women doesn’t change,” he says. “That said, it could be that there is a kind of ‘inflection’ point where suddenly it begins to count. The data is just too thin to know for sure.”But if women win because of who else does or doesn’t turn up – how did Paris do so by such a margin? After all, when she won the Spine, the second-place finisher was Eoin Keith, a previous winner and the holder of the course record she smashed – hardly an average competitor. The answer may lie less in the body than in the head.Paris doesn’t run for prizes. She – like Thomas, who works for a healthcare company in Colorado – is an amateur, with a full-time job. If every single fell race in the country were called off tomorrow, she’d still be up in those hills every day. She tells me about holidays spent there in her late teens and early 20s with her brother. They’d pack everything they needed to be self-sufficient for a week, go to the remotest hills and hike, eat, sleep, repeat. She hasn’t raced a huge amount since January’s Spine Race, but in the summer she, her husband and a friend completed the Petite Trotte à Léon (PTL). Part of ultrarunning’s biggest event – the Ultra Trail du Mont Blanc (UTMB) – the PTL is not so much a race as an endurance adventure. The 300km route passes through France, Italy and Switzerland, and includes 25,000m of ascent. “It was kind of a holiday,” Paris says, smiling.I suspect it’s not most people’s idea of a relaxing week. But it reminds me of a conversation I had with the cyclist Emily Chappell, who was the first woman across the line in the 2016 Transcontinental, and has herself been pondering the question of what can lead to women outperforming men.“I’ve got this bee in my bonnet about the current narrative for cycling – the male narrative,” she says. “A lot of it is about pain and suffering and the pain cave and the glory of pain and seeking out pain. Oh God, it’s so boring. So the working theory I’ve come up with is that people who do endurance sport are often people who have quite comfortable lives, and they are almost looking for pain elsewhere. I know it’s making generalisations, but what if men are looking for the pain they lack in life, and women are looking for the freedom?”It’s a persuasive theory. So many endurance events are marketed with a hefty dash of machismo – “tough” this, “ultimate” that, “warrior” the other. But is this constant reminder of suffering really the best way to approach an ultra event, when managing your head is as – if not more – important than managing your body? If you buy into this narrative that you are here only to suffer and endure, rather than have fun, then maybe those who start relaxed, looking forward to the journey, might have a head start.Perhaps this sounds a little woolly. But Thomas agrees that, for her, swimming is about freedom, not glory. “This is exactly me!” she says. “I don’t really care about racing and winning – I just like pushing myself. The long open-water swims make me feel free and strong. To look across the Channel and say, ‘I swam that’ is really empowering. I love being alone in a large body of water, knowing I’m relying on myself to make it through.”Sports psychologists also often talk about “the process, not the outcome” – enjoying, or at least staying in, the moment. Thomas clearly embraces this. “I was always weird during my competitive swimming days. I loved the training more than the racing,” she says. Perry believes this mindset can, perhaps contrary to expectations, create winners. “Something I see regularly with athletes is that when you are expected to do well, it adds a significant pressure,” she explains. “When there are no expectations we relax and can enjoy the process of seeing what is possible, rather than worrying about failing. These women may well see the event as ‘just a race’ in which they can see what is possible, rather than openly and loudly setting out to win it. This can be incredibly beneficial to performance.”Then there is the question of pride. Even when women do not win outright, they often perform better than men: better, in that a higher proportion of women finish ultra events successfully. And ego – or rather a lack of one – may be a key factor.Thomas agrees. “I think women do train harder, generally, and are less likely to wing something than the guys are,” she says. “I remember seeing something a few years ago that ran some numbers as related to speed. There are more guys who do longer swims, so there is a wider range of times, more variation. There are fewer women, but we seem to be more consistent.”It is backed up, too, by data from less extreme events. In marathon running, we know that women are on average better pacers. Not faster overall, just better at running evenly: less likely to go out too hard and “blow up”. And whether it’s 26.2 miles or 262, going out too hard can be the worst mistake you can make.But Thomas is not one to explore the theories. “I haven’t really looked into the science,” she says. “I just try to accept that my body is strong and can handle cold, no matter how much I hate my love handles.”Fortunately, hostility is the exception. Thomas points out that swimming has a longer history of equality than most sports. “Gertrude Ederle was the first woman to swim the Channel in the late 1920s, while the first female to run a marathon didn’t come along until the 70s. So women swimmers have a decades-longer tradition of being accepted than runners do.“I think most men are in awe of the women they swim with,” she adds. “They seem to accept that we’re just as tough, just as fast. That said, there are always exceptions. I have trained with men who think and act like they can beat me and get their feelings hurt when I pass them. I was sharing a lane with some guys a few years ago. When I was passing them, they tried to obstruct me. When I was getting out, two of them yelled at me for not being ‘respectful’ of their workout, never mind them being respectful of my workout.“And in 2008 or 2009, I outright won a 10k race. I passed the lead guy with about a mile to go and won by a couple of minutes. When we were done, I went up to congratulate him on a good race. He refused to shake my hand.”Paris has a similar story about a trail runner who wouldn’t let her pass him up a hill, despite clearly ruining his own race by speeding up too much. But she points out that generally fell running is democratic: “Here, you can have an elite runner and an 80-year-old in the same race, and we all have tea and cake together afterwards. There’s genuinely very little ego in this sport.”Where female winners often do encounter sexism, though, is in the reactions to their achievements. Thomas remarks that she’s constantly asked if she has kids, “with the assumption that if I did, I wouldn’t be doing what I was doing”. Paris says that she avoided looking too much at the comments under the articles about her victory.We also talk about Emelie Forsberg, a star of the ultrarunning world, with multiple wins to her name. Recently she had a baby with her partner, Kilian Jornet – himself probably the closest thing ultrarunning has to a household name. Forsberg was posting on Instagram about her return to competition in the Courmayeur-Champex-Chamonix (CCC part of the UTMB race series), which would take her about 12 hours. Paris says she immediately spotted one reply asking: “When you run for 12 hours, who looks after your baby? Don’t you worry about her?”“She replied with four words: ‘She has a father,’” Paris says. “And I thought yes, that absolutely sums it up. It’s crazy.”And so, despite these amazing athletes conquering distances most of us would consider an effort in a car, there’s still a considerable way to go. But make no mistake, times are changing in the endurance game. And these women know better than most how to stay in it for the long haul.• If you would like your comment on this piece to be considered for Weekend magazine’s letters page, please email weekend@the, including your name and address (not for publication).

Here’s how to keep them out of your jumper drawerYou have to think like a moth to eradicate a moth. Identify what they want, then take it away. Moths hate disturbance, so adults look for places that are dark, warm and undisturbed. Larvae look for protein. Dust is a food source, so the dirtier things are, the more they thrive.The most effective deterrent is thorough, regular housekeeping – at least once a week during spring and summer and once a month during winter. This takes away what moths need to thrive. Anything made of wool, such as carpets and curtains, must be disturbed regularly. That means dusting, vacuuming, removing seat pads from sofas and pulling out beds, TV cabinets, bookcases and wardrobes. Vacuum right around the edges and in the corners and crevices of rooms, as well as the bottom of wardrobes and cupboards. If there is carpet on the floor of your wardrobes and cupboards, get rid of it, if you can.Open up your wardrobes and chests of drawers, take the clothes out and give them a good shake. This will deter any adult moths that may be in there.In the spring, clean heavy items of clothing and bedding (such as thick blankets and quilts), then store them in vacuum bags – so moths can’t get in – for the warmer months. If your home has an open fireplace, get the flue swept at least once a year.If you use central heating in the winter, try not to turn it up higher than 21C doing so will attract moths.If you have wool carpet in the loft or basement, remove it.

But is it so very far from hip-hop’s roots?When a new song by the Atlanta rapper Playboi Carti emerges, the response from fans is frenzied: last year, a tune called Minute Maid appeared on YouTube and quickly racked up several million views, many fans hailing it as an instant classic. However, Playboi Carti had almost nothing to do with the song. While his voice was on it, he wasn’t involved with its production. In fact, at the moment of release he didn’t even know it existed.Minute Maid is an example of a bizarre and engrossing new phenomenon in hip-hop: a work made not by the artist, but by one of their fans, and indistinguishable from the genuine article. Elements of tracks will leak from a studio session, usually via engineers or hangers-on, and these “snippets” of unfinished material make their way to listeners.Minute Maid took shape after an Atlanta producer acquired a large number of Carti vocal stems – throwaway voice cuts, each only a few seconds long – from an unnamed leaker. That producer, an 18-year-old calling himself McFly, assembled these half-sentences and ad-libs into a song’s worth of verses and hooks. Next, he laid the stitched-together vocal over an instrumental obtained from a friend, which McFly believed to be a leaked beat by Carti’s longtime producer Pi’erre Bourne. Minute Maid was the result: a “new” Carti song, enthusiastically devoured by hordes of fans. The rapper himself never worked on the track beyond those ad-libs but listeners were none the wiser. “It’s crazy how big that song got,” McFly says. “Do you know how many people creamed their pants over it?”Minute Maid, which has since been taken offline, proliferated through reposts on streaming platforms – one reached 4m YouTube views before being deleted. McFly tried to have the song expunged after learning that the beat he used wasn’t by Bourne at all, but by a 13-year-old producer, Martini Got Tha Acid. But the track spread too quickly to contain, and so McFly took up the honourable – if arduous – task of contacting reposters inidually, demanding they credit the right person.There are few mainstream rappers who have gone untouched by the new leak economy. Kanye West teased and eventually cancelled his project Yandhi fans assembled the album that should have been with almost indignant swiftness, using leaks from the sessions. The best track of the bunch, 80 Degrees, was put together using snippets posted by West on Twitter and Instagram, plus snatches of demos that subsequently surfaced online.Songs by Travis Scott have undergone similar fan surgery – keyboard work from his live performances is replicated by fans on synths at home, and those melodies added to the original songs this way, fellow fans can enjoy the flourishes of a live show in studio quality, rather than listening to a phone recording. Fan revisionism has also reached Frank Ocean, most notably in the work of a YouTuber called Blomded, who merges various iterations of songs into chunky, completist-pleasing compound tracks, dubbed Ultimate Versions. The one for Nikes, for example, combines the original album track, the variant released with the music video, and a version with a guest verse from the Japanese rapper Kohh.The community is animated by a DIY punk spirit and an easygoing attitude to copyright it’s easy to draw parallels between it and the practices that led to the birth of rap in the first place. “Musical borrowing is the lifeblood of an art form like hip-hop,” says the musicologist Steven Gamble. “In the earliest days, turntablists in the south Bronx would loop the drum breaks from funk and soul as the basis for their own musical works. Now we’re seeing that with snippets – if you don’t like where an artist is going, you can make your own version.”While Spotify is unlikely to go offline, leaks and snippets are at constant risk of being culled by copyright strikes. Gamble points out that downloading files – very old hat in the age of streaming – is the only way a listener can guarantee their continued access to a leak-based track. “I’ve done it myself with Brockhampton leaks,” he admits.Some artists are less enthused. “Leaking isn’t advantageous to us – we need the traffic ourselves,” says Virgil Hawkins, a London rapper and member of the 237 collective. “There are people who would like to make a name for themselves off other people’s names.” Beyond that, he adds that having a track leak can feel violating for artists – it’s not pleasant, he says, to have unfinished work broadcast without your consent: “If you have a big plan for the song, it ruins the whole thing. You can’t take that moment back. It’s a bit of a pisstake, isn’t it?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/684337b6a66d85e7d07a270412f5a00f8bfb6dde/0_144_3037_1822/master/3037.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=89d9112aced08f09ffc35e04237b2853","title":"mystery of rolling stones tracks posted briefly on youtube","story":"Vintage recordings may have been published in attempt to extend copyright protectionA mysterious YouTube account that posted, then hid, a collection of 75 rare and unpublished Rolling Stones recordings may have been a canny attempt to avoid EU copyright laws and keep the tracks out of the public domain on the 50th anniversary of their creation.Shortly before midnight on 31 December, the YouTube account 69RSTRAX posted a collection of recordings including studio out-takes and live performances to its public page on the video-sharing site, with no commentary or explanation. Hours later, on 1 January, again with no warning, the account made all the videos private.69RSTRAX only joined YouTube on 29 December, and offers no clues as to its identity – save a YouTube-mandated email address, which directs business enquiries to ABKCO, a music publishing company that owns the rights to a substantial chunk of early Rolling Stones recordings.According to Variety magazine, which first reported the brief publication, the explanation could lie in the European Union’s copyright directive. Under EU law, sound recordings are covered by copyright for the first 50 calendar years after they were made – unless they have been “lawfully communicated to the public”, in which case the copyright term extends a further 20 years.At the end of 2019, then, ABKCO would have faced a “use it or lose it” conundrum: if it did not publish the tracks it held, it would find it difficult to monetise them in the future, as the copyright for the recordings (though not the compositions) would lapse.Some publishers, faced with similar issues, have released collections of recordings – of interest to super-fans only – such as the Beatles’ 2013 album Bootleg Recordings 1963. Others, perhaps less eager to share early, unfinished versions of songs with the world, have pushed what it means to “publish” tracks: a Bob Dylan compilation, literally published as “The Copyright Extension Collection, Volume 1”, was also released in 2013 in an edition of 100, and only sold in Europe.But this would be the first time a label has taken such a minimalist approach to publication. Even while the Stones tracks were available on YouTube, they were reportedly tampered with to make them less appealing to fans who might rip them and share them elsewhere. “The rarest recordings – ie the ones not previously available on bootlegs – have a dial-tone-like sound as loud as the music,” reported Variety’s Jem Aswad, making them “a truly miserable listening experience”.It remains unclear whether a publication of a single day, on one internet video platform, will be enough to satisfy European judges that the tracks were indeed “lawfully communicated to the public”.ABKCO declined to comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6ceb660fe63aee31e8db58227675fd637ef22d64/0_107_3196_1917/master/3196.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=f4e242806d83ec335dc48aacb51d0859 1240w","title":"labour leadership race comfort blanket keir starmer too safe","story":"Brexit stance will also prove controversial as candidates begin jockeying for positionWhen Labour members voted at the party’s conference in Brighton last autumn to back their leader’s Brexit stance, one close ally exulted: “This is Jeremy’s party now!”Faced with the choice of pressing for the remain position many passionately believed in and showing loyalty to Jeremy Corbyn, members opted for the latter.Last month’s crushing election defeat, however, has reopened the question of where members will put their faith. Early polling, which gave Keir Starmer a clear lead this week, suggests they are not ready to back the most leftwing candidate in the field en masse.Brexit is likely to be part of the explanation. The party, whose members are disproportionately in London and the south, is overwhelmingly pro-remain, even while many of its heartland constituencies – a swath of which were lost last month – voted to leave.Starmer’s patient and deliberate efforts to push the leadership toward a remain position were welcomed by many grassroots members, though his critics will use the issue to raise questions about his political judgment.Team Corbyn blame the shift toward backing a second referendum for the party’s electoral defeat and ridicule the fears of Starmer and his fellow leadership contender Emily Thornberry, expressed around the shadow cabinet table, that the Lib Dems could threaten them in their London seats.This and the prospect of yet another male leader – “we could be on our second Keir and we haven’t had our first woman yet,” said one exasperated frontbencher - are likely to be used against Starmer in the weeks and months ahead.Rival campaign teams also claim MPs and members scarred by the election result are clutching at the prospect of a Starmer leadership as a safe option, a “comfort blanket” as one candidate put it.The other contenders, including the high-profile backbencher Jess Phillips and the Wigan MP, Lisa Nandy, will hope to shake up the race and fight back by pointing to the scale of Labour’s defeat and the need for a change of direction. This would be in contrast to Starmer’s insistence that he would not “oversteer”.They face a scramble, however, to secure the necessary nominations from MPs and MEPs, and depending on the timetable the national executive committee (NEC) sets on Monday that race could be over in a week or less. Nandy and the anti-Brexit frontbencher Clive Lewis may struggle to convince the requisite 21 MPs, according to some colleagues.The leftwing frontrunner, Rebecca Long Bailey, appears to have made a faltering start despite being Corbyn’s heir apparent. The Labour leader spoke warmly about her when the pair appeared alongside each other at a string of general election events.  understands he has told friends he would like her to succeed him as the torchbearer of the left, but even some of his longtime allies harbour niggling doubts about the shadow business secretary.They feel she has not been tested enough, and wonder whether she might be tempted to tack toward the political centre ground at the behest of restive MPs. “A lot of us on the left are talking about this. She’s just never been under pressure,” said one frontbencher.Some speak wistfully of Laura Pidcock, the outspoken young former North West Durham MP who was another Corbyn favourite, but who lost her seat to the Conservatives and so is out of the running.The party chair Ian Lavery’s suggestion in recent days that he has not ruled out running for the leadership was read by many as a sign that key Corbyn lieutenants are not yet ready to throw their weight wholeheartedly behind Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary.Floated on the hyper-partisan blog Skwawkbox, Lavery’s candidacy is widely thought to be the brainchild of Corbyn’s former chief of staff Karie Murphy, who was a key figure in organising Labour’s election campaign and has close links with the Unite union.Unite is expected to support Long Bailey, though no formal decision has been made. Other major unions, wary of a stitch-up or of being accused of narrowing the choice for party members, may decide to opt for alternative candidates.Whatever the reservations of some Corbyn supporters, however, Long Bailey remains the leftwing candidate with by far the best chance of getting on the ballot paper. As such, she is likely to have the weight of Momentum’s formidable campaigning machine behind her.Other candidates will hope to attract thousands of new registered supporters as Corbyn did in 2015 to bolster their cause, provided the NEC, which has sweeping powers over the race, does not try to limit their ability to do so.As the 2015 contest showed, Labour leadership campaigns, particularly when conducted in the aftermath of a jarring general election defeat, can be anything but predictable."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/087742d9605e9ada0ffb53b35ffccd1abd3acadb/0_762_5478_3287/master/5478.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ae4346ca0e7c91bbdbb99d8082a81849","title":"lisa nandy enters labour leadership race with call for change","story":"Wigan MP says party will have to fight to regain trust of voters and ‘take anger on the chin’The Wigan MP Lisa Nandy has announced she will enter the Labour leadership race, with a stark warning to party members that “unless we change course, we will become irrelevant”.Nandy, who has championed the needs of Britain’s towns, announced her decision to run in a letter to constituents, carried in the Wigan Post.Setting out her pitch for the top job in an article for the , she took a dig at her rival Keir Starmer’s promise not to “oversteer” in the wake of last month’s general election defeat.“Now is not the time to steady the ship or try not to oversteer,” she wrote. “What is needed are the hard yards of winning the argument inch by inch in town halls, workplaces and pubs. This is where we fight to regain people’s trust. The next Labour leader will have to be up for a scrap – willing to run to the places we are loathed, take the anger on the chin, make and win the argument.”The poll, commissioned by the Party Members Project, suggested Starmer was the clear frontrunner, with the leftwing candidate Rebecca Long Bailey in second place, and Jess Phillips, third.Long Bailey is likely to benefit from the considerable campaigning resources of Momentum, if, as expected, she emerges as the leading leftwing contender.Momentum, a group set up to support Jeremy Corbyn’s successful candidacy in 2015, has not yet decided who it will back, but a spokesperson said: “We have got this incredible people-powered campaign machine and we will be throwing it behind a leftwing leadership candidate.”Phillips, the Birmingham Yardley MP, also declared her candidacy on Friday. Like Nandy, she stressed the importance of appealing to working-class voters who had deserted Labour.“I wasn’t sure if I was going to stand in this contest, but listening to the debate in the days after the election, I thought, we’ve got to elect someone who gets it. Someone who understands how serious this defeat was. We’re a party named after the working class who has lost huge parts of its working-class base. Unless we address that, we are in big trouble,” Phillips said.She tweeted a campaign video along with a statement saying that “politics needs honest voices” and urging people to join her campaign at her website.Phillips and Nandy will join Emily Thornberry and Clive Lewis as confirmed candidates. Others including Long Bailey and Starmer are expected to join the race formally in the coming days.Phillips was first elected to parliament in 2015. She has achieved prominence with her campaigning on equality issues and tackling violence against women, and has at times been a fierce critic of the party’s direction.In a statement announcing her candidacy, she said voters had lost trust in the Labour party and stressed the need for Boris Johnson to be challenged with “passion, heart and precision”.She criticised the current leadership’s “woeful response” to antisemitism within the party’s ranks and Jeremy Corbyn’s ambiguity on Brexit.Phillips said: “We have got to be brave and bold and bring people with us, not try and look all ways. Trying to please everyone usually means we have pleased no one.“Now is not the time to be meek. Boris Johnson needs to be challenged, with passion, heart and precision. We can beat him.”She also made clear she would have no qualms in challenging the US president, telling a Channel 4 News: “Of course you have to be prepared to confront anybody if you are in any position of power … Being an ally means being honest. I would have absolutely no problem in confronting Donald Trump.” Corbyn announced in the aftermath of last month’s election defeat that he would stay on as leader for a “period of reflection”.Labour’s ruling national executive committee (NEC) will meet on Monday to set the timetable for the contest, which is expected to be completed by the end of March.Phillips is calling for registered supporters to be allowed to participate in the contest at a low cost, such as the £3 paid by many who took part in the 2015 race that led to Corbyn’s election. In 2016, when Corbyn was challenged by Owen Smith, the NEC raised the cost to £25 and set a tight deadline for registering.A spokesperson for Phillips’ campaign said: “The Labour party membership, affiliates and supporters will be looking to this contest as a moment we can turn the page on what happened in December. They will want a proper say on what comes next for Labour. They deserve nothing less.“They’ll be looking to the NEC to ensure a process and timetable that respects the people who make this party what it is, the people who spent hours in the cold and rain during the election. They must get their say.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4af1e5c5b7e9cc4603550c6ea9720faf4ad78f95/0_406_6300_3780/master/6300.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0b11f31fab0758443778a3a608aaba84","title":"scottish trade unions leader urges labour to back independence vote","story":"Grahame Smith, head of the STUC, said election loss presented Labour with a dilemma but also an opportunityThe leader of Scotland’s trade union movement has urged Labour to support Nicola Sturgeon’s calls for a second independence referendum.Grahame Smith, general secretary of the Scottish Trades Union Congress (STUC), said the Scottish National party’s landslide victory in the general election made it clear that voters wanted a referendum.Smith, who will retire this spring after 14 years in the post, said the election result presented Labour with a dilemma but also an opportunity.Writing in the magazine Scottish Left Review, he said: “The first minister has made it clear that she will now push for indyref2. This has left Labour in a quandary: it cannot hold, as it has, that the overall election result gives the Tories a Brexit mandate, and simultaneously maintain the result in Scotland cannot be viewed as a mandate for indyref2.“The democratic wishes of the people of Scotland need to be acknowledged. The Scottish Labour movement should support indyref2.” Labour should use that as a chance to make a “compelling offer” to voters on how Scotland should pool or share its economic sovereignty.Leonard was forced last summer into accepting that the party could support a fresh referendum after John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, unexpectedly announced that policy. Leonard persuaded McDonnell and Jeremy Corbyn to reject Sturgeon’s call for a vote to be held this year.Smith’s remarks were welcomed by the SNP’s deputy leader, Keith Brown. “He is entirely right to say that the democratic wishes of the people of Scotland should be respected,” Brown said. “No politician or political party should stand in the way of people having that right to choose.”Kenny Macaskill, a new SNP MP who was previously the Scottish justice secretary, wrote in the same edition of Scottish Left Review that the chances of a second referendum this year were “nil”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6af76a5a5ee0cc3bc56e92d04fac40474917c77b/0_12_1641_985/master/1641.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8aeebdb0db960636bdaa616185c3be7c","title":"who said it dominic cummings or nathan barley quiz","story":"After Boris Johnson’s No 1 spad issues a bizarre job advert via his blog, can you guess who said it: Cummings or Barley?One is prone to spouting wonkish technobabble full of long words, dresses like he fell through a wardrobe backwards and had random items stick to him, and is looking for assorted weirdos and misfits with odd skills.

This is the venue for the Final Eight knockout stage and the final on 12 January, so travel hassles in the world’s sixth largest country will not be an issue if they reach the deciding Sunday.The 2019 Davis Cup finalists started well on Friday when Cameron Norrie took the first rubber 6-2, 3-6, 6-2, against the stubborn world No 423, Dimitar Kuzmanov. Dan Evans then went a set up against Grigor Dimitrov before the former world No 3 recovered to win 2-6, 6-3, 6-1.That prompted Dimitrov, as player-captain, to join Alexandar Lazarov against Jamie Murray and Joe Salisbury – a match which began at 12.47am and finished at 2.47am, 3hr 12min after public transport finished. It was an inspired decision by Dimitrov – and his sizzling return to save match point was not bad, either.The British pair, playing together for the first time, clicked but not often enough, and Bulgaria won 7-6 (5), 6-7 (2), 11-9 to seal an edgy 2-1 result. Murray served for the match at 9-7 but the Bulgarians got back on terms, Murray left Lazarov’s blistering backhand down the line and it dipped in for the winner.Murray said later: “It’s annoying, isn’t it, let’s be honest, to have to play at that time. For everyone, I mean, for everyone involved in the tournament, isn’t it? It’s a shame, because you start the match, singles, there’s 5,000 or 6,000 people there, but by the time you get to play there’s a few hundred. That’s not really what the event should be about.”The marketing men have branded this addition to a packed schedule “for love of country” and, although Norrie perhaps has a choice of allegiances – born in South Africa to a Scottish father and Welsh mother, raised in New Zealand and drawn back to Blighty to further his career – he is the sort of committed player anyone would want.As he said later: “I’m really happy that I made the team. I practise with Evo a lot on the tour, so it’s nice to be around a couple of my mates – especially Tim being the captain. He’s got some good stories from when he was playing, and some good experience.”Norrie found the court “extremely slow” but that suited his grinding game and an entertaining match with several long rallies pleased fans who took up maybe two thirds of the 10,000 seats in the air-conditioned Ken Rosewall Arena under a new canopy originally intended to keep out the rain, of which there was a mere 1.6mm last month, 76mm below the December average stretching back 161 years.When the ATP and Tennis Australia began to pull this event together last year, the sheer scale of the enterprise lent it a surreal edge. For a start there are 2,044 miles between Sydney and Perth, where Spain, one of the favourites, begin their campaign on Saturday. Russia, who won their tie against Italy, look strong in that group.There is a more amenable 454‑mile hop from Brisbane, where the hosts were handed a wildcard entry, and home fans were ecstatic when Nick Kyrgios eased past Jan-Lennard Struff in two sets and Alex de Minaur shocked the world No 7, Alexander Zverev.This is not the first international sporting event to ask participants to travel vast distances, and the 1994 World Cup in the US still owns the nine longest journeys for a tournament. But Perth-Sydney comes in a respectable 10th.Travel is the least of the problems facing the players here, though. There is the deadly spectre of bushfires crackling in the distance, roaring, roaming monsters of flame fed by intense heat and unpredictable winds that tug and shove them in all directions. As the death toll rises and scenes of mass evacuation fill TV screens around the clock, the hardships of tennis players are, beyond argument, trivial.Still, players, fans and administrators have responded generously, urged by Nick Kyrgios to help the fire victims and those trying to save them. After pledging $A200 an ace for relief funds, he hit 20 of them to beat Germany’s Jan-Lennard Struff in two sets in Brisbane.There is no shortage of enthusiasm or goodwill for this competition, and plenty of empathy for people in a daily life and death struggle with nature. The flames will fade sooner or later whether or not the ATP Cup withers on the vine will depend on the quality of the tennis and the brutal weather. While there will be no rain on Saturday to ease the scorching 43C forecast for this parched site, some of the tennis so far has been outstanding."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ecc36629709d58165b81b088af8fc881ee99c0fa/0_149_3292_1975/master/3292.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=93de62875257cfdb7fcfffd3a00c6fd3","title":"england joe root captain not working","story":"You had to commend Joe Root’s honesty when he walked after gloving behind a short ball from Anrich Nortje on the opening day of this second Test against South Africa. Yet perhaps the time is nearing for him to be equally honest about his own position as England’s Test captain.To be frank, it just isn’t working out. This latest innings from Root, a largely fluent 35 from 49 balls, offered more evidence as to why he should not be in the job.Up to the point where he nailed Keshav Maharaj for a sublime swept four to move on to 29, the Yorkshireman was imperious. After that something changed and his rhythm was disturbed, firstly flirting with danger when top-edging Maharaj before being dropped on 31 off Nortje and then being removed by the same bowler two balls later.Shorn of the opener Rory Burns through injury and coming into this match with a top three boasting only 15 caps between them, England needed their captain to lead from the front.Unfortunately, he did not. Again. The end result – yet another calamitous collapse – was all too predictable.Forget the flaws in his on-field captaincy for now – and they are myriad. England need Root at his very best with the bat if they are to have any hope of progressing as a Test team. At the moment they are going backwards, a rather uncomfortable position for Chris Silverwood, the new coach who is still looking for his first win four Tests into his tenure.Much was made of the great relationship the pair of Yorkshiremen had when Silverwood was announced as the successor to Trevor Bayliss in October. Although Silverwood should be given time to stamp his mark on this team, the early signs are that he is struggling to make much, if any, headway in what was always going to be a sizeable rebuilding job.Whatever support the coach can offer Root as captain, it will never banish the mental pressures that impose themselves on those who take on the role. To say Root’s own game has not been affected since he took over as captain from Alastair Cook in early 2017 is to deny all the evidence.When he came into the job, his Test average stood at 52.80. Back then he was rightfully ranked alongside the modern batting greats of India’s Virat Kohli, Australia’s Steve Smith and Kane Williamson of New Zealand. Sadly, that is no longer the case given Root’s average as captain stands at 42.42. That is still a very good return for most batsmen.However, Root is not most batsmen – he is the best England have and they desperately need him to progress rather than regress.Tellingly, since he took on the captaincy the averages of Kohli (63.68), Smith (67.31) and Williamson (57.70) dwarf Root’s over the same time three-year period.It is no coincidence England have not lost any of the 17 Tests where Root has made a three-figure score. He is the heartbeat of the batting unit yet trying to make him the heartbeat of the team as captain has undoubtedly not been for the greater good.You can point to the fact he has won more Tests (17) than he has lost (15) since taking on the job. Yet how many more victories might England have achieved had Root’s form with the bat kicked on even remotely similarly to that of Kohli, Smith and Williamson over the past three years?Things appear to be getting worse too, with Root’s average over the past 24 months dropping to 39. Cricket, and especially batting, is so much of a mental game that any disturbance to a player’s equilibrium can have a huge impact. To suggest that Root’s form has not been affected by the extra responsibility is ludicrous.Many people jumped to Root’s defence when he scored a double hundred against New Zealand at Hamilton before Christmas. It was a fine innings but ultimately it came on a flat pitch and England did not win the game. The last time Root scored a hundred in a winning cause came 11 months ago against West Indies in St Lucia. The series had already been lost by then.Root will make runs whether he is captain or not. But the key is he is likely to score many more if unburdened of that responsibility.In November before the series defeat in New Zealand, Ashley Giles, England’s director of cricket, said Root was the man to lead England on the next Ashes tour of Australia in 2021-22. “We have talked about him leading and winning in Australia,” he said. “We’ve not said: ‘Maybe if you get there.’ We plan for him to be our captain.”That now seems a remarkably premature shout from Giles because the truth is Root’s captaincy looks like it could reach a critical mass in a matter of months, if not weeks."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/068aedef95b548c1fcff7cae673ad524289841d9/0_240_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=97ff69610c77286f9d2be70826e94ab9","title":"australia v new zealand third test day two live","story":"138th over: Australia 413-6 (Labuschagne 213, Pattinson 1) Nice over from Astle, especially to the left-handed Pattinson, whose lack of foot movement allows the ball chance to drift and spin. Australia still manage three singles to keep the scoreboard ticking over.As his white ball figures attest, CdG is not the easiest to get away in a hurry. Labuschagne dots a couple before rotating strike, then Paine dots a couple before being bowled! Lovely delivery from CdG, hitting a perfect line and length, finding a touch of seam back into the right-hander - who left his gate open trying to force a late cut - and the ball cannoned into the top of off.136th over: Australia 409-5 (Labuschagne 210, Paine 35) The tonk is on. Paine gets off strike then Labuschagne slogs Astle with a crooked bat and only just avoids mid-on with a mistimed stroke. A couple more arrive courtesy of a dab to third-man before Astle beats the bat for no reward.Question: Is there anybody in cricket you’re happier to see succeed than Tim Paine? Jason Holder perhaps? Kane Williamson? The entire Ireland team? 135th over: Australia 403-5 (Labuschagne 205, Paine 34) Milestone passed, Labuschagne shows his hand, cutting for two then driving aggressively but straight to the field. I reckon we could be in for some #Declarationspeculation hitting over the next couple of hours. CdG is handed the ball as the field squeezes the life out of the SCG. Normally a vast football oval it must feel as enclosed as solitary confinement for Labuschagne right now. Dot. Dot. Edge! But there’s no slip - and the ball scoots down tot he boundary for four runs - 400 up for Australia - and a magnificent double century for Australia’s superstar no.3134th over: Australia 397-5 (Labuschagne 199, Paine 34) Astle sends down five dots in the over after drinks. The crowd holds its breath for ball six. Paine cuts. Groans spread. But they grow into cheers as the ball runs and runs away to the third-man boundary for four! Labuschagne on strike to start the next over. Surely 200 is his, 19 minutes after hitting 199. Just to annoy you all with a little earworm, I can’t get Cypress Hill’s Insane in the Brain out of my head while Paine and Labuschagne are out in the middle together. Thank you very much Adam. Remember to retune your emails and tweets to the following addresses: @JPHowcroft and jonathan.howcroft.casual@the. 133rd over: Australia 393-5 (Labuschagne 199, Paine 30) The SCG crowd are a bit tetchy with Paine finding it ever so hard to put Marnus back down there. He will get one delivery, with Paine pushing one to cover. And he plays and misses at it! That was a lovely bit of bowling. That’s drinks as well. Over to JP Howcroft to, let’s hope, drag Marnus Labuschagne over the line for a maiden double ton. Bye! Oh, before I go: great news from the Russell Jackson bat auction for bushfire relief: it has topped two grand! Get in there! To be honest, I still think that’s a bargain. It couldn’t be easier to lodge your bid. Check out the below and up the offer. Do it!132nd over: Australia 392-5 (Labuschagne 199, Paine 29) Toddy, my man. Can you do to Marnus what happened to Matty Elliott all those years ago? Or Steve Smith at Sahina Park? I was calling the latter for West Indies radio, a DRS review sorting him out. Let’s hope not. He’s earned this achievement. Paine isn’t finding it easy to give the strike back to him though... until the final ball, that is! Paine to face again.131st over: Australia 391-5 (Labuschagne 199, Paine 28) Henry has the job to do with the entire SCG crowd waiting to see a special moment. Paine does his bit, giving Labuschagne the strike with three balls remaining in the over. On 199, he defends the first, defends the second... and... defends the third! Over bowled. 130th over: Australia 390-5 (Labuschagne 199, Paine 27) Hot Toddy Astle is brought back on and is making life tough for Labuschagne with a delivery that turns a long way to beat the edge. Now on 198, he cuts to extra cover from the penultimate delivery, Paine then doing likewise to keep the strike. We wait. 129th over: Australia 386-5 (Labuschagne 197, Paine 25) Labuschagne pulls Henry but only for one. Paine wants to cut when he gets his turn but underestimates the bounce, beaten outside the line. He responds with a much better shot for three out to cover from the balls of his feet. Labuschagne once more, now a boundary away, but takes a quick single instead to midwicket. He’ll wait for next over.128th over: Australia 381-5 (Labuschagne 195, Paine 22) Paine picks Somerville off for a single through midwicket after using his feet to get to the pitch. He has a nice start here. The offie is back around the wicket to Labuschagne, who is jumping down the track to defend then doing the same to attack, driving on the up through cover. What a shot that is, all the way along the ground and straight from the middle of the bat. And now another gallop down the strip before setting for one to square leg. He brought up his ton in Perth with a six (and tried to in Adelaide), so that’s worth keeping an eye on now that’s he’s within five of his double century. 127th over: Australia 375-5 (Labuschagne 190, Paine 21) Fair play to Matt Henry, who keeps hitting his length just on the fourth stump line over and over and over again. Remember, he’s doing this with a broken thumb, which must be throbbing as he sets in to deliver each ball. His maiden to Labuschagne is spot on here.126th over: Australia 375-5 (Labuschagne 190, Paine 21) Somerville gives Paine enough room to cut his first ball, away for a couple and into the 20s. He’s kept honest by the Kiwi spinner for the rest of the over, who has bowled pretty well.125th over: Australia 373-5 (Labuschagne 190, Paine 19) There we go, Labuschagne overtakes his 185 from Brisbane against Pakistan in November with a boundary to start Henry’s over, albeit an unconvincing one off an outside edge through the cordon. But with only one catcher in there, the risk is limited. By the end of the set he’s into the 190s from the bottom edge of his bat, mishitting his pull shot. It came up on social media during the lunch break that he’s never made it to 200 in any form of cricket that is registered on the world wide web. What better time! 124th over: Australia 367-5 (Labuschagne 185, Paine 18) Labuschagne pulls level with his highest score with a push to mid-on. He’s got a long way to go, I reckon.123rd over: Australia 365-5 (Labuschagne 184, Paine 18) Wagner to Labuschange to begin, the Queenslander taking a single first ball this time. Full, full, short is the pattern this time to the captain, who is happy to have a pop at the pull shot, getting it straight to ground and out to a sweeper. He was the player who changed the tempo of the innings last week at Melbourne when Wagner was in the heads of Australia’s middle order. Another half-century to finish his summer would do the world of good before white-ball cricket takes over until Bangladesh in June.122nd over: Australia 363-5 (Labuschagne 183, Paine 17) Paine gives the strike straight to Labuschagne from the first ball of Somerville’s new set. The dominant No3 plays the rest with a straight bat, easing one down the ground to finish.121st over: Australia 361-5 (Labuschagne 182, Paine 16) Wagner again to Paine, who is more conversative this time around, prompting a move to around the wicket for the tail-end of the over. He takes one from a fuller ball, Labuschagne dealing with an accurate short one with soft hands to finish. 120th over: Australia 360-5 (Labuschagne 182, Paine 15) Somerville from the Paddington End, where he started the day so successfully with Wade’s wicket. The TV cuts to a shot of the city, just a couple of kilometres away from the SCG, and the haze is thick. I wonder at what stage they will start considering their options in terms of taking the players off? It looks very sunny in the middle but they are measuring this on air quality. Anyway, in the here and now, the big off-spinner gets one to keep low at the home skipper, just getting his bat down in time. You don’t normally see that in the opening innings of a Test. Paine goes at the next ball, a full delivery outside the off-stump, middling a square drive out to the rope. He’s hitting them well in this series, helping silence calls for his replacement.119th over: Australia 354-5 (Labuschagne 181, Paine 10) From the Randwick End, Wagner has the field spread out on the legside and just Taylor in the conventional cordon, as is the norm at this stage of an innings for the left-armer. Ooh, and Paine has a pop at the short one too, missing with his swing. He’s back in defence straight after that then leaving the last couple. They’ll go harder in this session. The players are back on the field. Wagner is back into the attack for yet another spell, this his 27th over. Paine is up the business end. PLAY! “Morning Adam (well it’s morning in Perth).” Hello, John Phaceas. “It strikes me that many of those players in favour of 4 day tests have limited experience in actually playing on day 5. Regardless, though most tests currently only last 4 days anyway, my fear would be that officially shortening the duration would result in a lot more teams pulling down the shutters early and holding on for draws. How many wins currently come down to a team being 3 down in the 4th innings at the start of day 4 and staring at the mountain of surviving 180 overs or scoring 400 runs? Plus – 5 day tests are a Tex Perkins-like gesture to the banality of broadcastingadvertising executives who increasingly call the shots in all modern sport.”Also, a lot of assumptions about how many overs would fit into a day. With the exception of New Zealand, is there a team that consistently gets through their 90? Let alone another eight, even with an additional half an hour. It won’t happen.“Is anyone else struggling with guilt over checkinglisteningwatching the cricket?” I’m asked by @Roscommon_Cat on twitter. “I’m on the other side of the state to where the fires are, but I feel like it’s somehow in bad taste.”I don’t think it’s wrong at all to feel that way. But I suppose the nature of life is that it continues through tragedy all the time and this is no different. To be fair to the participants in this match, they are trying to use the week to raise much-needed funds. Without the fixture taking place, it would be harder to achieve that. To that end, a reminder that you can participate in a couple of cricket-related auctions for bushfire relief. Take a look at these playing shirts for the Australian team, and Russell Jackson’s magnificent cricket bat - currently at $1500. Bargain!New Zealand hung in there. Across the 28 overs, they took two wickets and only gave up 71 runs, which wasn’t a bad effort. That Somerville bowled Wade sweeping in the first over of the morning halted any thoughts of putting the foot down, Head tied up for half an hour before falling caught behind to Henry - the other scalp. The problem for the Black Caps is that Labuschagne goes on and on, now just four runs short of his highest Test score and 19 away from a maiden double ton he’s been out there for 308 deliveries but his concentration can’t be broken. This really is the definition of a golden summer. Remember to email or tweet me your thoughts on four-day Test cricket. We’ll pick that up shortly. 118th over: Australia 354-5 (Labuschagne 181, Paine 10) de Grandhomme has the final over before the break, Paine taking the third ball - another hoopy inswinger - out to backward square to get off strike. He’s where he needs to be at Labuschagne too, finding the inside edge one last time before they depart for LUNCH! 117th over: Australia 353-5 (Labuschagne 181, Paine 9) They are scoring easily enough off Great Guy Todd Astle, but he has a decent wrong’un on him! He nearly slips one past Paine, in what will be his final over before lunch. The captain keeps the strike with a single out to point. I’ll be calling this fashion option the Hot Toddy. Please do it. 116th over: Australia 349-5 (Labuschagne 180, Paine 6) It doesn’t look pretty this field for CdG but you have to change it up when an innings has been going this long, nearing an interval. Watling makes a lovely take down the legside, quickly whipping the bails off - he appeals but Paine never moves his back foot. The all-rounder brings out his outswinger next, locating the outside of Paine’s bat, steered behind point. Warne and Gilchrist are talking about average speeds for legspinners as they look at Astle, who is sending them down at about 85kph. The best there is reflects on Stuart Macgill: “Good bowler. Gave it a rip.” Love that stuff.115th over: Australia 346-5 (Labuschagne 178, Paine 5) “Yeah, one!” calls Labuschagne when taking a single through point to retain the strike at the end of the Astle over... he now even sounds like Steve Smith. All told, five risk-free runs from it, the Queenslander closing in on 185 - his highest Test score. 114th over: Australia 341-5 (Labuschagne 174, Paine 4) de Grandhomme, who opened the bowling yesterday, is on for his first go today. To Labuschagne, he has no conventional slips but Ross Taylor is in position at leg slip, with Latham up to the stumps. A bit different but the all-rounder makes it work for him, all stump-to-stump. He also finds the inside edge with a tidy inswinger. Useful first set. 113th over: Australia 340-5 (Labuschagne 173, Paine 4) After getting through that appeal, Paine makes contact with the middle of his bat a few times in the over while defending before putting away a half-tracker past point to get off the mark. NOT OUT! Yeah, that’s not a good review. The noise that Watling detected before the ball hit the bat was the blade hitting the pad. They have no reviews left. Watling smiles upon realising that, on reflection, it really wasn’t much of a shout.HAS ASTLE TRAPPED PAINE LBW? Aleem Dar says no but Tom Latham is sending it upstairs. Stand by. 112th over: Australia 336-5 (Labuschagne 173, Paine 0) Watling is very keen on a leg before shout to start Henry’s over, Labuschagne shuffling across his stumps and working it down to fine leg, hitting pad before pat. No review. He defends the rest of another accurate over. It’s been a very good spell.As we move towards lunch, give me your hottest takes on four-day Tests. I’ve already said that I can’t have it. Not full-time. I don’t mind them being used to enable Tests that wouldn’t otherwise happen, but to make them compulsory for the next round of the World Test Championship is a whole other thing. Go!

I thought it was just talking dirty. It comes in so many different ways. It might be 15 messages … it could be racy photos.”Nex’s AI platform is used by more than 50 corporate clients, including law firms in London.The industry is a potentially fertile ground for the bots to examine: a third of female lawyers in Britain report having experienced sexual harassment.The bot uses an algorithm trained to identify potential bullying, including sexual harassment, in company documents, emails and chat. Data is analysed for various indicators that determine how likely it is to be a problem, with anything the AI reads as being potentially problematic then sent to a lawyer or HR manager to investigate.Exactly what indicators are deemed red flags remains a company secret, but Leib said the bot looked for anomalies in the language, frequency or timing of communication patterns across weeks, while constantly learning how to spot harassment.Leib believes other industries could also benefit. “There’s a lot of interest from clients across sectors such as financial services, pharmaceuticals,” he said.Prof Brian Subirana, a lecturer in AI at Harvard and MIT, said the idea of using AI to root out harassment was promising though the bots’ capabilities were limited.The underlying issue is that AI can only reliably conduct basic story analysis, meaning it is taught to look for specific triggers. It cannot go beyond that parameter and cannot pick up on broader cultural or unique interpersonal dynamics. This means the bots risk leaving gaps or proving oversensitive.“We don’t know when AI will break the ‘story understanding’ frontier,” Subirana said.He added that if employees’ correspondence gets flagged, it can create a climate of distrust, and offenders may learn how to trick the software. Alternatively, offenders could resort to other mediums of communication that are not monitored by the bots.A further concern is protecting the confidentiality of the data that is collected. Subirana said if the software made a mistake and the data was leaked, internal communications between employees could be seen by rival companies.“There are still hurdles to jump before AI can do what we think it can,” Subirana said. “I haven’t heard of any HR who has said it is useful for this yet.”He is not the only sceptic. Sam Smethers, the chief executive of the Fawcett Society, a women’s rights NGO, pointed out there could be unforeseen consequences from policing staff’s communications.“We would want to look carefully at how the technology is being developed, who is behind it, and whether the approach taken is informed by a workplace culture that is seeking to prevent harassment and promote equality, or whether it is in fact just another way to control their employees,” she said.“It has implications for the privacy of staff and could be abused”, she added. She suggested educating staff about appropriate attitudes and behaviours would be more effective in protecting potential victims.He added that believing communications were being monitored could make people less prone to harass colleagues, in a placebo known as the Hawthorne effect. “There is a preventive element here,” he said.Similar technology is being used to retrospectively scour large volumes of digital communications to fight harassment claims.One law firm using the technology is Morgan Lewis, which specialises in US employee and labour practice. But instead of monitoring employees, the AI is used to analyse clients’ past communications.“We’ve used this in dozens of cases,” said Tess Blair, a partner at the firm. She said the tech usually helped build a case rather than providing the smoking gun.Another AI startup, Spot, has created a chatbot that allows employees to anonymously report sexual harassment allegations. It is trained to give advice and asks sensitive questions to further an investigation into the alleged harassment, which may have played out digitally or physically. Spot aims to account for gaps in HR teams’ abilities to deal with such issues sensitively, while also preserving anonymity.These variants of AI could work together to detect workplace harassment more effectively, Blair said. Tools such as Spot can be deployed before lawyers or HR staff are involved. If a full investigation proceeds, technology like Morgan Lewis’s can analyse their clients’ digital communications to build a case.But however good the #MeTooBots become, Blair sees their role as assistants to humans rather than an all-seeing judge, jury and executioner.“Computers are not value-judging, they are saying ‘this doesn’t fit the pattern’,” she said. “It is then up to us to interpret.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6d706a50270df8529ae44394ca65cb80dada0c58/0_271_10668_6403/master/10668.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=15980679800299771969f9e64afab69f","title":"mike pence iran 911 suleimani","story":"In a series of tweets, US vice-president falsely claims Iran general assisted in travel of terrorists behind September 11 attacksIn defense of his administration’s decision to assassinate Qassem Suleimani, Mike Pence has been promoting conspiracy theories that link September 11 terrorists to Iran.In a series of tweets, the US vice-president called Suleimani “an evil man who was responsible for killing thousands of Americans”. Among other things, Pence insisted that the general “assisted in the clandestine travel to Afghanistan of 10 of the 12 terrorists who carried out the September 11 terrorist attacks in the United States”, misstating the number of 911 hijackers – there were 19 – and insinuating Suleimani’s involvement despite a lack of evidence.The official 911 commission report found there was “no evidence that Iran or Hezbollah was aware of the planning for what later became the 911 attack”, and that 15 out of the 19 hijackers were from Saudi Arabia, and the remainder were from the United Arab Emirates, Lebanon and Egypt. Moreover, Suleimani’s name is never mentioned in the nearly 600-page report.Experts have also pointed out that Suleimani, a Shia leader, would have been an unlikely ally to the Sunni militants that carried out the attacks. This isn’t the first time that the Trump administration and supporters have promoted a link between al-Qaida – the group that launched the 911 attack – and Iran. Insisting that these groups are in cahoots could be key in legally justifying a war against Iran.A 2001 law allows the president “to use all necessary and appropriate force against those nations, organizations, or persons he determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001, or harbored such organizations or persons” – without waiting for congressional approval.Though Iran, and its proxy group Hezbollah in Lebanon, has cooperated with al-Qaida before, both the 911 commission report and a 2018 study by the New America thinktank, based on roughly 470,000 declassified files found that the groups didn’t work together to commit terrorist acts.Despite criticism from policy experts, Pence’s press secretary, Kate Walderman, later doubled down on the claim that Suleimani somehow assisted the 911 hijackers, but did not offer evidence."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4129770.1578070049!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"james joyce centre irish georgian society oppose dublin co living project","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe new development will sit near the James Joyce centre, second from left, on Dublin’s North Great George’s street. Photograph: GoogleTwo cultural and heritage organisations have become involved in a planning row over plans to convert a building in Dublin’s north inner city into a co-living scheme for more than 130 people.The James Joyce Cultural Centre and the Irish Georgian Society are among a number of parties which have appealed the recent decision of Dublin City Council to grant planning permission for the demolition of an existing warehouse between North Great George’s Street and Hill Street to facilitate the construction of a shared accommodation facility.It will provide 132 bedspaces, 105 of which are designed for a single person.Communal kitchens and living spaces will be provided on the majority of floors.The proposed development is located close to the Bakery development at the junction of Gardiner Street and Parnell Street, which is due to provide more than 250 student bedspaces.The promoters of the scheme said there was a growing popularity for the shared accommodation model which was “driven by shifting consumer preferences with an increased appreciation of experience versus ownership as well as by a growing sense of loneliness and disconnection among young people that co-living helps address”.They claimed interest in co-living had been demonstrated by an “explosion” in internet searches about such accommodation over the past five years.\u0027Built heritage\u0027However, the James Joyce Cultural Centre, which is located on North Great George’s Street, said it was concerned the project represented an intense redevelopment of a site that could “have a negative impact on the built heritage of the area”.The centre said it was a key cultural amenity, as well as a building of architectural significance and a visitor attraction in the heart of the north inner city and the impact on its operations had to be considered.It claimed the proposed development had the potential for significant overbearing and overshadowing of the cultural centre.While the main entrance to the shared accommodation scheme is via Hill Street, the centre said a proposed pedestrian entrance at the side of its building on North Great George’s Street would create noise and security issues.It also raised concerns about the removal of a boundary wall, which it claimed could affect the structural stability of the visitor centre.While the Irish Georgian Society acknowledged that the site of the proposed development could be enhanced by a sensitively designed project, it has objected to the height and scale of the proposed shared accommodation facility because of its impact on the character and setting of protected structures on North Great George’s Street which is located in a conservation area.A ruling on the case is due by the end of April."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Department will contest Data Protection Commissioner\u0026rsquos decision in courtOwen Keegan says land not appropriate for housing, wants funds for

frustration” among staff.Unions asked that senior staff in the Central Bank be forced to give up their offices to help tackle a growing capacity crisis at its recently constructed €140 million headquarters.A shortage of desk space at the new building, which the bank moved to in 2017, has sparked a major industrial relations battle within the Central Bank. Union sources said 800 staff had been put on desk-sharing arrangements known as “hot desking”, with hundreds more to be placed on the system in the new year.Letters to management in the Central Bank from trade union Unite, seen by The , warn of “damage to productivity” and a “huge amount of frustration” among staff, with unions claiming the bank is in breach of agreements on desk-sharing signed when the Central Bank moved from its old headquarters on Dame Street in the city centre.One letter sent in July of 2019 outlines a range of measures Unite wants management to take, including “that isional and senior management vacate all personal offices, as a show of solidarity with colleagues across the bank, enabling such offices to be used more productively by staff”. It also suggested the bank formally move to a policy allowing staff to work two days per week from home, and that staff be allowed to choose to perform normal duties at weekends if they so wish. The bank rejected these suggestions, later correspondence reveals. Working patternsThere are currently 1,500 desks in the Central Bank, but unions estimate staff numbers are as high as 1,800 with a further several hundred contractors also operating in the building. The bank has argued that working patterns mean these workers will never be in the office all at the same time, and therefore has introduced a system whereby there are 100 desks for every 120 workers. This system is operated by managers who assign desks on a day-by-day basis within the same general area. A spokeswoman for the bank said “We acknowledge that it takes a little getting used to this new way of working. But we are very confident in the adaptability of our staff to operate the new arrangement effectively.” However, the changes have caused deep disquiet among some staff, who have asked their union to step in. “The implementation of hot desking has already led to a large amount of concern expressed to us by staff, who are experiencing damage to productivity and difficulty in collaborating with team members, as well as a huge amount of frustration in engaging with the whole process.”‘Flexibility’ conceptThe matter was referred to the Workplace Relations Commission, with unsuccessful talks held at the end of November. Further talks at the WRC are scheduled for later in January. However, unions believe the situation will be made worse with several hundred more staff set to be asked to take part in hot desking. Stances from the union and the bank in relation to the stand-off are expected to harden, with a bank spokeswoman saying the allocation of workspace is “not a matter of collective agreement between the Central Bank and trade unions”. The spokeswoman said “flexibility” was built into the design for the headquarters at North Wall Quay, which delivers “a modern, progressive and efficient workspace for our staff”. The Central Bank is currently developing a new office in the new Dublin Landings area, immediately to the north of its new headquarters. It will accommodate staff who work in its Spencer Dock office, which is up for sale. The same working practices will then come into place in these offices, the bank said. “This consolidates all our city centre accommodation into one connected campus and the same progressive design principles used in North Wall Quay will be replicated in the Dublin Landings premises.” "},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons december 2019","story":"To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2018 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178.Australia fires: Two dead as country braces for worst day of bushfire crisisAirstrikes kill Iraqi militia near Baghdad one day after attack on Qassim Soleimani - latest newsPaltry fines of as little as £50 for fly-tipping fail to deter criminals, warn councilsPatients less likely to book a GP appointment if the sun is shining - or England is playing Donald Trump ate meatloaf and ice cream as Qassim Soleimani was neutralisedScottish Tory MSP Michelle Ballantyne to stand for party leadership to ensure contest, not coronationDonald Trump says killing of Qassim Soleimani was to \u0026#39stop a war\u0026#39 with Iran Government distances itself from Dominic Cummings\u0026#39 job advert as MPs accuse him of \u0026#39subverting due process\u0026#39Comment: Mr Trump was right to take on Iran – it has given him power over the situationLeave the \u0026#39Love Actually house\u0026#39 alone, says Kensington council after lawyer complains Instagrammers are besieging her £1m homeNHS could deliver blood and chemo kits by droneGolden Globes go vegan - but will the stars ditch their In-N-Out burgers?Repeat offenders spared jail despite up to 60 previous offences, figures reveal amid call for tougher sentencesVegans could legally fight \u0026#39unethical\u0026#39 banknotes following landmark rulingBBC should stop being so \u0026#39wet\u0026#39 and hit back at government criticism, says former press watchdog chief Hopes fade for Northern Ireland powersharing deal after Sinn Féin refuse to back down over Irish language actCynics are wrong to roll their eyes at Dominic CummingsOfficial alert issued over  synthetic opioid in heroin blamed for the deaths of dozens of addicts Airbnb gained technology to judge  \u0026#39narcissism\u0026#39 of guestsLisa Nandy and Jess Philips enter race to succeed Corbyn as Labour leader We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2020/01/03/TELEMMGLPICT000220269904_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"qassim soleimani possible targets irans crushing revenge assassination","story":"Iranians burn a US flag during a demonstration against the assassination in TehranTehran will not leave the killing of its top commanders unanswered, and yesterday vowed crushing revenge over the assassination of General Qassem Soleimani.  The raid dramatically escalated already tense relations between the US and Iran, who have for months been fighting a shadow war.The US is now bracing for a response, though it is unclear yet what form it will take.Iran showed in September with an attack on Saudi Arabia’s biggest oil field that is is capable of sophisticated and long-range attacks from its soil, if US intelligence is to be believed.

No doubt your imagination is filled with a fantasy out of Kevin McCloud\u0027s Grand Designs: all efficient insulation and recycled materials, wooden walls and a green roof.That vision in your mind is the opposite of our house. For one, it is not green but literally yellow: a bizarre choice made by a previous owner whose unusual decisions extend through the rest of the house too, but one fitting for a place that is far from the fresh, clean image that comes with sustainable housing.We hope to repaint the house this year. And we hope to make it a little more green throughout, too: my\u0026nbsppledge for 2020 is to find the ways that our somewhat behind-the-times building can be pulled into the 21st century\u0026nbspand do its bit to avoid any further damage to the environment.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesMy partner and I lack both the means and the ability to undertake any grand plans like the installation of solar panels on the roof or gutting the walls. Instead, I will be looking for the easy wins that we can do ourselves or with minimal cost and input from the outside.We already try to achieve little gains in this respect – for example, I am a dogmatic avoider of leaving the big light on. But there is undoubtedly\u0026nbspmore we can do, both in terms of the house itself and the way we live in it.I\u0027m looking forward to exploring more environmentally friendly ways of dealing with waste, of considering the appliances in our house and the way we use them, of looking into the energy our house uses and how it can be minimised. I\u0027m hopeful too that we can do that without taking ourselves off the grid or avoiding the 21st century, not least because my job as technology editor means using the latest kit.Hopefully, what we will learn will not only help educate us and you the reader about how we can all make improvements, but also help show companies how they can better enable their customers to do so.There are plenty of people, like me, living in old and often rented accommodation where they have limited scope to make improvements. Those people are of course concerned about living without damaging the Earth, too, and so I hope to find ways we can all make our homes a little more sustainable together.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It\u0027s time to start asking what the sporting world can do to prevent global warmingIn 2020 The Independent will be doing more than ever before to try and make the world a better place. When it comes to sport, that’s easier said than done.Sport is our escape, a way to block out the realities of everyday life for 90 minutes, or a few hours, maybe even an entire day. It is supposed to be enjoyed even in defeat, and yet not even sport is exempt from the greatest threat to humankind today: global warming and the negative impact of climate change.But not even sport can continue to ignore the perils that will come to threaten its very existence unless something is done to change the path it is on. After all, how will our children and grandchildren play football, rugby or cricket if there are no parks left, or will the next Lewis Hamilton be uncovered if we can’t find a sustainable way to maintain motorsport without the use of oil, petrol and even electricity?Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThis year we will be delving into how sport affects the surrounding environment, exposing the shocking truths of how it is damaging the world as we know it and highlighting the ways people are trying to bring change for the better.Why will we be doing this? Whether your outlook on global warming is akin to Greta Thunberg or Donald Trump, the truth is that sport has one of the biggest impacts on climate change. Whether it’s the Arsenal squad using a private jet to fly to Norwich, or single-use plastic being used at just about every stadium across the globe, there are endless examples of ignorance when it comes to helping the environment.There will be positives, too. What is Formula E doing to inspire change not just in motorsport but in our everyday commute? What inspired Forest Green Rovers to become the world’s first 100 per cent vegan football club? And are extreme adrenaline sports the answer – they tend to go hand in hand with being at one with the world around us in an effort not to damage it.And if we are to cover all areas of this subject, we will have to take a close look at ourselves too: the media. Is it right that journalists travel all year round aboard the most environmentally damaging transport available in automotive vehicles and aeroplanes, throwing away countless notebooks instead of recycling? If we are to ask the difficult questions, we have to be prepared to answer them too.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The bank also said its gauge of Brexit uncertainty in its monthly Decision Makers’ Panel survey fell to a six-month low in December.Brexit uncertainty will still bedevil the markets in 2020More than half (53 per cent) of firms reported that Brexit was one of their top three sources of uncertainty in December. That was slightly lower compared to the average of the previous three months. However, Brexit-related uncertainty remains well above its average since the referendum.Fears about renewed tensions between London and Brussels undermined the value of the pound. Sterling fell 0.4 per cent against the US dollar and 0.2 against the euro.The drop against the dollar wiped off some of the 7.9 per cent rise in the pound’s exchange rate in the final quarter of the year, which had made it the strongest currency pair in the 2019 rankings by Deutsche Bank.“Much of sterling’s gains came after prime minister Johnson and the EU agreed a new deal in October, and the gains in GBPUSD over the last three months mark the strongest quarterly performance since the second quarter of 2009,” said research analyst Henry Allen.Capital Economics, the London-based consultancy, believes the pound will end 2020 almost 4 per cent higher at $1.35 by the end of the year as the outlook for the UK economy brightens thanks to reduced political uncertainty and a large fiscal boost.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A keeper counts squirrel-monkeys at London Zoo during the annual stocktake.

Flybe said it cancelled 994 flights in the three months to 31 March, compared to 372 in the same period last year.He said continued deglobalisation was one of what he called the “three Ds” — the others being debt and demographics. The demographic\u0026nbsptimebomb is well known — even if no one has adequately dealt with it — and the vast global debt burden of $188 trillion (£143 trillion) is unlikely to be an issue this year as low as interest rates remain low, as most forecasters expect.But deglobalisation is proving to be a major threat to the global economy. Societe\u0026nbspGenerale\u0026nbsp(Soc Gen) has warned that financial globalisation is at a “tipping point”, highlighting the possibility of stagnation and even a slow decline in production links between economies.‘Alarm bells ring’ as factory output falls at fastest rate in 7 yearsSoc Gen, which forecasts global growth slowing from 3.2 per cent to 3.1 per cent between 2020 and 2021, says financial globalisation has slowed significantly. Annual cross-border capital flows have decreased by more than 60 per cent compared to the peak in 2007.There is a similar problem with the trade in goods. According to the World Trade Organisation, its member states slapped protective measures on $747bn\u0026nbsp(£571bn) of goods in the year to October, a 27 per cent annual increase and the largest since 2012.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Any number below 50\u0026nbspsignifies contraction and the index has now been below that point for eight months in a row.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“The pace of manufacturing’s decline in December will set alarm bells ringing,” said Duncan Brock, group director at CIPS. “Production levels sank at their fastest levels since July 2012 and with no sign of immediate recovery in sight.”The level of new work received declined for the eighth successive month in December as inflows weakened from both domestic and overseas clients.Created with Sketch.

New export business fell for the second month running.The drop in activity has fed through to job numbers as manufacturers cut employment for the ninth month\u0026nbspin a row.Job losses were registered across the consumer, intermediate and investment goods sectors and at companies of all sizes.“This impact trickled down to job creation strategies, as the pace of job losses intensified and companies were reluctant to commit to additional expense,” Mr Brock said.Mr Brock said although the result of the general election would bring some “clarity” to businesses, he warned that manufacturers faced a long road ahead to recover last year\u0027s losses. “In the closing stages of the year, the sector has ended on a dreary note,” he said. “There will still be some obstacles to overcome in 2020.”Manufacturers to end 2019 at ‘standstill’ over Brexit uncertaintyFhaheen Khan, senior economist at Make UK, the manufacturing and engineering employers’ organisation, said uncertainties over the outcome of Brexit, the outcome of the general election, and global trade tensions had “clearly weighed on” the UK’s manufacturing sector.However, CIPS said business sentiment remained positive in December with more than 43 per cent of companies forecasting output would be higher a year from now, compared to only 10 per cent anticipating a contraction. The optimism was linked to reduced uncertainty, new product launches, increased efficiency and improved client confidence, it said.The downbeat picture was reflected in the eurozone where the equivalent index dropped from 46.9 in November to 46.3 in December, marking an eleventh successive month of contraction. Germany was again the weakest-performing country, while the deteriorations seen in Italy and the Netherlands were the sharpest in more than six and a half years.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The bank also said its gauge of Brexit uncertainty in its monthly Decision Makers’ Panel survey fell to a six-month low in December.Brexit uncertainty will still bedevil the markets in 2020More than half (53 per cent) of firms reported that Brexit was one of their top three sources of uncertainty in December. That was slightly lower compared to the average of the previous three months. However, Brexit-related uncertainty remains well above its average since the referendum.Fears about renewed tensions between London and Brussels undermined the value of the pound. Sterling fell 0.4 per cent against the US dollar and 0.2 against the euro.The drop against the dollar wiped off some of the 7.9 per cent rise in the pound’s exchange rate in the final quarter of the year, which had made it the strongest currency pair in the 2019 rankings by Deutsche Bank.“Much of sterling’s gains came after prime minister Johnson and the EU agreed a new deal in October, and the gains in GBPUSD over the last three months mark the strongest quarterly performance since the second quarter of 2009,” said research analyst Henry Allen.Capital Economics, the London-based consultancy, believes the pound will end 2020 almost 4 per cent higher at $1.35 by the end of the year as the outlook for the UK economy brightens thanks to reduced political uncertainty and a large fiscal boost.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A keeper counts squirrel-monkeys at London Zoo during the annual stocktake.

Shopper numbers fell almost 9 per cent on Boxing Day, which used to be a traditional start of the sales, according to retail intelligence firm Springboard.“Consumers are increasingly using Boxing Day primarily for leisure purposes, going out to eat or to the cinema, but possibly combining this with a visit to retail stores rather than shopping being the main focus of the trip,” said Springboard\u0027s insights director Diane Wehrle.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Searches for a number of other related terms threw up similar results.Carolyn Harris, a Labour MP and chair of a cross-party group on gambling-related harm, said the adverts were immoral.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We have suspended the accounts in question.”The company says it uses a combination of humans and algorithms to vet adverts and enforce its rules.But on Friday, after Google provided a statement, at least one gambling advert was still showing close to the top of search results for Gamstop“Don’t miss the chance to have fun again,” the advert read.\u0026nbsp”Find the best sites not on Gamstop\u0026nbsphere.”Gambling adverts have been inappropriately placed on Google searches before. In October, the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) banned an ad for a casino app which targeted customers who googled “How to unsubscribe from all gambling”.Trade body the Betting and Gaming Council called on Google and other search engines to update their gambling blacklists to prevent similar problems emerging again in future.Anyone who sees gambling adverts targeting search results for help with addiction is advised to contact industry regulator the Gambling Commission.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Minding the GapOne of the year’s biggest cinematic curveballs occurs at the midway point of this stirring documentary. Billed as a film about small-town US skate culture, Bing Liu’s Minding the Gap grows into a haunting depiction of class and masculinity, and how once inseparable groups of friends tend to untangle and erge as they come of age. Few of 2019’s films cast quite as long a shadow. Adam WhiteThe Farewell rips your heart out of your chest. Then it hands it back to you, wrapped gently in cotton wool. Director Lulu Wang loosely adapts a chapter in her own life, as we follow a young woman (Awkwafina) travelling back to China to say goodbye to her terminally ill grandmother. Delving into all the intricacies of immigrant identity and family politics, it’s a comedy of warmth and bracing honesty. Clarisse LoughreyAn opportunity for Jordan Peele to cement his status as one of horror’s modern maestros, Us reels us in with old-fashioned thrills. Then it leaves us with the terrible dread of realising we’ve been looking into a mirror this whole time. Lupita Nyong\u0027o delivers two of this year’s best performances in one film, both as our hero and as her sinister doppelgänger – one of an army of “Tethereds” that emerge from underground seeking vengeance. Clarisse LoughreyAll of Pedro Almodovar’s films feel autobiographical in one way or another, but Pain \u0026amp Glory couldn’t be more lived-in if he stepped out in front of the camera to introduce every scene. A lushly romantic ode to cinema, shared history and cruelly interrupted love, it features a career-best performance from Antonio Banderas – Zorro at his most tender and vulnerable. Adam WhiteVox Lux is 2019’s most damning filmic portrait of American culture. We begin with a teenage girl (Raffey Cassidy), who survives a school shooting and ends up a pop star. As an adult, she’s played by a breezy, vicious Natalie Portman. Her strut is one part Sia, two parts Lady Gaga. It’s an ugly, despairing film that comes gift-wrapped in sequins, presenting art as the cavernous pit we throw our traumas into. Clarisse Loughrey620 15. Under the Silver LakeA paranoid puzzle box of a mystery, Under the Silver Lake is far more interested in the directions down the rabbit hole than allowing star Andrew Garfield to crawl his way out of it. That’s also the most pleasurable aspect of David Robert Mitchell’s film, a sunny LA noir which is sinister, hilarious and (potentially ruinously) male. It’s probably 2019’s most polarising film, adored and reviled in equal measure, but undeniably a work of striking creative autonomy. Adam WhiteHigh Life has its silly sub-Barbarella moments (Juliette Binoche testing out the spaceship’s very own orgasmatron machine) and clearly wasn’t made on a Hollywood budget. Nonetheless, veteran French auteur Claire Denis’s first English language film is a typically provocative and subversive affair. Binoche plays Dr Dibs, a scientist on board a ship full of criminals and trying to harvest healthy foetuses. Geoffrey MacnabAd Astra is a space movie with an Oedipal undertow. Brad Pitt gives a fine, understated performance as the introspective astronaut trying to save the world and find his father at the same time. Writer-director James Gray throws in references to Heart of Darkness and Apocalypse Now. This is a slow-moving but beguiling film with an unexpected emotional kick. Geoffrey Macnab920 12. Happy as LazzaroA bee keeper’s daughter, Italian director Alice Rohrwacher is one of European cinema’s visionary young talents. Happy As Lazzaro, her best film yet, is a magical realist fable that combines hard-hitting social comment about the exploitation of rural workers with flights of astonishing lyricism. The film also has one of the best performances of the year from newcomer Adriano Tardiolo, an 18-year-old economics student who plays the holy innocent, Lazzaro, with an ingenuousness which rekindles memories of Peter Sellers in Being There. Geoffrey MacnabBased on a Haruki Murakami’s short story, Burning – from South Korean maestro Lee Chang-dong – is a meditation on dealing with isolation and the tricks being alone might play on your memory. Jong-su (Ah-in Yoo) is forced to play detective when Steven Yeun’s affluent bachelor rolls into town – an event that coincides with the disappearance of a schoolfriend. Burning is a searing drama whose central unanswered mystery unnerves long after the credits role. Jacob StolworthyNews coverage has hardly been short of harrowing, violent footage of the Syrian Civil War. But too often missing are the human moments inbetween the bombings and the bloodshed. In Waad Al-Kateab’s first person account of the uprising’s aftermath, her camera’s gaze never flinches from the horrors it sees – as she and her husband try to maintain a rebel hospital amid a reign of bombing from President al-Assad – but nor does it stop rolling while she falls in love, has a baby, and jokes around with her friends and neighbours. This is the story of ordinary people doing extraordinary things. It is an important, powerful, astonishing documentary. Alex PollardIt feels almost blasphemous to be glad of Julianne Moore stepping down from a role, but Lee Israel – the cantankerous, lonely literary forger who found herself the target of an FBI investigation in the Nineties – feels like a part Melissa McCarthy was born to play. Nimbly directed by Marielle Heller (who was shunned by the Oscars in the Best Director category), Can You Ever Forgive Me? is a sharp, funny and deeply compassionate examination of loneliness and self-destruction. Richard E Grant and Dolly Wells give wonderful supporting performances, too. Alex PollardAs deeply indebted to the teen movie genre as it is formally and narratively rebellious, Booksmart grounds its traditional night-before-graduation plot (teenagers eager to crash a party) in touching character-driven drama. Beanie Feldstein and Kaitlyn Dever, both instant stars, convey the ever-shifting dynamics and heightened dramas of adolescent best-friendship perfectly. Behind the camera, meanwhile, actor-turned-director Olivia Wilde demonstrates a staggering amount of emotional empathy and technical mastery for someone so green. Adam WhiteComparisons to Martin Scorsese’s previous films (Goodfellas, Casino) are unfounded considering The Irishman is unlike any other gangster film you’ll see. With his three-hour-30-minute-long opus, Scorsese places the harsh spotlight on mortality. Instead of tracking the rise of Frank Sheeran (Robert De Niro) from regular family man to seasoned hitman with glitzy panache, we see him shamefully confess his crimes as an elderly man ruminating on his past in a nursing home. The result is an unsettlingly moving character study unafraid to ask the big questions.​Jacob Stolworthy1520 6. Once Upon a Time in HollywoodWith his ninth feature, Quentin Tarantino took a breath and crafted an unhurried, oddly heartwarming fable, one that came with a career-best performance from Brad Pitt. Its release rolled around with the usual smattering of discourse-steering controversy but, for all the complaints about the director’s depiction of his film star subjects, including the scant usage of Margot Robbie as Sharon Tate, the fact remains that Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is one of the filmmaker’s most accomplished films – a free’n’easy sun-soaked delve into Sixties Hollywood, whose much-discussed final 20 minutes provided topics of conversation all summer long. Jacob StolworthyFor too many years the internet was exclusively evil in movies, something for tech boffins to hack, or used to steal Sandra Bullock’s identity. Bo Burnham’s Eighth Grade felt so comparatively real because it felt like the real internet, which has been as toxic and terrifying as it has been helpful to a generation of young people. Elsie Fisher, as a 13-year-old girl chronicling her confidence and anxieties in a vlog, is an adorable delight here, in a film that is devastatingly, heartbreakingly and endearingly human. Adam WhiteYorgos Lanthimos’s delightful, subversive vision has shaken the cobwebs out of costume drama. Set in the 18th century, it follows a trio of women – two cousins, Sarah (Rachel Weisz) and Abigail (Emma Stone), and the ruling Queen Anne (Olivia Colman) – as they vie for power over each other and England. Desire, savagery, and manipulative vulnerability all become weapons in the hands of those who have no choice but to fight dirty. But, then, Colman’s childless, gout-ridden Queen Anne tenderly reveals her shattered soul – it’s an Academy Award-winning performance that brings a slice of tragedy to an otherwise sublime farce. Clarisse LoughreyThe marriage of disparate talents united to ensure If Beale Street Could Talk is worthy of mention alongside Barry Jenkins’ previous film, Moonlight – The Independent’s film of the decade. With his film, Jenkins takes the words of James Baldwin and translates them into visual poetry. From Nicholas Britell’s mesmerising score to Regina King’s towering supporting performance (that Oscar was well deserved), the result is a creative tour de force. Jacob StolworthyHere is a love story about orce. Noah Baumbach writes and directs this aching, empathetic depiction of a couple whose marriage has fallen apart. As ruthless orce lawyers driving a wedge between two people already hanging by a thread, Ray Liotta and Laura Dern are magnificent, while Scarlett Johansson gives her best performance in years as a woman trying to do the right thing without knowing what that is. But the real star is Adam Driver, who – hulking as he is – makes himself seem small and fragile. For his rendition of Sondheim’s “Being Alive” alone, Marriage Story deserves all the awards coming its way. Alex PollardGreta Gerwig’s adaptation of Louisa May Alcott’s 1868 novel – the story of four Massachusetts sisters coming of age during the American Civil War – may be a period piece, but there is nothing staid or stuffy about it. The girls, played by Saoirse Ronan, Florence Pugh, Emma Watson and Eliza Scanlen, talk and clamber over one another, their hair messy, their dresses scorched, their ambitions unfettered. It is a lively, profound adaptation. Alexandre Desplat provides the exuberant score, and Yorick La Saux’s cinematography is lush and textured. “I didn’t want it to be beautiful at the expense of being real,” said Gerwig. “But I did want it to feel like you wish you can jump inside and live in there or eat it. I remember trying to explain that to the gaffer, who was like, ‘You want what?’ I was like, ‘I want them to want to eat it.’” And how delicious it is. Alex Pollard120 20.

Billed as a film about small-town US skate culture, Bing Liu’s Minding the Gap grows into a haunting depiction of class and masculinity, and how once inseparable groups of friends tend to untangle and erge as they come of age. Few of 2019’s films cast quite as long a shadow. Adam WhiteThe Farewell rips your heart out of your chest. Then it hands it back to you, wrapped gently in cotton wool. Director Lulu Wang loosely adapts a chapter in her own life, as we follow a young woman (Awkwafina) travelling back to China to say goodbye to her terminally ill grandmother. Delving into all the intricacies of immigrant identity and family politics, it’s a comedy of warmth and bracing honesty. Clarisse LoughreyAn opportunity for Jordan Peele to cement his status as one of horror’s modern maestros, Us reels us in with old-fashioned thrills. Then it leaves us with the terrible dread of realising we’ve been looking into a mirror this whole time. Lupita Nyong\u0027o delivers two of this year’s best performances in one film, both as our hero and as her sinister doppelgänger – one of an army of “Tethereds” that emerge from underground seeking vengeance. Clarisse LoughreyAll of Pedro Almodovar’s films feel autobiographical in one way or another, but Pain \u0026amp Glory couldn’t be more lived-in if he stepped out in front of the camera to introduce every scene. A lushly romantic ode to cinema, shared history and cruelly interrupted love, it features a career-best performance from Antonio Banderas – Zorro at his most tender and vulnerable. Adam WhiteVox Lux is 2019’s most damning filmic portrait of American culture. We begin with a teenage girl (Raffey Cassidy), who survives a school shooting and ends up a pop star. As an adult, she’s played by a breezy, vicious Natalie Portman. Her strut is one part Sia, two parts Lady Gaga. It’s an ugly, despairing film that comes gift-wrapped in sequins, presenting art as the cavernous pit we throw our traumas into. Clarisse Loughrey620 15. Under the Silver LakeA paranoid puzzle box of a mystery, Under the Silver Lake is far more interested in the directions down the rabbit hole than allowing star Andrew Garfield to crawl his way out of it. That’s also the most pleasurable aspect of David Robert Mitchell’s film, a sunny LA noir which is sinister, hilarious and (potentially ruinously) male. It’s probably 2019’s most polarising film, adored and reviled in equal measure, but undeniably a work of striking creative autonomy. Adam WhiteHigh Life has its silly sub-Barbarella moments (Juliette Binoche testing out the spaceship’s very own orgasmatron machine) and clearly wasn’t made on a Hollywood budget. Nonetheless, veteran French auteur Claire Denis’s first English language film is a typically provocative and subversive affair. Binoche plays Dr Dibs, a scientist on board a ship full of criminals and trying to harvest healthy foetuses. Geoffrey MacnabAd Astra is a space movie with an Oedipal undertow. Brad Pitt gives a fine, understated performance as the introspective astronaut trying to save the world and find his father at the same time. Writer-director James Gray throws in references to Heart of Darkness and Apocalypse Now. This is a slow-moving but beguiling film with an unexpected emotional kick. Geoffrey Macnab920 12. Happy as LazzaroA bee keeper’s daughter, Italian director Alice Rohrwacher is one of European cinema’s visionary young talents. Happy As Lazzaro, her best film yet, is a magical realist fable that combines hard-hitting social comment about the exploitation of rural workers with flights of astonishing lyricism. The film also has one of the best performances of the year from newcomer Adriano Tardiolo, an 18-year-old economics student who plays the holy innocent, Lazzaro, with an ingenuousness which rekindles memories of Peter Sellers in Being There. Geoffrey MacnabBased on a Haruki Murakami’s short story, Burning – from South Korean maestro Lee Chang-dong – is a meditation on dealing with isolation and the tricks being alone might play on your memory. Jong-su (Ah-in Yoo) is forced to play detective when Steven Yeun’s affluent bachelor rolls into town – an event that coincides with the disappearance of a schoolfriend. Burning is a searing drama whose central unanswered mystery unnerves long after the credits role. Jacob StolworthyNews coverage has hardly been short of harrowing, violent footage of the Syrian Civil War. But too often missing are the human moments inbetween the bombings and the bloodshed. In Waad Al-Kateab’s first person account of the uprising’s aftermath, her camera’s gaze never flinches from the horrors it sees – as she and her husband try to maintain a rebel hospital amid a reign of bombing from President al-Assad – but nor does it stop rolling while she falls in love, has a baby, and jokes around with her friends and neighbours. This is the story of ordinary people doing extraordinary things. It is an important, powerful, astonishing documentary. Alex PollardIt feels almost blasphemous to be glad of Julianne Moore stepping down from a role, but Lee Israel – the cantankerous, lonely literary forger who found herself the target of an FBI investigation in the Nineties – feels like a part Melissa McCarthy was born to play. Nimbly directed by Marielle Heller (who was shunned by the Oscars in the Best Director category), Can You Ever Forgive Me? is a sharp, funny and deeply compassionate examination of loneliness and self-destruction. Richard E Grant and Dolly Wells give wonderful supporting performances, too. Alex PollardAs deeply indebted to the teen movie genre as it is formally and narratively rebellious, Booksmart grounds its traditional night-before-graduation plot (teenagers eager to crash a party) in touching character-driven drama. Beanie Feldstein and Kaitlyn Dever, both instant stars, convey the ever-shifting dynamics and heightened dramas of adolescent best-friendship perfectly. Behind the camera, meanwhile, actor-turned-director Olivia Wilde demonstrates a staggering amount of emotional empathy and technical mastery for someone so green. Adam WhiteComparisons to Martin Scorsese’s previous films (Goodfellas, Casino) are unfounded considering The Irishman is unlike any other gangster film you’ll see. With his three-hour-30-minute-long opus, Scorsese places the harsh spotlight on mortality. Instead of tracking the rise of Frank Sheeran (Robert De Niro) from regular family man to seasoned hitman with glitzy panache, we see him shamefully confess his crimes as an elderly man ruminating on his past in a nursing home. The result is an unsettlingly moving character study unafraid to ask the big questions.​Jacob Stolworthy1520 6. Once Upon a Time in HollywoodWith his ninth feature, Quentin Tarantino took a breath and crafted an unhurried, oddly heartwarming fable, one that came with a career-best performance from Brad Pitt. Its release rolled around with the usual smattering of discourse-steering controversy but, for all the complaints about the director’s depiction of his film star subjects, including the scant usage of Margot Robbie as Sharon Tate, the fact remains that Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is one of the filmmaker’s most accomplished films – a free’n’easy sun-soaked delve into Sixties Hollywood, whose much-discussed final 20 minutes provided topics of conversation all summer long. Jacob StolworthyFor too many years the internet was exclusively evil in movies, something for tech boffins to hack, or used to steal Sandra Bullock’s identity. Bo Burnham’s Eighth Grade felt so comparatively real because it felt like the real internet, which has been as toxic and terrifying as it has been helpful to a generation of young people. Elsie Fisher, as a 13-year-old girl chronicling her confidence and anxieties in a vlog, is an adorable delight here, in a film that is devastatingly, heartbreakingly and endearingly human. Adam WhiteYorgos Lanthimos’s delightful, subversive vision has shaken the cobwebs out of costume drama. Set in the 18th century, it follows a trio of women – two cousins, Sarah (Rachel Weisz) and Abigail (Emma Stone), and the ruling Queen Anne (Olivia Colman) – as they vie for power over each other and England. Desire, savagery, and manipulative vulnerability all become weapons in the hands of those who have no choice but to fight dirty. But, then, Colman’s childless, gout-ridden Queen Anne tenderly reveals her shattered soul – it’s an Academy Award-winning performance that brings a slice of tragedy to an otherwise sublime farce. Clarisse LoughreyThe marriage of disparate talents united to ensure If Beale Street Could Talk is worthy of mention alongside Barry Jenkins’ previous film, Moonlight – The Independent’s film of the decade. With his film, Jenkins takes the words of James Baldwin and translates them into visual poetry. From Nicholas Britell’s mesmerising score to Regina King’s towering supporting performance (that Oscar was well deserved), the result is a creative tour de force. Jacob StolworthyHere is a love story about orce. Noah Baumbach writes and directs this aching, empathetic depiction of a couple whose marriage has fallen apart. As ruthless orce lawyers driving a wedge between two people already hanging by a thread, Ray Liotta and Laura Dern are magnificent, while Scarlett Johansson gives her best performance in years as a woman trying to do the right thing without knowing what that is. But the real star is Adam Driver, who – hulking as he is – makes himself seem small and fragile. For his rendition of Sondheim’s “Being Alive” alone, Marriage Story deserves all the awards coming its way. Alex PollardGreta Gerwig’s adaptation of Louisa May Alcott’s 1868 novel – the story of four Massachusetts sisters coming of age during the American Civil War – may be a period piece, but there is nothing staid or stuffy about it. The girls, played by Saoirse Ronan, Florence Pugh, Emma Watson and Eliza Scanlen, talk and clamber over one another, their hair messy, their dresses scorched, their ambitions unfettered. It is a lively, profound adaptation. Alexandre Desplat provides the exuberant score, and Yorick La Saux’s cinematography is lush and textured. “I didn’t want it to be beautiful at the expense of being real,” said Gerwig. “But I did want it to feel like you wish you can jump inside and live in there or eat it. I remember trying to explain that to the gaffer, who was like, ‘You want what?’ I was like, ‘I want them to want to eat it.’” And how delicious it is.

He’s flying down from San Francisco and it’s going to be at least 45 minutes until he gets here.’”Hamlin said Spielberg then asked the actors to bake a chocolate cake for Lucas in the production studio’s kitchen while they waited for him to arrive.“He closed the door and left and we were standing alone in this kitchen,” Hamlin said, explaining that they then spent 40 minutes talking as they attempted to make a cake without instructions.Created with Sketch.30 times things went wrong on film and TV sets Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.130 Margot Robbie – The Wolf of Wall StreetThe actor says that acting in the scene where she has sex with Leonardo DiCaprio on a bed of money was really painful in The Wolf of Wall Street. “I got a million paper cuts on my back from all that money! It\u0027s not as glamorous as it sounds,” she said. “If anyone is ever planning on having sex on top of a pile of cash: don\u0027t. Or maybe real money is a bit softer, but the fake money is like paper, and when I got up off the bed, I turned around to get my robe and everyone gasped. I said, \u0027What is it?\u0027 And they said, \u0027You look like you\u0027ve been whipped a million times. Your back is covered in a thousand red scratches.”During the filming of the sequel to Steven Spielberg’s Jaws, cast members were terrified when real hammerhead sharks started circling them in the sea. The trouble was that their screams went unheard. The crew didn’t think they were in real danger to start with because it was written into the script that they yelled for help at that point.330 Sylvester Stallone and Dolph Lundgren – Rocky IVThe fourth in the Rocky film franchise to focus on the boxing career of the fictional Rocky Balboa, played by Sylvester Stallone, has some gripping and authentic-looking fight scenes. It’s no wonder then that during filming, Stallone actually asked Dolph Lundgren, who plays his opponent, Ivan Drago, to try to knock him out for real. But Lundgren hit him with such force that he was sent to the hospital and was in intensive care for over a week.Brando was infamous for his bad on-set behaviour. That is one reason why Paramount was nervous about getting him involved in Francis Ford Coppola’s mafia film. It didn’t start well, when on the first day of shooting, the actor who played the patriarch in the family, Vito Corleone, missed his overnight flight from LA to New York. His scene was rescheduled for the next day, but it cost producers $40,000.In his autobiography, rapper Gucci Mane said he was so tired on set of Harmony Korine’s crime film Spring Breakers, that he fell asleep during his big sex scene. The rapper, who plays Big Arch, a rival drug dealer of James Franco’s Alien character in the film, is seen having sex with one woman, while another sucks his toes. “I couldn’t keep my eyes open. I was knocked out, snoring . . . Harmony kept having to wake me up for takes.” In another interview, he explained why he was so exhausted. “I had a concert down there in St Petersburg, Florida, one of the days I had to shoot a scene. Same night. We started shooting at 10 o\u0027clock in the evening until 1 or 2 o\u0027clock.”The action star broke his ankle while doing his own stunt on set of the sixth Mission Impossible. The scene sees Cruise completing a fast rooftop jump from one building to another, when his foot slams into the side of the wall. But instead of collapsing in a heap, he keeps going as if nothing has happened, until the end of the scene when he can be seen hobbling away. He said: “I knew instantly my ankle was broken and I really didn’t want to do it again so just got up and carried on with the take. I said, ‘It’s broken. That’s a wrap. Take me to hospital’ and then everyone got on the phone and made their vacation arrangement.”730 Lizzy Caplan and Michael Sheen – Masters of SexCaplan was nervous when she had to take her clothes off in front of co-star Sheen in the TV series. It made her feel better that they were both shaky. But then disaster struck. “And we complete the scene, I place the hand on my breast and they yell “Cut” and he immediately walks over to a garbage can and throws up.“ Turns out Sheen had eaten something that upset his stomach, but Caplan didn\u0027t know that. She said: ”My whole self-confidence plummeted to the ground and I realised that I\u0027m a monster and anybody who touches me will immediately start vomiting and that’s just the way it\u0027s going to be.”830 Nina Dobrev and Paul Wesley – The Vampire DiariesNina Dobrev accidentally broke Paul Wesley\u0027s finger while shooting a sex scene in The Vampire Diaries.930 Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan - 50 Shades of GreyObviously this could be a load of hype to promote the first erotic film in the franchise, but there were certainly a lot of terrible sex scenes in which things could go wrong. Johnson, who plays Anastasia Steele, becomes romantically linked to Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan) and they act out their BDSM desires. Johnson, who wore a modesty thong glued to her body while Dornan wore a “wee bag” to protect his modesty, said: “I got whiplash once from him throwing me on the bed. So f***ing painful. I wish we had a gag reel from the shoot.”Michael Imperioli is best known for his role as Tony Soprano’s protégé, Christopher Moltisanti in The Sopranos. During the filming of his death scene in Martin Scorsese’s Goodfellas, Imperioli cut his hand on a glass and was taken to hospital, where the doctors sped in to treat his fake bullet wounds.During the filming of Groundhog Day, Murray was more irritable than usual as he was going through a orce and was prone to disappearing from set. He had been asked to get an assistant to ease communication between him, the director Harold Raims and the studio. He was against the idea, so he hired somebody who was deaf and spoke only in sign language, which nobody on set, including Murray, could understand. Ramis said: “Bill said, ‘Don’t worry, I\u0027m going to learn sign language.’ And I think it was so inconvenient that in a couple of weeks, he gave that up. That’s anti-communication, you know? Let’s not talk.”It was a small mishap for Dunham when her nude patch kept falling off in scenes that required nudity. Dunham, who plays aspiring writer Hannah in her comedy-drama TV series Girls, said: “I stopped wearing the nude patch after the first season of Girls. There’s not one guy who works on that show who hasn’t seen the inside of my vagina. You glue it over your vagina. It gets sweaty and always falls off. My male co-stars, at the end of the day, don’t care.”In one scene of Quentin Tarantino’s 2015 Western thriller, Jennifer Jason Leigh as Daisy Domergue plays a guitar. It is a vintage Martin guitar from the 19th century, worth roughly $40,000, which had been loaned out from the Martin Museum in Pennsylvania. But a misunderstanding on Russell’s part led to an expensive mistake. The valuable guitar was meant to be swapped over with a replica prop when he snatched it from her. Russell had not read the memo, though, and smashed the antique guitar against a wall, while shouting “Music time is over”. As a result, the Martin Museum – which called the guitar a priceless, irreplaceable artefact – vowed never to loan guitars out to movies again.1430  Robert Pattinson and Julianne Moore – Maps to the StarsThe Twilight and Lost City of Z actor played Jerome, a limousine driver and struggling actor, in David Cronenberg’s acerbic Hollywood satire. It was while he got intimate in the back of a car with Moore’s character, a washed-up actress, that he ran into problems and started sweating profusely. “I sweat like a f***ing crazy person,” he said. “I was trying to literally catch drops of sweat to stop them hitting her back. Afterwards she was like, \u0027Are you having a panic attack?\u0027 It was so embarrassing.”1530 Anne Hathaway and Jake Gyllenhaal - Love and other DrugsHathaway accidentally stripped off too soon when she thought cameras were rolling during the filming of Love and other Drugs. She stars alongside Jake Gyllenhaal in the erotic film based on the non-fiction book Hard Sell: The Evolution of a Viagra Salesman by Jamie Reidy. “I have to remove my trench coat and be nude underneath, and I thought we were filming,” she said. “But it turned out we were just rehearsing and I got unnecessarily naked in front of a lot of people!”In a 2007 episode of the reboot of Battlestar Galactica TV series, Olmos’s character William Adama, the commanding officer of BS Galactica, is playing around with a model ship when he gets carried away by improvising and smashes it to smithereens. The model ship was, however, museum quality and according to Olmos, who had no idea at the time, it was worth roughly $200,000.1730 Allison Janney and Michael Lerner in Life During WartimeDuring a sex scene against a wall for the 2009 comedy-drama, Allison Jamey\u0027s co-star Michael Lerner went crashing to the ground. “We had to have sex up against a wall and they started spraying us with glistening stuff to make us look sweaty, but no one seemed to realise that we were standing on a marble floor,” she said. “They said ‘Action’ and he pulled me up against the wall and his feet slipped out from under him and he went crashing down on the floor. It was terrible, but it was one of those moments I\u0027ll never forget.”1830 Ryan Reynolds and Olivia Wilde in The Change-UpThe Deadpool star was taken aback when his co-star Olivia Wilde painted smiley faces on her underwear during a sex scene, that he completely forgot what he was doing. “In the scene, she’s sitting there and I take her top off and the bra off, and she has those panties on, but she’s drawn these adorable little smiley faces on them,” he said. “And I forget every line. Not just from this movie, but from every other movie I’ve done.”1930 Sean Connery and Lana Turner – Another Time, Another PlaceSean Connery and the American actress Lana Turner were filming a love scene when Turner’s gangster boyfriend Johnny Stompanato showed up uninvited. Turner was playing an American journalist who has a love affair with a BBC war correspondent (played by Connery). But her boyfriend was so jealous that he showed up with a gun in his hand, and threatened to kill Connery. Bravely, Connery grabbed the gun from his hand and twisted the boyfriend’s wrist until he fled off the set. Turner’s turbulent life continued when her daughter Cheryl killed Stompanato with a kitchen knife fearing that he was going to kill her mother after he showed up at their house in the US – but in the trial it was deemed as justifiable homicide.2030 Christian Serratos and Michael Cudlitz - The Walking DeadThe long-running TV show focuses more on blood and violence than sex. But during one scene between Rosita (Christian Serratos) and Abraham (Michael Cudlitz) things nearly went pear-shaped when they had to get intimate in front of 30 crew members, who  were drinking coffee and eating ramen noodles. Cudlitz, who was on top of Serratos, said they were nearly naked but covered – but then as they were “humping”, the cover got knocked off, leaving Serratos practically naked. The actor said: “Then we just started laughing, because it\u0027s ridiculous. It\u0027s two people, we barely know each other, lying on top of each other naked.”During the filming of Blazing Saddles, a man wandered into a scene of the film. He wasn’t part of the crew or cast but when the director Mel Brooks got the man moved on, he returned again, seemingly not understanding the request. Brooks then sent over a waiver for him to sign and left him in the movie for a laugh. He can be spotted at the end of the film wearing a jumper and standing on a sidewalk watching the action as people run out of the Warner Brothers studio front gates.Not really a mishap, but it was certainly an awkward moment behind the camera for the then 17-year-old actor, who legally had to have his mother on set for his first-ever sex scene, in which he says, “It’s in. Oh, my God, it’s in.” “She got there, and I had fake sexual intercourse in front of her,” Mintz-Plasse said. “Afterwards we didn\u0027t talk about it we still don\u0027t speak about that moment.”2330 Sylvester Stallone and Sharon Stone – The SpecialistStallone and Stone had absolutely no chemistry in the 1994 American spy thriller, but when the Basic Instinct star refused to get naked for the shower scene, it was potentially a huge problem. Stallone admitted they had to get drunk on vodka for filming to even start. “Ok. Let it be known, I didn’t want this scene because Sharon was not cooperating. We get to the set and she decided not to take off her robe off. The director asks only a few of the crew to remain, and she still won’t take it off. I promised her I wouldn’t take any liberties, so what’s the problem? She said, ‘I’m just sick of nudity.’ I asked her if she could get sick of it on somebody else’s film. She was having none of it, so I went down to my trailer, bought back a bottle of Black Death vodka that was given to me by Michael Douglas and after half-a-dozen shots we were wet and wild.”2430 Margot Robbie and Alexander Skarsgard – The Legend of TarzanApparently Robbie – who plays Jane - punched her Tarzan co-star Skarsgard after getting carried away during the filming of their climatic sex scene. The director David Yates asked them to be a little more violently passionate. “I didn’t injure Alexander,” she said. “And I didn’t punch him in the face, at least not hard. But he’s a pretty strong guy. He can take it. We just got carried away a bit.”Cavill says he had to “apologise profusely” after he got aroused on set, adding that “It had only happened to him once”. “A girl had to be on top of me, she had spectacular breasts and I hadn\u0027t rearranged my stuff into a harmless position. She\u0027s basically rubbing herself all over me and, um, it got a bit hard.” He claimed there was nothing sexy about onscreen sex scenes. “All you’re doing is smacking your nuts against someone and nothing is going in.” But he added: “It’s not great when you’re in a professional acting environment and somebody gets a boner, is it?” It’s not just Henry Cavill who got aroused during filming a sex scene. Metcalfe, who played John Rowland, experienced the same issue during his first onscreen sex scene with Eva Longoria’s Gabrielle Solis. He said: “We were rehearsing and then the director was like, \u0027OK, get out of bed, we have to reset the set\u0027, and I was like, \u0027I need a minute.\u0027“ He added: “It doesn\u0027t happen that frequently” because ”there are a lot of people on set, and it can be very technical, but it happens from time to time.2730 Christopher Guest and Cary Elwes – The Princess BrideWhen you see the dashing Westley (Cary Elwes) fall to the ground unconscious during a fight scene in Rob Reiner’s The Princess Bride, it really happened. Christopher Guest, who was playing Count Tyrone Rugen, knocked Elwes out by accident, when he hit him on the head with the butt of his sword. Elwes also broke his toe during the first week of filming when he was “messing around” between scenes on co-star Andre the Giant’s all-terrain vehicle. But the actor, who was in his first major role, hid the injury for the rest of the film as best he could. “I was limping a bit, you can see it in some of the scenes – you can see that I was limping into the fire swamp (during a scene with Robin Wright).”The star was filming the scene in which he storms off after he discovers Craig Schwartz (John Cusack) has been renting out his brain to strangers. According to the director, Spike Jonze, a drunk extra then threw a beer can from a moving car at his head while shouting “Hey Malkovich, think fast!” Jonze liked the scene so much that he left it in the film. The extra had his day rate bumped up to $700 a day because he had a speaking role.2930 Viggo Mortensen – The Lord of the RingsWhen Aragon (Mortensen) thinks that two of the hobbits are dead in a scene in The Two Towers, he lets out a gigantic primeval cry as he kicks his helmet in anger and falls to the floor. This behaviour would seem like an appropriate response to the grief his character feels but in reality, the actor had actually broken two toes while kicking his helmet.3030 The entire cast of RoarBut whatever the mishap, nothing can surely be as bad as it was on set for director Noel Marshall’s family, who were cast in his 1981 adventure comedy film Roar? During filming, his then wife Tippi Hendren and her daughter Melanie Griffith, as well as his two sons, John and Jerry, were mauled by lions. Heddren suffered multiple scalp wounds while Marshall was bitten so many times, he ended up hospitalised with gangrene.130 Margot Robbie – The Wolf of Wall StreetThe actor says that acting in the scene where she has sex with Leonardo DiCaprio on a bed of money was really painful in The Wolf of Wall Street. “I got a million paper cuts on my back from all that money! It\u0027s not as glamorous as it sounds,” she said. “If anyone is ever planning on having sex on top of a pile of cash: don\u0027t. Or maybe real money is a bit softer, but the fake money is like paper, and when I got up off the bed, I turned around to get my robe and everyone gasped. I said, \u0027What is it?\u0027 And they said, \u0027You look like you\u0027ve been whipped a million times. Your back is covered in a thousand red scratches.”During the filming of the sequel to Steven Spielberg’s Jaws, cast members were terrified when real hammerhead sharks started circling them in the sea. The trouble was that their screams went unheard. The crew didn’t think they were in real danger to start with because it was written into the script that they yelled for help at that point.330 Sylvester Stallone and Dolph Lundgren – Rocky IVThe fourth in the Rocky film franchise to focus on the boxing career of the fictional Rocky Balboa, played by Sylvester Stallone, has some gripping and authentic-looking fight scenes. It’s no wonder then that during filming, Stallone actually asked Dolph Lundgren, who plays his opponent, Ivan Drago, to try to knock him out for real. But Lundgren hit him with such force that he was sent to the hospital and was in intensive care for over a week.Brando was infamous for his bad on-set behaviour. That is one reason why Paramount was nervous about getting him involved in Francis Ford Coppola’s mafia film. It didn’t start well, when on the first day of shooting, the actor who played the patriarch in the family, Vito Corleone, missed his overnight flight from LA to New York. His scene was rescheduled for the next day, but it cost producers $40,000.In his autobiography, rapper Gucci Mane said he was so tired on set of Harmony Korine’s crime film Spring Breakers, that he fell asleep during his big sex scene. The rapper, who plays Big Arch, a rival drug dealer of James Franco’s Alien character in the film, is seen having sex with one woman, while another sucks his toes. “I couldn’t keep my eyes open. I was knocked out, snoring . . . Harmony kept having to wake me up for takes.” In another interview, he explained why he was so exhausted. “I had a concert down there in St Petersburg, Florida, one of the days I had to shoot a scene. Same night. We started shooting at 10 o\u0027clock in the evening until 1 or 2 o\u0027clock.”The action star broke his ankle while doing his own stunt on set of the sixth Mission Impossible. The scene sees Cruise completing a fast rooftop jump from one building to another, when his foot slams into the side of the wall. But instead of collapsing in a heap, he keeps going as if nothing has happened, until the end of the scene when he can be seen hobbling away. He said: “I knew instantly my ankle was broken and I really didn’t want to do it again so just got up and carried on with the take. I said, ‘It’s broken. That’s a wrap. Take me to hospital’ and then everyone got on the phone and made their vacation arrangement.”730 Lizzy Caplan and Michael Sheen – Masters of SexCaplan was nervous when she had to take her clothes off in front of co-star Sheen in the TV series. It made her feel better that they were both shaky. But then disaster struck. “And we complete the scene, I place the hand on my breast and they yell “Cut” and he immediately walks over to a garbage can and throws up.“ Turns out Sheen had eaten something that upset his stomach, but Caplan didn\u0027t know that. She said: ”My whole self-confidence plummeted to the ground and I realised that I\u0027m a monster and anybody who touches me will immediately start vomiting and that’s just the way it\u0027s going to be.”830 Nina Dobrev and Paul Wesley – The Vampire DiariesNina Dobrev accidentally broke Paul Wesley\u0027s finger while shooting a sex scene in The Vampire Diaries.930 Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan - 50 Shades of GreyObviously this could be a load of hype to promote the first erotic film in the franchise, but there were certainly a lot of terrible sex scenes in which things could go wrong. Johnson, who plays Anastasia Steele, becomes romantically linked to Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan) and they act out their BDSM desires. Johnson, who wore a modesty thong glued to her body while Dornan wore a “wee bag” to protect his modesty, said: “I got whiplash once from him throwing me on the bed. So f***ing painful. I wish we had a gag reel from the shoot.”Michael Imperioli is best known for his role as Tony Soprano’s protégé, Christopher Moltisanti in The Sopranos. During the filming of his death scene in Martin Scorsese’s Goodfellas, Imperioli cut his hand on a glass and was taken to hospital, where the doctors sped in to treat his fake bullet wounds.During the filming of Groundhog Day, Murray was more irritable than usual as he was going through a orce and was prone to disappearing from set. He had been asked to get an assistant to ease communication between him, the director Harold Raims and the studio. He was against the idea, so he hired somebody who was deaf and spoke only in sign language, which nobody on set, including Murray, could understand. Ramis said: “Bill said, ‘Don’t worry, I\u0027m going to learn sign language.’ And I think it was so inconvenient that in a couple of weeks, he gave that up. That’s anti-communication, you know? Let’s not talk.”It was a small mishap for Dunham when her nude patch kept falling off in scenes that required nudity. Dunham, who plays aspiring writer Hannah in her comedy-drama TV series Girls, said: “I stopped wearing the nude patch after the first season of Girls. There’s not one guy who works on that show who hasn’t seen the inside of my vagina. You glue it over your vagina. It gets sweaty and always falls off. My male co-stars, at the end of the day, don’t care.”In one scene of Quentin Tarantino’s 2015 Western thriller, Jennifer Jason Leigh as Daisy Domergue plays a guitar. It is a vintage Martin guitar from the 19th century, worth roughly $40,000, which had been loaned out from the Martin Museum in Pennsylvania. But a misunderstanding on Russell’s part led to an expensive mistake. The valuable guitar was meant to be swapped over with a replica prop when he snatched it from her. Russell had not read the memo, though, and smashed the antique guitar against a wall, while shouting “Music time is over”. As a result, the Martin Museum – which called the guitar a priceless, irreplaceable artefact – vowed never to loan guitars out to movies again.1430  Robert Pattinson and Julianne Moore – Maps to the StarsThe Twilight and Lost City of Z actor played Jerome, a limousine driver and struggling actor, in David Cronenberg’s acerbic Hollywood satire. It was while he got intimate in the back of a car with Moore’s character, a washed-up actress, that he ran into problems and started sweating profusely. “I sweat like a f***ing crazy person,” he said. “I was trying to literally catch drops of sweat to stop them hitting her back. Afterwards she was like, \u0027Are you having a panic attack?\u0027 It was so embarrassing.”1530 Anne Hathaway and Jake Gyllenhaal - Love and other DrugsHathaway accidentally stripped off too soon when she thought cameras were rolling during the filming of Love and other Drugs. She stars alongside Jake Gyllenhaal in the erotic film based on the non-fiction book Hard Sell: The Evolution of a Viagra Salesman by Jamie Reidy. “I have to remove my trench coat and be nude underneath, and I thought we were filming,” she said. “But it turned out we were just rehearsing and I got unnecessarily naked in front of a lot of people!”In a 2007 episode of the reboot of Battlestar Galactica TV series, Olmos’s character William Adama, the commanding officer of BS Galactica, is playing around with a model ship when he gets carried away by improvising and smashes it to smithereens. The model ship was, however, museum quality and according to Olmos, who had no idea at the time, it was worth roughly $200,000.1730 Allison Janney and Michael Lerner in Life During WartimeDuring a sex scene against a wall for the 2009 comedy-drama, Allison Jamey\u0027s co-star Michael Lerner went crashing to the ground. “We had to have sex up against a wall and they started spraying us with glistening stuff to make us look sweaty, but no one seemed to realise that we were standing on a marble floor,” she said. “They said ‘Action’ and he pulled me up against the wall and his feet slipped out from under him and he went crashing down on the floor. It was terrible, but it was one of those moments I\u0027ll never forget.”1830 Ryan Reynolds and Olivia Wilde in The Change-UpThe Deadpool star was taken aback when his co-star Olivia Wilde painted smiley faces on her underwear during a sex scene, that he completely forgot what he was doing. “In the scene, she’s sitting there and I take her top off and the bra off, and she has those panties on, but she’s drawn these adorable little smiley faces on them,” he said. “And I forget every line. Not just from this movie, but from every other movie I’ve done.”1930 Sean Connery and Lana Turner – Another Time, Another PlaceSean Connery and the American actress Lana Turner were filming a love scene when Turner’s gangster boyfriend Johnny Stompanato showed up uninvited. Turner was playing an American journalist who has a love affair with a BBC war correspondent (played by Connery). But her boyfriend was so jealous that he showed up with a gun in his hand, and threatened to kill Connery. Bravely, Connery grabbed the gun from his hand and twisted the boyfriend’s wrist until he fled off the set. Turner’s turbulent life continued when her daughter Cheryl killed Stompanato with a kitchen knife fearing that he was going to kill her mother after he showed up at their house in the US – but in the trial it was deemed as justifiable homicide.2030 Christian Serratos and Michael Cudlitz - The Walking DeadThe long-running TV show focuses more on blood and violence than sex.

Heddren suffered multiple scalp wounds while Marshall was bitten so many times, he ended up hospitalised with gangrene.He added: “It never occurred to me that we were actually in the audition while we were making the cake.”Hamlin claimed the kitchen was wired with cameras and microphones while Spielberg and Lucas were upstairs watching the actors to see whether they had chemistry.“I’d been riffing on how annoying Steven Spielberg was to my friend Amy,” said Hamlin, “So hey, guess what? I didn’t get the part\u0026nbspand I’ve never worked with Steven Spielberg, and I grant you that I never will work with Steven Spielberg and I never learned how to make a cake.”The role of Indiana Jones eventually went to Harrison Ford, while Karen Allen played Marion. It is not known whether the pair were asked to bake a cake, chocolate or otherwise.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

In doing so, they claim to have created the world\u0027s most efficient lithium-sulfur battery.“The world needs radical new\u0026nbspenergy storage technologies to fight climate change,” Dr Mahdokht\u0026nbspShaibani\u0026nbspfrom Monash University’s Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, who led the research, told\u0026nbspThe Independent. “Lithium-sulfur batteries, which use extremely high-capacity sulfur, can store five-times as much capacity as traditional lithium-ion batteries, and are made from cheap materials that are available worldwide.”Associate Professor Matthew Hill added: “This approach not only favours high performance metrics and long life cycle... it is also can lead to significant reductions in environmentally hazardous waste.”Battery breakthrough revolutionises recharge times for electric carsThe research, which is published in\u0026nbspScience Advances, could be a major milestone for the battery industry and could impact everything from consumer electronics to solar grids.Dr Shaibani\u0026nbspsaid the commercialisation of the batteries may be between two to four years away, and a\u0026nbsppatent for the manufacturing process has already been approved.Prototype cells have been developed in Germany and further testing in cars and solar grids is set to take place in Australia this year.“Cost projections and performance metrics of our technology predicts for outperforming today’s lithium-ion batteries at high competitive price points,” said Dr Shaibani.\u0026nbsp“Altogether, this means that solar power could be much more easily stored, or an electric vehicle go a lot further, but more importantly, the battery is safe, simple and ethical.”​Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The bird, floating on the seawater beneath a cliff, held a stick in its beak.It began to scratch its back with the stick – the puffin, as Ms Fayet watched, was using a tool.Ms Fayet, a puffin expert who studies how the birds migrate and feed, wrote about the crafty bird in her notebook. But she had no photo evidence of this first-of-a-kind sighting. “It was just one observation, and I was busy doing something else,” she said. As unusual as this was, Ms Fayet said, she “kind of forgot about it”.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesUntil it happened again. In July 2018, Ms Fayet was studying another group of puffins at Grimsey Island in Iceland, about a thousand miles from Wales. She planted camera traps on the island and recorded “loads and loads of puffin behaviour”.Another puffin used a scratching stick. This time, the action unfolded in front of a camera: The bird spots a stick and grasps it with a cartoon-bright beak. The bird makes a burbling sound. It turns, as if to face the lens. And then it scratches its chest feathers with the stick’s pointy end.Created with Sketch.Science news in pictures Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.120 Over 400 species discovered this year by Natural History MuseumThe ancient invertabrate worm-like species rhenopyrgus viviani (pictured) is one of over 400 species previously unknown to science that were discovered by experts at the Natural History Museum this year220 Jackdaws can identify \u0027dangerous\u0027 humansJackdaws can identify “dangerous” humans from listening to each other’s warning calls, scientists say. 320 Turtle embryos influence sex by shakingThe sex of the turtle is determined by the temperatures at which they are incubated.

This was not some nesting behaviour gone awry. Puffins collect soft grass for their nests, then hurry into their burrows with beaks full of bedding. The puffin in Iceland dropped the stick after it finished scratching. Hours later, the camera recorded the stick, still discarded, on the ground.This behaviour “fits all current definitions” of tool use, said University of Oxford zoologist Alex Kacelnik, who has studied toolmaking crows and was not a member of the puffin research team.Outrage over trophy hunts to Iceland to kill puffinsMs Fayet sent the recording to her colleague Dora Biro, an animal behaviour expert at the University of Oxford. The video immediately excited Ms Biro because, as she said, “this was a puffin, this was a seabird – and tool use had never been reported in seabirds before”. Together, with their colleague Erpur Snaer Hansen, the biologists described puffin tools in a study published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.Studying animal tools can help scientists understand the origins of our own Stone Age, which began when our ancestors picked up rocks around 2.6 million years ago. But tools wielded by beak, paw or snout are rare. Scientists have observed tool use in fewer than 1 per cent of species, which are erratically scattered among animal groups. Chimpanzees and several other primate species use tools. Yet so do sea otters, fish and even some insects, such as ants that sop up honey in spongy matter.Several bird species use tools. Crows in the Pacific, for instance, use hooked twigs to catch grubs. But back-scratching is an unusual form of tool use that the scientists called “body care”. The only other type of body care observed in wild birds, Ms Biro said, is “anting”, in which birds cover their bodies in insects. Bug juices, biologists suspect, can act as chemical defences against bird parasites or fungi.The puffin in Iceland may have been trying to rid itself of ticks. “At the time, when these observations were made, there was also a particularly high parasite load on the birds that year,” Ms Biro said. A scientist who reviewed Ms Biro and Ms Fayet’s paper suggested the stick could have had chemical properties, too. (That’s hard to say the twig was dry, and the scientists don’t know what sort of plant it was.)Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

After all, why use a stick when a beak could do? He wondered whether the irritants on the puffins could be “toxic or particularly distasteful” – like a smear of boat fuel, perhaps – “hence the birds may have wanted to avoid beak contact”. In experiments, New Caledonian crows, the grub-fishing species, will use sticks to touch objects the birds perceive as dangerous, such as rubber spiders, he said.Or, maybe, the satisfaction of an itch well-scratched is just one of those things that transcends species.University of Oxford\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Words by Stacey Smith213 ‘Rachel Ama’s Vegan Eats: Tasty plant-based recipes for every day’ by Rachel Ama. Published by Ebury Press: £12.87, AmazonSince launching her vegan YouTube channel in 2017, Rachel has gained a heap of hungry followers who lap up her simple, delicious recipes (and the dance moves that go along with them). Dishes are often one-pot, can be prepped ahead, and most include a song recommendation so you can dance along as you cook. Within these pages, you’ll find plenty of meals inspired by Ama’s Caribbean and West African roots – from crispy jerk barbecue tacos or ackee “saltfish” with dumplings to peanut stew. Although this is really a celebration of all cultures – and with vegan takes on everything from Thai green curry to creamy cashew and vegetable no-pasta lasagne, we’re pretty confident you’ll find your favourite comfort dish has been given a plant-based makeover. With most ingredients easy to obtain and meals quick to put together, this is modern cooking, for the meat-shunning millennial. 313 ‘BOSH! Healthy Vegan’ by Henry Firth \u0026amp Ian Theasby. Published by HQ: £10.87, AmazonWorking with a registered dietician to ensure recipes follow trusted NHS guidelines, the BOSH! boys (aka, Henry and Ian) have bought us their healthiest cookbook to date. Recognising that just because a plate of food is vegan, that doesn’t necessarily mean it’s healthy (vegan junk food certainly exists!), this is a collection of 80 new recipes showcasing their flavoursome vegan food with a healthier focus. Along with advice on sleep, movement and relaxing, there’s guidance on ensuring you get all the nutrients you need. And although the boys insist this isn’t a diet book, you’ll find recipes to help you reduce fat, build muscle and generally be a bit healthier. So whether you’re looking to up your protein intake (try the ultimate veg tacos), reduce your sugar intake with a summer-berry granola bowl or keep your calorie intake to under 500 per portion with puttanesca potato stew, you should be left feeling suitably inspired to kick start the new year.413 ‘Happy Vegan: Easy plant-based recipes to make the whole family happy’ by Fearne Cotton. Published by Seven Dials: £13.46, AmazonDespite Fearne Cotton not being a fully-fledged vegan herself (or perhaps because), this book got rave reviews from our panel, with both flexitarians, meat-eaters and vegans alike. Recipes are approachable, inexpensive and perfect for the whole family, so we can see ourselves working through them all in time. The broccoli katsu curry was a particular favourite and surprisingly easy to make and for tea time we’ll be trying our hand at her date and almond cake with caramel sauce which uses white miso paste and coconut cream to great effect.513 ‘Vegan One Pound Meals: Delicious budget-friendly plant-based recipes all for £1 per person’ by Miguel Barclay. Published by Headline Home: £10.75, AmazonIf ever there’s a time we feel the pinch, it’s January, with the festivities of Christmas long behind us but the credit card still to pay. Thankfully eating a plant-based diet could be the answer and in this book, you’ll find over 85 recipes all coming in at a frankly unbelievable £1 a portion. Our concerns that we’d be living off of beans on toast were quickly alleviated as we tucked into black bean meatballs and sticky aubergine bao. Full-flavoured, quick and easy, we couldn’t really ask for more.613 ‘Incredible Plant-Based Desserts: Colorful Vegan Cakes, Cookies, Tarts, and other Epic Delights’ by Anthea Cheng. Published by Quarry Books: £11.89, AmazonCalling all sweet-tooths! This collection of recipes from Australian blogger Anthea Cheng is celebratory food for the keen baker. You certainly couldn’t call dried rainbow pear slices convenient, quick or easy to make, however the impact they have when used to decorate her chai cake is truly show-stopping. If that all sounds a little intimidating, we found the Snack Time chapter much more manageable, with the likes of bliss balls, chocolate cups and cookies vying for attention, as well as Instagrammable breakfast bowls, beautifully presented with nut butters, granola and oats.713 ‘Dirty Vegan Another Bite’ by Matt Pritchard, published by Octopus Books: £20, Octopus BooksAfter 10 years of hard partying finally caught up with him, Matt decided to switch from the crazy pranks of MTV’s Dirty Sanchez to fitness – and is now a completely vegan endurance athlete. Believing a natural diet is key, Matt’s second cookbook is brimming with recipes full of veggies and largely focuses on un-processed ingredients (keeping the vegan cheese or meat-substitutes to a minimum). Some of Pritchard’s favourites include roasting tin laksa, sticky tofu bao buns and rhubarb and custard doughnuts. If you’re yet to convince your pal\u0027s that veganism is the way forward, we reckon the Dinner with Mates chapter will convert a few of them, with all the recipes you need to create a Mexican feast, a perfect picnic, a banging BBQ or a cracking Christmas spread. All in all we found recipes really varied, with us ear-marking nearly all of them to try at once.813 ‘5 Ingredient Vegan’ by Katy Beskow. Published by Quadrille: £12.08, AmazonLet’s face it, at the end of a long day the last thing any of us want to be doing – whether we’re following a plant-based diet or not – is trying to track down long lists of hard to find ingredients. This is the fourth book from the award-winning cook, writer and cookery tutor Katy Beskow and follows a similar simplified format, with each recipe requiring just five ingredients. Chapters include soups, lunches suppers, sweets and basics, with recipes beautifully laid out and gorgeous photography accompanying each one. Far from being basic, we were amazed to see we could create a beautiful Mediterranean briam (a layered courgette, potato and red onion bake from Greece) which was as delicious hot with crusty bread as it was cold for lunch the next day.913 ‘Zaika: Vegan recipes from India’ by Romy Gill. Published by Seven Dials : £10, AmazonGrowing up in a small town in West Bengal, India, very few people, including Romy Gill’s own family, ate meat regularly. It’s this home-cooked vegan food of her childhood that the chef and food writer wanted to share with us through her debut cookbook Zaika – meaning taste, or flavour. There’s an entire section dedicated to bread, including gram flour turmeric pancakes which are perfect with chutneys, a variety of rotis and parathas and light naan bread with nigella seeds. The Light \u0026amp Breezy chapter is all about showcasing the freshest ingredients – think watermelon and mint salad while the Warming the Heart chapter is where you’ll find hearty comfort food such as spicy red lentil dahl. The section we most fell for though was Labours of Love for when you’ve got time to really get lost in the kitchen – rich, creamy and so warming, we recommend the Baingan masala with baby aubergines, dill and coconut.1013 ‘Rebel Recipes: Maximum flavour, minimum fuss: the ultimate in vegan food’ by Niki Webster. Published by Bloomsbury: £18, AmazonThe debut book from award-winning blogger and food consultant Nikki Webster shares the same ethos as her blog Rebel Recipes – that healthy food needn’t be boring or lacking in flavour. Taking inspiration from around the globe, you could never accuse these recipes of being dull. If only we could start every day with creamy spiced coconut porridge and sticky sesame banana! Instead of relying on stale vegan ingredients and recipes – this is new-school vegan cuisine for those seeking full flavours. Although despite this, recipes were easy to follow and largely uncomplicated – with lots of spicy curries, pulses, flatbreads, salads, dips and pickles making an appearance. With mouth-watering photography throughout, the Can’t Believe It’s Vegan Desserts chapter is a particular highlight, with the likes of chocolate ganache tart, easy espresso martini pots and lemon curd and thyme tart. 1113 ‘Green: Veggie and vegan meals for no-fuss weeks and relaxed weekends’ by Elly Pear (Curshen). Published by Ebury Press: £14.99, AmazonWhile this title isn’t 100 per cent vegan, half of the book is made up of plant-based recipes so we felt it was still well worth including. Acknowledging that most of us have more time to experiment in the kitchen at the weekend yet need dinner on the table pronto mid-week, Elly Pear’s book separates dishes accordingly. We’re very keen to incorporate more Sunday night batch-cooking into our weekly routine, in order to eat better later in the week and with tray bakes, one-pot wonders and freeze-able options, this will keep us suitably inspired.1213 ‘Vegan (ish): 100 simple, budget recipes that don\u0027t cost the earth’ by Jack Monroe. Published by Bluebird: £10.66, AmazonDon’t be fooled by the title, every one of the 100 recipes within this book is completely vegan. The “ish” comes from Jack Monroe’s belief that if we were all to incorporate a few more plant-based meals into our diet each week, we’d be better off both environmentally and financially. So you needn’t be a full-time vegan to appreciate the practical, inexpensive solutions within this book. Although perhaps not the sexiest food chapter to ever be written – the whole section on sandwiches was inherently helpful for midweek meal inspiration (especially when you consider the “standard” fillings of cheese, ham, tuna, etc obviously aren’t vegan). In true Jack Monroe style, we loved the no-nonsense, easy to follow recipes and believe we’ll turn to this cookbook on a regular basis. 1313 ‘7 Day Vegan Challenge’ by Bettina Campolucci-Bordi. Published by Hardie Grant: £9.72, WorderyIf you’re tempted to give this vegan thing a whirl but you really don’t know where to start, the 7 Day Vegan Challenge is here to help. There are three menu plans to choose from complete with shopping lists: The Easy Peasy Way (quick meals for those that don’t mind repeating some dishes), For the Planners (which requires a Sunday night batch-cooking session) and Fast \u0026amp Fresh (quick and simple recipes). So a typical weekday might look like, banoffee oats for breakfast, a convincing vegan take on the classic BLT sandwich for lunch and creamy satay noodles with salt and pepper fried tofu for tea.Veganuary becomes bigger every year, but it needn\u0027t be just for Janaury as these cookbooks make it easy and accessible.

They do not buy clothes made of wool or leather, or use products tested on animals.The landmark decision means ethical vegans are entitled to protection from discrimination.In order for a belief to be protected under the act, it must pass a series of tests including being worthy of respect in a democratic society, not incompatible with human dignity and not conflicting with fundamental rights of others.In the hearing on Thursday, the court heard Mr Casamitjana was dismissed after he gave colleagues details of the charity’s pension funds, which revealed that some invested in companies involved in animal testing.He claimed he was whistleblowing, but the charity said this had “no substance” and had “absolutely no connection with why Mr Casamitjana was sacked”.Golden Globes to only serve vegan food at this year’s ceremonyWe tested Gregg’s new vegan steak bake and this is what it’s likeWagamama launches vegan tuna made from watermelonIt added the reason for his dismissal was confidential but said it was sad that a former employee was taking action against one of the UK’s most vegan-friendly employers.Mr Casamitjana said: “Although the manner in which I was dismissed was intensely distressing for me, some good may come of it if I am able to establish this valuable protection for all ethical vegans.”Additional reporting by agenciesOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Child mortality is at record low levels. Famine virtually went extinct. Malaria, polio and heart disease are declining.Ever since I wrote The Rational Optimist, in , I’ve been faced with, “what about. . . ” questions: What about the great recession, the euro crisis, Syria, Ukraine, Donald Trump  How can I possibly say that things are getting better, given all that The answer is: Because bad things happen while the world still gets better.That is to say, our population and economy would grow, but we would learn how to reduce what we take from the planet. And so it has proved.Scientist Andrew McAfee documented this in his book More From Less, showing how some nations are beginning to use less metal, less water and less land.This does not quite fit with what the Extinction Rebellion lot are telling us.But the next time you hear Sir David Attenborough say: “Anyone who thinks you can have infinite growth on a planet with finite resources is either a madman or an economist,” ask him this: “But whateconomic growth means using less stuff, not more ”For example, a drink can contains  grams of aluminium, much of it recycled. In  it contained  grams.Substituting the former for the latter is a contribution to economic growth, but it reduces the resources consumed per drink.As for Britain, our consumption of “stuff” probably peaked around the turn of the century. The evidence is there.In  Chris Goodall, an investor in electric vehicles, published research showing the UK was now using not just relatively less stuff every year, but absolutely less.Events have since vindicated his thesis. The quantity of all resources consumed per person in Britain fell by a third between  and , from . tonnes to . tonnes.That’s a faster decline than the increase in the number of people, so it means fewer resources consumed overall.Think about your own home. Mobile phones have the computing power of room-sized computers of the s. I use mine instead of a camera, radio, torch, compass, map, calendar, watch, CD player newspaper and a pack of cards.LED light bulbs consume about a quarter as much electricity as incandescent bulbs for the same light. Modern buildings generally contain less steel and more of it is recycled. Offices use much less paper.Even in cases when the use of stuff is not falling, it is rising more slowly than expected.For instance, how much water the world consumed in  was half as much as experts in the s predicted. Inventiveness allowed more efficient irrigation for agriculture, the biggest user of water.Until recently, most economists assumed these improvements were almost always in vain, becauseyou cut the cost of something, people would just use more of it. Make lights less energy hungry and people leave them on for longer.But Andrew McAfee argues that doesn’t hold up. Suppose you switch from incandescent to LED bulbs in your house and save about three-quarters of your electricity bill for lighting. You might leave more lights on for longer, but surely not four times as long.Efficiencies in agriculture mean the world is now approaching “peak farmland”. Despite the growing number of people and their demand for more and better food, the productivity of agriculture is rising so fast that human needs can be supplied by a shrinking amount of land.In , Jesse Ausubel, of The Rockefeller University in New York, and his colleagues argued that thanks to modern technology, we use  per cent less land to produce a given quantity of food compared with  years ago.By  it is estimated that an area the size of India will have been released from the plough and the cow.Perhaps the most surprising statistic is that Britain is using steadily less energy.John Constable, of the Global Warming Policy Forum think tank, points out that although the UK’s economy has almost trebled since , and our population is up by  per cent, energy consumption has fallen by almost ten per cent.This is not necessarily good news, Constable argues. Although the improving energy efficiency of light bulbs, planes and cars is part of the story, it also means we are importing more embedded energy in products, having driven much of our steel, aluminium and chemical industries abroad with some of the world’s highest energy prices.In fact, all this energy-saving might cause problems.Innovation requires experiments . Experiments require energy. So cheap energy is crucial.Thus, energy may be the one resource that a prospering population should be using more of.Since its inception, the environmental movement has been obsessed by finite resources. The two books that kicked off the green industry in the early s, The Limits To Growth, in America, and BlueprintFor Survival, in Britain, both lamented the imminent exhaustion of metals, minerals and fuels.The Limits To Growth predicted thatgrowth continued, the world would run out of gold, mercury, silver, tin, zinc, copper and lead well before . School textbooks soon echoed these claims.This caused the economist Julian Simon to challenge the ecologist Paul Ehrlich to a bet that five metalswould cost less in  than in .The Stone Age did not end for lack of stone, Simon said, arguing that we would find substitutesmetals grew scarce.Simon won the bet easily, and Ehrlich sniped that: “The one thing we’ll never run out of is imbeciles.”To this day, none of those metals has signicantly risen in price nor run out. A modern irony is that many green policies advocated now would actually reverse the trend towards using less stuff.A wind farm requires far more concrete and steel than a system based on gas. Environmental opposition to nuclear power has hindered the generating system that needs the least land, least fuel and least steel or concrete per megawatt.Burning wood instead of coal in power stations means the exploitation of more land — and even higher emissions. Organic farming uses more land than conventional methods.Technology has put us on a path to a cleaner, greener planet. We don’t need to veer in a new direction. To do so risks retarding progress.As we enter the third decade of this century, I’ll make a prediction.By the end of it we will see less poverty, less child mortality, less land devoted to agriculture.There will be more tigers, whales, forests and nature reserves. Britons will be richer and each of us will use fewer resources.The global political future may be uncertain, but the environmental and technological trends are pretty clear — and pointing in the right direction. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Employers such as the MoD and the NHS had said they were safe.But it simply wasn’t true . . . and at least  rogue operators were free to roam in a “scammer’s paradise”.To add insult to injury, the victims — some of whom have reported feeling suicidal — are now being fined for unknowingly participating in these schemes, which broke tax laws.And who’s to blame  Tony Blair and his Labour government, who relaxed rules around HMRC enrolment in , allowing dodgy pension schemes to sign up with virtually no checks.This was supposed to bring “security, dignity and comfort in old age”. Instead it has unleashed a nightmare.Perhaps instead of lecturing us on Brexit, Blair should reflect on his devastating legacy.IN her bid to become the next Labour leader, Rebecca Long-Bailey has promised “progressive patriotism”.It sounds as nonsensical as the party’s economic policies. After all, there’s nothing “progressive” about this vile, anti-semitic version of the party.Nor is there anything “patriotic” about Long-Bailey’s loyalty to Jeremy Corbyn, the man who counts Hamas, Hezbollah and the IRA as his friends.So it comes as no surprise that Corbyn’s cronies are apparently trying to shorten the Labour leadership contest in order to boost Long-Bailey’s chances and “stitch-up” other hopefuls.Her proclamation of patriotism shows utter desperation.Labour spent years treating anyone who’s proud to be British as lowle scum, only to have that backfire on them at the election.Many are proud of this country and enthusiastic about Brexit.It’s a bit too late for Corbynistas to pretend they feel the same.IT looks set to be a very happy New Year for many British workers.Chancellor Sajid Javid has announced that the minimum wage for over s will rise by p to £. an hour in April.After years of “Spreadsheet Phil” Hammond and his Brexit fearmongering, this is exactly the boost Britain needs — both for the economy and spirit.So let’s join the three million who’ll be toasting Mr Javid on New Year’s Eve. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Things can only improve on the last four years of anger, ision and political paralysis.A period which should have been pivotal to our country saw it barely governed at all. That all changed at pm on December .Boris Johnson’s thumping election win gives us the greatest opportunity for radical renewal since at least .That means finally achieving Brexit  days from now and then, we hope, rapidly ­striking trade deals with Brussels and the world’s greatest economies.It means a dramatic, imaginative ­Budget to turbo-charge both those “left-behind” regions which voted Tory for the first time and the wider economy.We share too the  vision of our readers: For huge NHS investment to continue and a long-term social care solution be put in place.That tax breaks and rate cuts must renew our dilapidated High Streets and help small firms thrive and create jobs.That rough sleeping must be slashed, even ended. That wages must be driven up and food banks rendered redundant.That the Tories must continue striving for a cleaner environment without ­caving in to economy-wrecking panic.And we of course share the desire for a kinder, more united country — echoed by the open letter from faith, ­culture, sport and business leaders.The Sun is optimistic about that too.In fact we do not agree we have suffered a “decade of ision”. Yes, it was tough financially. But we were far from ided at, say, the  Olympics.The anger in our Parliament, offices, factories and homes was caused by Brexit, specically by some Remainers’ refusal to accept defeat, and by a Labour Party engulfed by the hostile hard-left.The Brexit heat is fast dissipating now. Boris’s triumph saw to that. Many Remainers are making their peace with it . . . and even seeing its opportunities.Which leaves but one obstacle to the national healing.No one has done more to ide us than Jeremy Corbyn, his thuggish, often anti-Semitic followers and his obnoxious media apologists.Their relentless hatred and dishonest demonisation of opponents toxied both political discourse and Labour’s election fortunes.Yet none of the contenders to replace Corbyn grasps this reality: They can remain a Twitter-obsessed, Tory-hating clique of middle-class Marxist posers calling each other “comrade” but disconnected from working people.Or be viable, mainstream contenders for Government. But not both.Will they make the right choice  It’s January , , and we live in hope.We are far more sure that Britain, fully independent for the first time in  years, will enjoy a golden decade in the ’s.Happy New Year to you all! Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Whichever box we ticked in the election, millions of us vote green with our lestyles.A recent survey of Sun readers showed  per cent recognise climate change is real and that  per cent of us worry more about our environmental impact now than they did five years ago.And  per cent of Sun readers want to make their habits greener still.Some of them make their voices heard.Retired receptionist Eileen Webster, , says “climate change is the big issue facing the next generation”, while Anna Lubecka, , demands new PM Boris Johnson, “start making good plans for climate change”.Attitudes to environmentalism have shted so much that being green is now no longer the preserve of lentil-munching hippies and Swampy, it is totally mainstream.No trendy bar would now dare put plastic straws in their cocktails.We’ve all got used to carrying Love Island-style water bottles and happily adopted reusable coffee cups. This year they pulled off a plastic-free Glastonbury, despite a few hiccups.We’ve long stopped grumbling about taking our own bags to the supermarket and got used to stuffing our pockets with them when we leave the house.So now in England, the average person uses less than a tenth of the number of single-use plastic bags than we did five years ago. Only around ten a year, compared to  in .As electric cars have improved, we’ve all been seduced — and not just by Tesla’s new “bulletproof” Cybertruck. Overall, demand for electric cars has jumped, with the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders finding that this November alone electric car sales leaped by . per cent, with more than three times as many new battery-electric vehicles registered as in the same month in .Nowhere  is it clearer that green has become the new black than in fashion, where criticism of fast fashion has led to trends for vintage, second hand and renting rather than buying.On the high street, companies such as HM have launched their “conscious collection” , fashion bible Vogue has championed sustainable designs, while French President Emmanuel Macron’s “fashion pact” — presented at the G summit and intended to make the industry more sustainable — has been signed by more than  brands, including Nike, Zara and Gap.All these changes prove how far we have come and the impact Greta has had.Hearing her, strong and calm, on Radio ’s Today programme this week, what struck me is that now another change is needed.This time a sht not in our actions, but in how we approach the environmental debate.It’s not beliefs but attitudes that need to change. Until now, environmental issues have been too isive.Butwe want real change we’ve got to move beyond blame.It puts people off environmental issues when campaigners hector and shame them.When wealthy celebrities such as Sir David Attenborough criticise normal people for taking holidays with cheap flights, or actress Emma Thompson jets back from America to harass normal people driving to work.In the same way Extinction Rebellion threatens to lose potential supporters when it starts fights with commuters trying to board their morning train or cause mayhem in central London.The real danger is that by being so aggressive, these green campaigners risk putting people off.Greta seems to know this. She is much calmer than she used to be when speaking in public.Rather than getting angry or emotional, instead she has stressed the importance of just, “listening to the scientists”.As usual, we could learn from her.The reality is most people want to be green.We are all concerned about global warming, pollution in the seas and the kind of planet we are creating for our grandkids. But you can’t shame people into doing something.Diesel drivers — especially White Van Man — shouldn’t be harassed just for getting to work. I’m sure they would buy more environmentally friendly vehiclesthey could afford to.Likewise, no one should be shamed for taking a flight — who knows what other measures they might be taking, such as living in a carbon neutral home What the planet needs least is more fighting.

No way was it what I had written.”And the -year-old teen’s lawyer told The Sun a close examination of the language used in her statement retracting her rape allegation suggested it was not in her words.Forensic linguistic specialist Dr Andrea Nini said: “The linguistic evidence supports the hypothesis that all or some parts of the statement were not composed by the girl.“They were from a non-native English speaker. The combination of words is not what an educated English speaker would say or write.“What it appears to be is words dictated to her by someone  who didn’t speak English as their first language.” The confession reads:“The report I did on the th of July  that I was raped at Ayia Napa was not the truth. The truth is that I wasnt raped and everything that happened in that appartment was with my consent.“The reason I made the statement with the fake report is because I did not know they were recording  humiliating me that night I discovered them recording me doing sexual intercourse and I felt embarrassed so I want to appologise, say I made a mistake.”Dr Nini said: “It is very unlikely a native English speaker would write ‘report I did’ — it would be ‘the report I made.’“Also an English speaker is more likely to say ‘not true’ rather than ‘not the truth’.“The statement also contains the word apartment which is misspelt with an extra p and is more American than English. ‘Discovered them’ is also not a native English speaker’s phrase.“It’s more consistent with a person who has English as a second language.“Perhaps the most telling is the use of the phrase ‘doing sexual intercourse’ — a native English speaker would say ‘having sexual intercourse’.”The -year-old’s conviction on Monday rests on the validity of the retraction statement, which she is said to have written and signed ten days after the rape.But Dr Nini’s analysis bolsters the well-educated teenager’s claim that the many grammatical errors and spelling mistakes prove it was not written by her.Her lawyer Michael Polak said the statement was written in “Greeklish”.And he insists it was given under duress after almost eight hours of hostile questioning and with no lawyer or translator present — a breach of her human rights.The teenager’s friend, who comforted her as she sobbed and told of the hotel room rape by  Israelis, today insisted the Cypriot police never had any intention of taking them seriously.She added: “It was a stitch-up from the beginning. It felt asthey had made their minds up without even bothering to listen to us.We weren’t taken at all seriously and it felt aswe were being kept in the dark the whole time.”She told of her shock at the way in which her witness statement was taken by an investigating officer.The -year-old, who had been out for a meal with the teenager earlier, added: “There was just me and him in the room and he kept saying to me ‘So you were both drinking a bit that night ’“He was implying that we were drunk and I said that wasn’t the case. He was trying to suggest that it was all our fault because we were drunk. But we weren’t. He was writing my statement as he wanted to interpret it.”Police initially arrested  Israeli men aged between  and  in connection with the attack.But all were later released without charge and allowed home.Police say the teenager invented the rape claim after discovering film of her having consensual sex with one of the Israelis had been posted online.The teenager had started seeing the Israeli a few days earlier and had gone to a hotel room with him after having a meal with her friend.During her trial she told the court they had sex but she asked him to stop when he became violent.A HUMAN rights lawyer has slammed the conviction and said the idea the teen willingly took part in an orgy is a “ridiculous porn fantasy”.Harriet Wistrich, of the Centre for Women’s Justice, said: “I’ve never met a woman who’d consent to .I believe she had sex with one then was treated appallingly by his friends.As I understand there is video evidence of her asking the men to leave the room then they posted what they filmed online, which is particularly offensive.There appears to be a lot of material available.“She confessed under duress. To me the conviction is unsafe.“It’s also tortuous for her having the judge drag it out for so long. I don’t understand his motive.”She said he then pinned her down and his friends burst into the room and raped her.The girl, from Derbyshire, was found guilty of public mischief earlier this week and faces a jail sentence of up to a year and a maximum £, fine when she is sentenced on Tuesday.Yesterday we told how the teenager and her mother called on Boris Johnson to personally intervene to put an end her suffering before she is sentenced. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Through the Quds Force, it has killed British troops and plotted to assassinate diplomats in Washington DC.“The ayatollahs have nurtured terrorists around the world. Their war has never been declared, but has cost many lives.”That war has now taken another le  —  Major General Soleimani — said to be Iran’s second most powerful man after its Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei.So who was this man who came to be likened to the Scarlet Pimpernel and crime lord Keyser Soze in the film The Usual Suspects A short man, said to have had “understated charisma”, Soleimani was born into a farming family in impoverished Rabor, Iran, in .He had little formal education but would become “a very shrewd, frighteningly intelligent strategist”.Aged , he got a job as a labourer to help pay off his family’s debts and would lt weights after work to bulk up his physique.When the revolution to oust the Shah of Iran broke out in , Soleimani helped organise demonstrations against the monarch.He joined the Revolutionary Guards shortly after it was formed in  and rose through the ranks during the eight-year Iran-Iraq War that left as many as a million dead.Quds was linked to the murder of four Brits in Baghdad in .Likened to World War One, the fighting saw large-scale trench warfare with bayonet charges and Iranians attacking in human waves.Soleimani earned a reputation for bravery, taking part in reconnaissance missions behind enemy lines — often ing with a stolen goat for comrades to slaughter, earning him the nickname The Goat Thief.The conflict’s bloodshed would have a lasting effect on him.In , he led a group of veterans to the scene of a particularly brutal battle from the war and told a cameraman: “One type of paradise that men imagine is about streams, beautul maidens, and lush landscape. But there is another kind of paradise — the battlefield.”It also taught Soleimani the futility of head-to-head warfare. He realised that it was much better to fight from the shadows using proxies where necessary.In , he took command of the Quds Force that specialised in assassinations, arming allies, and later overseeing attacks against coalition troops in Iraq.It would fight for control across the so-called Shiite Crescent — a sweep of terrain with large numbers of Shia Muslims — from Iran through Iraq and Syria to Lebanon.It supported Hezbollah and Palestinians Hamas in conflict with Israel and backed Islamist groups in Saudi Arabia and Bahrain. Though ideological enemies, the US and Iran have at times worked together when their interests aligned.After  , Iran — through Soleimani — provided military intelligence to the US to support its invasion to overthrow the Taliban in Afghanistan. The cooperation, however, was short-lived.When US and British forces rolled into Iraq in  to remove Saddam Hussein, Soleimani had a network of armed militias at his disposal. He unleashed them and IEDs on the Western troops, killing hundreds.Iraq’s former deputy PM Saleh al-Mutlaq said in : “All of the important people in Iraq go to see him. People are mesmerised by him — they see him like an angel.”In , John Maguire, a former CIA officer in Iraq,  said: “Soleimani is the single most powerful operative in the Middle East today.”Soleimani’s tentacles stretched across the globe with attacks in Thailand, India, Nigeria and Kenya.He and his forces played an important role in fighting IS in Iraq. His popularity grew in Iran and he became the subject of TV documentaries and pop songs. He even made Time magazine’s  most influential people list in .Former CIA analyst Kenneth Pollack wrote in the magazine: “To Middle Eastern Shiites, he is James Bond, Erwin Rommel and Lady Gaga rolled into one.“To the West, he is . . . responsible for exporting Iran’s Islamic revolution, supporting terrorists, subverting pro-Western governments and waging Iran’s foreign wars.”Said to be a strict but loving dad of five, Soleimani rose daily at am and was in bed by .pm.Over the past  years, he survived several attempts by Western, Israeli and Arab agencies to assassinate him.In , he took his fight to Donald Trump — personally warning the US President: “You will start this war but we will be the ones to impose its end.”Iran will want a violent reaction but Tehran is terried of fighting a war with the US they could not win and will not start World War Three.Instead, this attack might spell the beginning of the end for the savage regime that has ruled Iran since .They have been crippled by US sanctions and widespread street demonstrations have left the ayatollahs fearful for their survival.President Trump’s bold action will give the protesters, as well as their anti-Iranian counterparts in Iraq, hope that one day they might bring their oppressors down.What are Iran’s military options  Soleimani put in place a network of terrorist proxies, not just in the Middle East but around the world.The most powerful is Lebanese Hezbollah, with tens of thousands of missiles in southern Lebanon, pointing at Israel.They exist to react to a US or Israeli attack on Iran. Butlaunched they would be obliterated by Israel’s massive retaliation.What should Britain do  We do have a dog in this fight. Soleimani’s proxies killed more than , British and US troops in Iraq and Afghanistan in the conflicts there.Our government should now publicly support President Trump’s actions against Iran — and must stand ready to back up the US with military forces and diplomatic ­pressure as the situation unfolds.He added: “We are near you, where you can’t even imagine. Come. We are ready.”Trump took him at his word and a missile from a Reaper drone was unleashed above Baghdad.Death finally caught up with the Pimpernel — a man who had turned the Middle East sands red with the blood of others. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

No way could God have that living in Europe or the US.He also made a lot of snakes. Some are very pretty and some are very impressive.But occasionally it all went wrong and he ended up with something that could kill a fully-grown man with one small bite. And again, these could not live in populated areas.He needed a home for all these things, so he made Australia.And to make sure people didn’t go there, he put a huge coral reef on the approaches and filled the interior with a sea of sand that goes on for ever.He even used this remote outpost to house some of his more ridiculous ideas. Stuff he came up with when he was drunk.Like those birds that can’t fly and that otter with a beak.Then you have the kangaroo, which gets about by bouncing, and the koala, which is permanently stoned and catches chlamydiaanyone ever picks it up.For millions of years, this big, sandy cupboard under the stairs went unnoticed.But then along came Captain Cook and now the world knows all about Oz and its stupid, dangerous creatures.Plainly, God is embarrassed. Because he’s decided to set fire to it.It’s been argued the fires raging across the country were caused by global warming or out-of-control barbies.But when you look at the footage, you know something biblical is going on.Those things are huge.Skies have been turned red by the flames. Choking smoke is blanketing millions of acres.Thousands of homes have been obliterated. And people are dying.This has happened before in recent years and there’s no doubt it will happen again.Which means people must accept that Australia isn’t meant for human habitation.Soyou’re reading this down there, please come home.You’ll like it. It never stops raining. And we are better at sport.DURING World War Two, General de Gaulle used London as a base and to say a belated thank you, current president Emmanuel Macron is thinking of giving the city France’s highest award for honour.Needless to say, lots of people are now jumping up and down in Paris saying the Legion d’Honneur cannot possibly be given to London as England and France are “hereditary enemies”.No we aren’t. Germany is our hereditary enemy and not just on the football pitch.France, meanwhile, is just some place we visit to buy cheese and wine.We have no idea what it’s like to fight France because it always surrenders before the battle’s got going.ALL of us begin a new decade with hope in our hearts that it’ll be better than the past one.Not me. This is thanks to two things.Firstly, there’s Libya. Since they shoved a scaffolding pole up Colonel Gaddafi’s bottom, it has been a lawless haven for terrorists and lunatics.Today it’s run by factions of the Judean People’s Front and the Popular Front For Judea, with one backed by Turkey and Qatar and the other backed by the United Arab Emirates and Egypt.There’s going to be a bloodbath. And this is a country less than  miles from mainland Europe.Which means we are going to have to get involved. Becausewe don’t, Russia will.That’s one reason, then, that I fear for the coming decade.The other is that at some point in the next ten years, statistically speaking, I am likely to die.TWENTY years ago, Britain created the perfect argument for not allowing anything to be nationalised or run by the Government.It was called The Dome.Created to mark the end of a millennium, it cost £million and was filled by right-on frizzy haired vegans with things no one wanted to see.There was a plastic human you could walk through, a multi-faith zone and lots of global warming malarkey.Unsurprisingly, it was a spectacular flop.So after a year, it was given away to a property company which turned it into the O, a music venue that now rakes in £million a year. Led Zeppelin had their reunion there.As I’ve always said, governments should put up park benches and run the nuclear submarines.And that’s it. Everything  should be run by the private sector.AS we all trudge back to work, with the fog making our hair frizzy and the puddles reminding us we need some new shoes, we will develop a teeth-rattling hatred for all those celebrities on Instagram who are frolicking in the Caribbean or sipping green juices on a beach in the Males.Amanda Holden. Pippa Middleton. Myleene Klass. Grrrr.Except,you think about it, you and I don’t have to find someone to put sun cream on our back five times a day.We aren’t being eaten alive by mosquitoes. And while a wet pavement isn’t very romantic, it’s better than hopping about, yelping, on a superheated white beach.Also, we will not have dicky tummies from the weird food, bad heads from the cocktails, puffy eyes from the jet lag and the constant worry we’ve been papped while bending over.And what’s more, we didn’t have to spend half an hour at an airport waiting for someone in a high-visibility jacket to take an X-ray photograph of our genitals.TECHNICALLY speaking, the fabulous goal scored by Wolves against Liverpool last weekend was not a goal at all.Because careful examination of the footage showed one of the players involved in the build-up was offside by .mm.It may have been three in the morning. The road may have been empty and the skies clear. And there’s no way you should have to waste a day on a speed awareness course as a result.But technology means we live in a time when there is no grey area.

If she’s really troubled about racism in the Labour Party, why did she spend the past three years campaigning to get anti-Semitic Jeremy Corbyn into Number  Andshe’s a serious contender for the leadership, why does she spend half her time doing interviews about herself for glossy magazines Yes, personal brand is important. Butthe country is really in the state Jess claims, shouldn’t she be busy fixing it The Labour leadership contender is determined to paint herself as “likeable” and “relatable” but, right now, she’s coming across as a vacuous narcissist. And a slippery one at that.The race to succeed Jeremy Corbyn has so far involved the candidates hamming up their northern accents, trying to out-working class each other, or desperately bigging up their woke credentials to the Press.No one has yet adopted a whippet or done a Layla Moran, the Liberal Democrat MP and potential leadership hopeful who this week described herself out as “pansexual” — attracted to people regardless of sex — but it won’t be long now.For the casual bystander, it all makes for a good laugh. Emily Thornberry’s hysterical claim that her family was once so poor they had to put down a cat sounded so ridiculous in her cut-glass accent, it distracted commentators fromAngela Rayner’s far more legitimate tales of hardship — much to the comical irritation of the latter.For anyone serious about rebuilding the opposition, though, this farcical leadership race is no joke.While Labour contorts itself into a web of wokeness, the Conservatives are quietly cementing their new blue wall in the North.Why  Because outside leftie London and a few university towns, no one cares about tick-box ersity or even the le stories of politicians.Yes, having a “powerful backstory” is usefulyou want to make self-indulgent MPs weepy in the Commons, but it won’t persuade voters that you’re capable of getting things done.And as Boris Johnson proved so decisively last month, getting things done is what counts.The Eton and Oxford-educated Prime Minister looks and sounds nothing like most of the voters in Bishop Auckland or Redcar, but he persuaded them that he was serious about pulling Britain out of a rut.That, it turned out, was enough for an -seat majority.DOMINIC CUMMINGS is spot on: What this country needs is some more nerds.Stuffing the Civil Service full of people who meet gender and ersity quotas is all very well, butyou want employees who bring a fresh perspective, you need recruits who actually think dferently.A tech-obsessed -year-old who skipped university to pursue a career in coding could teach Whitehall’s swarms of humanities graduates a thing or two. And anyone prepared to give up a social le to work for the Government would likely do a far better job than the current civil servants who knock off at pm on a Friday.Bring on the geeks.The Opposition should now take a leaf out of his book.The last election was calamitous, yes, but with  per cent of the vote, Labour is still the second-largest party in British politics.That’s a powerful base for a recoveryit picks the right leader.The challenge is finding that person. As things stand, the field isn’t inspiring.Rebecca Long-Bailey — though a box-ticking superstar — doesn’t have the demonstrable competence that voters are yearning for from Labour.And poisonous Thornberry, who once tweeted a sneering comment about a Rochester home decorated with English flags, will repel patriotic voters.Butthe party is prepared to ditch the ersity nonsense and ignore pious pundits shrieking that the new leader “must be a woman”, the picture is rosier.The unbearably smug Keir Starmer — key player in the doomed People’s Vote campaign — would go down like a ton of bricks in Leave-voting areas.But someone like Dan Jarvis, who has called for Labour to make a “clean break” with the Corbyn era, may just have what it takes.Under Corbyn, Labour proved once and for all that wokeness doesn’t win elections.With the exception of naive students and hipster Londoners, voters don’t much care whether their politicians wear flat caps, headscarves or top hats. They just want politicians who are unafraid to act.So now MPs have a choice.Either they nominate duds with tear-jerking back- stories and shore up their majority in Putney — the right-on London seat which provided the only cause for celebration last time.Or they change tack, abandon wokery, and unearth a strong, competent leader, who might be up to the mammoth task of rebuilding the broken party.It really couldn’t be simpler.PO-FACED leftie commentators must stop laying in to journalists who call Boris “Boris” .They’ve been fighting a losing battle for years. And rightly so.Given Johnson is the third most common surname in the UK, it’s practical – not chummy – to call the Prime Minister by his much rarer Christian name.But, more importantly, the fact our PM is known by his first name on the world stage should be a source of pride to Brits.After three dreary years of Theresa May, Boris’s gravitas and quirky iniduality could hardly be more refreshing.It’s time to embrace it.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Daily Star Online has found the iconic British brand appears to be making little noise about closures of at least  stores.Pictures have been surfacing on social media showing the signs plastered in the windows of stores across the country. This comes a year after the once mighty retailer collapsed into administration and five years after it first fell into administration in . The outlets affected are in Leeds, Reading, Plymouth, the Bullring in Birmingham, Worcester, Bury St Edmunds, Grimsby, Plymouth, Nuneaton and Bury. HMV fans have been sharing their shock on social media after finding the closing down signs with no warning from the firm.One Twitter user wrote: “Went into Birmingham today and found out that HMV is closing. I’m bare sad right now.”Another wrote: “Gutted that @hmv_Nuneaton are closing down at the end of the month. Greedy landlords strike again, I fear!” “My local HMV is closing I repeat the HMV in Meadowhall is closing. This is disgusting, said another. Another comment included: “Just found out youaposre closing and I canapost deal! #hmv #meadowhall #sucks.” While another person seems to have discovered their store is moving rather than closing down. “My heart dropped when I saw the Closing sign, then realised they’re just moving, sad to see the store go but glad Plymouth will still have a HMV!”, they wrote. One gutted HMV fan has even voiced fears the closures are part of a “company wide review” across the country. “Is HMV closing down UK wide  Thought it was just our local one,” they wrote. “HMV in Leeds city centre also had store closing down posters up today. Sounds like a company wide review.”  Canadian firm Sunrise Records appeared to have saved the brand when it purchased  stores and secured , jobs in February. But it dumped  of HMV’s stores – including its flagship Oxford Street in London – leaving them to close and resulting in  redundancies. Sunrise Records chief executive Doug Putman said at the time of the takeover he was delighted to acquire the most iconic music and entertainment business in the UK. The -year-old Canadian added: ”By catering to music and entertainment lovers, we are incredibly excited about the opportunity to engage customers with a erse range of physical format content and replicate our success in Canada. We know the physical media business is here to stay and we greatly appreciate all the support from the suppliers, landlords, employees and, most importantly, our customers.  One retail consultant on Twitter suggested earlier this week that the closures were a result of short-term lease deals running out with no agreement. Graham Soult replied to one concerned HMV fan: “More likely the end of short-term lease deals agreed when the takeover occurred a year ago, and a failure to agree a new arrangement. “Youaposre right that there seems to be a flurry of closures just now, though!” Mr Putman told the Mirror in October that he believed the high street can thrive as he prepared to open Europe’s biggest record store, a ,sqft branch of HMV in Birmingham in a former IKEA store. Staff at Birminghamaposs Bullring branch were told The Vault opening would signal the closure of their store. Those who know the business say that, while the Bullring store has been taking more money than The Vault, its overheads are considerably higher. Employees told local media they had not been given a definitive closing date to pull down the shutters inside the Bullring, but the consensus was that it was likely to be at the end of January. The closing down sale that will end the companyaposs days as a core Birmingham city centre business. The new The Vault site is more on the fringe of the city centre, inside the former Toys R Us turned IKEA collections store below NCPaposs High Street Car Park, Dale End.  The entertainment giant used to have a branch in the  Pavilions shopping centre next to Waterstones on Birmingham High Street, but that complex was closed in May  to make way for  the worldaposs biggest Primark  which opened on April , . A statement issued on behalf of the Bullring said the shopping centreaposs owner Hammerson had helped HMV to reclocate in the autumn. “We can confirm that the HMV store at the Bullring is due to close. HMV recently opened Europeaposs largest entertainment store with Hammerson, HMV Vault, at Birmingham’s Dale End. We continue to offer a great range of technology and entertainment at Bullring  Grand Central including Game, Sky and within John Lewis and Selfridges, and look forward to introducing a new offer to the centre in due course.” One of the stores set to close is in Grimsby, where a closing down sale is now underway at the store, although details about the reason for the closure is not yet known.  It is also not yet knownany of the  closing stores are relocating, although Plymouth appears to be one of these. HMV has been contacted for comment. Company history HMV is due to celebrate its centenary in . Its first shop was opened on July ,  at  Oxford Street in London by legendary composer Sir Edward Elgar . Born in Lower Broadheath near Worcester, Elgar was the first professor of music at the University of Birmingham for three years from .  The company became a major part of Britainaposs high streets as vinyl sales soared in the s, s and s. It survived the switches from vinyl to CDs and VHS cassettes to DVDs, but the post iPod and iPhone decade of - began to pose major new challenges in terms of how people consumed music and films. Some , jobs were at risk in January  when HMV called in administrators. It was bought by Hilco UK for an estimated £ million in April, . The company sold  per cent of physical copies of music in the UK in  and  per cent of all DVDs and Blu-ray discs.  But when it collapsed again on December , , some , jobs were again put at risk. In February , the boss of Canadian label Sunrise Records saved the company but axed  stores. New HMV owner and CEO Doug Putman said he faced a long list of issues ranging from trying to secure new leases with landlords and improving the relationship with suppliers after he took control.

Tory ministers want families to dig their gardens this weekend and plant their redundant trees, rather than send them to the tip. If thereaposs no option to plant your trees, ministers also suggest checking whether councils have a special collection service - though that could prompt criticism, given the Tory cuts to councils in recent years. Or ministers suggest a recycling service that could use the trees to build flood barriers or turn them into path chippings or soil. The call is a boost for the Mirroraposs Million Trees campaign which aims to plant a million trees over five years. Today, just % of the UK is covered in trees, compared to the EU average of %. Globally,  billion more are cut down than are planted every year.  We have waged our fight with A Trillion Trees, a joint venture of the world’s largest conservation charities – WWF, BirdLe International and Wildle Conservation Society who are together fighting deforestation and to restore forests around the world. As Britons prepare to strip their festive trees before twelfth night and Epiphany on Monday, Environment Minister Rebecca Pow urged households to consider keeping their trees. She said: “Millions of families around the UK celebrated Christmas with a beautul fir or spruce tree in their home, but when the decorations are taken down it’s important that we dispose of trees sustainably. “If you have a tree with its roots still attached, then replanting your Christmas tree is a great way to reduce your carbon footprint and help our efforts to plant more trees.” According to the British Christmas Tree Growers Association, between six and eight million real Christmas trees are sold in the UK every year.If not reused or recycled, real trees can end up in landfill. Sending eight million trees to the local dump would cost about £million. A typical six to seven foot high Christmas tree is between  and  years old. Nordmann Firs are the most popular in British homes, making up % of those sold, with Norway Spruce making up  to %. According to the Committee on Climate Change, the Government’s statutory advisers on the climate crisis, the UK should have .billion new trees by  to meet its net zero carbon target. But last year just , hectares of its ,-hectare yearly target were planted. The Government said real Christmas trees which were not replanted can be shredded into chippings, which can be used in parks or woodland areas.

Mr Corbyn said: “The US assassination of Iranian general Qasem Soleimani is an extremely serious and dangerous escalation of conflict in the Middle East with global signicance. “The UK government should urge restraint on the part of both Iran and the US, and stand up to the belligerent actions and rhetoric coming from the United States. “All countries in the region and beyond should seek to ratchet down the tensions to avoid deepening conflict, which can only bring further misery to the region,  years on from the disastrous invasion of Iraq.” Tensions between the UK and Iran have mounted in recent months, leading to a dramatic military stand off in the Strait of Hormuz over the summer. The seizing of the ,-tonne British-flagged tanker, the Stena Impero, by the Iranian revolutionary Guard in July triggered a diplomatic crisis between London and Tehran.  That followed the detention of the Iranian tanker Grace , which was carrying . million barrels, off the coast of Gibraltar earlier that month. Now todayaposs killing risks unleashing a fresh wave of revenge in the volatile Gulf. Iranian Defence Minister Amir Hatami, the top commander of the elite Quds Force, vowed a crushing revenge against all those involved and responsible for his assassination. And Iranaposs Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei warned that severe revenge awaits the criminals behind the strike and announced three days of national mourning. Boris Johnson was criticised for staying personally silent in the hours following the attack - after spending the new year on Mustique, a Caribbean holiday island for the rich and famous. Angela Rayner, expected to run for Labouraposs deputy leadership, tweeted: The PM must at least get off his sun lounger to make some kind of statement on the US attack killing the senior Iranian general and the escalating dangerous situation between Iran and the USA.Leaving it to the hapless Dominic Raab will not suffice. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said: “We have always recognised the aggressive threat posed by the Iranian Quds force led by Qasem Soleimani. “Following his death, we urge all parties to de-escalate. “Further conflict is in none of our interests.” But several of the UKaposs Labour Party leadership hopefuls responded to the strike by hitting out at the UK stance - and warning against military escalation. Rebecca Long-Bailey tweeted: With this assassination, President Trump is pushing us to the brink of another disastrous war that would cost countless lives, further destabilise the region and make us all less safe. Our government should help de-escalate tensions, and we must resist any rush to war. Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary vying to succeed Mr Corbyn, said Mr Raabaposs statement was insufficient and criticised the PM for having pathetically unopposed Mr Trumpaposs decision to pull out of the Iran nuclear deal.  The Foreign Officeaposs call for restraint today is too little and far too late, in the wake of such a brazen, unlawful and provocative attack, she said. As the drumbeat for war with Iran grows ever louder, and the first shots are being fired, we must fight through the UN to stop this conflict, and fight in our Parliament to stop British forces being put in harmaposs way in the service of Donald Trump. Labour leadership contender Jess Phillips tweeted: “Reckless foreign policy does not show strength. Itaposs not a game. “The consequences of the escalating tensions between the US and Iran are not to be underestimated, not just once again on the civilians in the region but on the whole world.” Lisa Nandy added: This is a very dangerous moment.  years after the catastrophic decision to go to war in Iraq violence still rages every day. World leaders must stand up to Trump. The last thing we need is another all out war.  Former Army reservist Clive Lewis said: This violent escalation in an already volatile region is a mistake  should not be compounded by UK govt support. I call on the PM to condemn this cowboy action  turn immediately to our international institutions to try  de-escalate any war with Iran. I shed no tears for Soleimani, he was a cruel man who unleashed suffering for many. But violence begets violence, especially without a thought out military strategy. I know this from my time in Afghanistan. The UK must now lead in being a broker for peace. And Keir Starmer said: This is an extremely serious situation. There’s a clear danger of further violence and escalation in the Middle East. We need to engage, not isolate Iran. All sides need to de-escalate tensions and prevent further conflict. The US Secretary of State thanked Mr Raab in a phone call for recognising the aggressive threats posed by the Quds Force in his statement, according to US spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus. Mr Pompeo was also said to have stressed that the White House remains committed to de-escalation.

She follows colleagues Clive Lewis, Jess Phillips and Emily Thornberry in announcing she wants to succeed Jeremy Corbyn. Mr Corbyn is standing down following Labouraposs crushing defeat in last monthaposs general election, which saw its worst performance since . Writing in the Wigan Post, Ms Nandy said believes the party has to change to regain the trust of voters after suffering the huge loss. She said the drubbing at the hands of Boris Johnsonaposs Conservatives - which included losing swathes of seats in its northern heartlands - was a long time coming”. And she argues that the next leader should come from those areas which feel neglected and are turning away from the party, with a deep understanding of the problems the regions face. She said: It has been  years since Labour last won power, and I want you to know I have listened and I understand that we have one chance to win back the trust of people in Wigan, Workington and Wrexham. Without what were once our Labour heartlands we will never win power in Westminster and help to build the country we know we can be.  I know that a Labour Party led by someone like me is something many of you do not believe is possible. I think we can, and must, show that it is. “I have heard you loud and clear when you said to earn that trust means we need a leader who is proud to be from those communities, has skin in the game, and is prepare to go out, listen and bring Labour home to you. “I wanted to tell you first that I’m standing to be leader of the Labour Party because after a decade of having the privilege to represent you, I have a deeper understanding of what has gone awry in our discredited political system.  “I’m standing because I know too many people in places like Wigan no longer feel they have a voice in our national story. So many of you have told me you believe many leaders are not interested in what you have to say and are unable - or unwilling - to understand your lives. I believe you are right.” Ms Nandy, who served as the shadow energy secretary from  to , said she was heartbroken that so many working class constituencies had chosen the Conservatives over Labour at the last general election .  She criticises Westminster heavily in her leadership pitch, calling for devolution and decision-making abilities for “every town, city, region and nation in the UK”. She says she wanted communities to be able to create a dferent future for themselves, not rely on top-down initiatives from governments. She added: “Now is not the time to steady the ship or try not to oversteer. What is needed are the hard yards of winning the argument inch by inch in town halls, workplaces and pubs.

He said: I have about p in coppers - that is it. I havenapost got a penny and I am on emergency gas and electric. I wonapost last the month at this rate. The Department for Work and Pensionsstates that he received an advanced Universal Credit payment in November and may be eligible for additional supporthe provides information about his rent costs. But Adrian says: I feel lonely here, I donapost know where to turn and Iaposve been with them on the phone and canapost get anywhere at all. Iaposm probably going to lose everything. My -year-old son has even offered to give me, which I have obviously refused, itaposs embarrassing. He was given Christmas money and wanted to give me gas and electricity - I said aposno, you bloody wonapost ladapos. Adrian was expecting £ in his bank account on December , however, when no money transferred in, he started to panic. He says officers at the DWP contacted him two days before Christmas to say that he may not receive any money due to the fact he had already received some pending holiday pay on December , but Adrian protested it wasnapost enough to see him through. However, the DWP say they are still waiting for Adrian to submit more evidence to them regarding his rental costs after paying him an advanced£ payment in November.  He said: I was worried, it was very worrying when it wasnapost there. It was a really scary thought to be honest. I was expecting £ on December , and that would have set me up for now, but it didnapost arrive. It is the first time in my adult le that I had sat at home on New Yearaposs Eve just by myself without even a drink - couldnapost even afford a can of beer. Adrian is in such dire straits after claiming he has fallen foul of a system - which he describes as very wrong and evil. He said: Iaposve got enough in for a week, maybe, just a few tins of beans and bits. Iaposve been on the phone to the council to see what I can do and hopefully help me out. I was sat thinking about it and donapost sit in silence let people know what you are going through. I have a sister who is poorly and I donapost like putting on my family.  He added: Universal credit is crippling people - itaposs a very wrong and evil system. Adrian was let go from his powder coating job just a month before Christmas where he was earning £-a-week, but thought he would get by after signing up for Universal Credit. He thinks the confusion lies with his holiday pay in December - but believed that this wouldnapost affect his benefits. Adrian claims he is next due a payment on January . He said: I was told December , and when the money didnapost arrive and then was told it would be January , I just didnapost know what to think. Iaposve had to turn down my heating and only put it on when my -year-old son comes round. Iaposm not depressed as such, but itaposs not good is it. Iaposm struggling and Iaposm asking for help. That £ I thought I would get would have been great. Iaposve asked my landlord for an extension, but heaposs probably going to kick me out and then Iaposll be homeless. I have no savings - this is all I have - which is practically nothing. After signing up to Universal Credit when he was let go from his job, Adrian spent his severance - and subsequent holiday pay - on presents for his -year-old son. He said: They claim I earned £ in that time and I had a payment from work - but thataposs just my entitled holiday pay and nothing to do with them [DWP]. I spent all that money on my bills, a new phone and the rest on my son for Christmas because he means the world to me.

When police arrived at the scene in Middleton, Greater Manchester, Orchard was injured and on the ground with the victimaposs parents stood around him. A police mugshot shows Orchard looking battered and bruised, with marks on his forehead and under both of his eyes following his arrest on October , . It is not known how he came by his injuries. In a statement, the victimaposs mother told how the teen had been left traumatised by the attack. She said: Since the incident myself and her father have become very protective of her and her sister.

Prosecutor Brian Berlyne told the court that the girl was walking to a bus station when she noticed Orchard was following her. He was wearing a high-vis jacket and his place of work was nearby. Mr Berlyne said: She was on the opposite side of the road from him when she first noticed him but he was standing still staring at her. She heard him following close behind her and she walked faster, but she also heard him walking faster as well. He then walked passed her, stopped, then turned around to the side of her as she walked past.

It is believed she bought her own Princess Diana lookalike engagement ring in the sale. She claimed Saunders paid her back for the blue silver oval blue Cubic Zirconia cluster ring. A friend said: “She says the ring is in the box ready to go back and she wants a refund.” The jewellery store’s website promises “very few would know the dference between this and the ‘real thing’.” It emerged this week that Saunders was jailed for  five years in  for having sex with a teenage girl. He was seen smiling after leaving her ground floor flat yesterday. The mum-of-seven insisted they were “done” and said he slept on her sofa. Matthews also claimed his belongings are packed in a Primark bag but a date has to be arranged between them for Saunders, a handyman, to collect his stuff. Matthews met him just six weeks ago and a whirlwind romance led to a proposal. A little over a week later, police arrived on her doorstep to arrest him. Thames Valley Police confirmed they had arrested a -year-old man from Reading, Berks, on “suspicion of a breach to his notication requirements”. He has been released under investigation. The paedophile was caught after indecent images of his victim were found on his mobile phone. In January , Oxford crown court heard that his offences took place when she was aged between  and . He was placed on the sex offender register for le. His victim said after he was jailed: “He makes me sick. He should die. I hate him.” Matthews was jailed ­alongside her ex-boyfriend’s uncle Michael Donovan in  for faking the kidnap of her nine-year-old daughter in her native Dewsbury, West Yorks. She sparked one of the biggest missing persons hunts before her daughter Shannon was found after  days hidden under a bed in Donovan’s flat. Prosecutors said that the ­schoolgirl was drugged and probably kept on a leash.

I kept looking back and forth like, aposIs this actually happening apos Asymina and Iliya had been struggling to take the perfect snap with their selfie stick when they noticed a group walking towards them with two dogs.

She laughed and responded with something like, aposWeaposll have to do better,apos and then Harry said, aposNo pressureapos. Meghan took three photos and the couples wished each other a Happy New Year before parting ways.  Meghan, Harry and their son Archie skipped the traditional royal Christmas and New Year celebrations in Sandringham to spend the festive period in Canada with the duchessapos friends and mum Doria Ragland. They shared an adorable photo of Harry and little Archie  standing in front of a beautul lake on Instagram to wish their followers a happy . Archie looked adorable in a brown coat, grey trousers, ugg boots and a little bobble hat , with Hary looking every inch the proud dad. The Sussex family welcomed the New Year while staying at a £million waterfront mansion , understood to belong to a Russian oligarch.

She painted the rooms in the propertyaposs bleak and depressing rooms and added new furniture including a table and chest of drawers in the living room. Blued LED lighting was added to the staircase, which had its banisters repainted, and to the bathroom which also had new laminated floors installed.

Trapped indoors, some never leave their tiny cages and suffer devastating illnesses ranging from depression to brittle bones. Some are so badly neglected they need to be put down. Rescue workers say their popularity as pets is rising thanks to celebrity owners and a desire to stand out on social media. Tens of thousands of primates across Europe are in desperate need of rescue but are left to suffer as sanctuaries are now full. Rachel Hevesi, of Wild Futures monkey sanctuary in Looe, Cornwall, said: “The UK trade, which is still legal, leads to huge psychological and physical suffering. “Every time a celebrity is pictured holding a monkey we wonder what this will do to the demand. We have to turn away mon­­keys in desperate need as our sanctuary, and others, are full.” Breeding and selling small monkeys such as marmosets and tamarins is legal with a licence under the Dangerous Wild Animals Act. But welfare experts say as few as % are actually licensed. The exact number of primates kept as UK pets is unknown. In  it was estimated at up to , but given the inc­­reased popularity, it could now be higher. Capuchins are among the most popular. Two years ago they would fetch £, but they now sell online for just £ due to a surge in home breeding. Capuchin Joey was imported from South America with legal papers. But once in his UK home he had no access to direct sunlight, was alone for  hours a day and was unable to exercise.  He ended up with rickets and also rocked so obsessively he developed an open wound at the base of his spine. Primate expert Dr Ben Garrod, from the University of East Anglia, said: “Primates do not make good pets. Keeping them drives their extinction in the wild. “It’s hard enough for a zoo to keep a healthy population let alone someone who, even with the best intentions, simply doesn’t have the time, money or expertise.”  Dr Garrod said  European countries have some form of ban on pet primates and called for them to be made illegal here.He also called celebrities such as Justin Bieber , who share pictures with pet mon­­keys, “morons”. The RSPCA, which has urged action for years, said it received calls about monkeys most weeks."},{"url":null,"title":"traditional saturday jobs dying teens","story":"NewsTraditional Saturday jobs dying as teens sht focus towards their school workThe proportion of  and -year-olds with weekend jobs or other part-time em­­­ploy­­ment has halved in the last  years with better grants and a need to study being blamedShareCommentsByGraham HiscottHead of Business:,  JAN NewsThe traditional Saturday job is dying out \" to FREE daily email alerts from mirror - daily newsSubscribe We will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

Waitrose Asian inspired BBQ Mushrooms with Sticky Rice How much: £. What’s in it: Aromatic sticky rice is partnered with marinated and roasted portobello mushrooms, pak choi and pickled vegetables in a spicy chilli and garlic sauce. Taste verdict: I was so keen to try this dish that I burned my mouth in excitement. But it was definitely worth it. The tangy sauce and thick strands of mushroom partnered perfectly and were almost meaty in texture. In fact, there wasn’t mushroom for improvement. Rating:   I’d definitely miss out on meat to enjoy this meal again.  MS Beetroot and Carrot Bourguignon How much: £. What’s in it: MS have made their bourguignon with root vegetables to be served with a caullower mash. Taste verdict: One of new items available in the Plant Kitchen vegan range, the Beetroot and Carrot Bourguignon was filled with huge chunks of root veg and the ready meal was certainly filling. The creamy mash went down a treat too! However, there was a slightly sweet after-taste to the dish due to the beetroot sauce, which was a little off-putting. Rating:   Tasty enough but meat can’t be beat for this classic.  Pizza Hut Pepperphoni pizza How much: £. for a regular-sized pizza. What’s in it: Pea protein and Viole vegan cheese provide the perfect basis for this plant-based pizza. Taste verdict: Bubbling with “cheese” as I opened the box, this pizza looked like any peperoni fan’s dream. The taste was good but was overshadowed by the rubbery texture of the topping, which left it feeling a bit stodgy. If you fancy a pizza then I’d look where for a slice of the action. Rating:   Only real pepperoni can cut the crust when it comes to a Pizza Hut takeaway.  Subway Meatless Meatball Marinara How much: £. What’s in it: The new sub features the same delicious marinara sauce as the original. However, the plant-based alternative is stuffed with vegan cheese and plant-based meatballs. Taste verdict: The Meatball Marinara is one of Subway’s most iconic sandwiches, so it was a bold choice to create a plant-based alternative for Veganuary. However, this was just as good as the original. The meatless meatballs had a nice, authentic texture and the sauce was so good that my only criticism is that I would have liked more. Rating:  : Definitely not a sub standard attempt at a meat-free alternative.  Wagamama Vegan “tuna” How much: £. What’s in it: The strange sounding dish is made with dehydrated watermelon which is sliced, seared and served hot to give the texture of tuna sashimi. Taste verdict: This concoction tastes just as odd as it sounds. Surprisingly, on first appearances, the hot watermelon looked just like regular sushi but just one bite had me screwing up my face as my brain struggled to come to terms with what I was eating. And, at nearly £ a bowl, there’s definitely something a bit fishy about this idea. Rating:   I wouldn’t bother with this. Butyou still fancy going vegan then Wagamama’s have a range of other dishes, such as a Yasai Katsu Curry or Kare Burosu Ramen, which are plant-based without being too peculiar.  KFC Vegan Burger How much: £. What’s in it: Casting their signature chicken aside, KFC use an Original Recipe Quorn fillet for their vegan burger. This is then coated in the restaurant’s special  herbs and spices and served in a sesame bun with fresh lettuce and vegan mayo. Taste verdict: As a big fan of The Colonel’s chicken I was a little sceptical about whether KFC could work in vegan form. But the Quorn fillet was seasoned perfectly and aside from a slightly chewy texture was more than a bit moreish. Rating:   A finger lickin’ good opportunity to replace meat this Veganuary.  Costa Vegan Smokey Ham  CheeZe Toastie How much: £. What’s in it: The coffee chain boasts that it’s plant-based snack is made with Quorn smokey ham and coconut cheese sandwiched between two slices of vegan bread. Taste verdict: This was a simple offering from Costa as part of their new vegan range. Unfortunately, there wasn’t much filling, so the toastie was a little thin and the Quorn was hard to taste. But the vegan cheese was soft, melty and hard to distinguish from any other piece of cheddar. Rating:   If Costa added a little more filling then the original cheese and ham toastie would be... well... toast.McDonaldaposs Veggie Dippers How much: £. What’s in it: Both vegan compliant and gluten free, McDonalds’ Veggie Dippers are made with red pepper, rice, sundried tomato pesto and split peas. They’re also coated with light and crispy breadcrumbs.

Emily Elliott, , of New Hey Road, Huddersfield, attempted to take her own le just weeks after she split from partner Shay Doyle, who she met at Huddersfield University. She recovered and they rekindled their relationship, but a few months later Emily was found dead at home.Mr Doyle discovered her body on June , several months after they had initially broken up because Mr Doyle had been contacting another girl through Facebook , Bradford Coroneraposs Court heard.The two former University of Huddesrfield students had a turbulent relationship, assistant coroner John Broadbridge heard. Mr Doyle, of Wilmslow, Cheshire, gave evidence in front of Miss Elliottaposs family including her father Stan and mother Zarah Khilji as well as her brothers Fox and Jacob. He explained they had met initially as friends at university around  . Miss Elliott, a former Greenhead College student, had studied Sociology but failed her course after the first year while Mr Doyle studied a Graphics Design course. The court heard she was a very attractive, sociable young woman who had lots of friends and worked in bars and clubs such as The Warehouse, Camel Club and Mavericks. She had also worked previously at Tesco in Westbourne Road, Marsh. Mr Doyle was questioned by Mr Broadbridge about how their relationship began. He said: After eight-to-nine months there was flirting and getting a bit closer to one another. She lived with me and three of my friends in Huddersfield for a while, a couple of months. I would say we had a good relationship though we had the odd argument like any other couple. We split up. I had been texting another girl through Facebook. The coroner asked him: Can you accept that Emily was extremely distressed when she found out about this relationship and, to say the least, reacted badly  Mr Doyle agreed that was so. He was then questioned about Miss Elliottaposs attempt to take her own le in February . Mr Broadbridge asked: How soon did that occur after your separation  Mr Doyle, who admitted he was not good with dates replied: A friend told me. A month or two after it happened. Mr Broadbridge told him the attempt took place on February  and said: So it would not be a month, it would be a matter of weeks or days  Mr Doyle said: I found out a month or so after it happened. He said they had blocked one another on social media in the aftermath of his cheating but at the end of March had rekindled their relationship, though by now he was living in Wilmslow. Mr Doyle said: Things were going well, we talked about having children together.  But the court heard that on Thursday,  June, Mr Doyle got no response when he tried calling her so he sent a text message to one of her best friends, Kimberley Knight, askingshe had heard anything to which she replied that she had had some weird messages from her. Mr Doyle caught a train to Huddersfield Rail Station and then a cab to her home which she shared with her father. He broke down in tears as he told how he found the front door open. He said: I went upstairs and Emilyaposs bedroom door was closed. He opened the door and found her unresponsive. He said he screamed for help, dialled  and attempted to perform CPR before paramedics took over. The coroner asked him: Was there any clue in those few days that she was desperate, that she might harm herself  Mr Doyle replied: No. The coroner said: Were you shocked at what you saw  Mr Doyle: Yes. After hearing a wealth of evidence about Miss Elliottaposs history of mental health problems, previous overdose attempts and heavy drinking the coroner concluded that she had taken her own le.

Alyssa Cleland, , from Texas, USA, and partner Rick both worked at a land surveying company, but ended up meeting through an online dating app. After a great first date where they spent four hours locked in engaging conversation, they decided to start dating. Alyssa, who has a rare condition which causes the absence of the tibia and deformed hands, is drawn to Rick because she doesnapost think younger men can handle her. She and Rick have lived together ever since and are planning a future together. Despite being very much a loving couple, Alyssa says that they have been mistaken for father and daughter by Rickaposs friends and by real estate agents while they were looking for a home together. Iaposve met a few of Ricks friends and a couple of them thought I was his daughter, so that was super interesting, she said. Also, when we were looking at places to live, some of the real estate people would point out the two separate bedrooms which just made me call Rick aposbabeapos the whole time we toured places. I donapost think you can judge people until youaposve been in their shoes. You have no idea what theyaposre going through or what their le relationships are like. Alyssa has had had negative dating experiences with younger men due to her condition, which is called paraxial tibial hemimelia. And she has often found younger men hard to get to know and have a conversation with. But thinks she insists Rick is easy to communicate with and feels comfortable with him Alyssa said: Iaposve dated a few men my age and itaposs hard getting to know them, to carry on a conversation or to communicate when thereaposs a problem in the relationship, but with Rick it was dferent. Things were just easy with him and I felt very comfortable around him.   A handful of times Iaposve had some negative experiences with dating, but I havenapost really put myself out there that much to begin with.  The few men I dated before Rick all knew in advance about my leg and were fine with it. Any guy that wasnapost ok with it, I didnapost interact with because whataposs the point  I think the fact that Rick believes in my dreams as much as I do and helps me in any way he can do to get me there has made him very supportive of me. The pair plan to get married in the future. Speaking of their dream romance, Alyssa said: While we knew each other from the office, Rick and I really met each other through an online dating website. Rick had aposfavoritedapos or aposlikedapos my profile and I messaged him asking him what he was thinking. We ended up going to lunch the next week to talk things over. We wanted to make sure that neither one of us was going to speak about this we meant to just let it go and never see each other outside of work after that. However, after four hours of wonderful conversation, we decided we wanted to date, but not as long as we were working together although we counted that as our aposfirst dateapos. Rick and I met when we were both working at a land surveying company in Texas. Rick was the CFO and I worked as a CAD technician.  Rick ended up leaving the company not long after that and we were able to start publicly dating each other. Rick is now the CFO of a construction company and builds custom homes on the side.  I just thought he was a real man very strong, handsome and always polite and kind. As we got to know each other my attraction for him grew. He always treated me well, made sure I had everything I needed, was there for me emotionally and helped me work through things that were bothering me. Since he was so much older and had a ton of insight, the communication between us was a little easier. Alyssa said she feels much more comfortable with Rick and has struggled to maintain relationships with younger men. She said:  At my senior high school prom, I asked the guy out and while he said yes, he ditched me the entire night he didnapost take pictures with me, go to dinner with me or even dance with me.Alyssa says that they have been mistaken for father and daughter by Rickaposs friends and by real estate agents while they were looking for a home together.

French manufacturer Lazareth is making the LMV, a vehicle powered on the road by an electric motor which features four jet engines to provide a flight time of ten minutes. With a simple flick of a switch, bikers will allegedly be able to click into flying mode using a switch on the dashboard. Itaposs neat jet engines are fuelled by kerosene, paraffin, giving the bike ten minutes in the air. Each of the electric motorcycleaposs four-wheels acts as an air rotor, with the wheels folding out in air turning it into a quadcopter, essentially a drone that has a motor and propellor. The dashboard will automatically send the flight information to the pilot, including speed, altitude, position and engine speed.  The bike turbines use around , horsepower for ,N of thrust. Itaposs bodywork has been made from kevlar carbon composite, which makes it tough and resistant from abrasions.

Josias Fletchman, , from Manchester, was on holiday at the Costa del Sol resort when three family members lost their lives. Gabriel Diya, , his daughter Comfort, nine, and his son Praise-Emmanuel, , drowned at the Club La Costa World in Spain on Christmas Eve. Mr Fletchman knew something was seriously wrong when a Spanish woman ran into a hotel lobby making a “death cry”. He was one of the first people at the scene and gave CPR to Praise-Emmanuel at the poolside. The youth support worker has said the deaths could have been preventedthere was a leguard manning the pool at all times andstaff had walkie talkies to alert colleagues at the hotel, rather than running to noty reception. Three cleaners who could not swim were the first to arrive at the scene and they had to wait several minutes to get help. Mr Fletchman said: Iaposm not going to sit here and blame anybody, but...it was my family that it happened to... Iaposd be raising alarm bells.”  He added, My Diya “wouldn’t have had to jump in” to try and rescue his childrenthere was a leguard. Mother and we Olubunmi Diya previously claimed her familyaposs deaths were caused by a fault with the pool. A police spokesman described the tragedy as a freak accident and put it down to a lack of swimming ability. The resortaposs operator, CLC World Resorts and Hotels, said the police investigation confirmed the pool was working normally and there was no mal of any kind.  In an initial statement, the resort’s operator CLC World Resorts and Hotels said hotel staff found the three guests unresponsive in the pool, prompting first response teams and emergency services to administer first aid. On December , the resort published its condolences to the family, saying it was “devastated” by the tragedy. It added: “The Guardia Civil have carried out a full investigation which found no concerns relating to the pool in question or procedures in place, which leaves us to believe this was a tragic accident which has left everyone surrounding the incident in shock. “Naturally our primary concern remains the care and support of the remaining family members. Mrs Diyaaposs -year-old daughter, Favour, was also in the pool at the time of the tragedy and had become scared after realising the deep-end was located in the centre of the pool. Favour said she managed to get out of the water and threw a le buoy into the pool when her brother screamed for help.  In a statement to Spanish police, she said: “We never thought the deepest part of the pool was in the middle and the slope in the pool made her [Comfort] slide towards the middle and that was the reason my sister was there and the reason why I ended up slipping towards that area.” “I realised I was out of my depth soon after I got into the water. “I got scared and only managed to get out of the water with some effort because I’m not used to swimming in places where the water is deep and I can’t stand up. A police source said investigators were informed the three relatives didnapost know how to swim or didnapost swim very well. The source also discredited speculation about the pool pump system that could have made it hard for the group to swim, noting that investigators found no evidence pointing to any anomalies like increased suction pressure.

Sakorn Sayan, , first became aware of the snake while taking a bath as he heard a noise reminiscent of a water leak from behind the machine at his home in Trang, southern Thailand. Glancing at the device located in his bathroom, he immediately saw the snake’s tail poking out from beneath the machine. Terried Mr Sayan said he leapt out of the bath, grabbed a towel and ran out of the house to call for help. The nail-biting footage shows a team of eight animal rescue experts searching for the exact location of the cobra, all the while the snake can be heard letting out a growling moan in a warning it is ready to strike. Mr Sayan said: I was taking a bath after coming back from outside when I heard the hiss. I looked at my washing machine and saw a snakeaposs tail but I was quite sure that it was a cobra so I ran out as quickly as I could then called the rescue team. One of the rescue team members pokes around beneath the machine and the snake quickly appears, lurching forward in an aggressive move.  Although a single bite from the king cobra can be fatal, two members of the rescue team appear less than a metre from the snake, who coax it out from behind the machine for a stand-off. Usually, a king cobra will choose to escape over attack a threat and it isn’t long before the huge snake retreats and tries to hide in the single-store house. But before it flees, the rescue team seize the ft long cobra by the tail and tug hard. The talented team manage to catch the reptile after just -minutes.  One man can be seen exiting the house with the snakes tail in one hand and the head held away with a special tool.

The Bosman ruling allowed a player to leave a club on a free transfer as soon as their contract expired.That flipped the balance of power as players now had leverage to demand signing-on fees and salaries from new clubs to make up for absent transfer fee.Players coming to the end of their contract could also ask for more money from their current club, who would fear losing that player on a free.Aberdeen are in the driving seat with Cosgrove and McKenna as both are secured on long-term contracts.Middlesbrough, Derby County and Stoke City are tracking prolic scorer Cosgrove, who became the first Aberdeen player to net  goals before Christmas since Duncan Shearer in .Cosgrove is contracted until the summer of , having signed an extension last January.QPR are also reportedly set to step up their interest in centre-back McKenna after having a bid rejected towards the English summer transfer deadline.Aberdeen had rejected a £.m bid from Aston Villa for McKenna the previous summer window.McKenna is contracted to Aberdeen until summer .Capped  times for Scotland, McKenna is a product of the Pittodrie youth system and recently made his th appearance for the Reds. Clark is confident Aberdeen’s youth system will continue to produce first-team talent.He believes the £m Cormack Park, which is home to the Bobby Clark Football Academy, will be fundamental to that.He said: “Cormack Park can help bring through young players and it is great that Neil Simpson is now the director of coaching.“When I think back to Simmy, he was the first boy that progressed from the schoolboy coaching into Aberdeen’s ranks.“For him to have made that jump and then to have played as well as he did, to now be running it, is absolutely fantastic.”Signed in , Clark won all three domestic trophies with Aberdeen.Capped  times for Scotland, he was part of the  World Cup squad in Argentina."},{"url":null,"title":"meet rg mowat owner of the fulmar","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowAt the end of November we asked readers for help to unravel the mystery of a yacht log book which was posted to the paper with no clues as to its origin.And, not for the first time, Argyllshire Advertiser readers have come up trumps and we now know a little more about the boat#s owner, named only as RG Mowat in the log book.The  log book gives an account of the voyages of the -foot gaff cutter #Fulmar# and the adventures of her colourful crew. Its dog-eared pages contain neatly-typed records, precise drawings and fascinating photographs.The log#s mystery is deepened by the fact no names are given other than the nicknames #Tanky#, #Bosun#, #Skipper# and #Pilot#. The only crew member named is pet dachshund #Major#.The log does record the Fulmar#s home port was Tighnabruaich and the owner was RG Mowat, but few details on Mr Mowat could be found.Lord Weir of Lochhead, Achahoish, contacted the newspaper to pass on information on Commander Ralph G Mowat.During the Second World War, Commander Mowat was a Royal Navy Captain, latterly in command of a cruiser. At the end of the war, he and his ship entered Copenhagen, where he took the surrender of the German troops.Clive Brown from Ardfern added some post-war detail. He revealed: #Commander Ralph G Mowat, RN , was a distinguished member of Clyde Cruising Clubbest known as being, for  years, the honorary editor of the CCC Sailing Directions . These were # and indeed remain # a #must have# for everyone who navigates their way among the many lochs and islands of Scotland#s west coast. They were colloquially known as the #Blue Book# and published at that time as a hardback. He also served as CCC Rear Commodore -.#Mr Brown also provided an extract from the book #Clyde Cruising Club, The First One Hundred Years -# which states Ralph Mowat received an RYA Award for services to yachting in  but refused to accept honorary membership of the club. In recompense, his widow Mary was elected an honorary member in , after his death.Tighnabruaich man Alan Wilson contacted Clyde sailing legend Ian Nicolson, who was fairly sure he recalled racing against the #Fulmar# in the s.Mr Nicolson said:#Old Man Mowat, as I remember him, was a typical ex Royal Navy officer. He treated me as a young upstart, which I was, but we got on well because I wrote a bit for Clyde Cruising Club publications. He lived in Clarkston on the edge of Glasgow.#Clyde Cruising Club itself cannot help with information on the Fulmar.

just two years.Persecution of the iconic birds as well as changes in land use had led to numbers dropping across the Borders and Dumfries and Galloway in recent decades.Ahead of the South of Scotland Golden Eagle Project being launched almost two years ago it was believed that there were only two-to-four breeding pairs left across the whole area.Conservationists had identied enough habitat spread across the two rural local authority regions to comfortably cater for as many as  birds.Eaglets were taken from nests in the north of Scotland by ornithologists to prepare for release in the south.In early  five custom built aviaries were constructed in the Southern Upland hills to allow the first of the eaglets to become accustomed to the new territory.While the work of bringing a new generation of golden eagles to the Borders continued, outreach officers staged school and community visits to provide education on the endangered species.This month, with four eagles now successfully introduced to the south of Scotland, bosses at the project revealed that , people have now supported their work by either volunteering or taking part in the outreach sessions.Philip Munro, community outreach officer for the South of Scotland Golden Eagle Project, told us: ldquoIt is fantastic to see so many people are so passionate about protecting this iconic species in the south of Scotland.\"We are absolutely delighted with the support, which plays an absolutely vital role in protecting golden eagles.\"We need to keep building on this so that we can ensure that we can see even more of these magnicent birds across the south of Scotlandrsquos skies for generations to come.Funded by Heritage Lottery and LEADER Scottish Borders and DG, the project aims to bring together all countryside users

south of Scotland and one in the Scottish Highlands, Borders College, the Scottish Raptor Study Group, Kielder Bird of Prey Centre, HMP Dumfries, and local businesses like Wild Tree Adventures.Earlier this year, the Philiphaugh Estate near Selkirk also announced that it plans to open a Golden Eagle Centre which will support the projectrsquos conservation and community engagement work.Francesca

building a nature-rich country for us all.\"Wersquore passionate about ing golden eagles to places where they used to be plentul ndash and it looks like we have thousands of people on our side!\"A huge thank you to all the wonderful volunteers and project participants.The first four birds which were moved to the area have settled into their new habitats and are now fending for themselves.Support from volunteers and participants plays a pivotal role in helping the iconic species continue to grow and thrive in the area.One volunteer was shortlisted as Student of the Year by the Scottish Rural College, largely for her work on the project.Charlotte Martin, a Countryside Management student at SRUC, first heard about the Project when Philip Munro delivered a talk at the college.She said: ldquoHaving previously worked in areas where golden eagles were part of the fabric of the area and very much accepted and admired, alongside my career in farming with employers who farmed commercially yet with great respect for wildle, I was very excited by the South of Scotland Golden Eagle Projectrsquos aims.\"I badgered the project team to let me volunteer and have since been helping at public engagement events, which I thoroughly enjoy.As well as colleges, the outreach team have also visited many schools across the Borders.Michelle Hoppeacute, principal teacher for Yarrow

Among the steps being considered is the creation of a -space car park between Woodbush and Church Street.Furthermore, the councilrsquos transportation team is looking at the possibility of extending the car park at the railway station, which has  spaces, while potentially putting time restrictions on the car park at Abbeylands, which is home to more than  spaces.A planning application for the new car park, which would be accessed by Lamer Street and Woodbush, has been submitted by the local authority to its own planning department.The car park, which is described as being on land adjacent to the Coastguard Cottages, could also provide parking for the nearby Assembly Rooms, which have long been earmarked for development.A spokeswoman for East Lothian Council said: ldquoThe proposed car park is promoted to meet demand and to compensate for future road space enhancement within Dunbar town centre. It has also previously been identied that the Coastguard site could potentially provide parking for any new flats in the Assembly Rooms.A metal staircase linking the car park to the adjacent Church Street and the town centre is also included as part of the proposals.Pippa Swan, chairwoman of the townrsquos community council, had mixed thoughts on the scheme.She said: ldquoLargely, there is a demand for parking.ldquoHowever, these car parking spaces would require traffic to move past a very small group of cottages that have enjoyed a degree of privacy in effectively a cul-de-sac all the time they have been there.ldquoInitial messages I have had from residents are of horror.ldquoThe prospect is that green space will be tarmacked over and become a pretty signicant car parking lot.The spokeswoman for the local authority highlighted the proposed car park was part of a wider project surrounding parking in the town.She said: ldquoThe project that transportation is considering has nothing to do with the Assembly Rooms but rather a straight forward look at available space to act as long stay and to change Abbeylands parking to short stay.ldquoThe council is currently negotiating with Transport Scotland and Network Rail to increase the capacity of the rail station car park to stop indiscriminate parking on local streets. This site provides an opportunity to add some additional supply into the town to encourage parking behaviour that is more appropriate.Councillor Norman Hampshire, who represents the Dunbar and East Linton ward, was unable to comment on the specics of the proposals as he is convener of the councilrsquos planning committee. But he said but said there was a need to address parking problems in the town.He said: ldquoThe old part of the town, the narrow streets around Church Street and Castle Street, is very congested with the number of cars parked there because of the restrictions on the High Street. Traders and people who work in the premises park on the surrounding streets and they are very congested.There is definitely a need for more parking in the town centre.Councillor Paul McLennan, who also represents the town, is not part of the planning committee and welcomed the possibility of a car park being created. He highlighted some neighbouring streets had a number of parked cars on them and this could reduce that.He said: ldquoIf you go along Church Street in Dunbar, there is very little parking."},{"url":null,"title":"plans-rocket-engine-testing-site-turned","story":"Skyroras bid to set up a base on the former coal handling plant at Port Seton had caused a ision between neighbouring community councils and saw nearly  objections lodged with East Lothian Council.And at a meeting of the local authoritys planning committee today , the proposal was rejected against the advice of council officials after planning convenor Councillor Norman Hampshire branded the development a \"bad neighbour\".Mr Hampshire told fellow committee members that he was concerned that allowing Skyrora to test rockets on the land, which is central to the councils future economic plans, could put other investors off.He said: \"This is not a good neighbour ndash it is a bad neighbour development and my concern is this may deter potential investors from taking on development at the Cockenzie site.\"Skyrora had lodged an application to create a rocket engine testing site on the land, which is owned by the local authority, with plans to carry out five -second tests each month.But while they applied for temporary use of the site for five years, they told the planning committee they envisaged the possibility of not just expanding their presence in the community but potentially bringing a manufacturing facility, described as the size of an Ikea outlet, to Cockenzie.And while Prestonpans Community Council, which lies on the boundary of the site, supported their move as offering potential for jobs and the economy, Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council objected.At the planning committee meeting this week, Bryan Hickman, from Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council, pointed to a public meeting which had seen between  and  people turn out.He said: \"Virtually everyone who was there was against it ranging from our youngest residents to pensioners.

The existing junction in front of QMU would also be modied from a give-way ghost island T-junction to a signalised junction with greater capacity to hold turning traffic.The proposed scheme would, through the provision of an underpass beneath the A and slip roads to the northbound carriageway of the A, enable traffic movement from QMU and the new development to access the A northbound directly.Street lighting is proposed to be installed extended to include the new section of Queen Margaret Drive which would be provided under the A to the proposed roundabout junction. Street lighting would also be provided on the new slip roads.The proposals also include foot and cycle paths, two SUDS ponds, mitigation planting of native woodland to the main junction, structure tree planting, marginal planting to the proposed SUDS areas, and more ornamental planting to the areas near the QMU campus.Colin Beattie, Musselburgh MSP, said: ldquoWhile I welcome improvements to the road system which will accommodate the exciting new business developments around QMU, I am less enthusiastic about the huge expansion of housing, albeit much-needed, adjacent to QMU.ldquoThey will substantially increase the traffic on that stretch of road. Hopefully the improvements will manage that well.ldquoI continue to have concerns about developments being put in place with inadequate attention to overall infrastructure needs and the impact on surrounding residents.Barry Turner, spokesman for Musselburgh Conservation Society, added: ldquoThough we do not want this amount of housing in this location, we hope that the improved junction will channel much of the traffic generated onto the A and away from Musselburgh.ldquoThere are already serious traffic problems at the bottom end of Monktonhall Road and at the Tesco roundabout. Evenjust some of the traffic from the development around QMU comes this way to access facilities in Musselburgh, we fear the road system will clog up totally.ldquoWe have no problem with the junction improvements. Our issue is with the amount of housing proposed, which is totally inappropriate.Councillor John Williamson added: ldquoThe planned developments will technically be part of Musselburgh, although the vast majority of the new housing will be on the western side of the A with the only direct access to Musselburgh itself, as far as Irsquom aware, restricted to public transport and cycle pedestrian access.ldquoThe only full vehicle access will be via Newcraighall or Old Craighall Roundabout, which means that it will be dficult for the new communities to feel an integral part of Musselburgh.A spokesperson for QMU said: ldquoWe welcome news of the approval of planning permission for the A QMU road junction which will help unlock the full potential of the site for the development of the Innovation Park.ldquoQMU chose to move to East Lothian partly because of the opportunities to work with employers to develop the land immediately adjacent to the new campus.ldquoThe decision is the

had caused a ision between neighbouring community councils and saw nearly  objections lodged with East Lothian Council.And at a meeting of the local authorityrsquos planning committee last Wednesday, the proposal was rejected against the advice of council officials after planning convenor Councillor Norman Hampshire branded the development a ldquobad neighbour.Mr Hampshire told fellow committee members that he was concerned that allowing Skyrora to test rocket engines on the land, which is central to the councilrsquos future economic plans, could put other investors off.He said: ldquoThis is not a good neighbour ndash it is a bad neighbour development and my concern is this may deter potential investors from taking on development at the Cockenzie site.Skyrora had lodged an application to create a rocket engine testing site on the land, which is owned by the local authority, with plans to carry out five -second tests each month.But while it applied for temporary use of the site for five years, Skyrora told the planning committee that it envisaged the possibility of not just expanding its presence in the community but potentially bringing a manufacturing facility, described as the size of an Ikea store, to the area.And while Prestonpans Community Council supported the move as offering potential for jobs and the economy, neighbouring Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council objected.At the planning committee meeting last week, Bryan Hickman, chairman of Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council, recalled a public meeting in the summer which attracted several hundred people.He said: ldquoVirtually everyone who was there was against it ndash ranging from our youngest residents to pensioners.ldquoThe feeling, rightly or wrongly, in the community is that they do not want it.During the council meeting, residents raised concerns about the storage of key elements of fuel on the site for days prior to testing, as well as the impact of burning kerosene into the atmosphere.While Skyrora insisted that the engine tests would be a ldquoclean burn producing mainly water, resident and biochemist Dr Brian Hall told the committee that he estimated about , litres of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide could be released during each -second test.Calum Miller, on behalf of Prestonpans Community Council, urged councillors to approve the plans, pointing out that the power station site had lain empty now for six years.He told them: ldquoThe council has the opportunity with this Skyrora application to dispel the myth that we are too remote from Edinburgh to attract business.Ward councillors Fiona OrsquoDonnell, Lachlan Bruce and Neil Gilbert did not support the application.Ms OrsquoDonnell said that the impact on local amenity would be unacceptable and spoke of the ldquohigh level of public concern from constituents about the proximity of the test site to housing ndash the nearest of which was estimated at  metres away.Councillors rejected the planning application by six votes to two.The decision was welcomed by Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council chairman Mr Hickman, who said: ldquoThe community is very pleased about the decision as expressed on social media and meeting residents as I go about.ldquoI felt that we presented a strong case against the application.ldquoThe councillors present gave a fair and balanced summary before coming to their decision. The community thanks the ward councillors who called in the application.ldquoIf this did not go before the committee, it would have been approved by East Lothian Council planning department.Brian Weddell, chairman of Prestonpans Community Council, said that he hoped the council would now turn attention to calls for a cruise port at the former power station site, which has been supported by his members. He said: ldquoI am disappointed that local ward councillors went against the advice of their council officers on this planning application.ldquoHopefully this will focus East Lothian Council councillors and officials on pushing forward the cruise port initiative to secure much-needed jobs in East Lothian.And his community council colleague Mr Miller criticised councillors for failing to listen to their officials.He said: ldquoIt was patently obvious that councillors on the planning committee couldnrsquot get their heads around the nuances of decibels and emissions.ldquoThey should have fallen back on advice from their own experienced officials. Instead, they repeated the junk science coming from cranks in Cockenzie.ldquoEach test would have generated the same emissions as a family car running for a year. The councillors who referenced a climate emergency in defence of their decision were only too happy to drive home from Haddington.ldquoAn ecosystem of space technology companies could have emerged in East Lothian based around the testbed.ldquoThe wilful ignorance of a few has pulled opportunity for the hands of young people in East Lothian.Derek Harris, from Skyrora, said he was disappointed by the decision of the planning committee.It is understood the company will take time to consider whether to appeal the decision.Mr Harris said: ldquoI would like to thank all the staff at East Lothian Council who helped with our application.

My we and kids were with me carrying the crisps and goodies when the absence of sound coming from my friendrsquos flat made me suddenly realise Irsquod mucked up.Turning up on a doorstep with drinks and snacks for a party that had already taken place was a potentially awkward moment.ldquoI wondered where you were yesterday, my friend said, ldquoas you were so sure you were all coming.Kate, my we, who normally keeps me organised, looked at me in a way that expressed horried disbelief and lack of surprise at the same time. But what could have been an embarrassing and disappointing evening became a wonderful and quite moving experience.My friend is Jewish. She is not religious but she observes Jewish festivals and traditions as part of her inheritance and identity. And the day we arrived was December , which in  was the first day of Hanukkah, also called the lsquofestival of lightsrsquo. There is not a fixed date for this celebration as the time is based on the cycle of the moon, as many celebrations from other religious traditions are.We were askedwe would like to take part and we were honoured to do so. By tradition, the youngest in the room lights the candle, so my four-year-old son, with help, did so.The evening was full of meaning and unexpected closeness with an old friend. There was a feeling of shared sacredness in the antiquity of the ceremony, and the meaning of the story behind Hanukkah, like many religious stories, can be interpreted in dferent ways by the people who hold that faith.But at its core is the story of the miracle of the lamp that, despite only having oil enough for one night, burned for eight days and eight nights. The lamp was lit as a dedication to a desecrated temple, thereby signalling the restoration of religious freedom, and hence the name festival of lights.As we left our friendrsquos house into a cold and calm night, Kate told me she had forgiven me, as otherwise we would not have had such a meaningful and memorable evening.It happened to be also the Winter Solstice and this is a turning point in the year. Hanukkah isnrsquot specically about seasonal change but the idea of sharing the light in this dark time is a common theme.I imagined our ancestors huddling together in their ancient dwellings during the shortest day, knowing the dark was now at its worst, and soon the light would begin to . Le would come back to the land and the days become longer. But in the meantime, ways were needed to keep the dark at bay.Today we challenge the darkness with decorative seasonal lights. But we also have super-lit shopping centres, bright street lights and, hopefully, warm and lit homes.But in celebrating this time, it seems the seasonal bling of the corporate money-makers is becoming the new ritual. They promote the idea that celebrating together should be bigger and better every year that those who want to feel included need to buy the ticket for the big event.And indeed, much fun can be had at such events. But have we reached a point where traditions have become marketing labels rather than authentic shared experiences  Some people now have to acquire tickets from a company to celebrate in their own street, although thankfully not yet in East Lothian.The idea of being bigger and better means bigger crowds, which means more profit but not necessarily a better experience. Big crowds need to be restricted and controlled, meaning others are excluded. Have we reached the point whereyou donrsquot have a ticket then you canrsquot be part of the tradition We can enjoy big events while still having our own traditions, of course, but my feeling is that the idea of tradition is being hijacked by a commercial juggernaut with little authenticity or meaning other than making money.And so I think the unexpected evening with my friend taught me a lesson I hope I already knew: that the traditions we really value, and the memories we truly treasure, are the simple ones of shared meaningful connection. And perhaps the biggest treasure is sharing with those who would otherwise be excluded.And so wherever you are, whatever you do, I hope you find time to share these moments at this time of seasonal celebration. Whatever your faith or spirituality, whatever your family or cultural traditions, I wish you a Happy New Year and I look forward to theof the sun, and sharing with you new adventures of discovery in our beautul county."},{"url":null,"title":"dunbar-youngsters-thank-lifeboat-crew-saving-lives","story":"Rachel Pirie and Luke Foster, both , were exploring the townrsquos clfs with Chloe McCaw, , at about noon on November  last year when the incident happened.The rising water levels left the youngsters, who all live in Dunbar and attend Dunbar Grammar School, cut off with no food, no water and one working mobile phone that did not have any credit.Police and Coastguard crews struggled to locate them.Talking about their ordeal, Rachel said: ldquoWe know the area well and the tide was well out so we thought we were safe.

Edinburghrsquos Hogmanayrsquos city-wide series of site-specic installations combines newly commissioned texts by five writers with new visual projections and sound scores. The event is run in partnership by Edinburghrsquos Hogmanay producers, Underbelly in association with Edinburgh UNESCO City of Literature Trust, with City of Edinburgh Council and Edinburgh International Book Festival.It follows on from last yearrsquos Love Letters to Europe-themed compendium of works, and opened yesterday to usher in Scotlandrsquos Year of Coasts and Waters under the banner of Shorelines, with work that focuses on Edinburghrsquos maritime history in radically dferent ways.Sugar for Your Tea, takes place at the City Chambers on High Street, and sees its author reflect on the darker side of Scotlandrsquos sea-faring past. Using video and projections, Bankole focuses on the seemingly respectable Scottish merchants and businessmen whose names remain familiar from streets and statues across the country, but who made their fortunes on the back of the slave trade.Filmed by Rianne White, who has previously made videos for Young Fathers, The Proclaimers and Kate Tempest, Sugar for Your Tea also sees Bankole perform his text onscreen through a backdrop of light and water to reflect on his own identity as a Scot, as well as honouring his Nigerian ancestors. With the words themselves projected onto the City Chambers by high-tech projection mapping company, Double Take Projections, Bankole has also provided a new soundscape for the event.ldquoI didnrsquot know about Scotlandrsquos role in the slave trade, says Bankole. ldquoThings like that are always buried under the crypt, so this piece actually came from being a human making new discoveries. Irsquom not pointing the finger. Irsquom wanting to make people consider how we have appropriate discussions about identity and move forward.As those who have already trawled across the city yesterday will know, as well as Bankolersquos work, the Shorelines edition of Message from the Skies will feature new writing by Kathleen Jamie, Robin Robertson, Charlotte Runcie and Irvine Welsh. These map the city from the Union Canal in Fountainbridge to the Malmaison hotel on the Shore in Leith, taking in the Northern Lighthouse Board on George Street and the Nelson Monument on Calton Hill en route.Jamiersquos piece, Seascape with WEC, is a poem that captures her experience of witnessing new wave energy converters being tested on the Orkney islands. Graphic designer and animator Thomas Moulson brings the poem to le using vibrant colours inspired by ideas of symmetry and kinetic energy. These are subsequently animated by Susanna Murphy and Cristina Spiteri, the duo behind Bright Side Studios, who worked on last yearrsquos Message from the Skies alongside composer Pippa Murphy on Kapka Kassabovarsquos love letter to Europe projected onto the National Monument of Scotland on Calton Hill. This time out, Bright Side create a playful reflection of Moulsonrsquos visual interpretation of Jamiersquos words on the water above the Union Canal in Fountainbridge.Bright Side also take part in Ten Thousand Miles of Edge, Robin Robertsonrsquos personal reflection of the signicance of Scotlandrsquos seaside landscape in Scotlandrsquos identity as a seafaring nation, and takes the audience on a vast nationwide journey across the countryrsquos coastal geography. With Robertson narrating, Ten Thousand Miles of Edge is augmented by a new musical score by neo-trad troubadour Alasdair Roberts, who looks to Hebridean psalmody and piobiareachd to create something both sacred and elegiac. This is illuminated by Bright Side to create an immersive fusion of elements beamed onto the Nelson Monument on Calton Hill.As another Message from the Skies veteran, Pippa Murphy, provides a new score to accompany Lightkeepers, Charlotte Runciersquos meditation on lighthouses real and fictional, including those built by pioneering engineer Robert Stevenson, grand-father of fiction author extraordinaire, Robert Louise Stevenson. Utilising the Northern Lighthouse Board on George Street as a backdrop, the piece features animations by Kate Charter to shine fresh light on such iconic myth-making structures. There is input here too from singer Karine Polwart, who narrates and sings as part of the piece.Finally, down by The Shore in Leith, local hero Irvine Welsh presents The Sea, which promises a mash-up of Welshrsquos words, film cut-ups by Norman Harman and industrial beats by DJ Steve Mac to illustrate Welshrsquos memoir of the influence of a sailor he met while growing up in Leith. Projections again come care of Double Take Projections, who take over the faccedilade of the Malmaison hotel, formerly the site of a sailorrsquos mission.With a downloadable app developed by Odd Panda Design accompanying the event, Message from the Skies is an immersive experience in every way.ldquoWater is such a rich theme, says Amanda Rogers, producer of this yearrsquos Message from the Skies event, ldquoand each piece sits in its own world, butyou walk to all five pieces, with the sound and visuals you get a full experience. Itrsquos not just words on a wall.Beyond Sugar for Your Tea, Bankole is back in the studio with Massaquoi and Hastings working on new Young Fathers material.ldquoThatrsquos where Irsquom happiest,rsquo says Bankole, ldquocollaborating with my brothers, experimenting.

They clearly didnrsquot think Jeremy Corbyn believed in Britain or had the nationrsquos best interests at heart.Now, one of Mr Corbynrsquos disciples, Rebecca Long-Bailey, has recognised this. In her leadership pitch in theshe has called for Labour to adopt ldquoprogressive patriotism to bring the country together. She is suggesting that Labourrsquos electoral problem was not just opposition to Brexit but its ambivalence regarding the nation.Ms Long-Bailey doesnrsquot see why patriotism should be the property of the right. We should celebrate ldquoLancashire mill workers who supported Abraham Lincolnrsquos anti-slavery blockade of cotton from the American South. But even this tentative and politically-correct version of patriotism proved too much for s of Labour purity on Twitter. She was taken to task for spreading ldquoloathsome nonsense...Tory Lite...dog whistle nationalism. ldquoProgressive patriotism is an oxymoron, said one critic, ldquolike humane fascism. For many supporters of Jeremy Corbyn love of country is irremediably toxic.During the long Brexit culture war, this attitude finally alienated Labourrsquos older, socially conservative voters in the Midlands and North of England. The question is whether Labour has the will or the capacity to win them back. It would have to go a lot further than history lessons about anti-slavery.Can you imagine Momentum activists saying how much they love Britain and its history  Can you hear David Lammy say that, actually, Britain is not a racist country  Mr Corbyn saying that the British Empire wasnrsquot all bad Imagine Ms Long-Bailey saying that our armed forces are the best of British. Or that most men are kind and loving fathers and not part of an oppressive patriarchy. Twitter would go into meltdownLabour started talking about controlling immigration.I just canrsquot see Labour becoming patriotic in a way northern English voters would recognise. Stormzy would be furious.would say it had gone populist, fascist, even.But the inconvenient truth is that many voters just seem hard-wired to regard their community and their country with pride. It is a lot to do with accentuating the positive. The relentless miserablism of the Left leaves people with nothing to feel good about. Itrsquos like watching a permanent Ken Loach film.Scottish nationalists used to make the same mistake of revelling in miserablism. They banged on about how Scotland was impoverished and demeaned by England and how theyrsquod stolen our oil. Then in the noughties it discovered positive nationalism and started talking up Scotland as a progressive country that could be a model for the world. Inclusive, democratic, equalitarian.It worked. The SNPrsquos electoral dominance today is directly related to its celebration of Scotland. The  referendum campaign, with its Yestivals and Saltires, was all about feeling good about being Scottish.Could Labour learn from this  Or has Labour sold its soul to a version of liberal identity politics which loathes the very idea of nations  Labour intellectuals like Emily Thornberry laugh at flag-waving English patriots. Labour academics regard Britain as a neocolonial power, with blood on its hands, oppressing people abroad and racist at home.This is why this General Election could be terminal for Labour. Unlike in Scotland, the English Left seems incapable of finding any positive dimension to nationalism. Britishness is seen as inherently right wing and racist ndash even though Britain gave the world parliamentary democracy, abolished the slave trade and led the defeat of fascism.The Tory PM is dismantling the overtly racist, imperial nationalism of Churchill and Thatcher, in favour of the self-mocking, popular nationalism of the  Olympic Opening Ceremony. Danny Boylersquos pageant of English identity was of course authorised by Mr Johnson as London Mayor. It featured NHS nurses, Chartists and icons of popular culture. Thatrsquos the kind of One Nation Conservatism that Boris Johnson is grasping for, and is temperamentally capable of delivering.It is about reflecting the nation in a favourable light, but it is also a way of doing politics. The Prime Minister is successful because he is relentlessly positive. He makes people feel good about themselves. Labourrsquos characterisation of him as a hard-bitten racist demagogue doesnrsquot ring true. Mr Johnson is actually more in the hail-fellow-well-met mould of one Alex Salmond, who made the SNP what it is today.Mr Salmond too was a gted populist leader, a romantic nationalist who loved Scottish history and understood the importance of supporting the Scottish regiments, even the Queen. The media regarded him with suspicion, but many Scottish voters loved him. He wedded nationalism to social democratic themes of inclusion and equality. In his  Hugo Young lecture on progressive nationalism he hailed left-wing policies, like tuition fees, as the ldquosocial wage.Unlike Mr Salmond, Nicola Sturgeon does not like nationalism, and is quite obviously embarrassed by it. Shersquos even said she would like to remove the word ldquonational from the party name. Butshe did she would risk throwing the cultural baby out with the liberal bathwater. The SNP was an early the beneficiary of the wave of populist nationalism that has now swept England.SNP intellectuals loathe the idea that Scottish nationalism might have anything in common with Brexit and English nationalism. But the similarities are too obvious to ignore. They were both populist rebellions against globalisation and neoliberalism by people who love their country and seek sanctuary within it.How these two nationalisms, Scottish and English, learn to coexist ndash or donrsquot ndash will decide the future of the United Kingdom. Labour may have to learn the language of progressive nationalism to have any future at all.Read more: Why Im giving up Twitter in "},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/10854237.jpg?type=article-full","title":"one-four-atms-now-charge-scots-customers-withdraw-cash","story":"New figures from the UKrsquos largest cash machine network reveal that there are now  pay to use ATMS in Scotland -  more than this time last year.It has led to fresh demands for action to preserve the nationrsquos access to cash, as bank branches vanish.:The free cash machine scandal - how ATM loss is affecting your areaIt comes as thousands of Bank of Scotland, Halax and Lloyds customers were left without access to their accounts yesterday after the grouprsquos online banking websites crashed for several hours.Customers of the Lloyds Group, which has more than  million active online customers, began complaining about being unable to access the banksrsquo websites and smartphone apps from around am on New Yearrsquos Day.In the past four months alone, nearly  free cash machines have been lost to Scotland - at a rate of  a month.On top of that new LINK data shows that the rate of loss of free-to-use cash machines in Scotland has risen to  every week in the past year. Thatrsquos up from one in ten in the year to July.:One in five cash machines in Scotland to charge in a yearThe Herald revealed stark warnings in May from the ATM Industry Association that nearly one in five of Scotlandrsquos free to use cash machines were expected to introduce charges to customers in the following  months.It comes after banks have cut the fees paid to ATM operators when a customer uses a free cashpoint, causing many to switch to paid-for models.The shock figures emerged less than a fortnight after Adrian Roberts, LINKrsquos chief commercial officer told MSPs: ldquoIt is absolutely not acceptable for people to have to pay to access their own cash.The falling number of cashpoints is seen as a concern for elderly or vulnerable bank customers who do not use online banking, and for small businesses who rely on access to cash.Scotland has already seen over  bank branches close since , making it one of the worst affected areas in the UK, and often the cashpoints will also go. Banks who have made the cuts consistently say that it is the result of customers preferring to use online, mobile or telephone banking while usage of branches has fallen.Which  said the new figures showed how the UK government should step in to protect peoplersquos access to cash.:South Lanarkshire town that was left with no banksJenny Ross, Which  Money Editor, said: ldquoCountless Scottish communities are being stripped of free access to cash at an alarming rate that could hit the most vulnerable in our society the hardest, while denying many people free withdrawals.ldquoMismangement by the industry and regulators has led to a massive spike in fee-charging machines, while rampant bank branch and cashpoint closures are stripping people of vital cash access and have left the cash landscape on the brink of collapse.ldquoThe UKrsquos new government should seize the opportunity to act now and introduce legislation that protects this important payment method for as long as it is needed.Last month, the Herald revealed that ministers had refused to intervene in the access-to-cash crisis.A UK government response said: ldquoGovernment cannot reverse the changes in the market and in customer behaviour, nor can it determine firmsrsquo commercial strategies in response to those changes. However, the Government will continue to work with the sector to maintain access to vital banking services and ensure that banks support communities across the UK when their local branches close.ldquoThe Government is committed to safeguarding access to cash and proud that Scotland and the rest of the UK has an extensive free-to-use ATM network.\"However, it is important to note that as consumers use digital products more to make and receive payments, the demand for cash and ATMs will continue to fall. While industry must have the flexibility to take such trends into account when making decisions on how best to provide their services, the Government expects commitment from industry to protect access to banking and cash for those who need it.New details about the decline of ATMs comes after the north-west Highlands village of Durness, where locals have to drive for an hour to get to their nearest free ATM, became the first to receive a cash machine as part of a LINK pledge - and it was due to come online last week.LINK has received  separate requests for free access to cash across Scotland, raising fears they wonrsquot be able to cope with demand.:Scottish people pay price as one in seven cant use bank cards due to IT failuresIn August the ATM overseers said that should a high street be threatened with the loss of an ATM or Post Office, it would step in to ensure that a cash machine is made available and paid for with funding from all the UKrsquos main banks and building societies.And in October, it invited consumers and community groups to put in requests for an ATM through the Community Access to Cash Delivery Fund.Supported by the banks and building societies, LINK said it was part of a ldquopilot to support communities across the UK with cash access issues.The new figures from LINK show that despite calls for better access to cash, in November there were  free and chargeable cash machines in Scotland -  fewer than over a year.There were last month  free to use ATMs,  fewer than the same time last year.LINK have said they are expecting to approve between  and  new free ATMs over the next few months while admitting ldquomore still needs to be done to protect cash access.

It also found that cash is only used for three in every ten transactions, down from six in ten a decade ago and is forecast a fall to as low as one in ten transactions within the next  years.It concluded that this sht away from cash towards digital payments is placing signicant strain on the UKrsquos cash infrastructure which currently costs around pound billion a year to run.The government says industry statistics state that cash is being used in a decreasing proportion of UK transactions, falling from % of payments in  to % in .Correspondingly, the number of ATM transactions is declining, with volumes expected to be around % lower in  than .A Bank of Scotland spokeswoman said of the latest online issues: \"Were aware that some of our customers are experiencing problems logging on to Online Banking.

But there are bigger questions here, deserving of more attention, both around what sort of member state an independent Scotland might be, and of what the Scottish Government can do now to reinforce European relations despite Brexit.Many in Scotland have looked at the EUrsquos support for Ireland through the tortuous Brexit process and seen a small country with a seat at the table, that has had the strong backing of the other  EU member states, and that played an exemplary diplomatic game throughout.

Even at the start, in , the smaller threesome of the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg cooperated as the Benelux group to hold their own in the face of the larger trio of France, Germany and Italy.\"@context\": \"https:schema.org\",\"@type\": \"VideoObject\",\"name\": \"Politics: The state of the parties going into \",\"description\": \"Politics: The state of the parties going into \",\"thumbnailUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer v media PsvcXF poster.jpg width\",\"uploadDate\": \"--T::+:\",\"duration\": \"PDTHMS\",\"contentUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer manests PsvcXF.mu\",\"embedUrl\": \"https:www.heraldscotland video  \",\"publisher\": \"@type\": \"Organization\",\"name\": \"HeraldScotland\",\"logo\": \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\"url\": \"https:www.heraldscotland sitelogo \",\"width\": ,\"height\": : SNPMP admits chance of Indyref this year is probably lsquonilrsquoToday, one of the newest groupings of smaller states is the so-called new Hanseatic League covering the Netherlands, Ireland and the Nordic and Baltic states. The League was set up in , driven partly by the looming impact of Brexit: to many the UK was an important EU partner who needed replacing with new networks. But the Hanseatic League also aims to oppose Francersquos efforts to loosen orthodox economic and monetary policies around the euro.So while an independent Scotland might indeed be well advised to look first to its geographical neighbours for alliances, a neoliberal Hanseatic grouping would not be the most obvious place to start. But within that group there are countries Scotland could learn from. Ireland has worked hard at putting itself in the core of the EU ndash joining the euro, even while staying out of Schengen to protect the Ireland-UK common travel area. Finland too similarly made sure it is not on the sidelines.But an independent Scotland in the EU is not expected to join the euro in a hurry so it would be less of a core player. And the motley group of eight member states not in the euro including, apart from Denmark and Sweden, six central and eastern European member states, is not strong. The UK, with its euro opt-out, gave a certain clout to this group, disappearing now given Brexit.Perhaps an independent Scotland could be like Sweden ndash putting off indefinitely joining the euro, progressive on human rights, gender, climate change and migration  Or it could look further afield for role models ndash Portugal is currently showing how anti-austerity policies can work, just about, while being within the eurozone.:Sturgeon reassures EU citizens in New Year messageWhatever the strategy and policy stance, being a well-regarded EU member state depends on playing a constructive, cooperative game, with excellent diplomatic and networking skills, building bilateral and multilateral alliances, showing commitment to the EU as a whole not just to onersquos own narrow interests. Certainly, an independent Scotland in the EU ndash and in accession negotiations ndash would have, not least, to show it was not going to be a mini-UK, being one of the awkward squad and demandingmultiple opt-outs.All this is some way off, should Scotland eventually choose independence. But her international and European relationships need more not less work now to limit the damage that Brexit will do.The Scottish Government has already taken ious initiatives in its European work. It has a Nordic-Baltic strategy. And it has established government offices and ldquoinnovation and investment hubsin Brussels, Dublin, London, Paris and Berlin. A new review into strengthening Ireland-Scotland relationships should report this March.:Foreign property investors poised to swoop on ScotlandBut there is much more that could be done. The European Union is at the start of a new five-year term ndash with new Commission and Council presidents and big challenges ahead in a turbulent world. Scotland should have a clear European strategy setting out its interests and goals for the EU, and how it would hope to contribute and participate even from the outside, ranging from the environment and climate change to human rights, education, research, culture, competitiveness and the much-discussed green new deal. Ireland, Sweden, the Netherlands ndash even big regions like Baia ndash have clearly set out European strategies.True, foreign policy is not a devolved power but around the world cities, regions and sub-states are increasingly cooperating internationally on many key issues. Yet the Scottish Government seems a little nervous of being seen to have too clear or deliberate a para-diplomacy strategy. Such nerves should be set aside.A Scottish European strategy could be the centre of a wider international strategy and would strengthen Scotlandrsquos bilateral relationships across the EU. That would be helpful to Scotland today and, potentially, to the Scottish Governmentrsquos EU accession aspirations.Paradiplomacy on climate change is one example. There will quite likely be a row in  over the next big climate summit, COP, taking place in Glasgow in the autumn ndash the UK Government will aim to be centre stage and side-line the Scottish Government. But a Scottish Government that is working strategically with other EU member states, showing adept paradiplomacy, in the run up to COP may hold its own perfectly well.Amidst the Brexit furore, Scotland has established a quite distinct, pro-European image across the EU. The challenge now is to build on that to promote Scotlandrsquos wide, dense range of Scottish-EU networks and interests. Andthat is done well, Scotland will already be showing ndash to itself and to the EU ndash the sort of member state an independent Scotland might one day be.Kirsty Hughes is Director of the Scottish Centre on European Relations"},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/10856374.jpg?type=article-full","title":"dedicated-fans-britain-away-day-glasgow-clan","story":"Football fans travel theand breadth of Scotland to watch their team, but few sporting sides in the country can claim to travel as far and as often as supporters of the Glasgow Clan.Competing in the Elite Leaguesince , Glasgowrsquos ice hockey team faces sides not only from Scotland in the Dundee Stars and the Fe Flyers but others around the UK such as the Belfast Giants, Guildford Flames and the Manchester Storm. Usually, each side plays two games over the weekendoften against the same team resulting in signicant travel, not only for the players but the fans that opt to follow them.The Glasgow Clan fans, known as the Purple Army, have attracted much attention in recent years due to their loyal fanbase and large travelling numbers. Their supporters made headlines across the world last year after showing solidarity with LGBT people with a message that ice hockey is a sport that welcomes everyone. Their lsquoHockey is For Everyonersquo display at the National Playoffs in Nottingham attracted global attention and received much praise from media and fans across the world.:First-time fan writes about experience of hockey at Glasgow ClanWhile ice hockey may not be the biggest sport in the UK, it does have a passionate and loyal fanbase, and certainly, the Glasgow Clan are no dferent. Their Official Supporters Clubattracts hundreds of members each season who pride themselves on their ability to follow their club wherever they go. And it was this dedication and reputation that led to me arriving just before  am outside of Braehead to embark on an away day with the Purple Army.The round trip to Belfast would see these fans onthe road for around  hours, and I sought to find out what motivates Clan fans to spend hours travelling to watch their side play ice hockey and why such a niche sport has picked up such a loyal fanbase.I arrived for the bus departing Braehead with films downloaded on my phone and comforts that would let me pass the journey sprawled out across the bus, however, I was astounded to find three coaches awaiting over  members of the Clan fanbase who had opted to travel. It immediately became clear why the OSC was the envy of many teams in the league and why such a model was being looked at by other clubs. I soon found myself in the awkward position of having to ask an OSC organiser what bus I was on, having initially assumed there would only be one.En route to #Belfast with the @ClanOSC for a fan piece for @heraldscotland  @Glasgow_Times.

However, I was also surprised to see head coach Zach Fitzgerald and the Clan players descend from their coach and sit next to the fans. All were more than happy to talk and mix with supporters. I couldnrsquot help but wonderthis was part of the appeal of following the Clan, with the players and supporters having such a transparent and civil relationship. Having recently attended the Scotland v Russia match, I couldnrsquot imagine a situation that would allow me to take the same coach as Andy Robertson to Hampden, yet here, I sat inches from the heroes of the Purple Army asit was just a normal morning.Certainly, it was this family-friendly appeal that hooked so many fans into travelling when I got chatting to members of the OSC. Eddie Squires, , said that the ldquofamily atmosphere and supporting his local team was one of the main draws for his love of hockey. He said that ldquohockey was one big family and that through following the Clan home and away he had made friends across the country, even swapping hockey pucks with another fan in Coventry he kept in contact with.An away day with the Glasgow Clan, Picturel Stephen Mcilkenny Eddie was joined at his table with friends John Logan,  and Rab Kennedy,  who had also taken to following the Clan. John had only recently started his Clan journey having previously lived in Canada and followed the sport, whereas Rab had been watching the Clan for a number of years.However, it was the two other guests at the table that surprised me the most in US tourists Sean Kevin,  and son Mike Kevin, . Both were ing to Belfast having spent the last four days in Scotland and following the arrival of  people in Clan shirts, had asked the trio about their side. This sparked a conversation about hockey with Sean and Mike committing to come to the game in Belfast. Sean, originally from Wisconsin said that the passion from the fans was instantly obvious and that the supporters had been open in welcoming them along as soon as they told of their interest in hockey. He said: ldquoEveryone we talk to with the Clan, theyrsquore passionate. Being sports fans from the US, you can tell when someone is passionate about their team, and that came out right away.ldquoThey looked at us and said, lsquoyoursquore American you should come to the gamersquo.

Now the only surviving founder is preparing to celebrate her th birthday next week.More than , visitors have attended workshops and conferences held at the Findhorn Foundation, which is now the largest eco-village in the UK.Many of the teachings and philosophies shared there are an extension of Ms Macleanrsquos discoveries on the themes of inner listening and co-creation with nature.Ms Maclean was born in Guelph, Ontario. She was a nature-loving child with an enthusiasm for Badminton.She studied business at the University of Western Ontario before moving to New York to take up a position as a secretary for the British Security Coordination Service. She later transferred to their Panama office where she met the man who would introduce her to spirituality.John Wood introduced her to Sufism, a form of Islamic mysticism that encourages believers to seek the truth of ine love and knowledge through a close personal relationship to God through introspection.The couple married and they travelled extensively, arriving in London during the Blitz.Until the end of the war, Ms Maclean worked at the Counter-Espionage Section of British Intelligence.During her time in London, Ms Maclean became involved in a spiritual group through a friend Sheena Govan. It was here, in the early s, that she met the Caddys.Shortly afterwards, in , Ms Maclean had her first spiritual experience which she has described as ldquoexperiencing the God within, which she called a ldquovast unity.After taking up a regular meditation practice, she found she could connect to this lsquosourcersquo which led her further along a spiritual path - the essence which she believed was love and could be connected to through the practical.After she and the Caddys lost their positions at the Cluny Hill Hotel in Forres, Ms Maclean meditated, honing her inner listening and connecting to a higher power.In , during her usual morning sitting, Ms Maclean heard a directive to commune with the intelligence of nature, which she cultivated at Findhorn leading to the development of a world-renowned garden that brought forth an abundance of fruit and vegetables including the famous  pound cabbages and winter-flowering roses - said to have grown by summoning ldquonature spirits.Ms Maclean has authored a number of books which have been translated into many other languages including her autobiography, Memoirs of an Ordinary Mystic and To Hear the Angels sing, which details her contact with angels and mystical beings.After leaving the community in  and helped to found American spiritual group, the Lorien Association before travelling the world teaching others how to connect with their inity.Friend and spiritual philosopher David Spangler said: ldquo[Dorothy is] down-to-earth, practical, not given to glamour, nevertheless she has learned to expand her spirit and step beyond the purely human points of view without abandoning them either.

Compromise to create a larger good.It will be uncomfortable. Creature comforts and conveniences will have to be sacriced cars, plastics, and on. But the compromise is vital.So too is to try, where possible, to stop looking at issues as binary.A hugely problematic and frustrating element of public discourse that has developed is the habit of seeing people as for us or against us. This is common in the Scottish independence debate ndash you are pro-independence or you hate Scotland.In the trans debate too, you are pro-self ID, the new legislation proposed that will allow trans people to more easily and painlessly gain a Gender Recognition Certicate, or you hate trans people.The notion of existence has become a common theme too. Itrsquos not unusual to see, mid-debate, someone claim that the other party would prefer them not to exist. Itrsquos a symptom of a wider trend towards hyperbole in public debate.Anger and frustration grows and grows without any resolution and the means of expressing this fury become so hyperbolic as to be meaningless.As we tread into  these issues are very much at the fore. We will continue to discuss the reforms to the Gender Recognition Act and the interaction between trans rights and womenrsquos rights. The topic of Scottish independence and the chances of another referendum are vivid.Some will say it is impossible to compromise or empathise when there is so much bile spewed in these discussions. On some issues, compromise will be distasteful, rather than merely inconvenient. To reach out an understanding hand to someone you oppose will be no easy feat.Extreme elements of each side must not be an excuse not to try. There are nonsense fringes on every side. More than nonsense ndash toxic, appalling, even violent. These do not represent the vast majority of decent, engaged people.I think thatrsquos something we forget. The majority of people are decent, even when we disagree with them.

Understanding becomes a radical act. Compromise becomes a radical act. Volunteering and donating become radical acts.In  Scotland will be in a position of confronting its own mythology.

Scotlandrsquos future should be in Scotlandrsquos hands not those of Boris Johnson.ldquoNo politician or political party should stand in the way of people having that right to choose.ldquoThe Scottish Labour movement should take seriously the advice of Scotlandrsquos top trade unionist and engage positively over how we build a fairer, more prosperous country with the powers of independence.Mr Smith is seen as close to the Scottish Government, and has a number of paid positions on public sector boards, as well as being a member of the First Ministerrsquos standing council on Europe.He is on the board of Skills Development Scotland, which pays up pound a year, and the Scottish Qualications Authority, which pays another pound a year.He is also on the Scottish Governmentrsquos Enterprise and Skills Strategic Board, and can claim pound a day for work related to it.SNP ministers also provide almost two-thirds of the STUCrsquos income through its training arm, STUC Training Ltd, far outweighing affiliation fees from trade unionists.The reliance on public money led to criticism from within the union movement that the STUC had lost its way under Mr Smith.However Mr Smith has also criticised the SNP Government in the past, particularly its ldquopathetic excuses for not hiking taxes on the wealthy to pay for public services."},{"url":null,"title":"first-among-sequels-sturgeon-continues-dominate-thanks-brexit-boris","story":"Despite a series of failures that would have derailed many a government, the First Minister ended the year on a high, leaving the other Holyrood parties looking like bedraggled also-rans.Ms Sturgeon has always been blessed by unpopular opponents, but this year her lucky streak got even stronger.The rising stink from Brexit, Westminster and Boris Johnson was enough to lt her clear of her own record on health, education, and the economy.After two elections in seven months, the SNP leader emerged the most assured player on the national stage.Yet  all started so badly for her.January had barely got underway when, at the countryrsquos highest court for judicial review, the Scottish Government was humiliated by the man who once led it.Alex Salmond won a civil case after forcing Ms Sturgeonrsquos officials to admit they had royally messed up an in-house investigation into claims of sexual misconduct that had been made against him the previous year.On January , the Government side conceded the process had been unfair, unlawful and tainted by apparent bias because the official tasked with investigating the claims had been in prior contact with the two accusers.That contaminated the whole exercise. The Government would later pay out more than pound, towards Mr Salmondrsquos legal costs.It got worse for Ms Sturgeon when the opposition whipped up a Holyrood committee to examine where it all went wrong, and why she unaccountably kept in touch with him during the probe.The other parties made little secret of their desire to string the process out to the  Holyrood election to keepMs Sturgeon on the back foot.But then Mr Salmond ed to court in very dferent circumstances.On January , he appeared at Edinburgh Sherf Court and was charged with  offences, including attempted rape and sexual assault. He strenuously denied any wrongdoing.The Holyrood inquiry was put on ice.Also in January, it emerged two patients had died at the pound million Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow after contracting a fungal infection linked to pigeon droppings.The QEUH would stay in the headlines for the rest of the year, a gathering cloud over Scotlandrsquos largest health board and a scandal that still has a long way to run.The annual SNP-Green Budget pact saw Holyrood dip a toe into one of its taboo powers ndash the ability to invent taxes.A tourist tax and a workplace parking tax were the result. The latter saw the other parties, especially the Tories, rev themselves into a frenzy. The din over a pound a week parking bay levy was all out of proportion to its impact.Far more signicant, yet less noisily received, was the failure of SNP ministers to deliver the devolved welfare system they had demanded for years.In February, they admitted they had not fully assumed responsibility until , more than three years late.Critics said it made of mockery of the partyrsquos previous promise to deliver independence in a fleeting  months.In April, Ms Sturgeon lobbed some red meat to SNP members on the eve of the partyrsquos conference by announcing a generic Referendums Bill, the vehicle for a second independence referendumWestminster granted the missing power, and for an Irish-style Citizens Assembly to chew Scotlandrsquos long-term problem.But it wasnrsquot enough to head off the grassroots revolt that would dominate the gathering.As the SNP leadership tried to push the partyrsquos Growth Commission through conference, activists and past and present MPs resisted Andrew Wilsonrsquos hairshirt economic blueprint for independence, with currency the focus.In a rare defeat, Ms Sturgeonrsquos plan to cling on to the pound indefinitely was replaced by the membershiprsquos demand for a new Scottish currency ldquoas soon as practicable after a Yes vote.The Unionist parties hoped it would clamp the wheels of the SNP bandwagon.But, not for the last time in , they were sorely mistaken.In May, the SNP triumphed in the European elections on a strident anti-Brexit .The party improved from two of Scotlandrsquos six MEPs to three, with the LibDems, Tories and Brexit party getting one each. Despite being in its th year of government, the SNP managed to lt its share of the vote by . per cent to .%.Even more stunning was the collapse in Scottish Labourrsquos vote. Doubly handicapped by Jeremy Corbyn and Richard Leonard, the party lost almost two-thirds of its vote and both its MEPs to trail in fth on .%. The result screamed out for an end to Labourrsquos Brexit havering and its weak leadership, but it didnrsquot happen.The only resignation was by Labour MSP Neil Findlay, who had been in charge of the Scottish campaign, who left the partyrsquos front bench and said he wouldnrsquot stand for re-election in , citing ldquoendless internal battles.Ms Sturgeon used the aftermath of the election to announce, on a visit to Dublin, that she wanted to hold Indyref in the second half of .Logistically, the date made no sense. There would not be enough time to translate a Yes vote into independence before the  election came along.But politically, by putting a date out there, the First Minister teed up the fight she knows will fuel the  campaign.The election also led to a change in leadership for the Tories ndash two, in fact.The day after the EU vote, which she had assured the nation would never take place as the UK would be out on March , Theresa May finally croaked her resignation statement in Downing Street.Unable to get Brexit done, her fractious party had done her in instead.Her departure triggered a fateful contest to find a new Tory leader.Boris Johnsonrsquos win was never in doubt.In July, Health Secretary Jeane Freeman cancelled the opening of the new poundm Sick Childrenrsquos Hospital in Edinburgh at five daysrsquo notice after tests found inadequate ventilation systems had been installed. There were now hospital scandals at both ends of the M.In August, politicians seemed to take over the Edinburgh Fringe, with Ms Sturgeon, Ruth Davidson and John McDonnell all popping up, the latter to announce Labour would not stand in the way of Indyrefit won power.Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard, who had vowed to resist Indyref, was humiliated, then rapidly toed the shadow chancellorrsquos line.It was a necessary calculation by UK Labour ndash it knew it wouldnrsquot be ing many Scottish MPs and needed SNP votes to govern as a minority ndash but it proved an early gt for PM Johnson.Ms Davidson saved her grand finale for the week the festival left town.Resigning after eight years as the Scottish Toriesrsquo most successful leader, she cited the demands of a young family, but also her ldquoconflict over Brexit.As she had backed three dferent candidates against him to be leader, that was code for Mr Johnson.She used her new-found freedom to become mired in a self-inflicted row over a pound,-a-day job at a London public relations firm, leaving many to wonder how she had acquired her reputation as a ldquodferent kind of Tory in the first place.August also saw Ferguson Marine in Port Glasgow go into administration after a long dispute between the yard owners and the state firm behind CalMac over a poundm order for two ferries that doubled in cost and timescale.A childrenrsquos ward at QEUH was closed to new admissions after three young patients contracted infections. The next month, Ms Freeman announced a public inquiry into the extent of building problems at the hospital and Edinburghrsquos Sick Kids.Health was now the running disgrace of the autumn. Although almost all the problems began before her time as Health Secretary, Ms Freeman faced repeated calls to resign.In November, the mother of Milly Main, who died at the Glasgow childrenrsquos hospital in September  aged , said she was % certain contaminated water was to blame.The Crown Office confirmed it was investigating the death of a three-year-old boy from around the same time. Ms Freeman put NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde into ldquospecial measures.A whistleblower revealed the board was warned of infection risks across the QEUH site before it opened in .In November, Mr Salmond appeared at the High Court in Edinburgh, where the full details of the charges against him, now slightly revised, were made public.Speaking outside, he said he would be pleading not guilty to all of them.In December, the Scottish Government faced more bad news on education, as Scotland slipped to its worst ever place in the international rankings for science and maths, though reading improved.In the dying days of the parliamentary year, Finance Secretary Derek Mackay admitted it would cost poundm more to finish the two ferries rusting at the now nationalised Ferguson Marine yard.The Government also announced it was ending the Abellio ScotRail franchise three years early because of concerns over value for money for a service that exasperated passengers.There were more delays to a poundm plan for superfast broadband. NHS waiting times for AE hit record lows. Economic growth was near stagnant.Yet Ms Sturgeon was still able to end the year on a bang thanks to the General Election. She put Indyref centre stage ndash at least at first ndash then switched to ousting Boris Johnson and stopping Brexit.She achieved neither. But the SNP harvested Labour votes and gained  seats plus a th won by an independent who will surelyto the party fold.The Scottish Tories, meanwhile, went backwards after saying the Union was on the ballot paper and urging people to use their vote to reject Indyref.But people saw through the distraction ndash a cross for the Tories meant more Boris and more Brexit, neither of which have endeared themselves to Scotland.That was their immediate concernndash Indyref will be for a later date.The most dramatic event ndash and Pyrrhic victory ndash of election night was the SNP ousting LibDemsrsquo leader Jo Swinson in East Dunbartonshire. The sight of one Remain party decapitating another must have gladdened Tory hearts no end.As in Mayrsquos European election, Scottish Labourrsquos collapse was profound.The party that won  million votes in the election of  under Gordon Brown and Iain Gray managed just half that under Mr Corbyn and Mr Leonard.Its share of the vote fell in every seat in Scotland, and it ended with .%, compared to .% in England.It is asScottish Labour supporters no longer sustain one party but have become a loose communal resource, an unlocked bank other parties can ransack for votes.Ms Sturgeon quickly used her gains to demand endless referendum powers for Holyrood. Her proposed date of later this year remains an insulting pretence, buta potent rallying cry all the same.With no sign of a turnaround in public services, a good constitutional ding-dong will be vital in keeping her airborne.However Mr Salmondrsquos trial also lies ahead. The fall-out may be what finally brings the First Minister back to earth."},{"url":null,"title":"coco-chanels-highland-love-nest-turned-luxury-hotel","story":"It has finally been sold and is set to be turned into a luxury hotel.The crumbling B-listed Rosehall Estate in Sutherland with a pound. million price tag, has been in need of a buyer since .

Unless that changes, Orkney will be left with the oldest fleet and the highest fares in the country — and that can only be described as blatant discrimination.”The government’s failure to fund the ageing inter-island ferry fleet has left Orkney’s most remote and vulnerable communities with an inferior service compared to other areas in Scotland claimed Councillor Stockan.Following a y battle, the council secured £. million in additional government funding for internal ferry services for   — described by Councillor Stockan at the time as the “most signicant financial breakthrough” made by the council in years.The air of positivity failed to last however.OIC say they need £. million to run services in the current financial year — £. million more than the Scottish Government allocation.“This is a burden that most other Scottish councils do not have to bear,” Councillor Stockan continued. “The greater the burden placed on the council to keep the ferries running, the greater the risk of severe cuts to other vital services our community depends upon.“We need a long-term commitment from the government to fully fund the cost of running the service and replacing vessels with modern, cheaper-to-run ferries of a standard you would expect on routes as important as these.”RET was also in Councillor Stockan’s sights.The tarf, which would see cheaper fares for all when travelling across the Pentland Firth, has been mired in legal proceedings with Pentland Ferries making a complaint to the European Commission.From the outset, those at Holyrood said they were committed to see the scheme introduced within the first six months of . However, there appears to be no resolution in sight as we now head into .“It is outrageous that we in Orkney are still waiting for RET and that there appears to be no urgency or political will from the Government to resolve this.“Again, this is a clear case of discrimination against Orkney and our community will find it abominable that the money the government has saved by failing to introduce RET on our routes has been spent where — when it could have been committed to supporting our internal ferry service.“This is why I have written to the First Minister and appealed for her to intervene and ensure that Orkney is treated as fairly as other coastal communities with leline ferry services.”In response, a Scottish Government spokesperson indicated that the government was committed to finding a resolution to the issues raised.The spokesperson said: “At present, Orkney Islands Council are wholly responsible for the inter-island ferry services which they provide.#However, the Scottish Government understands the signicant financial challenges that can fall on inidual local authorities and we have made clear our commitment to Orkney internal ferry services with the provision of additional revenue funding support totalling £. million in the last two years.“We continue to discuss long term solutions with both Orkney Islands Council and Shetland Islands Council. We established a working group to examine these issues and we are now in receipt of the final report which we are currently considering.”The spokesperson continued: “It is the responsibility of inidual local authorities to manage their own budgets and to allocate the total financial resources available to them, including on ferry services, on the basis of local needs and priorities, having first fulfilled their statutory obligations and the jointly agreed set of national and local priorities.“Ultimately, it is for locally elected representatives to make local decisions on how best to deliver services to their local communities.“Ministers remain committed to pursuing all avenues to deliver RET for Orkney and Shetland, however, the first step is to resolve the complaint that Pentland Ferries have made to the European Commission.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

But away from Stormont it’s clear that the PSNI and its still relatively new Chief Constable have a lot of work to do in order to undo the damage done in what’s been a year of reversals and missteps for an organisation that appears to have lost its direction and purpose. Not to put too fine a point on it, it’s been a disaster for the PSNI vis a vis its relationship with the nationalist community. The support the new policing arrangements were given to allow devolution to forge ahead was contingent on a number of factors, most of which have either fallen by the wayside or are being flagrantly disregarded. At the most basic level, the urgent requirement for the policing service to reflect the community it serves has never been met –on the contrary, it now appears to be in reverse with calls growing for ato - recruitment. Coming two decades after the formation of the PSNI, this is desperately disappointing and places a question mark over the very concept of fair and balanced policing. But to make things immeasurably worse, the performance of Simon Byrne in the top job has led many to question the wisdom of his appointment. Any casual observation of recent history will reveal that there is no appetite within the nationalist political family for knee-jerk targeting of new PSNI Chief Constables. But when the PSNI needs to be held to account it is held to account in a robust and positive manner – the legacy issue being a recurring source of contention. But in the seven months since Mr Byrne took on the role, we’ve seen an extraordinary series of what we might charitably call unfortunate events – some cynical and deliberate acts, some common or garden incompetence – which have been incredibly debilitating to law and order in the north and which mean that the coming year is one in which his ability to see out his contract is going to be put under very serious scrutiny. First and most worrying is Mr Byrne’s increasing determination to use the PSNI as a bulwark against progress on the aforementioned legacy issue. His decision to go the Supreme Court to appeal adverse rulings on legacy investigations has seen him park the PSNI tank on the lawn of victims and survivors. His extraordinarily brutish threat to take children away from their parents quite frankly left some experienced observers here open-mouthed in astonishment. And his handling of summer bonfire issues – in particular the Avoniel and New Lodge stand-offs – underlined concerns around whether he’s possessed of the necessary insight and tactical nous to lead the PSNI forward. And to put the tin hat on an annus horribilis for policing here, Mr Byrne decided to pose for a Christmas pic with heavily armed officers at Crossmaglen barracks, to the consternation of nationalist politicians. Entirely unsurprising entirely unacceptable.

No worries. I can’t even think of how I’ll start pronouncing your very dficult Irish first name. Foreigners will take time to digest the following Gaelic names: Caoimhe, Oisín, Siobhán, Niamh and a host of others. There is a historical context to this and this could just be the colonial remnants that were left in Africa as official languages! But that’s not an excuse, we must spell your names correctly and we hope you compliment migrants likewise. Udhi nade jo Belfast  . Its dholuo language spoken by people of the Luo community. The Luos were split around the East African borders of Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda South Sudan by migration southwards and during the remapping of Africa in . That’s a story for another day. Luo is among hundreds of dferent African languages and dialects spoken in Belfast. Most Africans are in many cases authoritatively bilingual, spoken and written, no supernatural powers there, just a fact of le and that’s before you include the colonial language English, French etc, so effectively trilingual. In many encounters Africans residing in Ireland are often politely teased with the query, can you speak African please  Honestly, we don’t get offended by that question, generally the interlocutor would probably have assumed that “Africa” is a Pan-African language. I wish! The continent has over , languages, dialects and subcultures. Notwithstanding, the four countries listed above are just a small fraction of African nationalities in Belfast. There are many. The population of perhaps the total sum of  African countries as represented in Belfast could be in the thousands – although being hypothetical is not my cup of tea. West and North Belfast are probably the more African by headcount, followed by South and then East of the city. Some African countries are more visible than others here and we shall come to that in one of my future writings here at Andersonstown News. I just can’t wait. There is so much to explore in the lives of Africans in West and the rest of Belfast when you are inside the broth, it is the freshness you will get in this column moving forward, the smell, beauty and finesse of Africa. Having authored articles on migration in this past decade, it will certainly be a new environment to revisit, new faces, adults and also growing youthful population of first, second and third generation people who were either born in Africa or strongly identy with the continent because of family ties, social or legal reasons. n Elly Omondi Odhiambo is a freelance writer based in Belfast."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"health workers begin 12 hour","story":"THOUSANDS of health workers across the north have begun -hour strike action in a dispute over pay and patient safety.The Royal College of Nursing, who represent around , nurses, are taking strike action for the first time in its -year history.About , other nurses, who are members of Unison have also walked out.On Tuesday night, leaders of the five main parties met the head of the NI Civil Service, David Sterling, and Health Department Permanent Secretary, Richard Pengelly, in a th-hour bid to avert the strike action and state their “collective support for the restoration of pay parity”.The Northern Ireland Office later said that Health was a devolved matter and Mr Sterling rejected the idea of restoring pay parity on the grounds of public interest.UNISON Regional Secretary Patricia McKeown said: “Everyone with power and authority in this society has conceded that our cause is just.

Mr Caraher had been the victim of systemic harassment by the RUC in the lead-in to the Royal Marines shooting him dead. The harassing RUC were based at Crossmaglen Barracks. Sited beside Crossmaglen Rangers GAA club, RUC officers and British army soldiers had to be flown in via helicopter in military operations. All while the people who actually lived in the place trained, played and socialised in the GAA grounds on its doorstep. It was a physical epitome of occupation. Social media at Christmas is usually the pretty standard fare of hope and goodwill to all. Sadly, the PSNI’s Chief Constable social media was a wholly dferent offering, echoing Christmases Past in South Armagh. His pictures came from Crossmaglen , a strange choice of venue given the PSNI barracks in Crossmaglen has transformed from the days of conflict and is only open a few hours a week. Tuesday and Thursday from am-pm and on a Saturday from pm-pm. Not Wednesdays, not Christmas Day . But it was not the out-of-hours visit that caused people to stop in their tracks. It was the picture of Mr Byrne with four of his colleagues, two of them posing with heavy-duty rles. It was reminiscent of the heavy, dark days of conflict when the RUC would stand posing in their militarised version of disgraced policing. And all of the resulting echoes of the RUC, militarisation, shoot-to-kill and disgrace evoked by those photographs were heard loud and clear on Christmas Day as we read the tweet in disbelief. The response was unanimous from the population of Crossmaglen and the politicians that represent it: that it was ill-judged at best, and in no way reflected the contextual reality for modern policing. The wider response from commentators, journalists and others on social media was equally swt. This was an unwarranted, unhelpful and bizarre tweet and another misstep from a tone-deaf Chief Constable. This was in further evidence on St Stephen’s Day when he refused to withdraw the tweet and issued a statement justying the display of heavy weaponry as reflecting the terrorist threat his officers operate with. Presumably on Tuesday and Thursday mornings and Saturday evenings. It insulted the intelligence of anyone with half a genuine concern. His response displays the signs of a a weak man trying to act hard and when called out refuses to accept responsibility and blames the “bad boys”. The six counties have never had acceptable policing. Policing has always operated at dferent stages of history to reinforce British occupation: the Protestant State for a Protestant People since partition British military policy during the conflict and extremely sinister policies of shoot to kill and collusion. The PSNI is meant to be the new beginning we deserve and need. Human rights-compliant, accountable, community-based, responsive and supported policing that meets our needs as a community in its entirety. Many of us have tried to make that potential a reality. This Chief Constable doesn’t get it and, most worryingly of all, he appears to be too arrogant in his approach to learn. If policing was in crisis under George Hamilton for its defence of the RUC, which it was, then things have worsened under the clueless Mr Byrne."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"welcome organisation be kind to those living on the street","story":"I meet with Welcome Organisation CEO Sandra Moore in a room stacked from floor to almost ceiling of sleeping bags, which I’m told, have been donated by the Marine Society and Sea Cadets. Most,not all, of these will be gone over the coming nights to those sleeping rough in the city centre. Offering tea and coffee on tap from am until pm at their Townsend Street HQ, Sandra told the Andersonstown News that the need for their service is very much “ days a year”. “We have service users coming to us with ious needs, whether it’s clothes, a cup of tea or somewhere to have a bit of refuge. We do make targeted appeals throughout the year via our Facebook page and we do have people ringing to ask is there anything in particular we need. We always need decent trainers, sturdy, durable. We can’t hold out to jeans, in smaller sizes of waist, new underwear on which there is a massive demand all year round, socks and toiletries. “We can’t hold out to coffee, tea, sugar, washing powder, toilet roll, those things make a big dference to us,” she said.“We would ask for those who are donating that there is a reasonable le left in the items they want to give. We always have a need for sleeping bags and we don’t distribute tents on the streets as they would pose a danger.”Established  years ago, the Welcome Organisation has provided a vital shelter for those sleeping rough and who are experiencing homelessness. Sandra spoke of how the need for the service has “changed dramatically” in that time.“We are dealing with a greater number of people, people with more signicant issues, drug, alcohol, mental health, not all the people we work with do, its some, not all. What we are finding is that the age profile of those seeking the service is much younger, and there are more women coming to the Organisation. When I came  years ago we had six women in service. Now a third of our service users are female.”She continued: “We are working with homelessness in its most chronic form. We can’t forget that there is hidden homelessness. By that I mean people sleeping on sofas, moving from pillar to post. Nobody has a handle on that. One in  people within their le in Northern Ireland will experience homelessness. Le expectancy of someone who has had periods of continuous homelessness is  for a woman and  for a man.”Sandra said that currently those service users at the centre are predominantly young males from North and West Belfast.As  comes to a close, Sandra said that the issue of homelessness is facing a constant struggle in the New Year.“All services are facing pressure, lack of mental health services, lack of drug and alcohol support service and not just in Belfast, right across the North. We do not have detox or rehab facilities here, what services are there, due to severe pressures, aren’t responsive enough. We are trying to bridge that gap. It’s quite evident right across the city that there is a growing drug problem, there is a real need for education in communities. “People have to bear in mind that there is a back story to each and every person who is homeless. This is someone’s son, somebody’s daughter. Nobody has ever set out on that path. What child do you ask and they say ‘I want to be ill’, ‘I want to be struggling with addiction’, ‘I want to be homeless’. It’s not an aspiration but unfortunately it’s were we are. In Belfast I think we have a chance to not end up like Dublin, like London, the big cities. We still have a chance of doing something to contain it, but the agencies need to work together.”“No-one knows what the budget is for Ireland next year. How can you possibly plan while we have no minister for finance or minster for health  We, along with others, are highly dependent on the good will of the public, we couldn’t survive without the public,” she said. “I’ve been here  years and every year I am still overwhelmed by the generosity of people, people are very kind, however homelessness is an issue  days of the year.”Sandra said the levels of increased poverty within households job losses and the impact of Universal Credit are contributing factors to homelessness. “Regardless of whatever way Brexit goes, the economy is shrinking again, there is higher unemployment. “As my grandmother always said ‘when poverty comes in the door, love goes out the window’. We see so many times relationships breaking down because of the stresses of poverty linked to job losses. Statistics show that children growing up in poverty that their le chances are much worse. Someone who experiences homelessness as a child is much more likely to experience it as an adult – we need more preventive services going forward.”With the Organisation’s core team of staff, Sandra said that they couldn’t provide their service without their “ volunteers”. “We had  for Christmas dinner last year and so far we have wrapped over  Christmas presents,  of those bespoke for our regular users. We are inundated with people wanting to volunteer with us on Christmas Day – it’s a lovely day but it’s a hard day for a lot of people as you can imagine. We try to keep familiar faces around for the people that are coming in.“We just want to thank everyone for their continued support, we couldn’t do our work without it. We have a fantastic team of staff, of volunteers and the support of the public and the community. All I would ask is that people continue to be kind. That’s all I ask, is for people to be kind to those on the street. We don’t always know the story of how or why it has come to that.”For more information on the Welcome Organisation or to donate visit www.homelessbelfast.org"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"young people saying yes to yeha project","story":"ESTABLISHED over ten years ago, the YEHA Project has gone from strength to strength in helping young people in North Belfast.Based in the Flax Centre and the Houben Centre in Ardoyne, YEHA stands for Youth, Education, Health and Advice.The YEHA Project is made up of a small dedicated team of five full-time staff, sessional workers and a team of volunteers. One such youth worker is -year-old Cara O’Kane, who has been involved with YEHA Project for four years.Speaking to the North Belfast News, Cara explained more about the work of YEHA Project.“The YEHA Project supports young people in North Belfast aged  to  to tackle issues affecting their health and emotional well being,” she said.“Our work with young people embraces the core principles of youth work with therapeutic approaches.“Basically, we were set up over ten years ago to tackle health inequalities in North Belfast.“Our focus is on trying to get young people to focus on healthy lestyles and make positive and healthy choices regarding their wellbeing.“We do a lot of mentoring and support work where a young person would work with a youth worker informally centered around mental health and wellbeing. This may involve building coping skills and strategies for any dficulties they are facing in their le and looking at their interests and skills.“We want young people more involved in the community and activities instead of just going home after school as well.“It is about getting them out and about and giving them opportunities to try dferent things“We have had fantastic feedback from the young people themselves about the work that we do. They are testament to the work that they do themselves with our projects.“Our projects are all voluntary and everything is in the young person’s hands. Sometimes you have to step out of your comfort zone but the benefits are massive.The YEHA Project is also involved with cross-community work, alongside an organisation based on the Woodvale called Streetbeat Youth Project.Another successful project is the Carezone in Schools project, a pilot programme which is currently into its second year, based at Mercy College.Cara explained: “It is a model where we run one-to-one support within the school and have someone from YEHA project in the school daily to work with students in school.“After running a research programme, we found that over  per cent of young people would be more likely to speak to another young person about their problems rather than an adult.“We run the one-to-one mentoring service alongside a Peer Mentor programme where young people are trained up in Peer Mentoring to help support other young people on issues affecting their mental health and enables them to signpost to relevant support agencies.“It was a successful first year and last year we delivered  sessions to  pupils covering a range of issues including building coping skills and resilience, relationships, communication and social skills, health and well-being and anxiety.“We have a nice room in Mercy College where young people can come and relax and they are more likely to open up in such an environment.“It is all voluntary too, of course.”One young person, who took part in the programme, Jodie Shevlin, praised the benefits of it during the pressures of school exams.“The Carezone in Schools project is a way for pupils to distress and escape from the pressure of school work and exam,” she said.“The one-to-one work the project does is a chance for us to get worries or problems off our chest and be able to just have a more relaxed chat where we are really listened to.“It has really helped me get through my last few years of school.”YEHA ProjectFlax CentreArdoyne AvenueBelfast BT DATel:    "},{"url":null,"title":"adorable pup skye is one of many pets left at northern ireland shelters as unwanted christmas gifts","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Business leaders said no-deal would have proved disastrous. The farming community was facing devastation with the loss of EU subsidies coupled with new trade tarfs between north and south. Experts warned that farmers would be left facing bankruptcy.A real issue for all was the lack of clarity about what any potential Brexit would mean for Northern Ireland. Everyone had an opinion on what Brexit would mean. When Mr Johnson ed with his new deal from the EU, it became known as the Betrayal Act by loyalists who saw it as a threat to the Union. They claimed it put an economic border in the Irish Sea and meant Northern Ireland would be treated dferently to the rest of the UK.Disagreements about what it all means for Northern Ireland will continue in the next  months.July: Lowry wins at PortrushJuly saw the worlds best golfers and thousands of golf fans flock to the north coast as Royal Portrush hosted The Open for the first time in almost  years.The championship generated more than £ million of economic benefit for Northern Ireland, according to a study commissioned by organisers and proved a real boost to the tourist industry with hotels sold out and fans flocking to the scenic location from across the world - , fans arrived on the north coast with more than half coming from outside Northern Ireland.Shane LowryThe figures helped boost predictions that  will be a record breaking year for tourism in Northern Ireland with .m people expecting to have visited in the year.Irish winner Shane Lowry lted the coveted Claret Jug at the end of the event, six shots clear of nearest challenger, Englands Tommy Fleetwood.

The DUP suffered a third blow in North Down where the Alliance Partys Stephen Farry claimed the seat vacated by independent unionist Lady Sylvia Hermon.Nigel DoddsWhile the DUP finished the election down from  seats to eight, Sinn Fein saw their majorities slashed across Northern Ireland - Mr Finucanes win tempered by a crushing defeat for Elisha McCallion in Foyle.

He dedicated his le to fighting it. As an early leader in the Civil Rights movement, few have contributed as much to peace and equality on this island as Ivan.“Organising marches in Derry for the right to a home, to a job and the right to vote, Ivan often put himself in the path of danger to secure justice for people in the community.“On many occasions that meant he suffered vilication and violence for his convictions. Alongside his friend John Hume he helped blaze the trail that led to the Good Friday Agreement.“Ivan’s unwavering belief that people on this island should come together to fight for common ideals in their common interest remains a lesson for us all.” googletag.cmd.push Elderly couple terried by hate crime at CastledawsonAn elderly couple were left terried in July after a boulder was thrown the bedroom window of their home in broad daylight.A note, containing the names of four iniduals and a threatening message was attached to the rock used attack the pensioners home in Castledawson.Gwen and John Stewart who are both in their s were left badly shaken and unable to sleep by the incident which police treated as a sectarian hate crime.Former DUP MP for Mid Ulster, Rev William McCrea described the attack as “absolutely shocking.”It also emerged that the couple were forced to flee their home in Bellaghy  years ago also because of sectarian hatred.“This was not a child – it was someone with enough strength to hurl a boulder  foot from the front fence through a double-glazed window and then a further ten foot across a bedroom floor where it landed and cracked a wooden floor,” said Rev McCrea. googletag.cmd.push Shock following death of popular Kilrea GAC coachJuly began with the County Derry Post reporting the sad passing of well-known and popular Kilrea GAA coach Brian Calvert.Mr Calvert worked at Woodhall Education Centre in the east Derry town and was also a coach at Under  level for Padraig Pearse GAC.After news that Mr Calvert, who was in his s, filtered through tributes flowed in.SDLP MLA John Dallat described the late Mr Calvert as “inspirational.”“He was an extraordinary person in every sense, a person who had accomplished so much in his le and much of it with young people,” Mr Dallat added.And, Kilrea GAC senior coach Declan Bradley described Mr Calvert’s death as “truly heartbreaking.”“Brian radiated positivity in everything he did and that rubbed off on many of the players we coached together over the years,” he added.Kilrea GAC manager, Charlie Kielt also paid tribute to Brian Calvert.“It’s a massive loss to our club and community. He was such an energetic and positive man that had an uplting influence to all those in his company,” he said. Air pollution data goes unpublished for more than  monthsJuly  ended with the County Derry Post leading with the story that air pollution data for Dungiven had not been published for over a year.The last published data had shown the north Derry town had the highest levels of pollution in the area.The issue has blighted Dungiven for many years because of the huge volume of traffic which traverses the town’s Main Street as a route from Derry to Belfast via the Glenshane Pass.However, it emerged that the only air pollution monitor had been technically dysal and as a result pollution data was not being captured. The last known data captured prior to the discovery of the issue with the monitor was in June . Anger over offensive graffiti at Catholic church Also, in July the County Derry Post reports public anger over the scrawling of sectarian graffiti on the wall of a church in east Derry.Spray painted vandalism at St Anne’s Oratory in Kilrea laid out insults to the pope and caused outrage amongst parishioners.Sinn Fein councillor Sean Bateson hit out at those behind the vandalism.“First and foremost, this is a sectarian hate crime and those responsible should be brought to book. Parishioners and locals are incensed by this disgraceful graffiti attack on St Anne’s chapel, which is nothing more than blatant sectarian vandalism.And, local SDLP representative Helena Dallat-O’Driscoll added her voice to the condemnation of the incident.“This sacrilegious attack by three iniduals wearing very distinctive tops should allow the PSNI to make quick arrests and bring charges for criminal damage and hate crimes.“The iniduals who have done this have probably blighted their own communities with messages of hate and it would be good to have them caught. “In the meantime we will redouble our efforts to make sure this is not repeated and to ensure there is no retaliation because that would be in no one’s name and would only serve the perverted thoughts of those who did this,” she said.

I was then sent to the City Hospital in Belfast with kidney disease that can lead to kidney failure.”“Deirdre wanted to donate her kidney but I was a bit concerned that she would encounter the same issues down the line, but she was adamant that she was going to do it,” Bernie told the County Derry Post. googletag.cmd.push Mid Ulster a ‘black spot’ for mental health services August  began with the County Derry Post reporting that the Mid Ulster district was a ‘black spot’ for accessing mental health counselling.According to statistics uncovered by campaign group Participation and Pratice of Rightsjust five referrals for counselling were accepted in the Magherafelt and Cookstown areas from a total of ,.Elsewhere in Northern Ireland, the number treated in Ballymena and Antrim were  almost , people were successfully referred in the Larne, Carrickfergus and Newtonabbey areas.The figures related to the period between April  and March .Karen McGuigan from the Draperstown based suicide prevention organisation STEPS said she found the figures “deeply disturbing.”“We know from our own experience as a community-based counselling provider that timely access to locally based, quality counselling can be le-saving for people in distress.

And, between April  and March , , food parcels were given out. A spokesperson for the Hope Magherafelt Foodbank told the County Derry Post: “We have found that we are feeding more families this year with benefit changes relating to Universal Credit, along with low income which both continue to be the main causes for crisis. The five-week wait for Universal Credit is just too long.” googletag.cmd.push -year-old girl makes selfless donation to help young cancer sufferersA very kind-hearted little girl from Drumsurn made a wonderful gesture in September to help seriously ill children.Brave Kellie Stephens cut-off her Rapunzel like locks to allow wigs to be made for girls her own age suffering from cancer. The school child had cm of her beautul blonde locks shorn to have the task completed.The St Matthew’s Primary School pupil decided to take the task on two years ago after she learned about the Little Princess Trust charity. Wanting to help as much as possible she told her mum that she would grow her hair and then have it cut off to help those who need it more.Kellie’s mum Martina said: “It was completely off her own bat, she just wanted to do it all herself. She is very, very brave.“About two years ago she said to me ‘mammy, I don’t want to get my hair cut anymore, because I want to give it to the children who lose their hair when they have cancer.’“To be honest I thought the notion would go off her and we never really talked about it again. Then a couple of months ago she said ‘mammy, I definitely want to do this, I’m nearly ready.’“She grew it long and it’s lovely. She’s getting it cut off right up to a tight wee bob. She might even have enough hair for two wigs.” Workers without jobs as travel giant collapsesStaff at a Co Derry branch of former travel industry giant Thomas Cook were left without jobs at the end of September when the firm collapsed. It was believed that around six workers at the Magherafelt branch of Thomas Cook were informed they were jobless after the company ceased trading.The Thomas Cook shop at Queen Street in the south Derry town had been operating for a number of years but a notice on the door said ‘This shop has been closed with immediate effect’.The note also directed customers who made travel plans through the store to a dedicated UK Civil Aviation Authoritysupport service. Loyalist victim says UFF mural is ‘hurtful and offensive’In September, the lone survivor of an Ulster Freedom Fightersattack in County Derry in the s told the Derry Post that the reappearance of a version of an infamous loyalist mural in Derry city was both “hurtful and offensive.”South Derry man Gerry McEldowney was left for dead at Castlerock in March  when a loyalist murder gang attacked him and his workmates as they arrived at a building site in the picturesque east Derry seaside town.But the re-emergence of a mural containing a skeletal figure dressed in a shabby military unorm wielding a sword in Derry’s loyalist Bonds Street area brought back dreadful memories for Mr McEldowney. The mural also contains the insignia of both the UFF and Ulster Defence Association and the words ‘Spirit of ‘’, the year in which the Castlerock attack was followed in October by the IRA bombing of the Shankill Road in Belfast but also the notorious ‘Trick or Treat’ massacre at Greysteel. Loyalist killer Torrens Knight was later jailed for his part in the killings in both atrocities in County Derry.

Whilst the overall interest in the Feis and competitor participation continues to be very strong, the crippling costs of paying for venues to stage the festival of music, song and dance is jeopardising its very existence.The senior members of Derry Feis Committee also levelled criticism at Derry City and Strabane District Council for what they said was a lack of help in sustaining the event which first took place in Easter Week .Music secretary Pat MacCafferty said: The Feis has been running at a loss of around of pound, a year and our past savings are running out fast. “Our bursaries are paid from this money. “We receive no public sponsorship of any sort, our income is from private sources. Its just natural wastage and we just cant keep it up. We cant afford it anymore.”Registrar Ursula Clford told the Derry News: I dont know how many meetings weve had with the Council. “They promise the world but we get nothing. googletag.cmd.push Austins redevelopment inches closerThe iconic Austins building in Derry city centre was undergoing inspection to ensure that it was structurally sound ahead of plans for future redevelopment.Remedial works to remove asbestos from the building were completed and the next step was to survey the building before detailed designs could be drawn up. Reoccupation will then be considered in due course.Brendan Duddy, of the City Hotel Group, which owns the building, explained: “We’re getting people in there to check the entire structure, to carry out a proper survey of the building. “We’ll naturally review that and then look at a way forward, we’re fairly confident that it’s in good shape but we have to look at it before we can decide on anything .

Ebenezer Scrooge wasnt the first fictional character to see ghosts at this time of year. In fact the tradition probably goes back further than Christmas itself. As the nights grow long and the year creeps towards its close its a natural instinct that people gather together. Its also natural that this time makes us think of people and places that are no longer here. These thoughts have often morphed into tales based on what we encounter at this time of year - winter, death and the eventual rebirth experienced in spring. googletag.cmd.push In Europe this was usually connected to the pagan rituals surrounding the winter solstice known as Yule. The shortest and darkest day of the year was viewed as a time when the dead would have access to the living. The telling of tales at Yuletide began to decline as TV took over as the main form of household entertainment, but it must also be remembered that when Dickens published A Christmas Carol in  the tradition of Christmas itself was also in decline. In fact, for most people in that era Christmas was a working day because the Industrial Revolution meant fewer days off for everyone. As a result, Christmas was considered relatively unimportant and no one really complained. googletag.cmd.push The beginning of disregarding Christmas had come courtesy of Oliver Cromwell around  years earlier. The puritanical Lord Protector of England who in the th Century was “on a mission to cleanse the nation of its most decadent excesses.” These excesses unfortunately included banning Christmas celebrations, its ghostly tales and traditions with even carols making his draconian hit list. Oliver Cromwell is of course remembered in Ireland for his other exploits including the deaths of thousands of people as the result of his orders. But despite his best efforts he failed to quell the traditions of folklore carried over from pre-Christian Ireland. In the Irish tradition, ghosts are called taidhbhse or tais and live in a place halfway between this le and the next. The spirits are held here by some earthly affection or unfulfilled duty or anger against the living. Those who die suddenly, more commonly than others, are believed to become haunting Ghosts. They go about moving the furniture, and in every way trying to attract attention. It was also believed that when the soul has left the body, it is drawn away, sometimes, by the fairies. Such souls are considered lost. If a soul eludes the fairies, it may be snapped up by the evil spirits. The weak souls of young children were especially in danger. In western Ireland for example, people sprinkled the threshold with the blood of a chicken when a very young child died so that the spirits may be drawn away to the blood. A ghost was also compelled to obey the commands of the living. One old tale said, the stable-boy up met the master going round the yards after he had been two days dead, and told him to be away with him to the lighthouse, and haunt that and there he is far out to sea still. Oscar Wildes mother who studied and wrote about the supernatural thought it was only spirits who were too bad for heaven, and too good for hell, who were caught halfway between paradise and damnation. It was also thought that the souls of the dead sometimes took the shapes of animals. They will sometimes take the forms of insects, especially butterflies. If you see one fluttering near a corpse, that is the soul, and is a sign of its having entered upon immortal happiness. The author of the Parochial Survey of Ireland, , heard a woman say to a child who was chasing a butterfly, How do you know it is not the soul of your grandfather. Spirits who remain inside houses can also take on many shapes, including that of the elf and sometimes also of a rat, cat, or black dog. In their natural state they are invisible to people, but they can become visible in these forms. They make a lot of noise in the house at night and live between the walls, in the attic or in the cellar, in the stable, in the shed, sometimes even in a large tree beside the house. These ghosts are not considered particularly intelligent, and remain friendly as long as they are treated well. They like to tease lazy people by pulling the blankets off their beds and sending icy drafts through the room. They also delight in knocking over milk pails and keeping people awake by constantly tapping on the walls. When made very angry, they become malevolent. Their noise making becomes unbearable they throw stones, the cattle become sick, drought or cold weather or continuous storms occur. They leave the house or farm only when it has been totally overwhelmed by disaster and is lost. And, there is a well-known local wintry ghostly tale which refers to The Lady in the Snow which is said to have happened on the outskirts of Derry. The story is of two children, a brother and sister who were playing in the snow near a small stream near Enagh Lough. They were making a snowman and gradually they moved closer and closer to the water until they were standing on the ice. A woman dressed in a grey coat and a fur muff approached them, warning them of the danger. She coaxed them back to the bank just as the ice began to crack. She asked where they lived and she advised them to go home. The little girl askedshe could walk home with them andshe could put her hands in the muff to make them warm. The woman put the muff on the little girl and they chatted as they walked. She told them that she had a little girl who went into the water through the ice and warned them to be careful. At the gate she took her muff back and watched them being greeted at the door by their mother. They were both pointing at the lady and gesticulating but the mother saw no one. However she went to the gate because the children were so convinced that a lady had walked home with them. On the snow there were only the footprints of her children. When the snow melted a muff was found near the lake. The little girl knew it was the one that the lady wore.

For decade upon decade, especially in rural Ireland, New Years Eve was about exactly that - staying in. New Year was never truly a big thing in Ireland - especially for farming communities for who the fortunes of the crops were all important. Irish New Year traditions in agricultural areas, such as they are, are all about the coming twelve months. One belief was that no water could be drawn from the well after the sun went down on New Years Eve. All the water required needed to be inside the house before that and none of it could leave the house until the next day. Defying this belief meant that the family would be faced with a drought in the new year. googletag.cmd.push There was also a tradition that no money could be spent on New Years Day. Nothing could be brought out of a home and anyone visiting should make sure they came bearing a gt. Giving something away meant giving your money away and surely no sensible person would do that. The stroke of midnight on December  carried traditions of its own. Being the first visitor to a house on New Years Day was a popular custom but the warmth of your welcome was largely dependent on the colour of your hair. Unless he arrived empty handed, a dark haired man would be greeted gladly because it was believed that he would bring plenty of good luck. However, a red headed womans arrival meant ill fortune evenher arms were weighed down with all the tokens of what was known as first footing - bread and coal. Red haired females apparently tended to stay at home on New Years Eve. googletag.cmd.push In fact to prevent bad luck, families sometimes sent out a dark haired member of the family immediately after midnight and had them walk back in though the door. All dark haired boys in the area would visit the houses and be welcomed with gts of sweets or money. Anything bad that happened on New Years Eve was considered more signicant the closer it was to midnight. It was believed that there was only a certain amount of luck in the world and everything that could be done to claim a share of it had to be done. It was also important to begin the New Year with a spotlessly clean house signying a fresh start to the New Year. New Years Eve was also known as “Oiacuteche na Coda Moacuteire,”- ‘the night of the big portion’ since people would eat a larger than normal meal to ensure food in plenty for the coming year. Another way of ensuring plenty was to make a cake which was then pounded against the door of the house three times while a prayer was said by the housewe. This would chase the bad luck out of the house and invite the good spirits in. In other areas the man of the house would take three bites out of the cake and then throw it against the front door, in the name of the Trinity and banish hunger from the house. After this the family would then gather up the fragments of the cake and eat it. Many farmers repeated this ceremony at the door of the byre to ensure plentul fodder for the cows. People tried to ensure that no food was taken away from the house on New Years Eve and beggars knew better than to approach a house looking for food. Another New Years Eve Irish tradition was that young girls put mistletoe under their pillows on New Year’s Eve, in hopes of dreaming about their future husband. On New Year’s Eve night, families would remember those who has passed away that year before by setting a place for them at the dinner table and leaving the door unlatched. Anyone entering the house after midnight by the front door would leave by the back door for good luck. Well into the evening on New Years Eve in Ireland there would always be a small group gathered around the fireplace, laughing and joking. Sooner or later, the conversation would turn to reminiscing about Ireland. The old ones, well on their way with a few glasses of the hard stuff, would get all misty-eyed as they remembered times past and the stories would begin in the light of just the fire and candles burning in the windowsill. There was also an Irish tradition of predicting the political future of the country by checking which way the wind blows at midnight on New Year’s Eve. If the wind is from the west, there is a chance that good fortune will reign that year. If the wind is from the east, however, the British will prevail.

On Sunday, Shefflin and Slaughtneil hurlers supremo Michael McShane will lead their troops into battle for the right toto GAAs Mecca later this month. While Slaughtneil have been the story of the club scene, batting on two fronts in the latter half of the decade, Ballyhale added another title in March, their seventh All-Ireland, crowning them as the undisputed Kings of club hurling. googletag.cmd.push Not since two goals from James Stephens Tadhg Dwyer in the  Kilkenny semi-final have the Shamrocks lost a championship game. They have won all  games since. After conquering Ulster for the first time, the Emmets went down to Cuala by  points. Twelve months later they had Na Piarsaigh on the ropes before losing their footing and slipping out of the All-Ireland race by seven points, despite the Limerick champions going down to  men after half-time. After their third Ulster success and a commanding performance against Dunloy in the decider, Slaughtneil are more streetwise, have developed into a better all round team and have been able to concentrate solely on the wee ball. googletag.cmd.push With the calendar moved forward, preparations needed tailored. After the celebrations died down, the black smoke was blown out of the system before it was time to get back to the grindstone. A trip for a challenge game against a Wexford select, was followed by a free-scoring clash with Antrim as McShanes side sharpened their focus. Their preparations continued with a game against Ulster junior champions Coleraine. A long-term injury to Paul McNeill has robbed McShane of one of his key defensive cogs. Especially when a glance at the Ballyhale attack has two time all-star forward Colin Fennelly outside their top five scorers, though he has been central to their ability to carve out goal chances. Its common to see him hunting down defenders in possession, something that has been the cornerstone of Kilkennys success at senior level. They will meet their match this weekend. The Emmets never lack desire. Its the balance of Ballyhales attack that provides the wow factor. TJ Reid picked up an injury in their opening round win but amassed - across the campaign. Adrian Mullen, Eoin Reid and Brian Cody need watching, while the name of Eoin Codywill also have figured when Slaughtneil formulate their match-ups. Shane McGuigan could well see himself anchoring the defence, with Karl McKaigue keeping an eye on Ballyhales goal-poacher Eoin Cody. It was the Emmets defence that excelled in their win over Dunloy, winning every inidual battle with the confidence of goalkeeper Oisin ODoherty back between the posts. The surroundings of Newry, the scene of their best performance to date, will give Slaughtneil an advantage. They are unbeaten in championship action there, following their memorable All-Ireland football semi-final win over St Vincents and emerging victorious in a war of attrition against Kilcoo. A glance at the scorelines from Ballyhales seven game path to Sundays showdown points to a generous concession rate that will have no doubt struck a chord during Slaughtneils scouting. Likewise, there will be a concern over how much they squandered in the first-half against Dunloy. A similar story on Sunday wont cut the mustard. The Shamrocks defence has a Liam McCarthy winning theme to its spine. Centre-back Michael Fennellyand full-back Joe Holdenhold Celtic crosses and the experience that brings. Mark McGuigan is likely to tuck into midfield,Gerald Bradley drops back to the sweeper role where he excelled against Dunloy. Playing with a two man half-forward line would be a cause of concern for the Derry champions. Ballyhale wing-backs Evan Shefflin and Richie Reid have chipped in with points. Shefflin also raids forward from defence and his uncle Henry may ponder the idea of pushing him up on Gerald Bradley. Reidmissed the Leinster final due to a tour of duty in Lebanon with the Irish Army but was home on leave over Christmas. He is expected to take a place in the starting line-up, with brothers TJ and Eoin. His long deliveries into their inside attacking unit is another aspect of his game. It all points towards a need for Slaughtneils attacking unit to click. Its their toughest test of the clubs history by some distance. But they have a knack of always delivering a performance. They thrive on adversity and their golden generation of slick hurlers have proven they can dine at hurlings top table. Their performance against Dunloy was billed as the best in Michael McShanes tenure. They will need the same on Sunday...and more. Verdict: Ballyhale Key Men: Slaughtneil – Shane McGuigan In their Ulster final win over Dunloy, McGuigan was a considerable presence at centre-back but still carried out a man marking job on Keelan Molloy. On Sunday, he could be tasked with picking up Ballyhale go-to man TJ Reid. McGuigan is strong in the air, is a big occasion player and his ability to create space as a footballer forward could help him hone in on Reids ghosting game. Ballyhale – TJ Reid Reid has led the way on the scoring front for Ballyhale but he has stepped into the role of puppet master since Shefflin hung up his hurl. He can surge to the wing to offer himself as a puck-out target. His frees are unerring and Slaughtneils tackling will need to be sheer perfection. However, Reid offers the Kilkenny giants so much more. He picks up ball from his defence and his vision for a pass can unlock defences.

They needed late points and replays to see off Faughanvale and Steelstown respectively. After a draw in the league, both teams were destined to reach the final and did so with little fuss. Drumsurn came back from the brink to see off Ballerin and did push Claudy in the semi-final. The final was the clash all the neutrals wanted and once they found their feet, it was Foreglen who come out on top. In Ulster, they pushed eventual winners Magheracloone to the pin of their collar but left themselves with too much to do. googletag.cmd.push  - Kieran ReillyReilly produced the save of last years championship against Loup and he repeated the feat this year.His fulling save denied Lissans Shea McKernan and he got a glove to Harry Fosters shot to turn onto the bar. Both were jaw-dropping moments that backed up his confident array of kicking.[st All-Star]  - Tiarnan WoodsThe former Derry minor captain, one of Drumsurns up and coming young guns, had a fine season.In the opening round, he was part of a defensive unit that held Slaughtmanus to just five points.Against Ballerin, it was his ability to open up his running game that offered Drumsurn an attacking threat from deep. Then, against Claudy he was superb, being edged for man of the match by Marty Donaghy.[st All-Star] googletag.cmd.push  - Cathal OHaraOnce they got over their blip in the opening round against the Vale, Foreglens defence shut up shop and Cathal OHara was at the heart of it.Despite carrying an injury, he soldiered on and was a mainstay of their run to the title. He held Aaron Kerrigan to a point from play in the final and was immense against Castledawson in the semi-final, typied by two tremendous blocks.[st All-Star]  - Niall KeenanBurst onto the scene as the Dawson won the  championship and the  player of the year was pivotal on their way back to the semi-final stage.After helping his side keep a clean sheet against Craigbane, he held both Dermot Breen and Adie Trainor scoreless against Desertmartin.Despite going out to eventual winners Foreglen, Keenan helped his side to another shut-out. It seems like he has been about forever.[rd All-Star]  - Blaine CarlinWith Claudys championship hopes on rocky ground in their round one replay against Steelstown, Carlin came to his sides rescue.An underage career as a forward gave him an eye for goal and he has been an extra attacking weapon on the wing. When he found the net twice in quick succession, Claudy reeled Steelstown in and their rescue mission was complete.[st All-Star]  - Oisin DuffyWhen Foreglen bowed out of Ulster, Ozzies tally of - epitomised his attacking game as he tried to lead his side over the line.Claudy had put Eoin McGahon on him in the county final, as a marker almost, but Duffy was still able to get forward.In the Doire Trasna game he dictated their short kick-out routine, kicked three points and pulled a brilliant save from goalkeeper Durkan. Another inspirational season. [th All-Star]  - James OKaneSally notched his only score of the championship in the semi-final win over Castledawson, but he offered Foreglen so much more.This was the season their unsung hero grabbed his portion of the limelight for an all-action performance in the county final. Two fullblocks inspired those around him and he flung himself on breaking ball after breaking ball. [st All-Star]  - Mark McCormickHe was selected twice earlier in the decade and put in a seismic sht as Foreglen title took the title.His penalty began their redemption against Faughanvale in the drawn game. He amassed - over the championship, including two equalisers during the course of the final before Foreglen eventually broke Claudys resolve.[rd All-Star]  - Daryl MullanThe battering ram, charging into opposing defences and with an eye for goal.After getting himself into the shape of his le, he helped lead a young side back to the semi-finals. Formed part of the wall across the middle that stled Ballerin and it was his point that ignited the comeback. Claudy played Drumsurn a compliment by strategically by-passing him with their kick-outs. [st All-Star]  - Eoghan DuffyHis consistent championship performances caught the eye of new Derry boss Rory Gallagher.Armed with boundless energy, he was the link between Foreglens formidable defensive unit and their talisman Kevin OConnor.He was a contender for man of the match in every game and was edged out for player of the year by Marty Donaghy.[nd All-Star]  - Marty DonaghyNugget may well have played his last game for Claudy but he had a sensational championship campaign, scoring - along the way.But he offered the Mitchels so much more. He was a constant outlet and with his trademark dummy, he was able to buy space to lead the attack.The injury he sustained in the final all but ended his hopes of a second medal.[nd All-Star] - INTERMEDIATE PLAYER OF THE YEAR  - Sean OConnorOConnor delivered when the chips were down, the man for all occasions. He was an effective half-forward but was called back into defence as their championship race heated up. After Shane Duffys injury, he kept Aidan Keenan quiet in the semi-final. In the final, he was moved back onto the rampant Oran Armstrong to help put a lid on Claudys attacking threat.[nd All-Star]  - Aaron KerriganGets the nod ahead of Oran Armstrong due to his red card in the Steelstown drawn game.Kerrigans late free earned Claudy a replay and with three goals to his name, Kerrigan pushed Kevin OConnor for top-scorer. His precise pass put his brother Shea through to win a penalty against Drumsurn which Aaron tucked to the net to put Claudy on their way to the final.[rd All-Star]  - Kevin OConnorWith - to his name, he is the top scorer all three football championships.He bagged - in their draw with Faughanvale and it was his defence-splitting pass that set-up Kevin Dunne for his goal in the replay. Handed rookie Callum McElhinney a baptism of fire in the county final and was unerring in their defeat to Magheracloone. No better man to lt the cup.[rd All-Star]  - Gary KeaneOne of the most gted forwards in the county and a real finisher.He notched - as Ballerin turned the tables on Ballymaguigan in round one and it was his inch-perfect pass that played Paul Ferris in for his goal.In the quarter-final against Drumsurn, he had the ball in the net twice in the opening half.But when Ballerins midfield were outplayed after the break, Keanes influence waned and they missed him.[rd All-Star]   If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

They needed late points and replays to see off Faughanvale and Steelstown respectively. After a draw in the league, both teams were destined to reach the final and did so with little fuss. Drumsurn came back from the brink to see off Ballerin and did push Claudy in the semi-final. The final was the clash all the neutrals wanted and once they found their feet, it was Foreglen who come out on top. In Ulster, they pushed eventual winners Magheracloone to the pin of their collar but left themselves with too much to do. googletag.cmd.push  - Kieran ReillyReilly produced the save of last years championship against Loup and he repeated the feat this year.His fulling save denied Lissans Shea McKernan and he got a glove to Harry Fosters shot to turn onto the bar. Both were jaw-dropping moments that backed up his confident array of kicking.[st All-Star]  - Tiarnan WoodsThe former Derry minor captain, one of Drumsurns up and coming young guns, had a fine season.In the opening round, he was part of a defensive unit that held Slaughtmanus to just five points.Against Ballerin, it was his ability to open up his running game that offered Drumsurn an attacking threat from deep. Then, against Claudy he was superb, being edged for man of the match by Marty Donaghy.[st All-Star] googletag.cmd.push  - Cathal OHaraOnce they got over their blip in the opening round against the Vale, Foreglens defence shut up shop and Cathal OHara was at the heart of it.Despite carrying an injury, he soldiered on and was a mainstay of their run to the title. He held Aaron Kerrigan to a point from play in the final and was immense against Castledawson in the semi-final, typied by two tremendous blocks.[st All-Star]  - Niall KeenanBurst onto the scene as the Dawson won the  championship and the  player of the year was pivotal on their way back to the semi-final stage.After helping his side keep a clean sheet against Craigbane, he held both Dermot Breen and Adie Trainor scoreless against Desertmartin.Despite going out to eventual winners Foreglen, Keenan helped his side to another shut-out. It seems like he has been about forever.[rd All-Star]  - Blaine CarlinWith Claudys championship hopes on rocky ground in their round one replay against Steelstown, Carlin came to his sides rescue.An underage career as a forward gave him an eye for goal and he has been an extra attacking weapon on the wing. When he found the net twice in quick succession, Claudy reeled Steelstown in and their rescue mission was complete.[st All-Star]  - Oisin DuffyWhen Foreglen bowed out of Ulster, Ozzies tally of - epitomised his attacking game as he tried to lead his side over the line.Claudy had put Eoin McGahon on him in the county final, as a marker almost, but Duffy was still able to get forward.In the Doire Trasna game he dictated their short kick-out routine, kicked three points and pulled a brilliant save from goalkeeper Durkan. Another inspirational season. [th All-Star]  - James OKaneSally notched his only score of the championship in the semi-final win over Castledawson, but he offered Foreglen so much more.This was the season their unsung hero grabbed his portion of the limelight for an all-action performance in the county final. Two fullblocks inspired those around him and he flung himself on breaking ball after breaking ball. [st All-Star]  - Mark McCormickHe was selected twice earlier in the decade and put in a seismic sht as Foreglen title took the title.His penalty began their redemption against Faughanvale in the drawn game. He amassed - over the championship, including two equalisers during the course of the final before Foreglen eventually broke Claudys resolve.[rd All-Star]  - Daryl MullanThe battering ram, charging into opposing defences and with an eye for goal.After getting himself into the shape of his le, he helped lead a young side back to the semi-finals. Formed part of the wall across the middle that stled Ballerin and it was his point that ignited the comeback. Claudy played Drumsurn a compliment by strategically by-passing him with their kick-outs. [st All-Star]  - Eoghan DuffyHis consistent championship performances caught the eye of new Derry boss Rory Gallagher.Armed with boundless energy, he was the link between Foreglens formidable defensive unit and their talisman Kevin OConnor.He was a contender for man of the match in every game and was edged out for player of the year by Marty Donaghy.[nd All-Star]  - Marty DonaghyNugget may well have played his last game for Claudy but he had a sensational championship campaign, scoring - along the way.But he offered the Mitchels so much more. He was a constant outlet and with his trademark dummy, he was able to buy space to lead the attack.The injury he sustained in the final all but ended his hopes of a second medal.[nd All-Star] - INTERMEDIATE PLAYER OF THE YEAR  - Sean OConnorOConnor delivered when the chips were down, the man for all occasions. He was an effective half-forward but was called back into defence as their championship race heated up. After Shane Duffys injury, he kept Aidan Keenan quiet in the semi-final. In the final, he was moved back onto the rampant Oran Armstrong to help put a lid on Claudys attacking threat.[nd All-Star]  - Aaron KerriganGets the nod ahead of Oran Armstrong due to his red card in the Steelstown drawn game.Kerrigans late free earned Claudy a replay and with three goals to his name, Kerrigan pushed Kevin OConnor for top-scorer. His precise pass put his brother Shea through to win a penalty against Drumsurn which Aaron tucked to the net to put Claudy on their way to the final.[rd All-Star]  - Kevin OConnorWith - to his name, he is the top scorer all three football championships.He bagged - in their draw with Faughanvale and it was his defence-splitting pass that set-up Kevin Dunne for his goal in the replay. Handed rookie Callum McElhinney a baptism of fire in the county final and was unerring in their defeat to Magheracloone. No better man to lt the cup.[rd All-Star]  - Gary KeaneOne of the most gted forwards in the county and a real finisher.He notched - as Ballerin turned the tables on Ballymaguigan in round one and it was his inch-perfect pass that played Paul Ferris in for his goal.In the quarter-final against Drumsurn, he had the ball in the net twice in the opening half.But when Ballerins midfield were outplayed after the break, Keanes influence waned and they missed him.[rd All-Star]   If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It also saw a change from the dominance of Slaughtneil and Ballinderry for most of the decade. The Emmets knocked out the Shamrocks before falling victim to Glens devastating running game in the semi-final. The Watties were unable to carry that form into the final where a Magherafelt team, while only winning by a point, were worthy winners of the John McLaughlin Cup. Away from the final, Banagher were the story that kicked the championship into le. Despite bring relegated without winning a googletag.cmd.push game, they dumped out Bellaghy and Swatragh before pushing Adrian Cushs side to the pin of their collar in the semi-final. - Daryl McDermottAfter picking up the intermediate goalkeeping spot last year and making the hurling selection, Sticks once again is honoured.He was the undisputed goalkeeper of the year. His kicking against Bellaghy was pin-point and ied. In their win over Swatragh he made two fantastic saves and Magherafelt would have been out of sight only for his brilliance. [nd All-Star]  - Conor McCluskeyWhile also a very capable baller, Clucker was Adrian Cushs go-to marker in defence.He was asked to shackle Colm McGoldrick when Darren ONeill was black-carded. He kept a lid on Peter Hagan in the semi-final while getting forward to add to their attacking arsenal. Jack Doherty and Ryan Johnston also struggled against him. Two messy Benny Heron goals, neither of them his fault, was the only blot on a perfect season. [st All-Star] googletag.cmd.push  - Brendan RogersLike goalkeeper McDermott, Roger is a dual selection.In the Ballinderry game, he did a marking job on Ryan Bell yet still was able to get Slaughtneil on the attack with his trademark barnstorming runs from defence.His absence from full-back left the door open for Glen to exploit but his one man crusade almost pegged the Emmets back to nip the Watties. [th All-Star]  - Fergal DuffinGets the nod ahead of Darren ONeill and was a vital cog in Magherafelts defence.Came out on top of his battle with Ruairi Mooney and he blotted out Conor Feeney on Banaghers kick-outs. He held Kilcoos Paul Devlin scoreless from play but it was his county final performance that stands out. Two moments of bravery to win turnovers that resulted in Rossa scores.[nd All-Star]  - Gavin ONeillCharlie OKane kept Bellaghy guessing with Gavin ONeills jersey number positioning and in his new wing back role, he was immense. The fact that he nicked man of the match ahead of Conor Feeney and Tiarnan Moore spoke wonders of his performance.Swatragh didnt learn the lesson and once again ONeill bossed the game from wing-back, edging the battle with Patrick Kearney.[nd All-Star]  - Connor CarvilleWhen Glen licked their wounds after their hammering in the league by Slaughtneil, it was Connor Carville that learned the most. Following Sammy Bradley left Glen open.In the championship he was a dferent animal and when Oisin Hegarty was dismissed against Loup he was one of Glens leaders.Against Magherafelt he was one of the few to offer any help to goalkeeper Callum Mullan-Young. Glen didnt have enough like him. [st All-Star]   - Conor KearnsWith Michael McEvoy going under the kne, Magherafelts system of play needed someone to link their defence to attack. Kearns fitted the bill and thrived in his new found freedom. He handled an endless supply of ball against Coleraine and didnt look back. His goal proved to be the vital score to sink Banagher. He didnt deserve his season to end prematurely with a harsh black card against Kilcoo. [st All-Star] - SENIOR PLAYER OF THE YEAR  - Danny HeavronThe Rossa skipper once again poured out everything he had for the cause.His influence helped them see off Coleraine and his moment of quick-thinking put Kearns through for the all-important goal against Banagher. In the final he pressed high on Glens kick-outs to turn the game. Against Kilcoo he once again linked the play and was missed during a brief spell at full-forward. [st All-Star]  - Ciaran McFaulAfter Loups goal it was McFauls point that made Glen believe again. When they were staring into a defeat against Lavey, he led the way again and his display of fielding was simply awesome. Against Slaughtneil he plucked another one from the air, just when Glen needed a moment of inspiration.Not as influential in the final as was required. Without him, Glen wouldnt have got there and given three more seconds. he wouldve forced a replay. [nd All-Star]  - Christopher BradleySammy led their scoring charts in the league and it was his accuracy that edged out a well-organised Newbridge in round one. When he found the net against Ballinderry, it cemented Slaughtneils place in the last four.Against Glen, he made their attack tick and was unlucky not be their last gasp hero but Oran McGills left foot denied him a potential winning goal and a county final spot.[rd All-Star]  - Danny TallonDespite being captain, he was replaced against Loup but took it on the chin and came back stronger.Kicked a point against Lavey and plucked two vital balls from the skies as Glen dug themselves out of another hole.He gave Keelan Feeney the runaround in the semi-final. A hamstring injury shadowed his preparation for the final, but he saved his best for last and put in a performance that deserved to lt the John McLaughlin Cup.[st All-Star]  - Emmett McGuckinHis goal against Coleraine kicked off Magherafelts route to glory, as he delivered in spades.Revelling in the freedom of midfield he made his side tick and his performance in the final, along with that of Odhraacuten Lynch, ended the Rossa famine. His scores broke Glens hearts.Kilcoo had no answer to him at full-forward and he didnt deserve to be on the losing side. [st All-Star]  - Francis KearneyDaniel McKinless and Paul Gunning can count themselves unlucky to miss out.Francis Kearney carried his league form into the championship. He was in red hot formover Swatraghs two games. If the Swa had been able to get a handle on Banaghers attack, his scoring power wouldve taken them to the last four. [st All-Star]  - Alex DohertyAnother contender for player of the championship, he pinged - from play and was Glens top scorer.His goal against Lavey was sensational. After beating three men on his road to goal, he powered to the net for the goal that arguably changed Glens season. Scoring - off Karl McKaigue is no mean feat and he backed it up with four mighty points in the final. [st All-Star]  - Tiarnan MooreOne year on from tearing intermediate defences apart, Moore was at it again. His tally of -, with one assist from brother Niall, tore the Bellaghy defence asunder as he revelled in the open spaces.While he didnt score against Swatragh he pulled their defence all over the place as Banagher once again made hay.His frightening pace was one of the stories of the championship.

It also saw a change from the dominance of Slaughtneil and Ballinderry for most of the decade. The Emmets knocked out the Shamrocks before falling victim to Glens devastating running game in the semi-final. The Watties were unable to carry that form into the final where a Magherafelt team, while only winning by a point, were worthy winners of the John McLaughlin Cup. Away from the final, Banagher were the story that kicked the championship into le. Despite bring relegated without winning a googletag.cmd.push game, they dumped out Bellaghy and Swatragh before pushing Adrian Cushs side to the pin of their collar in the semi-final. - Daryl McDermottAfter picking up the intermediate goalkeeping spot last year and making the hurling selection, Sticks once again is honoured.He was the undisputed goalkeeper of the year. His kicking against Bellaghy was pin-point and ied. In their win over Swatragh he made two fantastic saves and Magherafelt would have been out of sight only for his brilliance. [nd All-Star]  - Conor McCluskeyWhile also a very capable baller, Clucker was Adrian Cushs go-to marker in defence.He was asked to shackle Colm McGoldrick when Darren ONeill was black-carded. He kept a lid on Peter Hagan in the semi-final while getting forward to add to their attacking arsenal. Jack Doherty and Ryan Johnston also struggled against him. Two messy Benny Heron goals, neither of them his fault, was the only blot on a perfect season. [st All-Star] googletag.cmd.push  - Brendan RogersLike goalkeeper McDermott, Roger is a dual selection.In the Ballinderry game, he did a marking job on Ryan Bell yet still was able to get Slaughtneil on the attack with his trademark barnstorming runs from defence.His absence from full-back left the door open for Glen to exploit but his one man crusade almost pegged the Emmets back to nip the Watties. [th All-Star]  - Fergal DuffinGets the nod ahead of Darren ONeill and was a vital cog in Magherafelts defence.Came out on top of his battle with Ruairi Mooney and he blotted out Conor Feeney on Banaghers kick-outs. He held Kilcoos Paul Devlin scoreless from play but it was his county final performance that stands out. Two moments of bravery to win turnovers that resulted in Rossa scores.[nd All-Star]  - Gavin ONeillCharlie OKane kept Bellaghy guessing with Gavin ONeills jersey number positioning and in his new wing back role, he was immense. The fact that he nicked man of the match ahead of Conor Feeney and Tiarnan Moore spoke wonders of his performance.Swatragh didnt learn the lesson and once again ONeill bossed the game from wing-back, edging the battle with Patrick Kearney.[nd All-Star]  - Connor CarvilleWhen Glen licked their wounds after their hammering in the league by Slaughtneil, it was Connor Carville that learned the most. Following Sammy Bradley left Glen open.In the championship he was a dferent animal and when Oisin Hegarty was dismissed against Loup he was one of Glens leaders.Against Magherafelt he was one of the few to offer any help to goalkeeper Callum Mullan-Young. Glen didnt have enough like him. [st All-Star]   - Conor KearnsWith Michael McEvoy going under the kne, Magherafelts system of play needed someone to link their defence to attack. Kearns fitted the bill and thrived in his new found freedom. He handled an endless supply of ball against Coleraine and didnt look back. His goal proved to be the vital score to sink Banagher. He didnt deserve his season to end prematurely with a harsh black card against Kilcoo. [st All-Star] - SENIOR PLAYER OF THE YEAR  - Danny HeavronThe Rossa skipper once again poured out everything he had for the cause.His influence helped them see off Coleraine and his moment of quick-thinking put Kearns through for the all-important goal against Banagher. In the final he pressed high on Glens kick-outs to turn the game. Against Kilcoo he once again linked the play and was missed during a brief spell at full-forward. [st All-Star]  - Ciaran McFaulAfter Loups goal it was McFauls point that made Glen believe again. When they were staring into a defeat against Lavey, he led the way again and his display of fielding was simply awesome. Against Slaughtneil he plucked another one from the air, just when Glen needed a moment of inspiration.Not as influential in the final as was required. Without him, Glen wouldnt have got there and given three more seconds. he wouldve forced a replay. [nd All-Star]  - Christopher BradleySammy led their scoring charts in the league and it was his accuracy that edged out a well-organised Newbridge in round one. When he found the net against Ballinderry, it cemented Slaughtneils place in the last four.Against Glen, he made their attack tick and was unlucky not be their last gasp hero but Oran McGills left foot denied him a potential winning goal and a county final spot.[rd All-Star]  - Danny TallonDespite being captain, he was replaced against Loup but took it on the chin and came back stronger.Kicked a point against Lavey and plucked two vital balls from the skies as Glen dug themselves out of another hole.He gave Keelan Feeney the runaround in the semi-final. A hamstring injury shadowed his preparation for the final, but he saved his best for last and put in a performance that deserved to lt the John McLaughlin Cup.[st All-Star]  - Emmett McGuckinHis goal against Coleraine kicked off Magherafelts route to glory, as he delivered in spades.Revelling in the freedom of midfield he made his side tick and his performance in the final, along with that of Odhraacuten Lynch, ended the Rossa famine. His scores broke Glens hearts.Kilcoo had no answer to him at full-forward and he didnt deserve to be on the losing side. [st All-Star]  - Francis KearneyDaniel McKinless and Paul Gunning can count themselves unlucky to miss out.Francis Kearney carried his league form into the championship. He was in red hot formover Swatraghs two games. If the Swa had been able to get a handle on Banaghers attack, his scoring power wouldve taken them to the last four. [st All-Star]  - Alex DohertyAnother contender for player of the championship, he pinged - from play and was Glens top scorer.His goal against Lavey was sensational. After beating three men on his road to goal, he powered to the net for the goal that arguably changed Glens season. Scoring - off Karl McKaigue is no mean feat and he backed it up with four mighty points in the final. [st All-Star]  - Tiarnan MooreOne year on from tearing intermediate defences apart, Moore was at it again. His tally of -, with one assist from brother Niall, tore the Bellaghy defence asunder as he revelled in the open spaces.While he didnt score against Swatragh he pulled their defence all over the place as Banagher once again made hay.His frightening pace was one of the stories of the championship.

Facilitated by Marie Dunne, of Resilio, the event acknowledged the support provided to the Strengthening Families Programme by local professionals and illustrated the need for staff working in the community, voluntary and statutory sectors to look after their own mental health and wellbeing.The Strengthening Families Programme is an inter- nationally-proven, evidence-based family skills programme and whilst used worldwide for more than  years now it has been delivered locally since  by developing healthy communities, and is currently funded by Public Health Agency. Course delivery takes place through a team of trained facilitators drawn from a range of local agencies, who deliver parent, child and family sessions over a fourteen weeks period.For many people, raising children can be dficult unchartered territory, and it can be hard to find support. The Strengthening Families Programme helps parents identy risks that their teenagers face and help build in protective factors within the family home. The course was also designed to aid families build and strengthen their communication skills, identy and build on their strengths, family resilience and set clear rules and boundaries.Speaking at the end of the event, programme manager, Leona Bradley, said: “The Strengthening Families Programme not only provides excellent skills for families locally but also an opportunity for local agencies to work together in a unique interagency manner. “The team who help deliver Strengthening Families are not only hugely talented but their passion to improve the lives of people locally is inspiring. “Today was an opportunity to celebrate these staff and give them an opportunity to promote their own wellbeing and resilience. All too often we forget how much of themselves the community, voluntary and statutory sector workers give, particularly when working with families and young people and we are delighted to be able to give something back to them.’Praising the funders and the team of facilitators for the successful delivery of the course, she continued: ‘We would like to thank the Public Health Agency in funding this worthwhile programme and today’s event and acknowledge the hard work and dedication of the multiagency team of facilitators who successfully delivered the sessions.’This year a large-scale evaluation of the programme and its effects on local families has been commissioned by developing Healthy Communities.

He believes the EU budget will be “signicantly reduced” following the UK’s departure, which, coupled with the possible admission of other countries into the EU, will have a detrimental impact on the Republic of Ireland moving forward.The recent Westminster election results can be interpreted as giving voice to the exasperated desire of many people to see a Stormont Government up and running to try and deal with the extreme circumstances that abound in health, education and other sectors in our society. Another element has been seized upon by some in declaring that for the first time there are more Nationalist MPs than Unionist MPs elected. This disguises the more fundamental point that while some Irish republicans go into a frenzy about demographic change bringing with it the so - called inevitability of a united Ireland, they have avoided actual election results which show nothing like that outcome. In this year’s election there were first time voters who had not been born when I was first elected to Parliament in . In that Westminster election  years ago, the united Ireland parties, Sinn Fein and SDLP, obtained .% of the vote, while at last month’s Westminster election Sinn Fein, SDLP and Aontuacute got .%. Support for those parties that advocate a united Ireland is less now than it was when I was elected in . The much vaunted “demographic change” that republicans repeat ad nauseum has worsened their chances not improved them. The other more practical problem they face is that just as any pan unionist vision of an ultimate solution such as total integration within the UK wouldnt have been possible or practical whatever the majority voting for it may have been, just so any pan nationalist vision of an ultimate solution of a United Ireland would fail by the same criteria. The other big ticket item next year will be the Brexit proposition. Again, those who advocate staying in the EU through an impossible united Ireland have not been open about what lies aheadthey were to be successful. The EU budget will be signicantly reduced on an annual basis by the UKs net contributions of approximately poundbillion. Countries such as Serbia and Montenegro potentially joining in the next five or six years means the budget would become even more hard pressed let alone any fancul notion that an Independent Scotland would be re admitted pressurising those net contributing countries, such as the Irish Republic, for more money again. In short, staying in the EU in those circumstances would cost the Irish Republic much more than it is costing them now, anyone looking to join them should ponder that.  is the year we must press the new PM to give us a more equal United Kingdom as opposed to an even more expensive EU. googletag.cmd.push Gregory Campbell googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

He believes the EU budget will be “signicantly reduced” following the UK’s departure, which, coupled with the possible admission of other countries into the EU, will have a detrimental impact on the Republic of Ireland moving forward.The recent Westminster election results can be interpreted as giving voice to the exasperated desire of many people to see a Stormont Government up and running to try and deal with the extreme circumstances that abound in health, education and other sectors in our society. Another element has been seized upon by some in declaring that for the first time there are more Nationalist MPs than Unionist MPs elected. This disguises the more fundamental point that while some Irish republicans go into a frenzy about demographic change bringing with it the so - called inevitability of a united Ireland, they have avoided actual election results which show nothing like that outcome. In this year’s election there were first time voters who had not been born when I was first elected to Parliament in . In that Westminster election  years ago, the united Ireland parties, Sinn Fein and SDLP, obtained .% of the vote, while at last month’s Westminster election Sinn Fein, SDLP and Aontuacute got .%. Support for those parties that advocate a united Ireland is less now than it was when I was elected in . The much vaunted “demographic change” that republicans repeat ad nauseum has worsened their chances not improved them. The other more practical problem they face is that just as any pan unionist vision of an ultimate solution such as total integration within the UK wouldnt have been possible or practical whatever the majority voting for it may have been, just so any pan nationalist vision of an ultimate solution of a United Ireland would fail by the same criteria. The other big ticket item next year will be the Brexit proposition. Again, those who advocate staying in the EU through an impossible united Ireland have not been open about what lies aheadthey were to be successful. The EU budget will be signicantly reduced on an annual basis by the UKs net contributions of approximately poundbillion. Countries such as Serbia and Montenegro potentially joining in the next five or six years means the budget would become even more hard pressed let alone any fancul notion that an Independent Scotland would be re admitted pressurising those net contributing countries, such as the Irish Republic, for more money again. In short, staying in the EU in those circumstances would cost the Irish Republic much more than it is costing them now, anyone looking to join them should ponder that.  is the year we must press the new PM to give us a more equal United Kingdom as opposed to an even more expensive EU. googletag.cmd.push Gregory Campbell googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

But, is the colder weather having an impact on your sleep  Are you struggling to drt off or waking up feeling chilly  If so, don’t fear. Holly Housby, sleep expert from Sealy UK, is here to help with her top tips for sleeping when it’s cold. Take a bathNot just relaxing, having a bath before bed can actually help to promote sleep and induce tiredness. Your temperature naturally dips at night as your body prepares for rest, beginning about two hours before sleep. When you soak in a hot bath, your temperature rises by a degree or two, and the rapid cool-down immediately after the bath imitates this natural decrease of your body temperature, which can help you to fall asleep faster. googletag.cmd.push Wear woolly socks, not cottonOften, poor circulation means that our feet are the first part of our body to get cold. Wearing woollen socks can help to keep you warm throughout the night - unlike cotton, wool is an great insulator and retains heat. And even better, wool has anti-bacterial properties meaning your cosy socks are odour resistant. Get movingExercising in the late-afternoon and early-evening can help to boost your body’s circulation and body temperature. However, it’s important to steer clear of exercise in the hour before bed, so as to avoid this having an impact on your sleep. googletag.cmd.push Say no to a night-capNot only does alcohol limit the amount of time you spend in REM sleep, the most restorative stage of sleep, it’s been suggested that alcohol can actually contribute to a lower body temperature. This is because alcohol causes your blood vessels to dilate, which takes blood and heat away from the core of your body. If you still want to enjoy a nightcap in the evening, make sure you only have one, and have it as early in the evening as possible to minimise its effects at bedtime. Upgrade your TOGIt goes without saying that investing in a thick, cosy duvet is important to staying warm during the winter nights. As a rule of thumb, a winter duvet should have a tog rating of . – . However, it’s also worth considering the filling.Wool-filled duvets can be quite chunky, making a good choice the cold nights. However, there are also synthetic duvets which are manufactured from fibres that are designed keep you warm while you sleep, which can be a great choice for those looking for hypo-allergenic options.

His close friends and running colleagues tried every trick in the book to ascertain the route for the annual Castlewellan Christmas Cracker, but uncharacteristically lsquoThe Prophetrsquo remained tight-lipped and taciturn. The usual platitudes and prosaicisms were thrown out by way of appeasement, but they threw no light on the course that has been in the planning since January .Phrases like, lsquothere is something for everyonersquo, lsquothere will be a few good climbsrsquo, lsquowe will go through a field or tworsquo and lsquoI still have a few ditches to clearrsquo served only to add intrigue and mystique to the potential route.From am, parking spaces were snaffled up as the growing crowds made their way to collect their numbers, totally unaware of what lay ahead, another unique characteristic of this now iconic event.When we go to races we usually know what lies ahead as it will be the same as the previous year mdash not so with this one.This led to great speculation at registration and the passing of spurious rumours, lsquoIrsquove heard it is Foxes green firstrsquo, lsquoBunkerrsquos Hill is the first climbrsquo, lsquothe gates at Niall Kingrsquos place are open and that can only mean one thing!rsquoThose unwise enough to listen were tormented, while the more sanguine took it all in their stride realising that what would be would be.The atmosphere in the GAA club was electric and filled with excitement as every little corner became a changing space and in the middle of all of this Stevie Rice had set up a stall and had created a monopoly on udderrmint ndash an essential for the discerning runner.With space at a premium, one team had pre-booked the VIP changing facilities in Ned McCartanrsquos front room. Here the gracious, ebullient and effervescent host provided valet parking, bespoke carb-rich pre-race food, handed out warm fluffy towels and proffered words of wisdom and encouragement. The * package was completed with optional dog therapy ndash petting Socks.The  entries were snapped up in a few weeks, such is the popularity of this event among the NI running fraternity.Running in pairs is far from commonplace in what is largely an inidual sport and this certainly brings a welcome new dimension in that you are only as good as your partner and an ill-conceived or sentimental choice could see you standing waiting at the top of a hill, the bottom of a hill or at the finish.The secret lies in getting the right partner, one you know you can work with and whose running skills complement your own ndash a lesson that has still to be learned by a number of this yearrsquos participants.While the event is a great opportunity to dress up, socialise and enjoy the wonderful scenery that Castlewellan has to offer, the racing at the sharp end of the field is seriously fierce.From the moment they were set on their way at the bottom of the Circular Road, the cream rose to the top as the leading teams thundered their way through the town at breakneck speed.Getting good road position at the front is essential for the leading men and women.In , Newcastlersquos Lynch and Hanna were clear winners with a minute and a half to spare over Johnston and Scott of Mourne Runners, with McMullan and Stephens, from the host club, a further  seconds back in third.These three teams were paired once again, but had to settle for second, third and fth respectively. With Hanna in the form of his le and regularly representing Ireland in the hills and Lynch coming off a superb  minute k at the Seeley, they were the in-form team and pre-race favourites.However, favourites do not always win and on this occasion it was Aaron McGrady from East Down and his partner Andrew Barrington, originally from Oban in Scotlandwho emerged victorious.The pair, who run and race together for Victoria Park Harriers in London, were among a group of leaders along the Crow Road.As the course rose steeply after the Moorish Tower, the pair was second behind Lynch and Hanna as they hurtled through the fields towards the Bannanstown Road.As was the case in , the climb over the Playrock Hill would prove decisive and the eventual winners managed to pull away and open a winning lead.However, McGrady admits that once they hit the front, they had to work very hard over the last three miles as they knew the quality of the team chasing them.When asked about the course, the winner said that it was very dferent to previous years, was far less muddy than anticipated and despite the steep hills offered great opportunities for hard fast running.Overall, he considered it to be a well-planned and carefully balanced route. McKinstry was always in contention, but his partner suffered terribly and put paid to their chances of the win ndash they would finish fourth overall.Beechmount Harriers claimed the ladiesrsquo team prize with Sarah Laverty and Catherine Diver finishing in an excellent th place overall ndash all that training up the hill in Falls Park paid off.They were joined on the podium by Hannah Somani and Georgina Wileyand Amanda Perry and Denise Logue .In the mixed category there was a great win for Shalene McMurray and David McNeilly who were th overall and comfortably clear of their nearest challengers and club mates Mari Troeng and Frank Cunningham. Karen Wilton and Andrew Wills of Jog Lisburn completed the mixed team podium.There were male, female and mixed category winners dotted throughout the field and these are highlighted in the results file available on the Newcastle AC website . Well done to everyone who won a prize.Some of the fancy dress was simply amazing and added greatly to the sense of fun that is central to this race. Special mention to the Power family who once again dressed to impress and the three sheep bleated their way around the course under the ever-watchful eye of Bo Peep, the Newry AC crew who were came as the cast of lsquoIrsquom a Celebrityrsquo, but regrettably failed to get out of there and had to complete all nine miles and the Grant family and their friends who looked lsquoCrackingrsquo for the Cracker.Costumes came in all shapes and sizes with superheroes galore and even the odd beach ball shoved up a T-shirt for maximum effect.Before we draw the curtain on this event there are some necessary closing remarks.Firstly, we have to mention some of those who were lsquopale facedrsquo as they crossed the finish line.Among this number were Connaire McVeigh, his brother Brian McVeigh, Noel lsquoWonderwallrsquo Gallagher , Dee Murrayand Patrick Higgins who it would seem invented a new shade of grey.While all of these are notable and honourable mentions, there can only be on winner of such a prestigious accolade.The worthy recipient is none other than Dominic lsquoMad Dogrsquo McGreevy, who by his own admission was lsquoclean burstedrsquo by evergreen Jim Brown before they even left the show field.Whilst cogitating the next day with McVeigh, he noted that there was a distinct lack of climbing in the opening mile which considerably reduced his chances of the overall win.Of course, all of this is pure conjecture, passed on to me by others who were better placed to judge. As these pale faced warriors finished, I was probably getting a drink at Stephen McMullanrsquos pop-up tavern in Leitrim.The day was a great success due to the hard work and planning that took place. Course designer McCrickard would like to thank his incredible team that spent the best park of two days marking ndash Francie McAlinden, Audey McVeigh , Aidan Brownand Donal Ward.Thanks also to the entry management and registration team who did so much work in creating and continually updating and modying the team ndash no small task, the marshals from our own club and neighbouring clubs, the lead cyclists from Shimna Wheelers and Kilmegan CC, the motorbike riders, Robert and Paddy, the finish team and the presentation party ndash too many to name inidually, but you all know who you are.In conclusion, the feedback from the , that completed the course was amazingly positive and a great time was had by all.

Health unions agreed a .% three-year pay rise for NHS staff, excluding doctors, in  but the deal did not apply to Northern Northern because of the absence of devolved government.Nurses based at the Downpatrick hospitals were among an estimated , from the Royal College who went on strike for the first time in the unionrsquos -year history the week before Christmas.The one-day stoppage marked a serious escalation after weeks of industrial action by other healthcareworkers. RCN nurses were joined by their Unison colleagues on the picket line in poor weather, buffeted by wind and rain.Northern Ireland has the worst hospital waiting lists in the UK, according to figures from the Department of Health with some , people waiting for appointments. On average, there is a four-year wait for knee and hip operations.The December  strike mdash which placed pressure on a range of hospital services and resulted in planned out-patient procedures and appointments being cancelled mdash placed increasing pressure on politicians restore the power-sharing assembly and executive at Stormont.During the industrial action, nurses did provide cover to ensure chemotherapy, intensive care and palliative care services at hospitals remained in place, while district nurses only attended emergency calls. A small number of domiciliary home calls were also cancelled.According to the South Eastern Trust,  outpatient appointments were cancelled and , others were not scheduled due to the recent industrial action.Ms Cullen said the local health service could not survive another winter, without improved pay and conditions for NHS staff.ldquoThe health service is in crisis, the senior RCN official continued.ldquoWe have , people on the waiting list for a hospital appointment and we have a severe nursing shortage, which is highlighted by the Nursing and Midwery Council figures.ldquoOur members have been out on strike to fight for patient safety and to improve conditions for everyone. Quite simply, we cannot afford to wait any longer to address the problems facing the health service. Another winter like this and the health service will be irreparably damaged..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/1st January 2020 Olympic.jpg","title":"Olympic bid for Border Cup glory  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH Olympic get a shot at redemption when they confront Rathfriland in todayrsquos eagerly-awaited Border Cup final showdown at Seaview.Last yearrsquos cruel penalty shoot-out defeat to all-conquering Crumlin Star in the final has plagued Olympic ever since and now is the time to put things right.Olympic have proven all the doubters mdash who predicted that they were one-season wonders mdashseriously wrong and they are back in the final on merit.Wins over Holywood , Bloomfield , Dromara Village , Dunmurry Recand Shankill Unitedhave made the rest of the league sit up and take notice for the second year in a row.Liam Sloanrsquos side are also going strongly in the Premier Section and are unbeaten after nine games. However, all that will count for nothing when they walk out at Seaview this afternoon.Sloan knows more than most that cup finals are all about what happens on the day and no amount of preparation or game planning can change that.With Olympic what you see is what you get.There are no prima donnas in the squad and they have all bought into the team ethos ndash one in, all in.The Olympic boss has made a few shrewd signings since last season and the new faces have gelled well with the group.Olympic may have lost top scorer Niall Murray to Crumlin Star, but Stefan Mason has proved more than a capable replacement.Stefan, now in his second spell at the club, joined from Drumaness Mills at the start of the season and his insatiable appetite in a main strikerrsquos role has endeared him to all.He is a nightmare for all defenders as he never stays still and is continually looking for space. He is not afraid to shoot and is also as brave as they come, adding a bit of physicality to his game in recent times.He has formed a perfect partnership with the under-rated Chris McNamara and the potentially explosive Nathan Jones mdash and all three are reliable matchwinners.Paul Dickson, another new signing, first came to prominence a few years ago when he starred for Noel lsquoDixiersquo Deanrsquos emerging Temple Rangers side that famously reached the semi-finals of the Clarence Cup.Since then he has played for Ballynahinch United and Saintfield United, but his adventurous style of play from the back has given Olympic an added dimension to their play.He has been joined in the squad by Anton McGrattan, a stylish midfielder, who gets up and down the park with ease and who is not an easy player to dispossess or put off his game.Basically, the rest of the Olympic remains the same and therein lies the secret of their success. Goalkeeper Ryan Walsh, a member of the Amateur Leaguersquos representative team, has enhanced his growing reputation this season and he rarely makes mistakes.Manager Sloan has the luxury of being able to play a number of formations at the back. Jason Noade is a colossus in the centre of defence with either Stevie McGoran, Connor Reid, Dickson or the highly-rated Dalton Tate flanking him.Midfield enforcer Ryan Noade,he is fit, can also play in the back four, but he, brother Stevie, Shane Murray and workaholic Ryan Molloy make up a formidable midfield unit with McGrattan able to cover any position in the engine room.Olympic have serious strength in depth and James McClean, Aaron McLean, Adam McClean, Simon Marmion, Jack Roddy, Josh Fennell, Darren Lyons and Reece McConnell are all ready to step up to the markthey are required.However, standing in Olympicrsquos way is one of their own, now making Rathfriland tick.Andy Kilmartin started out at Olympic as a raw teenager with immense talent.He signed for Glasgow Celtic before moving to Glentoran, Portdown and Glenavon where he won an Irish Cup medal.The martinette is now pulling Rathfrilandrsquos strings alongside Newcastlersquos Jonathan Scannell and Downpatrickrsquos Peter Telford and Ruairi Fitzpatrick.Olympic know these players inside out and given a fair wind, they hope to blow Rathfriland away in what promises to be an intriguing final.Coincidentally, this will be Telfordrsquos fth Border Cup final appearance, but he has yet to appear on a winning side.He has lost three finals with Downpatrick FC and one with Kilmore Rec and is hoping that it will be a case of fth time lucky this afternoon..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/1st January 2020 Out.jpg","title":"Out of Africa book looks at richness of sharing humanity together  ","story":"THE latest book by Downpatrick author Dr Stan Papenfus has just been published.Out of Africa has a title that he plagiarised from Pliny, the ancient Roman writer, who wrote: ldquoOut of Africa always something new.The subtitle of this book, lsquoSharing our livesrsquorsquo, derives from an African proverb mdash lsquoA person is a person through peoplersquo. It an also be translated as lsquoA person becomes a person through peoplersquo.The signicance of this proverb becomes ever more clear in the being and becoming of the three story tellers who share their lives with Dr Papenfus.Each one of them expresses and explores the truth of their own experiences and each one has their personal reality confirmed by the events and situations that unfold. In this telling, they also create how they who are and who they can be.Gabriel Makamanzi, from Zimbabwe, specically sees his own problems and dficulties belonging not merely to himself, but to the whole community in which he lives.This community is brought alive for us as he describes it and he expects us to relate it to our own problems and dficulties. In this way, he says, we all work together to discover our own creative freedom and realise our potential.Gabriel notes that le is for love. And yet, without honesty, our personal and shared reality is not reality at all.Instead, it is a pretense and those of us who pretend he sees us ldquoliving meaningless livesrsquorsquo.Dr Papenfus says: ldquoGabrielrsquos story challenges us, as it challenged him, to recognise our own poverty and despair, only to realise the spiritual power and richness of sharing our humanity with each other.The next exploration of time experiences is by Zakele Makaluza, from South Africa. He talks about his arrogance and his refusal to heed the warnings given to him by his ancestors, as they appear to him in his dreams.Zakelersquos experiences also refer to his relationship with bees, but not ordinary bees, rather with those ldquogentlemen of the honeyrsquorsquo sent by his ancestors to remind him of his duties to others, especially to members of his own clan.Dr Stan said: ldquoZakele, in his exploration of his experiences, brings us to an awareness of our own integrity or lack or integrity, in ourselves and in our relationship with others. He realises his potential only after he is persuaded of a certain truth, which he has been denying nearly all his le.ldquoIt is his cousin who opens up his awareness and tells him also that this was an experience that were lsquodestinedrsquo to share.The last person giving his testimony in the book is David Maganda, from Uganda. He came from a very big family and when his father died he was left to fend for himself, especially with regard to earning enough money to pay for his education.Even as a young boy, he secretly took a train from Uganda to Kenya, hoping to make enough money to sponsor his schooling. But, instead, he found himself on a ldquomission impossible as he calls it.He and his friend found themselves stranded and virtually penniless in the city of Nairobi. They had no place to stay, no work and no friends.How are they toto Uganda  They found themselves walking for mile after mile, along long and dusty roads, depending for their very survival on the kindness and pity of strangers. After living through a fierce storm and other hardships, they eventually arrived at the Kenya-Uganda border. Here, in their completely squalid state, they were interrogated by the police, who eventually let them cross the border.Arriving back in Uganda, they miraculously met Davidrsquos friendrsquos sister, who was working at a trading station. And so, at last, they find themselves able tohome.Each of their families get them to promise never again to engage in such a mad exploit. And yet within ten years he finds himself stranded once again, this time in the Sudan.Here, however, he is able to make do by earning money and pursuing some schooling and eventually being presented with a graduation certicate. Because of the particular school he attended, he was also able to become a confirmed Christian. However, he discovers, through his interaction with others, that his Christianity is only lukewarm.Through many strange encounters he eventually learns how to accept Christ into his very heart of hearts.As a result of this, he preaches the good news of salvation and in Northern Sudan he is even beaten and imprisoned.As time goes by he meets his we, Gillian, at a theological college in England. Today, David lives in Belfast and is only a lay preacher, but also someone who teaches others how to explore and discover the meaning of their lives and with others, how to realise their potential.Out of Africa is available on loan from Downpatrick Library and can also be bought from amazon..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/1st January 2020 Seals.jpg","title":"Seals prosper in Strangford Lough  ","story":"STRANGFORD Lough is proving to be a popular nursery for grey seals.The largest sea inlet in Ireland can boast having  pups born in its waters during last autumn, the most since records began almost  years ago.The National Trust, which records the number of wildle visiting the area, revealed there were  adults in the lough at the peak of the breeding season last year ndash something of a turnaround for the protected species.In the early s records show that only around six or seven grey seals were born in the area each year.Lead ranger at Strangford Lough Hugh Thurgate say several factors have contributed to the growth in numbers.He said: ldquoThe boom reflects the burgeoning population in Scottish waters which is pushing the population down the North Channel and into the Irish Sea and seals are being forced to seek out new places to breed.ldquoThe shelter of Strangford is a strong draw for seals on the look-out for alternative spots to relax on shore during the breeding and moulting seasons.Mr Thurgate agrees that Strangford Lough is just the place for them.He added: ldquoThe seals are looking for a safe and protected place to raise their young ndash somewhere that provides protection from the elements and is relatively free from disturbance ndash which Strangford Lough offers.ldquoPups are quite vulnerable. Seals give birth on the beach andyou get stormy weather, tidal surges and high spring tides, high pup vitalities can occur because seals are unable to thermo-regulate properly.ldquoSo,you have calmer conditions pups are going to have a better chance of survival.The mild lough islands of Strangford are a favourite spot for the seals to haul out in large groups, known as rockeries, now a regular sight for boat users.Mr Thurgate, who has worked on Strangford Lough for two decades, has seen the population steadily rise.He said: ldquoWe starting counting seals in .

It only became compulsory for front seat passengers in the early s, and in rear seat passengers around the time I began to drive.Rapidly the UK moved from a culture in which most people in cars were not restrained into one in which almost everyone wore a belt..ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button Deaths and injuries were reduced radically.The other huge change that I notice since then is adherence to  mph speed limits.I remember well the casual way in which these limits were ignored, albeit with occasional moments when police patrols would be found at the edge of such a  mph zone.Drivers routinely sailed into a  mph zone travelling at mph or even  mph.I recall the sense of bewilderment that the wide Newtownards Road outside Stormont had such a limit, when a  mph or  mph limit seemed more appropriate.Now, like most other drivers, I am well used to travelling at exactly  mph along that stretch and it seems a reasonable speed.In the late s and the s, around  people died each year on average on Northern Ireland’s roads. Traffic levels have risen by a multiple of more than . since then, which means that such a fatality rate applied to current traffic levels would result in perhaps  deaths in Northern Ireland each year.Last year there were  deaths, the joint second safest year since records began in .The average number of deaths over the last decade has averaged only .A spate of tragic deaths in recent days shows that, as the authorities keep telling us, one death is one too many.But we should not make that point so forcefully that we lose sight of the stunning — simply stunning — progress that there has been in making our roads far safer.Ben Lowry: A conversation about Northern Ireland with Professor Brendan O’Leary Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"At least  people are alive each year who would otherwise be deadwe had not made such strides in safety.As well as greater adherence to speed limits and seat belt laws, there are many other reasons for the decline,Motorists are better trained, better aware of the risksand better aware of the penalties for drinking or killing someone.Cars are much better built and have to be maintained to a safer standard . Roads are better designed and have better markings.Even so, I can think of several measures that could help to drive deaths down closer towards zero.• Dashboard cameras within cars. They are already used to keep down insurance premiums of young folk, butthat was expanded, fewer and fewer people would dare to drive badly.• A  mph speed limit in streets with housing. The  mph limit is too high on such residential roads. Some years ago I was discussing this with an old school friend and we both agreed that  was too high for streets with lots of parked cars. We were travelling at well below  and put our theory to the test and began to increase our speed up towards the  limit and then stopped before reaching it, because it was obviously too fast with cars on either side. Yet lots of drivers still tear down such roads at that speed or higher.• Greater use of average speed cameras in  mph zones. Elderly relatives of mine live within such a zone and I often see cars seeming to roar past but in fact they might only be doing  or  mph. It is still too fast and so the limit needs greater enforcement.• A mph limit in rural roads. The current speed limit on single carriageway roads, denoted by the national speed limit sign in the picture on this page, is mph. This is far too high for most rural lanes and even for most B roads. • A mph limit on major single carriageway roads or a mph limit on the best of them, but onlythey have a  sign or  sign, to show that they are exempted from the lower  mph national speed limit. Also, far greater construction of overtaking lanes on major single carriageways so that motorists do not get struck behind tractors and tempted to overtake against oncoming traffic• A mph limit on dual carriageways that have deadly gap junctions in the central reservation, enforced by average speed cameras. The current A road in Co Down would have such a  limit until it is upgraded and the gap junctions removed .• A mph limt on dual carriageways that have flyover junctions . This would be enforced by average speed cameras.• An mph limit on motorways. This would be to let motorists know that it is not all puritanism, and that drivers would be allowed to go a good pace on our safest roads. It too would be enforced by average speed cameras so that  means , not . It would further be enforced by cameras to ensure motorists keep their distance between vehicles in front, and do not sit in the overtaking lane.• No new planning permission whatsoever granted for entries directly on A roads. And any existing entrances on to A roads that can be moved to adjoining lanes would be transferred to the quieter, safer road.Under my plan there would, in summary, be a lot more average speed cameras, which would become cheaper with technology advancements. Average speed cameras remove even the temptation to speed, because they cannot be evaded by suddenly slowing down for a fixed site camera, then speeding up again. But under the plan there would also be many more roads with mph limits , and some roads with higher limits still — the motorways. So there would be plenty of scope for travelling swtly when it is safe to do so.• Ben Lowryis News Letter deputy editor• Ben Lowry: A conversation with Professor Brendan O’Leary©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Privacy policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":null,"title":"people","story":" getRequiredClientIdforjpiconsole.log requiredClientIdcatch]EV.Core.updateUserProfile]EV.Core.updateUserProfile....... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia, publisher of Belfast News Letter, via occasional emails keeping you informed about new features, relevant offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast News Letter and agreeing to JPIMedia Publishing Ltd#s standard Terms and Conditions.

This is not unique to Wales but an issue across the UK.Itrsquos important we act to ensure that our health service is sustainable in the long term.Recent figures show excellent progress has been made again this year.I increased the number of GP training places from  to  this year.However we actually filled  places.This is an increase of  per cent on last year and is great news for us locally.In order to ensure that we can recruit the medical workforce our health service needs now and in the future we also need to look outside Wales. That is why I recently visited India.The British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin have led the Medical Training Initiativescheme to bring medical professionals from India to work in NHS Wales for up to two years.This partnership with NHS Wales has led to over  doctors a year for the last three years being offered positions in NHS Wales through the scheme.During my visit I had the pleasure of meeting with some of the candidates who have applied to train work and live in Wales for two years together with the NHS Wales recruitment team.Our message that Wales is an excellent place to Train, Work and Live is clearly having an effect at home and abroad.As ever, I would be interested on hearing your views on this, please do get in touch. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

More than , people signed a petition to save the Victorian lamp posts, fearing a ldquoloss of valuable historic character from the streetscape in Penarth.A Vale council spokesman said: \"ldquoThe council has recently approved a more suitable replacement column for the old Victorian lampposts which will be painted black and feature embellishments to match the Victorian period style as well as having a swan neck arrangement that will accommodate a suspended LED lantern to meet its energy reduction strategy. It is intended to roll out this replacement column by replacing the previously installed steel columns along Cwrt y Vil Road before the end of this calendar year.\"Penarth Civic Society alleged the posts were safe in a letter sent last week to the Vale councilrsquos head of visible services and council leader Neil Moore.David Noble of the Penarth Civic Society said: ldquoWe would like to ask that the programme of removal and replacement of Victorian lampposts in Penarth is suspended with immediate effect.ldquoWe are completely in favour of the councilrsquos policy to replace old inefficient street lighting with modern more energy efficient LED lighting units. However, we are firmly of the opinion that not enough effort has gone into the decision.ldquoIt seems that the council is spending over pound, on replacing each lamppost. When two posts in Kymin Terrace and Beach Lane were converted, the contractor expressed concern that the spigot on the column was not strong enough to support the new unit. We believe this remains the sole justication for the claim the units are unsound.ldquoWe have been in contact with several street lighting contractors. They have all confirmed as long as the posts are structurally sound at their base there is no reason they cannot be upgraded.ldquoWe feel the decision to scrap the old columns was taken prematurely, without proper consideration and is motivated by a desire for expedience rather than sensibility and care.A Vale council spokesman said: ldquoThe council has a duty to ensure that the street lighting is in a safe condition and does not pose a hazard to the general public. As a result, a number of the older Victorian lampposts in Penarth were recently replaced because they were considered electrically and structurally unsafe with holes evident in some columns.

While policy decisions have yet to be made, heat pumps are the indicated preference.ldquoOver % of oil heated homes in Great Britain fall into EPC bands D to G ndash meaning they are poorly insulated and so unsuited for heat pumps without costly insulation work.ldquoFinancial support to help the poorest families switch heating systems would most likely be made available but many households will be expected to fund the work themselves.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Diverging substantiallywill bring in the requirement for inspections at the border for customs. “That hasn’t been agreed formally. That is quite a lot for UK and NI operators to deal with – haulage and freight movers, to get to grips with that. There are major operational challenges.“Northern Ireland also leave the customs union with GB, but there will be a customs border will between GB and NI to continue to essentially allow freight and good to travel.”Since Boris Johnson’s deal was floated, it’s understood the shipping industry is now drawing up plans for EU border checks in Britain for trade bound for Northern Ireland.According to the BBC, freight could be erted through ports with space for inspections at areas such as Liverpool and Stranraer.Richard says checks are likely to be carried out at the ports. The issue  He says backlogs, queues and congestion. “ to queueing back on to ferries and ships, which may miss or mess up timetables,” he says. He says while “many wouldn’t welcome new formalities”, a lot of cargo – such as dry bulk, fuel, aggregates and containerised products –  will find it reasonably easy to deal with. The main concern is around ‘roll on, roll off’, where the containers or lorries are driven on board a ship.“Those modes are where it could be the most problematic, as it’s based on a fluid process,” he says.“I think there is a definite concern from ports and shipping industries that businesses may be impacted negatively, and may reassess business operations.“I wouldn’t say it’s a doomsday scenario but it’s a real challenge for the sector to overcome. Politicians will have to make sure that with any kind of arrangements, there will be a good solution. This is a new proposal, so we are unsure what the details will be.”Brexit aside, Richard says the industry as a whole is that while the largely commercial and independent ports aren’t in need of ‘hand outs’ from the public sector, areas such as connectivity, roads and planning are key to their success.“It’s about making sure the planning system works, and is swt, and responsive,” he said. “They can be agile, for example, building a new shed, terminal or quay, or new developments in the water.“Where there are environmental sensitivities it can sometimes slow down the planning regimes so we are keen to see them not slow down. We welcome environmental policies but we want a scheme that will work and doesn’t have unintended consequences.“Shipping, although not perfect, is one of the most clean and efficient methods of transport. It’s a balance between environmental protection, but enabling ports and regions to grow.“If there are schemes, ports can find there are investors willing to come in, but they do rely on government – local or national – to finance road and rail connectivity.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/year1.jpg","title":"yearbook a look back at ","story":"Posted on Thursday January  by Ulster Business It was another year shaped by political turmoil and the loss of some giants of industry, but it was also a period which saw great opportunity and growth.
