The actual cash amount will depend on how many mushers finish the race, a factor in how the prize money is vied out.Waerner immediately thanked the 10 dogs in harness, petting and rubbing each dog, ending with his lead dogs K2 and Bark, before handing out treats.He called K2 \u0027an amazing dog.\u0027\u0027He has this inside engine that never stops,\u0027 Waerner said.Bark is the tough one, the winning musher said.\u0027He\u0027s the one just charging through everything. It doesn\u0027t matter what comes, he will just go through it, storms or whatever,\u0027 Waerner said. \u0027So they two together are an amazing team.\u0027Waerner, who began mushing in 1984, won the Iditarod in only his second attempt.He finished 17th in 2015, when he earned Rookie of the Year honors. Wearner last year won the 745-mile (1,200-kilometer) Finnmarkslopet, the longest sled dog race in Europe.As an 11-year-old boy in Norway, he read mushing magazines touting the achievements of some of the Iditarod\u0027s most famous mushers of that era. Their ranks included the race\u0027s only five-time winner, Rick Swenson, and a four-time winner, the late Susan Butcher, who in the 1985 race had to fight off an angry moose with an axe after it killed two of her dogs.Waerner told reporters at the finish line that it was always his \u0027dream to come here and do the race.\u0027Waerner became the second Norwegian musher in the last three years and third this century to win the race. Joar Leifseth Ulsom won in 2018 and Robert Sorlie took titles in 2003 and 2005.All three Norwegians earned Rookie of the Year honors before winning.Waerner encouraged other Norwegian mushers to follow in their footsteps.\u0027This is a great race you can do,\u0027 he said. \u0027Just start training.\u0027Warner\u0027s victory was also a moment of pride for the Anchorage Sons of Norway chapter.

Some local officials in communities along the race\u0027s route asked that the checkpoints be moved outside of the villages to prevent any spread of the virus.The Iditarod suffered a big monetary blow this year when two longtime sponsors with deep Alaska ties dropped their financial support for the race.People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals took credit for Alaska Airlines and the Anchorage Chrysler dealership dropping their support after targeting the airline\u0027s headquarters in Seattle, Washington, and the Fiat Chrysler Automobile offices in Detroit, Michigan, with protests over what the group has called the race\u0027s cruel treatment of dogs.Alaska Airlines said PETA had nothing to do with its decision, which it called a change in the company\u0027s corporate giving strategy.Fiat Chrysler Automobiles didn\u0027t mention PETA when it confirmed that the independently owned and operated dealership would no longer sponsor the race.The Anchorage dealership was one of the Iditarod´s top-tier sponsors and provided the pickup for the race winner for 30 years."},{"url":null,"title":"Russia feeding coronavirus disinformation sow panic West EU document says","story":"Share this article The European Commission said it was in contact with Google , Facebook, Twitter and Microsoft . An EU spokesman accused Moscow of \u0027playing with people\u0027s lives\u0027 and appealed to EU citizens to \u0027be very careful\u0027 and only use news sources they trust.The EU and NATO have accused Russia of covert action, including disinformation, to try to destabilise the West by exploiting isions in society.

You will want things more manoeuvrable, probably smaller and faster and probably often dispensable.’          Sir Nick, 61, told The Truth Trade podcast with Sven Hughes that the review will lead to the modernisation of the Armed Forces and be ‘profound’ (file photo)Ministry of Defence data shows the Army had 78,620 full time staff in January, with 29,860 reserves – a total of 108,480, not including civilians. The general said the size of the Army could be 120,000 in a decade but this would include robots and tech-savvy civilians able to counter cyber threats.

It will be a mix of skills and technologies that give a collective output different to today.’ He said wars would still be ‘visceral and violent’ but the Armed Forces needed more youngsters with computer skills. Sir Nick said both the strategic landscape and technology had meant the world had changed a lot since 2010. ‘We are living through one of the greatest periods of change that there have been at any stage in our lifetime and arguably a greater amount of change than perhaps the two world wars combined – and that is happening at a rate that is ever increasing’, he said. He added the world was a much more competitive environment, driven by the rise of China, a Russia that wants to reposition itself as a great power, and the threat of extremism. Sir Nick also warned Islamic State was spreading globally despite claims by Donald Trump last year that it had been defeated. In what will be seen as a thinly-veiled swipe at the US President, he said: ‘The plain fact is the phenomenon ISIS represents is spreading, you see that particularly in central Africa and sub-Saharan Africa but also globally.’ In a rare move, he also criticised the Government for failing to have a ‘political strategy’ when it came to Syria. He said the military was an ‘honourable profession’ and that the public knew that with the threat of coronavirus ‘the last resort, the insurance policy, is the Armed Forces’."},{"url":null,"title":"105m lotto couple three bed terrace four months","story":"Share this article He previously promised to help the local community with the winnings.Self-employed builder Mr Thomson is understood to have quit working after honouring all the customers that had booked with him prior to his win. A neighbour of the family, Ellie Wood, 42, previously said: \u0027Steve and his wife are salt of the earth.

In the video, Giwa-Amu describes Adichie’s book as “a rewrite of Sade” and says that “no one should profit from stealing another person’s work”. She uploaded a lengthy document to her website, laying out what she called “similarities” between the two novels.Sade is set during the Biafran war and follows the mixed-race daughter of a Nigerian supreme court judge, who falls for a barrister who is engaged. Adichie’s Orange prize-winning novel, published in 2006, follows lives torn apart by the Biafran war, focusing on an educated young woman, her houseboy and her lover, a professor.A statement from Wylie, Adichie’s literary agents, denied Giwa-Amu’s allegations and said that the author and her publishers “had never heard of Giwa-Amu’s novel until she brought her delusional claim” in 2016, when she first alleged plagiarism.According to the literary agency, a “professional independent reader” studied both novels and “concluded that there was absolutely no basis for Giwa-Amu’s claim”. But Giwa-Amu continued with it, and in February 2019 her claim was struck out by the court, which found it to be “an abuse of the court’s process”. Giwa-Amu was ordered to pay Adichie and her publishers £14,250, as well as the legal costs incurred by Adichie.“Her present allegations are false, libellous and constitute a harassment to Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie. Further legal actions are being taken,” said the Wylie Agency, adding: “Till date, Giwa-Amu has not paid the money.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a4e36e70f31b1bfb02aa3addd76c4d1f0e52c86b/0_56_1190_714/master/1190.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2208f891a55f6d63da187814fc1cf9e4","title":"brewdog begins making hand sanitiser shortages uk","story":"Brewer says product will be given away for free to those in need during coronavirus crisisThe independent brewer BrewDog has begun making hand sanitiser at its distillery in Aberdeenshire amid shortages driven by coronavirus fears.The firm said it would be giving away the “punk sanitiser” for free to those that need it.BrewDog’s founder, James Watt, announced on social media that the company had started producing sanitiser to help with shortages. “We are determined to do everything we can to try and help as many people as possible stay safe,” he said.The company said it was “working around the clock on producing the first batch to have it available for next week”, and the sanitiser will be given away to local charities and the community rather than sold. It comes amid shortages of hand sanitiser, which has been flagged as an important tool in combating the coronavirus.HMRC said it was prioritising applications from manufacturers to enable them to produce denatured alcohol, a type of spirit that is not for human consumption and exempt from excise duty. A range of chemicals is added to the alcohol to render it undrinkable.Many supermarkets and chemists have placed strict limits on the number of hand sanitising gels shoppers can buy as producers struggle to source enough ingredients and small plastic bottles.With heavy demand, independent gin producers have also been switching their production. Verdant Spirits, based in Dundee, is reportedly aiming to produce 400 litres of the gel starting this week, while Bristol’s Psychopomp Microdistillery and 58 Gin in London are also working on similar products.In France, the luxury goods group LVMH has switched to producing hand sanitiser at three of its perfume and cosmetics factories for distribution to French hospitals fighting coronavirus.Twelve tonnes will be produced as soon as this week, instead of the usual Christian Dior, Guerlain and Givenchy scents and make-up usually made at the three French sites."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/423fa91b9f62bb220f010908958d5acb3fea4099/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=70c8cbeacc75d562e35ca81c99e65f69","title":"coronavirus bonanza investors business rates shareholders","story":"If there’s anything left from the business rates freebie, it’s unlikely to find its way to shareholdersMorrisons on Wednesday announced underlying pre-tax profits of £408m for the past financial year. Add the £290m of store-related business rates that the company won’t be paying this year (at least according to the natural reading of Rishi Sunak’s emergency plan) and, hey presto, Morrisons could be looking at a year of bumper profits, runs one line of thinking.Unlike pubs, clubs, restaurants and theatres – Sunak’s main intended beneficiaries – the doors of supermarkets are wide open and punters are rushing in, to the extent that restrictions are being placed on what they can buy.Yet the idea that investors are poised to enjoy a pandemic bonanza is very silly. Supermarkets were not included in the business rates holiday so that shareholders could pocket the difference. The Treasury, one assumes, was trying to incentivise behaviour that the chains, to their credit, are adopting anyway.David Potts, Morrisons’ chief executive, gave a few examples: paying small suppliers immediately extending sick pay to staff who would not normally be eligible adding cleaners hiring more staff to cover absences extending online deliveries. Such “feed the nation” policies cost money.If there’s anything left from the business rates freebie, it’s unlikely to find its way to shareholders. A bonus for staff would be a far better use of surplus funds. The Treasury might even want a few quid back if things turn out better than expected.The new governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey, says his “strong preference” is to keep stock markets open. Quite right: closure would look panicky and deprive some ordinary savers of access to their investments, even if the value of those investments has plunged.What’s more, the stock market’s fumbling daily assessment of points of stress can be useful to policymakers. The signals are mostly showing red for danger, but the shades of red also matter.Bailey, however, sounded weak when he called for short-sellers – those betting on share prices to fall – to behave themselves. “Anybody who says, ‘I can make a lot of money by shorting’, which frankly might not be in the interests of the economy, the interest of the people, just stop what you’re doing,” said the governor. An appeal for everybody to play nicely is probably not going to cut it.A ban on short selling would be controversial, and is generally only adopted by policymakers when there are specific dangers, such as runs on banks. But, if the Bank judges that short-selling is making a bad situation harder to manage, just implement a ban. “Please stop” is not a message that is likely to be universally obeyed.Over in the government bond market, the European Central Bank ought to be worried. The gap in yields on eurozone countries’ bonds is widening. In short, there’s a rush for the safety of German bunds, with the debt of the likes of Italy, Greece and even France being shunned, relatively speaking.The situation is a long way from being a rerun of the eurozone debt crisis of 2011. Nor did the position worsen notably on Wednesday versus Tuesday. One would also expect market gyrations – investors can see a tidal wave of new government IOUs coming down the track as countries rip up borrowing pledges.This subplot could quickly become significant. Last time around, the ECB eventually managed to foster a greater sense of eurozone harmony out a crisis.

From automated systems that monitor cashflow, to software that sends out emails, there’s a plethora of online tools available to help small firms growSelf-driving cars, surgery carried out by robots, facial recognition software – the transformative potential of artificial intelligence (AI) and its implications for the world of work have rarely been out of the headlines in recent years. “Everything we assume about work, jobs, training and education – and being human – is being challenged by exponential scientific and technological progress,” futurist author Gerd Leonhard says. “Humanity will change more in the next 20 years than in the previous 300.”Considering the magnitude and scale of this fourth industrial revolution, it’s understandable that many small business owners feel left behind. Few will have the teams of data scientists, money and know-how to create their own bespoke solutions, unless they’re operating in the AI sector themselves. Yet many will be using platforms and tools that already incorporate AI – anyone doing a Google search, for example, is experiencing it in action. “You can be sure there isn’t a human sitting in a cubicle, sifting by hand through the entire internet to decide which search result to serve you,” says Cassie Kozyrkov, chief decision scientist at Google.This technology is most often used by businesses in three different ways: automating processes (such as timed newsletter sends, or bank account reconciliation), data analysis to gain insights (and then performing tasks such as recommending products to customers), and engaging with the public (via customer service chatbots, for example). Much of this has been made possible by cloud computing (a way of storing data remotely), which has given smart platforms powered by the cloud millions of anonymised users’ data to learn from and adapt accordingly. It’s rapidly accelerated the development of tools that are simple for small business owners to use but highly effective in terms of eliminating repetitive tasks, streamlining operations, and enabling sustainable growth.‘It’s important to have a clear mind’“What beekeepers really like is the 88-million-year-old technology that bees use to do all sorts of smart things, like organise their hives, and produce wax and royal jelly from their bodies,” Dale Gibson, co-founder of Bermondsey Street Bees, says about introducing the art of beekeeping to technology. “The last real technological discovery in beekeeping was in America in 1852.”While respecting that heritage, Gibson has been able to incorporate technological development into his business in a number of ways, since installing his first hives on his London roof in 2007. “I do start off with a proper, gummed up, sticky with honey notebook, where the data is gathered in the field,” he says. “But when I come home, I enter that information into a system on the cloud where my associate beekeeper can look it up.” He’s also working on a pilot programme with the World Bee Project to test remote monitors that track the health of hives, such as their weight. That data is then fed back into a central system, shared by 32,000 beekeepers across more than 150 countries. The project hopes this information will help to create more sustainable ecosystems and improve global food security.Gibson is also exploring the potential of tracking his honey via a blockchain system, first trialled by the technology company Oracle at the 2019 OpenWorld show in Dubai. “Anything that can help us distinguish between real, raw local honey and the manufactured commodity that’s come from halfway around the world and been blended, heated and mashed up, then that’s a good thing,” says Gibson, adding that honey is the third most tampered with product in the world, after milk and olive oil.While technology can sometimes be daunting for SME owners to incorporate, he says it’s given him more time to focus on the bees. “We’re massively assisted by having Xero on our phones too so we can use it for inventory record keeping, invoicing and statements at any time and anywhere,” he says. He finds the automatic reminders to customers that an invoice is due (or late) particularly helpful, as is the functionality that automatically reconciles his bank statements. “Even though you’re running a small business and lots of things can happen, it’s really important to have a clear mind.”‘We’re trying very hard to make online successful’Since starting in 2011, Papersmiths has grown from a two-employee interior design studio in Bridport, to launching an additional chain of five stationary shops. The company now employs 25 staff and has a presence in some of the UK’s most desirable retail locations (including Bristol, Brighton, and Chelsea in London).Smart technology has played a clear role in the business’s growth, co-founder Sidonie Warren says. The majority of their data is tracked using point-of-sale software Vend, which integrates with Xero. “That’s excellent because it allows us to track what we’re selling, right down to a specific product or colour,” says Warren. “When we open a new store we use that data to figure out what it is we need to buy, and also planning the fit out of the store.” Shop managers also use it to identify that week’s top five products, and arrange displays accordingly.Building the e-commerce arm of the business has been a key focus for Warren recently. “Our challenge is translating that thing of testing a pen or feeling the paper of a notebook into the digital realm,” she says. Automating email sends via Mailchimp has enabled her to engage new customers via discount codes, and she can target people known to be top spenders at certain times of the year using sales data from Shopify.She uses Xero weekly to plan cashflow, as well as process payroll and track all of her staff expenses. She still uses the personal touch – if a customer is late paying an invoice for example, she’d rather call than send an automatic reminder – but is open to integrating new technology in the future, including an online customer service chatbot, and some sort of retail mapping system. “With online you can see how many times a product gets viewed but it’s very hard to do that in store,” she adds.‘We’ve grown substantially and it’s all down to being in control of our finances’Richard Fishenden worked as a farrier fitting horseshoes before he started Made by the Forge in 2006. “My wife went into a local shop that sold curtain poles and I was horrified at the prices. I said bollocks to that, I’m going to make them myself,” he says. The range has since extended beyond bespoke curtain poles, to other wrought iron homeware items.Fishenden says he used to be “archaic with technology”, but has managed to automate processes in various areas. “Xero seems to be the central part of the spider’s web that everything else feeds from,” he says. That includes an order system, where delivery notes and worksheets are generated so staff know what products to make a customer relationship management system for customer data that Fishenden uses to send quotes via Xero, and then follow up on leads that were once buried in paperwork and Receipt Bank for invoices and receipts that he says has saved hours of data inputting.Sign up to Xero here with a free trial"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d802ae154d3ad8a70e65e19c73a5ead238e90c5/0_178_2775_1666/master/2775.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3fabd3b4def63bc3cc66354a6a4b50e7","title":"coronavirus uk expert advice wrong","story":"The warnings from China and Italy were loud and clear. But politicians and their advisers wasted valuable time – and lives will be lost as a result• Richard Horton is editor of the Lancet medical journalOn 24 January, Chinese doctors and scientists reported the first description of a new disease caused by a novel coronavirus. They described how a strange series of cases of pneumonia had presented in December in Wuhan, a city of 11 million people and the capital of Hubei province. At that time, 800 cases of the new disease had been confirmed. The virus had already been exported to Thailand, Japan and South Korea.Most of the 41 people described in this first report, published in the Lancet, presented with non-specific symptoms of fever and cough. More than half had difficulties in breathing. But most worryingly of all, a third of these patients had such a severe illness that they had to be admitted to an intensive care unit. Most developed a critical complication of their viral pneumonia – acute respiratory distress syndrome. Half died. The Chinese scientists pulled no punches. “The number of deaths is rising quickly,” they wrote. The provision of personal protective equipment for health workers was strongly recommended. Testing for the virus should be done immediately a diagnosis was suspected. They concluded that the mortality rate was high. And they urged careful surveillance of this new virus in view of its “pandemic potential”.That was in January. Why did it take the UK government eight weeks to recognise the seriousness of what we now call Covid-19?In 2003, Chinese officials were heavily criticised for keeping the dangers of a new viral disease, severe  acute  respiratory  syndrome (Sars), secret. By 2020, a new generation of Chinese scientists had learned their lesson. Under immense pressure, as the epidemic exploded around them, they took time to write up their findings in a foreign language and seek publication in a medical journal thousands of miles away. Their rapid and rigorous work was an urgent warning to the world. We owe those scientists enormous thanks.But medical and scientific advisers to the UK government ignored their warnings. For unknown reasons they waited. And watched.The scientists advising ministers seemed to believe that this new virus could be treated much like influenza. Graham Medley, one of the government’s expert scientific advisers, was disarmingly explicit. In an interview on Newsnight last week, he explained the UK’s approach: to allow a controlled epidemic of large numbers of people, which would generate “herd immunity”. Our scientists recommended “a situation where the majority of the population are immune to the infection. And the only way of developing that, in the absence of a vaccine, is for the majority of the population to become infected.”After weeks of inaction, the government announced a sudden U-turn on Monday, declaring that new modelling by scientists at Imperial College had convinced them to change their initial plans. Many journalists, led by the BBC, reported that “the science had changed” and so the government had responded accordingly. But this interpretation of events is wrong. The science has been the same since January. What changed is that government advisers at last understood what had really taken place in China.The UK’s best scientists have known since that first report from China that Covid-19 was a lethal illness. Yet they did too little, too late.The virus quickly made its way to Europe. Italy was the first European country to suffer huge human losses. On 12 March, two Italian researchers, Andrea Remuzzi and Giuseppe Remuzzi, set out the lessons of their tragic experience. Italy’s health service simply could not cope. They did not have the capacity of intensive care beds to deal with the scale of infection and its consequences. They predicted that by mid-April their health system would be overwhelmed. The mortality of patients with severe infection was high. A fifth of health workers were becoming infected, and some were dying.They described the situation in Italy as an unmanageable catastrophe. They wrote: “These considerations might also apply to other European countries that could have similar numbers of patients infected and similar needs regarding intensive care admissions.” And yet the UK continued with its strategy of encouraging the epidemic and the goal of herd immunity.Something has gone badly wrong in the way the UK has handled Covid-19. I know Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer, and Patrick Vallance. I have the utmost respect for both. They have had the services of some of the most talented researchers in the world to draw on. But somehow there was a collective failure among politicians and perhaps even government experts to recognise the signals that Chinese and Italian scientists were sending. We had the opportunity and the time to learn from the experience of other countries. For reasons that are not entirely clear, the UK missed those signals. We missed those opportunities.In due time, there must be a reckoning. I sat with the director general of the World Health Organization, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, in Geneva in February. He was in despair. Tedros had been criticised for not calling a public health emergency of international concern sooner. But when he did and when he asked for the modest sum of $675m to help the WHO combat the growing global pandemic his pleas were ignored.The UK is now taking the right actions to defeat this new epidemic. But we have lost valuable time. There will be deaths that were preventable. The system failed. I don’t know why. But, when we have suppressed this epidemic, when life returns to some semblance of normality, difficult questions will have to be asked and answered. Because we can’t afford to fail again. We may not have a second chance.• Richard Horton is a doctor and edits the Lancet"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d65d00bfb5318ee075edef1aac6f4c12f272b088/3_0_1609_966/master/1609.jpg?width=1200\u0026amp;height=630\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026amp;overlay-width=100p\u0026amp;overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026amp;s=2fffa463cd2217c1aa1fdeaa2ca053db","title":"coronavirus pandemic human rights","story":"People could soon be arrested for a sweeping range of new offences, sparking troubling scenes in the UK• Coronavirus – latest updates• See all our coronavirus coverageYou can learn a lot about someone’s perspective from what they find reassuring at a time like this. This week I saw a private briefing from a bank, soothingly reassuring its clients that “this feels more like 911 than 2008”. I think the point was to let investors know that this crisis is not systemic. It felt a bit like updating the old wartime spirit for today’s hyper-capitalist economy: “Keep well-capitalised, and carry on.”I can think of a host of reasons why 911 does not bring calming thoughts to mind, but one is the long-term impact it had on human rights. Back then I was in the early stages of becoming a human rights lawyer. My very first day in court was with the team defending a victim of extraordinary rendition, where Britain had helped facilitate his torture. By the time I was practising, the 7 July London bombings had happened, and so had draconian new laws – 90-day detention without trial, plus sweeping surveillance and monitoring. Many Muslims remember this as the time that racial profiling and state harassment – in airports, on the tube, in the street – became the new normal.This might sound like a strange issue to raise when the national priority is – understandably – how to stop the spread of coronavirus, treat the sick and tackle the hit to the economy. But since last month, when the government drafted emergency regulations to grant police new powers – and more far-reaching laws are expected this week – the potential has been building for a clash between liberty, privacy and public health measures. The authorities now have the power to arrest and detain someone they believe is infectious for up to 14 days, to move that person around from custody facilities including secure hospitals, and to take blood or saliva from them by force, even if they are a child.The legislation set to come before parliament is likely to ban public gatherings, to widen police and immigration officer powers of detention and restraint, to give doctors powers to sign death certificates without seeing the deceased person’s body, to allow fast-tracked burial and cremation, and to strip back services in care homes. People who refuse to self-isolate could be made to do so using the always contested “reasonable force”.Our human rights protections – long maligned by many of the politicians now running our pandemic-stricken nation – were designed for moments such as this. They contain specific exemptions for situations in which the state needs to contain the spread of infectious disease. And the continuing shutdown caused by coronavirus doesn’t make them less relevant, it makes them more important than ever.The proposed measures will contain safeguards – as they are constitutionally required to do so – especially rights to appeal. But this being a government that has decimated legal aid, brought our court system to its knees and repeatedly attacked the judiciary, a key element of trust is already compromised.Trust is one of those ingredients in a democratic process that is hard to notice until it is gone. But this government’s cavalier approach to applying the rule of law at the best of times – let’s remember the prime minister misled the Queen and illegally prorogued parliament – does not inspire confidence at a time of crisis.Lawyers who focus on the right to human dignity in the care of vulnerable or elderly people were appalled to hear Boris Johnson suggest that the deaths of vast numbers of British people would be an acceptable price to pay for so-called “herd immunity”. One QC compared the idea to Germany’s post-911 attempt to permit hijacked passenger planes to be shot down, as if the lives of those on board were expendable. Similarly, he suggests, the very idea of herd immunity would have “subordinated human dignity by treating it as a quantifiable entity that can be measured and weighed in the balance.”There’s the potential for a kind of tyranny of the majority – one of the reasons we need human rights in the first place – and then there are the new, established but upgraded, tyrannies of the state. China has developed an app of remarkably intrusive proportions, using facial recognition to track both your movements and those of everyone in your proximity, so that they can be tested in the event you become infectious.Israel is ditching superfluous apps altogether and simply allowing security services to hack infected people’s phones to monitor their movements.Donald Trump has insisted on a project of deliberate racial demonisation by calling Covid-19 the “Chinese virus” – inflaming what we already know to be harmful prejudice against east Asian people, including those who have suffered shameful abuse in Britain. In one of the most surreal responses to the pandemic, commentators who are usually allergic to this form of social justice have belatedly discovered the concept of reparations – not for the genocidal abuses committed by Europeans over the centuries, but for Europeans from the allegedly guilty Chinese. The truth is that China has been remarkably effective at stemming the spread of Covid-19, but has done so through a heady concoction of human rights abuses and authoritarian rule, of which no one should be envious. Human Rights Watch has reported censorship dissenters put “under quarantine” a disabled child left to die when his parent was forced into isolation and a leukaemia sufferer turned away from hospital. That doesn’t justify racism against Chinese people any more than the British should be stigmatised for the uniquely dodgy leadership we currently endure. This pandemic has exposed what many of us said about the Tories’ long boast of “record high” numbers of people in employment – namely, insecure workers with no rights and no safety net. Likewise, we warned about starving the NHS so that its resilience is shot, creating a generation of renters with no savings, and allowing homelessness and destitution to mushroom.These casualties had already become the new normal. But once we see newly troubling scenes – people arrested for resisting isolation or treatment – we will be reminded why this could become a crisis of rights, as much as it is one of disease."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d127c94ab85005fa99790f8832ae8da361a5ec9/0_86_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5109a8c54f95f4fce09dc653fbee746d","title":"netflix party could this group watching tech gimmick be a lifesaver","story":"A new Google Chrome extension allows groups of friends to watch and comment on shows and movies together, a genius invention at a difficult timeIf, like me, you’ve been struggling to summon any sort of buoyancy this week, perhaps it’s worth thinking a couple of years ahead. At some point the coronavirus will be eradicated, and humanity will move on from a dark time changed. Great things can come from times of unbelievable hardship. For example, without the second world war we wouldn’t have the NHS.The big advancement from this outbreak remains to be seen. It might be universal income. It might be a global blueprint for how to react more nimbly to a future outbreak. Then again it might just be the website Netflix Party. And if that’s the case, then maybe that isn’t so bad.Netflix Party is a Chrome extension that allows users to chat while they watch the same film at the same time. You log in, share a viewing link with friends, choose one person to be in charge of picking what you watch and, as your chosen show plays out in the bulk of the screen, a chatroom pops up on the right-hand side. You can discuss the show with the people in your room, or argue, or flirt, or veer wildly off-tangent because you’ve realised that you’ve picked an absolute dud to watch.Right now, Netflix Party feels absolutely necessary. Self-quarantine has atomised us, and if this is the closest we can get to watching films and TV shows with our friends, then we’ll grab it with both hands. But then again, even if this wasn’t a time of enormous struggle, Netflix Party would be a terrific idea.Because the biggest downside to this vast glut of non-linear content is that nobody watches the same thing at the same time any more. There are no more water cooler series, because everyone at the water cooler has to tiptoe around the fact that they might be a few episodes ahead of everyone else, and one stray spoiler slip might ruin it for everyone else. Television has always been a social pursuit, but this element has been lost in recent years.Netflix Party isn’t a perfect remedy – take it from a decade-long liveblog veteran, watching and typing at the same time isn’t ideal – but it comes close. In the past I’ve tried watching films with faraway loved ones over the phone, and it was always a nightmare of botched schedules and mistimed cues. It was far more trouble than it was worth. But having an in-vision chatroom connected by a centrally controlled show makes things so much easier. It’s such a good idea that I wish it had existed a few years ago.Imagine watching the penultimate Breaking Bad episode at the same time as a group of friends, all reacting in real time to every sucker-punch moment. Imagine watching the Red Wedding. Imagine watching the Fyre Festival documentary, for crying out loud. The Evian anecdote alone would melt the internet.There’s so much about Netflix Party to get excited about. Especially now, when we’re all a few days away from going stir crazy from staring at the same four walls all day, this feels like a great gulp of clean oxygen. Sure, the novelty will probably wear off before long, just like it has with every other social network going. Semi-professional Netflix Party trolls might pop up, or Netflix Party influencers who’ve been paid on the sly to artificially increase the popularity of, say, Narcos.But right now there’s something pleasingly pure about Netflix Party. It’ll never beat the enjoyment of watching a show with a big group of friends in the same room, but it’s the best any of us can do right now. It’s a lifesaver."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9a7dae2b08f5b98caa13343f12369d93ae43ead1/0_200_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ec2da7a795ff4fb44e8c2fd6d1f7ab1e","title":"wonderchicken oldest fossil of modern bird discovered","story":"Tiny creature, half the size of a mallard, found in rocks dating back to dinosaur ageExperts have discovered a fossil of the world’s oldest known modern bird – a diminutive creature about half the size of a mallard duck.Dubbed the Wonderchicken, the remains were found in rocks dating to about 66.8m to 66.7m years ago, revealing that the bird was active shortly before the asteroid strike that wiped out the dinosaurs 66m years ago.“This is the oldest evidence of modern birds that we have so far,” said Dr Daniel Field, of the University of Cambridge, an avian palaeontologist and co-author of the research.Modern birds evolved from meat-eating theropod dinosaurs, with creatures such as the 150 million-year-old Archaeopteryx cropping up along the way. In sharp contrast to Archaeopteryx, modern birds have no teeth and tend to lack the bony tails and clawed wings of many of their predecessors.It is not clear exactly when modern birds emerged, but estimates range from about 110m years to 85-70m years ago.“As best as we can tell, this fossil sits very close to the common ancestor of two major groups of living birds – the group that eventually gave rise to chickens and their relatives, and the group that eventually gave rise to ducks and their relatives,” Field said.The team says the discovery pushes back the date of the earliest known modern bird: the record was previously held by Vegavis whose fossils were discovered in Antarctica and dated to about 66.5m years ago.Writing in the journal Nature, Field and colleagues describe making the discovery while carrying out CT scans on a specimen donated to Maastricht Natural History Museum. The fossils were unearthed 20 years ago by an amateur fossil hunter at a quarry in Belgium, near the border with the Netherlands, within sedimentary marine rock that is part of the so-called Maastricht Formation.At first, said Field, the specimen appeared unprepossessing. “It is basically four small blocks of rock with a handful of broken limb bones visible, poking out of the rock,” he said. However, on digitally “removing” the low-density rock around the fossil using computer software, the team found something special.“As soon as I did that, this incredible skull – one of the most incredible fossil bird skulls in the world – stared straight out at us, and we could not believe our eyes,” said Field, noting that the lack of teeth and other features of the skull quickly suggested it was from an early modern bird.The team say the bird would have weighed about 400g, about half the size or less of a mallard duck. “It is the same size as a green-winged teal, which is one of the smallest ducks in the entire world,” said Field. “We think it would have had a face that looked a little bit like a modern chicken, and the back of the skull looked a little bit more like a living duck,” he said. Its long slender legs – together with the rocks it was found in – suggest it may have lived along the shoreline.The bird’s official name is Asteriornis maastrichtensis, a reference to the place it was found and the Greek goddess of falling stars, Asteria.“We thought that that was apropos because the fossil is so close in time to the asteroid impact,” said Field, adding the Greek myth describes Asteria being transformed into a quail and throwing herself into the ocean to avoid Zeus, features that nod both to the animal and the habitat in which it may have lived.The team say the fossils not only suggest modern bird evolution was in its early stages when the asteroid struck, but its discovery in Europe opens up debate about whether modern birds emerged in the southern hemisphere, as has previously been proposed.Prof Julia Clarke, an expert in avian palaeontology and Vegavis from the University of Texas, in Austin, who was not involved in the study, described the find as “fantastic” and said it fitted in well with predictions based on Vegavis. “Finding this new fossil in Europe is key to understanding a global pattern of extinction and survivorship in the Latest Cretaceous,” she said. Prof Mike Benton, a palaeontologist from the University of Bristol, said the new skull was “gorgeous”, adding that previous contenders for the world’s oldest duck have been queried, and that fossils hunters have been searching hard for unambiguous members of the modern bird group that definitely lived before the dinosaur mass extinction.“The new fossil ticks all the boxes,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/99988865e5a719b4f6caaa63dde7fa7b20eaedbd/0_163_3504_2103/master/3504.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6afa6ff2c50fa7020376203c9cd9ab0b","title":"the banker review apple first movie is a slick yet patchy racism drama","story":"Strong performances from Anthony Mackie and Samuel L Jackson lift this intriguing if not fully realised true story about black entrepreneurs in the 1960sThere’s a considerable amount of baggage arriving with the delayed release of The Banker, Apple’s first original movie, now landing online after a token two-week theatrical window. Primed for awards glory, or at the very least consideration, the fact-based drama was set to land in December, an ambitious last-minute slot for a film that cannily ticks a large number of Oscar-friendly boxes. But less than three weeks before it was due to open, a flashy world premiere was cancelled and soon after, so was the release.The film, based on the story of two black entrepreneurs who took on unjust white business practices in 1960s America, was mired in controversy when allegations of sexual abuse were levelled at the producer, who also happened to be the lead character’s son. His name has since been taken off the project but given how the claims were never directed at the two men at its centre, both now dead, it remains an unfair blot on a story that deserves to be remembered and celebrated, even if it’s been brought to us in imperfect packaging.Bernard Garrett (Anthony Mackie) grew up with ambitions that the world around him was constantly trying to flatten. As a black teenager growing up in late-1930s Texas, he was made aware that expectations and opportunities were limited but refused to accept the idea that his life would be one of servitude. In the 50s, he made a move into the world of Los Angeles real estate and found a way of sneaking past the systemic hurdles in his way with the help of a business partner, Joe Morris (Samuel L Jackson). The pair used a white frontman, Matt Steiner (Nicholas Hoult), to help secure them deals they would otherwise be denied access to, a nifty con scheme that led them all into a surprising, high-stakes game.As Hollywood continues to gradually fill in the many, many gaps left by the largely white-centric view of history film-makers have previously reconstructed, it remains a pleasure to see little-known stories such as this brought to life. Too often, black characters have been relegated to period films that position them as subservient, trapped playing maids and slaves, but in The Banker, we see businessmen with agency and drive. Garrett and Morris worked hard not just to better their own lives but ultimately the lives of others through buying up banks that would provide affordable loans to people of colour and apartments that were rented out to those who were discriminated against by white landlords. It’s a story that expands with every development yet ironically, one that works best when the focus is more, well, focused.The Banker works best in its snappily paced, magnetically involving first act as we’re drawn into Garrett’s mission, thanks in large part to Mackie, an actor who always feels strangely under the radar despite his movie star charisma and impressive versatility. He makes for a believable everyman who chooses to restrain his anger when faced with daily micro-aggressions, a strategy that Jackson’s more flamboyant counterpart finds confounding. They’re a charming double-act and the early scenes of them trying to prepare Hoult’s clueless foil for business are supremely entertaining.But while director George Nolfi ensures that his film at least looks handsome to the very end, slickly recreating 60s LA, he stumbles to keep his story one that’s worth investing in as the script gets bogged down by the minutiae of banking and of the legalese attached to the plans constructed by the pair. What was once sparkling and tight starts to feel dull and it’s left to Mackie and Jackson to do the majority of the legwork. The facts of the case help to pull us back by the end as we’re taught about the major strides made and the impact their work had for black people at large but a potentially great, if safely made, film then ends up as a solid one instead. Inspiring until the end if not entirely entertaining."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b94e3fc67752ea16efc551389051f7ea1b06c4ad/693_130_5922_3557/master/5922.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=657336de5b14f38f6f7586e2b7d0457f","title":"the truth review hirokazu kore eda catherine deneuve juliette binoche ethan hawke","story":"A legendary movie star’s dubious memoirs outrage her daughter – played by Juliette Binoche – in Hirokazu Kore-eda’s stylish, seductive family dramaThe title is a deadpan challenge, and it is up to us to decide where exactly this movie and its characters live in the disputed territory around truth, untruth, near-truth: the comforting fiction that we all create around what we remember of our lives. This is the first non-Japanese-language film from auteur Hirokazu Kore-eda (Palme d’Or winner at Cannes in 2018 for his film Shoplifters) and he has come to France for a very elegant and insouciant family drama set in Paris, which he has directed from his own script, translated from his original into French by Léa le Dimna.Catherine Deneuve gives a seductive and self-aware performance as Fabienne Dangeville, a creamily well-preserved movie star in her mid-70s who is a legendary figure in her native land – opinionated, vain, imperious with a haughty vagueness about which of her contemporary acting rivals are dead and which alive. (It hardly matters to her.) There is a great scene in which Fabienne whimsically proclaims that all France’s great female stars have surnames which begin with the same letter as their first names: Danielle Darrieux, Simone Signoret, Anouk Aimée – and it is a joy to watch Deneueve’s subtle wince or moue of suppressed disgust when someone adds: “Brigitte Bardot”. (No one dares point out that her own initials don’t match.)It is very stylish, amusing work from Deneuve who comes as close to really loosening up as she is ever going to get, and there is, incidentally, an entertaining, brief shot of her walking her dog in Paris that Kore-eda repeats in full as an out-take over the closing credits.Fabienne has just published her memoirs, outrageously entitled La Vérité, or The Truth, and, to mark this occasion, her screenwriter daughter Lumir (played by Juliette Binoche) has come from New York, bringing along her American husband, Hank (Ethan Hawke), a failing TV actor, and their young daughter, Charlotte (Clémentine Grenier). Instantly, these memoirs cause uproar: her long-suffering assistant Luc (Alain Libolt) quits, because she hasn’t mentioned him at all, and Lumir is furious because Fabienne has invented ridiculous anecdotes about the loving mamma picking her up from school – when of course she was always away filming.Yet Lumir’s attitude to her mother and to their own troubled mother-daughter relationship changes subtly, and mysteriously, because Fabienne has invited her to come and watch the new movie that she is shooting, a sci-fi fantasy entitled Memories of My Mother, about a young woman in the future with a terminal disease who is able to use time travel to visit her young daughter at various ages Fabienne is to play this daughter as an old woman. (It is based on a story by sci-fi author Ken Liu, and it has, in the real world, been adapted as a short film called Beautiful Dreamer, by commercials director David Gaddie.)It is intriguing to wonder if Kore-eda himself considered making his own version of Memories of My Mother, maybe in French, maybe with the same cast envisaged here – but then realised what a shame it would be to waste Deneuve in such a small part. In any case, this enigmatic story within a story has an echo with at least one part of Kore-eda’s previous work: his cult docu-essay fantasy After Life from 1999, which imagined a future in which people are allowed to choose the most ecstatic moment of their lives in which to spend eternity.The Truth starts as a droll tale but then morphs into something else, something stranger and more elusive, something with a hint of fairytale magic realism, which plays with the interconnection between cinema and reality: Fabienne is continually reproached with her attitude to a certain contemporary whose lost career runs alongside Fabienne’s own life in a sort of ghost parallel. Kore-eda might have had in mind at some subconscious level an inversion of the case of Deneuve’s late sister Françoise Dorléac (although the analogy is in any case hardly exact).As for Binoche’s Lumir, the topsy-turvy spectacle of her mother appearing in a role much older than her screen mother affects her strangely, and she begins to see how she might use her own daughter in a dramatic ploy to rethink their relationship, and re-establish her own power within it. It’s a startling, even shocking piece of imposture. This movie is an absorbing serio-comic flourish.• The Truth is released in the UK on 20 March and will be available on the Curzon Home Cinema streaming platform."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4d696a339e1ddc4c1cd5ee2b3771969fa35d49f6/94_162_3745_2247/master/3745.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3fb1f1a44d764c181bd402c30b2def14","title":"wycombes david wheeler a lot more can be done to look after players","story":"Wycombe winger on a promotion bid halted, the challenges of inactivity and how coronavirus threatens small clubsIt is a peculiar time for professional footballers without the carrot of a match at the end of a week. Last Saturday Wycombe Wanderers were due to travel to Burton Albion but, with every Football League match suspended until April owing to coronavirus, David Wheeler ended up spending 90 minutes not on the pitch but on the sofa, bingeing on episodes of All or Nothing, a behind-the-scenes docu‑series centred on Manchester City. “You train nearly every day for 10 months of the year, so geared towards a particular goal and, especially for the teams that are at the top end or bottom end of the table, it’s very high-emotion, high levels of dedication and concentration at this point of the season and so for it to be frozen in time is very, very strange,” the 29-year-old winger says.Wycombe are eighth in League One but three points off an automatic promotion place with the climax of a unique season still to play out. Some clubs have shut up shop, leaving players to train in isolation, some are training sporadically after deep cleans, having introduced stringent measures on hygiene, particularly in gym areas, while for others it is close to business as usual as they await further government advice or updates from the game’s governing bodies.“It’s a waiting game,” says Wheeler. “As a professional athlete you get itchy feet having a few hours indoors – let alone days on end. It is very difficult to stay fit in relevance to football, because you can go for a jog but it’s not the same as football fitness. The way it is looking, with the amount of time we’re going to be off, I’d imagine for health and safety of the players, we’re going to have to have almost a mini pre-season before we set up for the last games because otherwise people will pick up muscle injuries from muscle wastage from sitting around for so long.”Football, and indeed sport, did not seem to wake up to the crisis until the Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, tested positive for the virus – “there was a definite gear change when that happened, which is ridiculous” – and, even then, some National League games continued to be played in front of, in many cases, increased crowds. “It was pretty staggering that some non-league clubs were still playing when the league clubs had decided it was too dangerous. I think it comes from the top and the decision needs to be taken out of people’s hands. It’s like with cafes, pubs and restaurants: the government has told everyone to not go but they haven’t said ‘you have to shut’ so businesses will go under unless they change tack and do something about it.”Boredom does not concern Wheeler, a sports science graduate from Brunel University who arrived in professional football aged 22 at Exeter City after playing part-time for Lewes and Staines Town – “I’ve got loads of books on backlog to read and films to watch” – but he believes the absence of matches and formal training schedules could seriously affect others. “You almost lose your purpose a little bit, because there’s no direction to what you’re doing at the minute. There is often a lot of talk about players that get injured or are not involved that spend days on end sitting at home and end up getting hooked on gambling or other addictions. If they thought it was bad before, it is going to be a hell of a lot worse in the next few months. Are the players really being looked after? I would argue a lot more can be done. I would argue that it’s way past the need for more mental‑health provision and psychological help to players within clubs.”Wheeler joined Wycombe last summer after loan spells away from Queens Park Rangers, whom he joined in 2017, at MK Dons and Portsmouth and, from his experience, he believes the virus will have serious implications for clubs, particularly those that were in precarious positions before the suspension of fixtures and needed gate-receipt income. “There will be plenty of clubs that are built on a house of cards, and you only have to look at the examples in recent history of Bury and Bolton to realise it doesn’t take a lot to knock some of these clubs over and something like this is way, way above what any club could have expected.“It’s very much short-termism in football, very much here and now and every club seems to throw as much money as they can at trying to win the league, get promoted or get into the play-offs because essentially for players, staff and, sometimes the owners, it’s about this season and this season only. Sometimes it’s only about the next few months, because leagues like the Championship are so volatile. Clubs are not insulated for things like this.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dc77593047edc5c23cf62f383339649a90824aee/0_22_5185_3111/master/5185.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ca508428bc7918844bab9fa6ba532655","title":"covid 19 phil foden england prospects not healthy euro 2020","story":"If your way of dealing with existential stress is to say: ‘Look, it’s going to boost Foden’s England chances,’ then, you know, get realSay what you will about our monumentally mind-warping new reality but it certainly offers the opportunity to type sentences that might have appeared to be facetious attempts at satire a mere fortnight ago. Sentences like, “Manchester United are working from home.” Or, “West Ham’s Karren Brady has suggested there is an antidote to the deadly coronavirus pandemic.”If the latter reference puzzles you, let’s see it in action in Karren’s critically misunderstood Sun column from last weekend (in which she decided, among other things, that the Premier League season should be declared null and void and Liverpool denied the title despite being 25 points clear at the top).“The only antidote at present,” explains Baroness Brady of coronavirus, “is care in human contact and unrelenting pursuit of hygiene.” I heard that antidote meant something different than that? But as I’ve had to remind myself so many times over the past couple of weeks: you’re not an epidemiologist, Marina. Listen to the experts in this case, the vice-chair of West Ham.In many ways it feels unfair to single out any particular master or mistress of the footballing universe for mild sarcasm. From Brady’s bunch of arse to de‑facto virus‑modelling from Uefa, who seem to be speculating that Istanbul could well be fine in June, Big Sport is struggling to pivot to its new position of immense irrelevance.Not that a form of lip service isn’t being paid. Arguably the most unintentionally comic pose is that of the sporting big cheese taking magisterial care to explain to you there are more important things than sport right now. Is that a fact? Like me, you probably had no idea there were, until a member of Her Majesty’s Sports Press enlightened you.But of course the self-importance goes much higher. In this vein, it is absolutely no surprise to receive a lengthy statement from the Fifa president, Gianni Infantino, in which he informed the planet: “Cooperation, mutual respect and understanding must be the guiding principles for all decision-makers to have in mind at this crucial moment in time.” Something for the director-general of the World Health Organization to take on board, there. I’m sure it means so much more to Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, coming from one Swiss‑headquartered chief executive to another.Even well-meaning gestures seem like acts of absurdist theatre. On Tuesday, Sky Sports made a public announcement that pubs will not be charged for their Sky Sports accounts during this period of no sport. And, indeed, this period of no pubs.Against this backdrop of wild malfunction and warp-speed recalibration, then, comes the Breaking! News! that Uefa will hold Euro 2020 in the year 2021, or at least it will on current estimates. The decision was reached in Uefa’s Tuesday conference call, a telephonic fixture trailed slightly more portentously than a second-tier Champions League tie. The announcement would have seemed unthinkable once upon a time (ie two weeks ago). But this week it was largely met with the sort of seismic shock you’d expect to greet the news that your club’s second-choice right-back was likely to be out this weekend with a thigh strain.The Premier League will be next out of the traps, of course, with their “crunch talks” scheduled for Thursday. I note from football dispatches that England will be “worst hit” by the mounting fixture backlog and there is a “genuine fear” the season may not be able to be played out. Which does feel like it should place maybe three or four on the list of “genuine fears” doing the rounds.In some ways the most fascinating reaction to the implication of the postponement is those who have retreated into the familiar comfort of simply assessing where the England team may be in terms of development one year after scheduled kick-off. If your way of dealing with existential stress is to say, look: it’s going to give Phil Foden a whole extra year to be brought on … then, you know, fine. Whatever gets you through it. But I would be failing in my duties as a human if I didn’t say: are you OK? Do you want me to get some shopping in for you?We’re in the relatively early stages of a deadly pandemic and the leader of the free world is Donald Actual Trump, while our prime minister is Boris Actual Johnson. I feel like wondering if Dean Henderson will be pushing Jordan Pickford for the England goalkeeper spot is at best a slight swerve of the main point and at worst not quite the swings‑and‑roundabouts positive it’s being billed as. Though your footballing fundamentals are doubtless sound, even working through them out loud feels considerably less rational than even the Twitter user I saw react to the Euro 2020 postponement with the deathless analysis “fuck the person who ate the fucking bat”.Then again, why cavil? There is a strong displacement activity feel to a lot of these high-level discussions and which of us can say we aren’t in need of a bit of that right now? If you, me, or anyone else can even momentarily distract themselves with the ins and outs of how Uefa may reach this or that decision that will almost certainly be overtaken by events infinitely bigger than it, then let’s have it. Social goods come in many forms and we’ll have plenty of time to be surprised by some of the more recherché ones in the months ahead."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f633c96c8a49177da8bdb4ddaa297c1ae7052ebd/2_0_3020_1814/master/3020.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=256dcdc382f7306c170705fdac948973","title":"euro 2020 euro 2021 winners and losers football","story":"Kane and Rashford can recover, Haaland can get even better but Belgium, Ronaldo and Modric could be on the way downFor several weeks it had been clear that, given the rate of Covid-19’s spread, a pan-European tournament was the least desirable event possible. Postponing it was the only sensible, conscionable and practicable thing to do: it sends the right message at a time when people across the continent will have to make temporary changes to their lives and also ensures football plays its own part in keeping potentially dangerous movements to a minimum. And when this is all over, perhaps Euro 2021 will take on a new, potent and poignant life as a celebration of bonds restored and friendships rekindled.Harry Kane and Marcus RashfordIt would not be a major tournament without a personnel scare in the England camp and, realistically, will probably still not be one either. But a year’s delay lifts the anxiety over getting Harry Kane and Marcus Rashford fit and firing for a tournament whose Wembley-based latter stages ensure there is plenty of pressure to be present at the sharp end. If nothing else, the long months ahead will allow time for plenty of daydreaming about a Kane trophy lift on 11 July next year.Erling Braut Haaland and Europe’s other young gunsWould Euro 2020 have come too soon for some of the continent’s best youngsters to upstage the existing order? We will never know but, assuming they can outgun Serbia in the play-offs, an exciting Norway generation – spearheaded by Erling Braut Haaland and Martin Ødegaard – will have extra time to smooth the rough edges. Other teams may benefit similarly even their fellow play-off participants Kosovo, whose star winger Arber Zeneli now has added scope to recover from a cruciate injury. Perhaps the year’s delay will ensure the orthodoxy is turned on its head.Dutch fortunes have picked up considerably over the past year and there is a school of thought that, given another 12 months and a few more fixtures to prepare, Ronald Koeman’s team may be able to compete seriously for the title. They already have the world’s best defender in Virgil van Dijk but Frenkie de Jong, Donny van de Beek and Donyell Malen will have had more time to refine themselves into a unit better than the one thatcurrently looks likely to fall just short against the very best.It comes some way down the list of current health concerns but there still seems little harm in giving Europe’s top-tier footballers a breather, especially if this is backed up by shortened domestic and ChampionsEuropa League campaigns. You will hardly find a top manager who, at least privately, likes the relentlessness of the modern schedule and perhaps a buildup with less football being played will help players’ fitness and give us a better spectacle too.Fifa has agreed to delay the first edition of its revamped Club World Cup, due to be held in 2021, to make way for the Euro 2020 and Copa América tournaments which have been postponed for a year due to the coronavirus pandemic.Fifa said in a statement on Wednesday that it would decide at a later stage when to schedule the new Club World Cup which was due to take place in JuneJuly 2021.The new-look 24-team tournament, the brainchild of Fifa president Gianni Infantino, would be the biggest so far, taking place across eight Chinese cities, and including eight teams from Europe with six from South America. Until now, the competition has featured seven teams in total.Fifa has also set up a working group to consider possible changes to transfer regulations amid fears that players whose contracts end during the stoppage could lose their jobs. Fifa said it wanted to protect contracts for both players and clubs and adjusting player registration periods.The group would also consider creating a fund to compensate those in football who suffer financial hardship as a result of the pandemic. ReutersEuro 2020 always looked like the last chance for the rump of Belgium’s hugely feted “golden generation” to bring home a trophy. Shifting things back a year is not the end of the world but it might make a difference to a squad whose best players are hovering precariously around their peak. Eden Hazard will be 30 by the time the rescheduled tournament kicks off Kevin De Bruyne will turn 30 during it. Toby Alderweireld and Axel Witsel will both have turned 32 while Jan Vertonghen will have attained confirmed veteran status at 34. Even Romelu Lukaku and Thorgan Hazard will be senior players at 28. Youthful promise will have given way to delivery-or-bust.Cristiano Ronaldo and Luka ModricWill a 36-year-old Cristiano Ronaldo still be in prime shape to help Portugal retain their European crown? Far stranger things have happened given the supreme condition in which he keeps himself but it is hard not to think that, given his astonishing goalscoring record with Juventus this season, Euro 2020 would have arisen at exactly the right time. Modric, seven months younger than Ronaldo, has a similar issue. The way he dragged Croatia to the World Cup final was inspirational but will those legs be able to perform one last hurrah in 2021?The Football Association of Ireland’s financial woes are well-documented and have, over the past year, been the subject of an official inquiry. So the postponement of four games at the Aviva Stadium in Dublin is unlikely to be good news for the debt-stricken organisation, and nor is the wait over as to whether Mick McCarthy’s team earn them a windfall by qualifying through the play-offs. And therein lies another huge, thorny issue: McCarthy was to be replaced by Stephen Kenny on 1 August as part of a long-established succession plan. Early suggestions are that both men will assert their right to the throne if Ireland do make it – assuming the play-offs take place this summer at all – and the situation could become a messy one.It should not be taken as a dismissal of women’s football that the original Euro 2021 will almost certainly now need moving. Covid-2019 has wreaked havoc upon the entire calendar and everyone is going to have to absorb some significant inconvenience. The priority now must be to make sure the competition gets the platform and visibility it merits. Holding it back-to-back, or even concurrent, with the men’s tournament would be logistically difficult on many fronts – not least when this summer’s Olympics still seem in the balance. Far more sensible would be to maintain its own slot in 2022 no one wants to wait another two years given the immense quality of Euro 2017 and the 2019 World Cup but there is unlikely to be a better way.The veteran manager was due to bow out with a Euro 2020 campaign partly contested on his team’s home turf in Copenhagen. He will retire this summer and be replaced by Kasper Hjulmand, with no wrangling expected over that state of affairs. “My contract expires on 31 July and I expect we will terminate our cooperation after that date is planned,” Hareide said.

He is talking about the 16 large-scale colour photographs of teenage boys that went on display at City Hall in London last autumn. They are distinctive in that each of the 13-year-olds is smiling, captured in moments of happiness, relaxation and vulnerability.“For them to allow me to capture this of them took a lot of work, to peel back these layers of stoicism that they need for protection and self-preservation, but which fuel a self-fulfilling prophecy of what people perceive them to be,” he says.The photographs are on show again this month, printed on to large flags hanging from the ceiling at Brixton Village Market.But Rufai’s photography is just the most high-profile aspect of a wider initiative, the Smile-ing Boys Project, which aims to address the mental health needs of black teenage boys that can go unacknowledged and unmet. Rufai, whose previous work has explored issues around masculinity, says the project was a direct response to rising levels of knife crime, government “kneejerk” reactions and the media portrayal of black boys and men as perpetrators and victims.As a black male artist already working with young people, Rufai explains, he could see that rising knife crime was a “symptom of something bigger” and young black boys weren’t being given the tools to manage their mental health.“These young boys don’t have positive outlets,” he says. “Who’s talking about that? I realised that nobody was – and if they were, it was on the margins.”With £32,000 funding from the Wellcome Trust, Rufai developed a series of workshops around the eight “pillars” of happiness, such as belonging, security and sense of purpose. He even travelled to Scandinavia and Bhutan – which measures prosperity through gross national happiness – to carry out background research.About 30 boys were recruited from three schools in south London via teacher recommendations as being among the most disengaged. They were given cameras to document which aspects of their lives were contributing to, or working against, their happiness, including people and places.The boys then discussed the photos together in the workshops and talked about which aspects of their lives they had control over and which ones they didn’t.“It created a platform for them to discuss the things they generally weren’t able to talk to people about,” says Rufai. The challenge of having an absent father was an important issue to emerge, says the 36-year-old, who was born in Poplar, east London, but grew up in Nigeria and California – and one he faced himself during his childhood.Last year’s eight-month pilot project culminated in an exhibition of the boys’ work at Battersea Arts Centre, with extra funding from the Arts Council. It documented their stories through their photography, poetry and creative writing.The Smile-ing Boys Project is now in four more schools, but Rufai wants to eventually see this preventative work in all schools in the capital as an alternative provision to “typically punitive ways of dealing with kids that they struggle to engage with”, such as pupil referral units or exclusion units.The Smile-ing Boys initiative was one of two contrasting projects to emerge last year that both used photographic portraits to challenge stereotypes of black boys and men, and the perceptions they may have of themselves.The 56 Black Men campaign used a series of portraits of black working men wearing hooded tops to cast a spotlight on the issue. The men, photographed by and including the project’s founder, Cephas Williams, look straight at the camera, compelling the viewer to look them directly in the eye.Their job titles and achievements – such as MP, court clerk, project manager, physiotherapist – are written below, challenging people to examine their own prejudices about what black men can be.Beamed across social media, on billboards and exhibited at the headquarters of the advertising agency M\u0026ampC Saatchi, the portraits sparked a national conversation about stereotypes and the role of the media in the negative representation of black men.Williams, a 28-year-old entrepreneur, grew up in New Cross, south London, where his peers were predominantly black and Essex, where he was at one point the only black pupil in his school. He describes attending college among mainly black people and then stepping into a white world when he took up a degree in architecture. These experiences he says, helped “inform a world view”.He first conceived the idea in 2018 after his project to develop a studio for the local creative community in Peckham High Street stalled because of difficulties with the council and others over the building. Williams turned his frustration into positive action by launching a campaign to help black men change their own narrative.The portraits were a powerful way to attract attention and start a conversation. He chose 56 because this was how many black men were murdered in London in 2018. “The premise really is for black men and boys to see ourselves amplified in a positive light for once,” he says. He adds that 56 Black Men has become a “movement”. Williams, who gives talks on issues around ersity and inclusion to FTSE 100 companies, says: “There are so many other positive black men out there doing stuff like this who don’t get seen, who don’t get the support they need. Instead of their efforts being highlighted, we’re always talking about the negative portrayal of black men.” With this in mind, Williams has big ambitions as the project enters its second year. He wants to raise funds to bring black men to the stage to tell their stories through “56 Black Men Live” events. An initial show held at Theatre Peckham in October, he says, was a success, but he hopes shows will be run at high-profile venues such as the National Theatre in the long run.Williams says: “56 Black Men wants to bring storytelling to the stage, part of the reason being that we want black men to be in control of their own narrative.” Williams is also planning a campaign against racism in football in the form of another portrait series featuring black men connected by their love for the sport. At the same time, he is working with City companies to create an “experience exchange” to give black men direct access to business leaders in the City and other industries. It will help address the problem of black men feeling as if they do not necessarily fit the mould to work in these industries and also change stereotypical perceptions among chief executives and other decision-makers.“A lot of people live on one side of the river and these black boys live on the other side of the river – and they never get to have a real conversation. There’s no forum set up for that,” says Williams. “So how do we build more inclusive companies when we don’t understand what it feels like to be this person?”For Williams, the overall strength of the movement will come in numbers and making connections with those who wield power and influence. A 56 Black Men members’ club has even been suggested. “For the black community, we need what I’ve coined as a ‘unified knock’,” he says. “It’s not just inidual people knocking on doors, getting dribs and drabs of money and support and dribs and drabs of allies,” he says.• The Smile-ing Boys portraits are at Brixton Village Market until 28 April. Another set of  portraits will be at Battersea Arts Centre from 2-19 April. 56 Black Men portraits can be viewed viewed at 56blackmen "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/20cf516a240009fdfcaab2a4c509bac070f98115/175_364_4109_2465/master/4109.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b7140fd4896d4faa2e0f9658c658d8c9","title":"bbc to open up its writers academy to non professionals","story":"Eight successful applicants will be trained and write for top television showsThe BBC is to throw open the doors of its Writers’ Academy to anyone who wants to have a shot at writing for television, in a move dubbed “X Factor for writers”.In the past, only professional screenwriters have been allowed to apply to the academy, but in a bid to bring in voices from different backgrounds any budding writer will be able to try to follow in the footsteps of previous winners such as Killing Eve and The Victim writer Rob Williams.The eight successful applicants will write for BBC Studios’ biggest shows such as EastEnders and Casualty, have lectures from writers such as Line of Duty’s Jed Mercurio and Years and Years writer Russell T Davies and get three months of paid training.The move may be welcomed by those in self-isolation due to the coronavirus outbreak who are looking for something to focus on. Recently, stories have been shared about the creativity that has emerged from historical quarantines. William Shakespeare is thought to have penned King Lear during a plague outbreak and Sir Isaac Newton reportedly discovered gravity while in quarantine.The head of the BBC Studios Writers’ Academy, John Yorke, said writing could help people cope with anxiety.“It’s easy to be simplistic about this, but I think if people do have time on their hands and the urge to write, then writing is an incredibly good process for mental health and taking your mind off some of the wider anxieties that people are clearly going to face.“It’s a great way of ordering your mind and thoughts but also allows you to cope with the wider anxieties in a way that could be very beneficial.”He continued: “I think it’s fascinating, if you look back at any vaguely comparable situation, what people are looking for is escapism, joy and entertainment … you look back at the BBC’s output during the war and it was light entertainment that people remember and got people through.“We’re obviously not going to judge it on that, but every year you see different kinds of stories – there’s always recurring themes, or society changes, and I’m sure we’ll see that.”Yorke added that the Writers’ Academy has often been sent good but ineligible scripts in the past by non-professional writers, which had prompted the change: “At a time when it’s harder than ever for new writers to break in, this course allows writers from less privileged backgrounds to get their first important step into television.”“One voice … can transform a company, script or a programme, so if we can find them, as I think that’s very much the BBC’s job, that’s a really good thing to do.”Applicants will be whittled down by a team of script experts and the winners will have their work optioned by BBC Studios.

From the plethora of TV shows on competing streaming platforms to the seemingly infinite choice offered by online music and gaming services, the wealth of new material being released each month is staggering. Yet when it comes to cultural consumption, audiences are increasingly choosing to seek out classic, safe bets – forgoing the next big thing in favour of the last big thing.According to UK media watchdog Ofcom, the single most-watched programme in the first quarter of 2019 was the 1990s sitcom Friends. In the US, the top Netflix spot has long been held by the US version of the Office, which first aired 15 years ago. Meanwhile at the box office, sequels and reboots abound. Last year’s top five grossing films in the UK included the remake of the Lion King, Toy Story 4, Frozen 2 and Star Wars: Episode IX – the Rise of Skywalker.Even computer gaming is stepping increasingly back into the past. Two of the biggest launches in recent years have actually been mini versions of the comparatively ancient 80s and 90s games consoles, Sega’s Mega Drive and Nintendo’s SNESNES. “Without a doubt, people are going back to the classics,” says Iain Simons, director of the National Videogame Museum in Sheffield. “They pioneered so many of the things we have today.”One obvious reason why audiences are opting for classic, safe bets is the sense of comfort they can provide in a world that feels increasingly precarious. This feeling of comfort isn’t simply a function of nostalgic familiarity, however. Today’s new TV shows often reflect our current dystopian mood and the fashion for grisly narrative plot twists and traumatic backstories. Think Black Mirror compared with Frasier.There are other reasons for playing it safe when it comes to pop culture. Partly, it can be about taking joy in simplicity amid the complexity of the world we live in. Our frantic pace of life makes spare time so rare that people are wary of not enjoying the little they have of it. “I can see the appeal in a safe bet, especially if you are going to spend a lot of money on tickets,” says Anna Smith, film critic, broadcaster and host of the all-female film review podcast Girls on Film.Likewise, Simons notes that there’s a beauty in the relative simplicity of older video games: “There’s something comforting about only having three lives in a game there are only so many hours in the day.”Nostalgic cultural consumption can also remove the all-too common problem of too much choice. “The overabundance of content can make people feel overwhelmed,” says Cristel Russell, a professor of marketing at Graziadio Business School, who has conducted several studies into people’s re-reading of stories and reconsumption of media. “It’s like going to a restaurant and the menu being 20 pages long. You’re probably just going to order something you’ve had before.”One of Russell’s studies found that revisiting cultural favourites is such a deliberate act – as opposed to a habit – that she coined the term “volitional reconsumption” to describe it. She also found that nostalgic culture can offer something that new works can’t: a form of self-discovery. “The thing you’re watching hasn’t changed, but you have,” explains Russell. “You’ve accumulated all this knowledge and experience, so you’re not looking at it through the same eyes. When you revisit it, you get to see how much you have changed as a person.”Revisiting pieces of classic cultural entertainment can also give us bonding social experiences. For instance, events such as Secret Cinema, which screens old favourites in specially-created immersive worlds, thrive on the feeling of community and belonging you get when you bring fans of a movie together to celebrate it. “I think one of the keys here is the community aspect: we love to watch a cherished film with others, and laugh and cry together,” says Smith. “In a society that feels increasingly less community driven, in many ways this is an outlet for a positive shared experience.”There are other possible psychological benefits to reconsuming cultural works. Erica Hepper, a lecturer in personality and social psychology at the University of Surrey, has researched the social emotion of nostalgia, including the reconsumption of works of art. One study involved letting participants choose an old, beloved song to listen to and then comparing their emotions with those of people who hadn’t done so. “Time and again, we found that people who listened to something that was nostalgic experienced all of these psychological boosts – they feel more connected to people, they feel better about themselves, they feel more optimistic,” says Hepper. “They also feel more motivated to achieve their goals. So nostalgia isn’t about being stuck in the past, it actually looks to the future.”Indeed, one of Russell’s studies showed that reconsuming cultural works can even involve more intense cognitive processes than watching something for the first time. To test this, subjects were made to wear eye-tracking equipment while watching a black-and-white Russian film twice. The equipment monitored both the movement of their eyes and pupil dilation, which can indicate the intensity of the cognitive effort they were undergoing. “Sure enough, on the second viewing, your eye gaze goes to different parts of the screen – you are taking it in in a different way,” says Russell.She found that people were watching in a way that suggested they appreciated the film much more as a work of art on the second viewing. For instance, they were looking at all the creative details rather than just following the plot. Moreover, she found that people’s pupils were more dilated while doing so. “When you rewatch something, the cognitive effort involved changes. You are hyper-responsive – all of your senses are on. It is a much more intense process than watching something for the first time.”That intensity might seem counterintuitive, given how comforting nostalgic pop culture can feel. But as the trend itself illustrates, opting for comforting pop culture isn’t a passive act. Given the emotional and psychological upsides of the tried and tested, it’s no wonder we enjoy watching things again. And again. And again.Safety mattersYour world matters to us.

The coronavirus can be spread through airborne droplets released when infected people cough or sneeze, so keeping your distance reduces your chances of becoming infected by this route. Avoid contact with anyone with symptoms of coronavirus: a high temperature andor a new continuous cough.No, but for most people it means radical lifestyle changes. To reduce the spread of the virus, you should avoid meeting up with friends and family, avoid venues such as pubs, clubs, restaurants, cinemas and theatres, and work from home wherever possible. If you need to see the doctor or other essential services, use the phone, internet or social media if possible. You can go out for a walk for exercise, but stay two metres away from others.Avoid it whenever you can. Handrails, buttons, windows, seat fabrics and other surfaces can all become contaminated. If you have to travel on buses, trains or trams, try to avoid rush-hour and other busy times of day, and wash your hands.Some people are at much greater risk from coronavirus than others and it is doubly important for them to follow the advice. This includes everyone aged 70 or above, regardless of how healthy they are, and people of any age with specific underlying conditions. The list of medical conditions includes long-term respiratory problems, such as asthma, bronchitis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) heart disease, such as heart failure chronic kidney or liver disease neurological conditions, including Parkinson’s and MS, problems with the spleen, including sickle cell disease, and anyone with a weakened immune system, such as those with HIVAids, or on steroids or chemotherapy. People who are obese, with a BMI of 40 or more, and those who are pregnant are also in the high-risk group.A further group of people are at even greater risk from coronavirus and NHS England intends to contact them with specific advice in late March. That group includes people who have had organ replacements and are on immuno-suppressants those with cancer who are on chemo- or radio-therapy, people with bone marrow or blood cancers, such as leukaemia those with severe asthma, cystic fibrosis and other serious chest problems, and people with other serious medical conditions, for example those needing kidney dialysis.The government is expected to issue even stricter advice in the coming weeks, with those aged 70 and over, and other vulnerable groups, being asked to self-isolate at home for 12 weeks. This aims to keep their contact with others to a minimum when the epidemic in the UK reaches its peak.First of all, try to maintain a healthy lifestyle by eating well, drinking enough water, and exercising regularly. Try to avoid smoking and drinking alcohol. Open the windows for some ventilation and try to get some natural sunlight. It’s an opportunity to read, listen to the radio, watch TV and pursue other indoor hobbies.The most common symptoms are a new continuous cough andor a high temperature. If you live alone and have either, no matter how mild, stay at home for seven days after symptoms began. If you live with others, everyone in the house must stay at home and not leave for 14 days.The infection is likely to spread from person to person in shared houses. If anyone else starts to show symptoms while already in isolation, they must stay at home for seven days from the moment their own symptoms start, regardless of where they are in the 14-day isolation period.If you can, move them in with friends or family for as long as you are in isolation. But if you can’t it is important to be meticulous about cleaning and handwashing and stay away from them as much as possible. Minimise the amount of time they spend in shared areas, such as kitchens, bathrooms, and sitting areas, and keep those areas well ventilated. The infection can spread through shared towels, crockery, cutlery and other items, so if possible make sure they have their own. If you share a toilet or bathroom, clean all the surfaces after using the facilities.There is no specific advice on breastfeeding. Babies can pick up the infection, though the evidence so far suggests that children are generally not as badly affected as adults. The government states that the benefits of breastfeeding outweigh the potential risks of the virus, but add that it is a personal decision people can discuss with their midwife or health visitor.Keep yourself hydrated and consider painkillers such as paracetamol to help with symptoms. If your condition worsens, or your symptoms don’t improve in seven days, use the NHS 111 online coronavirus service, or call NHS 111. In an emergency, call 999."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6db1c652e058bc838cdc2e8be78520a5851a0a6b/0_154_4645_2786/master/4645.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ddc078e268621959524bdc51f68a8c33","title":"tom brady tampa bay buccaneers nfl new england patriots football","story":"The quarterback teamed up with Bill Belichick to become a ruthless winner in New England. Tampa Bay coach Bruce Arians has a very different philosophyMontana finished in a Chiefs jersey. Jordan retired as a Wizard. Gretzky went out in New York. And now it appears Tom Brady will spend the final years of his professional career playing for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.I repeat: Tom Brady, he of six Super Bowls, New England Patriots fame, is departing the most successful team in modern NFL history and is all but certain to move his operation to Tampa, Florida, in order to join a team with the NFL’s third-worst record over the past decade. The Patriots went 125-35 between 2010 and 2019, winning three Super Bowls: The Buccaneers: 59-101, with zero playoff appearances.Brady leaving the Patriots to join the Bucs is as much about lifestyle as anything else. Tampa’s coach, Bruce Arians, is famed for his laidback, there’s-more-to-life-than-football style. He drinks beers in the parking lots with the players and their families after games. He threatens to fire coaches if they miss a dance recital or ballgame or a family member’s birthday. “Those years don’t come back,” Arians famously said.Arians certainly does not reflect the ruthless, win at all costs Patriot Way. For Brady, a man soon-to-be in his mid-40s, the family stuff starts to matter a whole lot more.There are football reasons for the switch, too. The Bucs have one of the best two-man receiving tandems in the sport: Mike Evans and Chris Godwin. There is also a chance Antonio Brown joins the group. He and Brady have remained in close contact, and Brown worked under Arians back in his Pittsburgh days. And you can chuck into that mix tight end OJ Howard, who is as physically gifted as any at his position in the sport, though he fell victim to Arians’ scheme – which almost vehemently opposes the use of tight-ends as pass-catchers – in the coach’s first season in Tampa.The Bucs were impressive on both sides of the ball last season, despite Jameis Winston tossing 30 interceptions. In fact, it’s likely that Brady surveyed the landscape and sought out the best possible defense rather than offense when making his decision. The Bucs defense finished fifth in DVOA last season. The other two Brady suitors? The Raiders, 31st the Chargers, 21st.The fit between coach and quarterback remains iffy. Arians is known as a fun-n-gun coach, someone who wants his quarterbacks to make long throws. When his offenses have been at their best – first in Pittsburgh and then in Arizona – it’s been when he’s had a strong-armed quarterback who could throw the ball deep down the field outside the numbers, often supplemented with a sound running game.That’s not Brady. He is a rhythm player: hit the back foot, get the ball out. Everything he does is about precision and timing. In New England, Brady was also the master of pre-snap manipulation. He controlled everything and the Patriots ran everything: two-back sets, spread-sets, motions, shifts, fullbacks, h-backs. The Patriots align players anywhere and everywhere. Players’ roles shift on a week-to-week, concept-to-concept basis. Wide receivers become ball-carriers, and they shift between inside and perimeter positions. Running backs are used as a deep threat in the passing game. It was a complex, all-encompassing system.And it all flowed through Brady. He digested each morsel of information and made sure the team used the best play possible against whichever look a defense presented. Indeed, the Patriots system was always at its best when Brady was able to jump into the no-huddle, marshaling things alone at the line of scrimmage.Adjustments flow both ways. Will Arians let Brady bring the New England blueprint with him? Will Brady welcome a shift away from a system that puts so much focus on his decision-making and timing rather than letting him just go out there and rip it?Remember: Brady will be 43 by the time the new season starts. His arm remains as strong as it’s been since the early 2010s, but, barring a wild 2007 run, throwing the ball vertically has never been his biggest strength. Will Arians be happy running a system reliant on precise, underneath routes? If it works, you would think so.But it remains an essential question the pair must figure out together. Taking deep dropbacks would be a recipe for disaster. Tampa Bay’s offensive-line ranks anywhere from solid to good by most metrics. They finished 22nd in adjusted sack rate and 16th in pressure rate. But even those numbers were slightly inflated by Winston’s, umm, ability to go off-script, break a play, and avoid sacks.Tampa’s group has talent, most notably inside. But they’re a group built for an Arians offense, not a Brady one. They maul people in the run-game then set deep in the passing game.The shift to Brady couldn’t be more radical. Brady isn’t utterly immobile, but he’s not exactly mobile either. He’s a pocket shuffler. Others bob and weave like a boxer, keeping a play alive until they scamper away or find an open teammate. Brady likes to adjust the radar of a pass-rusher by a fraction. At high speed, it feels like a world of difference. They can see still him. It looks like he’s in the same spot, but for some reason, he’s now out of range. It is exceptionally effective, but only to a point. Brady has noticeably become gun-shy in the past two seasons, chucking the ball into the dirt or throwing it away in order to avoid big hits. There were times last season where he was inching closer to the fossil most quarterbacks become at the very end.But Brady is still good. That’s important to note. Is he the Brady of old? No. But he still ranks as a league-average starter, one with a rolodex of football information stored in his brain. Wriggle his way into the post-season, and with the weapons, he has on the perimeter and a frisky Bucs defense, he would have a shot. That, along with a new challenge and a less pressurized environment, was probably what he was looking for.None of his other options were great. In Jon Gruden and the Las Vegas Raiders, he would have found a better schematic fit and someone who shares his football psychopathy. It wouldn’t have been all that much fun, though. The Los Angeles Chargers, meanwhile, are a rotating morass of mediocrity and the little brother in a city that’s yet to prove it has an appetite for professional football. In Tampa, Brady has found the best of some not-great situations. Arians is smart enough to step back or push, depending on what is needed.This move was about ego and joy. About respect. About credit, and how we, as a collective, apportion it between Brady and Belichick. Now, they will both go it alone, albeit at the back-end of their careers. Maybe Brady won’t win a Lombardi, but as a steady hand on a team with a bunch of young talent, he will surely have some fun."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/803bfe69f3b60466d2c52dcc18d5b54b22a1ba8f/0_2_5639_3386/master/5639.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9b8b415771221a54e5621fe3a4d1f54f","title":"thats a fact olympics are cursed says japans deputy prime minister","story":"Japan’s deputy prime minister has said the Tokyo Olympics are “cursed”, as speculation mounts that the Games will have to be postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic.Taro Aso, who has a history of making gaffes, told a parliamentary committee on Wednesday that the Olympics appeared to be blighted by world events every 40 years.Japan had planned to host the summer and winter Olympics in 1940, but the second world war forced the cancellation of both Games.Forty years later, many countries, including the US, China and Japan, boycotted the Moscow Olympics in protest at the Soviet Union’s invasion of Afghanistan.“It’s a problem that’s happened every 40 years – it’s the cursed Olympics, and that’s a fact,” Aso said.As Japanese officials and International Olympic Committee again insisted the Games would go ahead as planned, it emerged that the Tokyo 2020 organising committee’s chief, Yoshiro Mori, had recently attended a meeting with a senior sports official who had since tested positive for the virus.Mori, a former prime minister, was at the same 10 March meeting, held to discuss last year’s Rugby World Cup, as the deputy head of the Japanese Olympic Committee, Kozo Tashima, who tested positive on Tuesday.Mori, who is 82 and has lung cancer, has not shown symptoms and does not meet the requirements for a test, an official from his office told Reuters.About 60 people attended the meeting, with Mori seated about 10 metres away from Tashima on the opposite side of the table, according to Jun Kusumoto, a spokesman for the Rugby World Cup organising committee. Health authorities have contacted other attendees who are thought to be at risk.The chief cabinet secretary, Yoshihide Suga, told reporters that the prime minister, Shinzo Abe, had met Mori on Monday, but did not directly address a question about whether Abe would be tested.Aso, who doubles as finance minister, said holding the Games this summer would “not make sense” if other countries were unable to send their athletes.“As the prime minister said, it’s desirable to hold the Olympics in an environment where everyone feels safe and happy. But that’s not something Japan alone can decide.”Tokyo 2020 organisers said a little-known Japanese swimmer who competed in the 1996 Atlanta Games would receive the Olympic torch during a scaled-back handover ceremony in Athens later on Thursday.Naoko Imoto, who works in Greece for Unicef, had been approached by organisers after virus-related travel restrictions prevented a Japanese delegation from flying to Athens to receive the symbolic flame, which is due to arrive in Japan on Friday.“We decided yesterday that we felt it was necessary for a Japanese person to undertake this role,” the organising committee’s chief executive, Toshiro Muto, told reporters."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d8de71b9ea8e316621e768e022bdc3fca4f0bd80/205_474_5067_3041/master/5067.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=591267d37ed03b52b5e92c928dfd288d","title":"iditarod 2020 the worlds most famous sled dog race in pictures","story":"Thomas Waerner of Norway won the nearly 1,000-mile sled dog race in Alaska, of the few sporting events not canceled amid the coronavirus outbreak"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a8023d572e2e1ef25e938fcd7e5c9cb98b7c7da2/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7f8f12d8879fd6ed7ec610d39ccbf7b6","title":"can computers ever replace the classroom","story":"With 850 million children worldwide shut out of schools, tech evangelists claim now is the time for AI education. But as the technology’s power grows, so too do the dangers that come with it. By  Alex BeardFor a child prodigy, learning didn’t always come easily to Derek Haoyang Li. When he was three, his father – a famous educator and author – became so frustrated with his progress in Chinese that he vowed never to teach him again. “He kicked me from here to here,” Li told me, moving his arms wide.Yet when Li began school, aged five, things began to click. Five years later, he was selected as one of only 10 students in his home province of Henan to learn to code. At 16, Li beat 15 million kids to first prize in the Chinese Mathematical Olympiad. Among the offers that came in from the country’s elite institutions, he decided on an experimental fast-track degree at Jiao Tong University in Shanghai. It would enable him to study maths, while also covering computer science, physics and psychology.In his first year at university, Li was extremely shy. He came up with a personal algorithm for making friends in the canteen, weighing data on group size and conversation topic to optimise the chances of a positive encounter. The method helped him to make friends, so he developed others: how to master English, how to interpret dreams, how to find a girlfriend. While other students spent the long nights studying, Li started to think about how he could apply his algorithmic approach to business. When he graduated at the turn of the millennium, he decided that he would make his fortune in the field he knew best: education.In person, Li, who is now 42, displays none of the awkwardness of his university days. A successful entrepreneur who helped create a billion-dollar tutoring company, Only Education, he is charismatic, and given to making bombastic statements. “Education is one of the industries that Chinese people can do much better than western people,” he told me when we met last year. The reason, he explained, is that “Chinese people are more sophisticated”, because they are raised in a society in which people rarely say what they mean.Li is the founder of Squirrel AI, an education company that offers tutoring delivered in part by humans, but mostly by smart machines, which he says will transform education as we know it. All over the world, entrepreneurs are making similarly extravagant claims about the power of online learning – and more and more money is flowing their way. In Silicon Valley, companies like Knewton and Alt School have attempted to personalise learning via tablet computers. In India, Byju’s, a learning app valued at $6 billion, has secured backing from Facebook and the Chinese internet behemoth Tencent, and now sponsors the country’s cricket team. In Europe, the British company Century Tech has signed a deal to roll out an intelligent teaching and learning platform in 700 Belgian schools, and dozens more across the UK. Their promises are being put to the test by the coronavirus pandemic – with 849 million children worldwide, as of March 2020, shut out of school, we’re in the midst of an unprecedented experiment in the effectiveness of online learning.But it’s in China, where President Xi Jinping has called for the nation to lead the world in AI innovation by 2030, that the fastest progress is being made. In 2018 alone, Li told me, 60 new AI companies entered China’s private education market. Squirrel AI is part of this new generation of education start-ups. The company has already enrolled 2 million student users, opened 2,600 learning centres in 700 cities across China, and raised $150m from investors. The company’s chief AI officer is Tom Mitchell, the former dean of computer science at Carnegie Mellon University, and its payroll also includes a roster of top Chinese talent, including dozens of “super-teachers” – an official designation given to the most expert teachers in the country. In January, during the worst of the outbreak, it partnered with the Shanghai education bureau to provide free products to students throughout the city.Though the most ambitious features have yet to be built into Squirrel AI’s system, the company already claims to have achieved impressive results. At its HQ in Shanghai, I saw footage of downcast human teachers who had been defeated by computers in televised contests to see who could teach a class of students more maths in a single week. Experiments on the effectiveness of different types of teaching videos with test audiences have revealed that students learn more proficiently from a video presented by a good-looking young presenter than from an older expert teacher.When we met, Li rhapsodised about a future in which technology will enable children to learn 10 or even 100 times more than they do today. Wild claims like these, typical of the hyperactive education technology sector, tend to prompt two different reactions. The first is: bullshit – teaching and learning is too complex, too human a craft to be taken over by robots. The second reaction is the one I had when I first met Li in London a year ago: oh no, the robot teachers are coming for education as we know it. There is some truth to both reactions, but the real story of AI education, it turns out, is a whole lot more complicated.At a Squirrel AI learning centre high in an office building in Hangzhou, a city 70 miles west of Shanghai, a cursor jerked tentatively over the words “Modern technology has opened our eyes to many things”. Slouched at a hexagonal table in one of the centre’s dozen or so small classrooms, Huang Zerong, 14, was halfway through a 90-minute English tutoring session. As he worked through activities on his MacBook, a young woman with the kindly manner of an older sister sat next to him, observing his progress. Below, the trees of Xixi National Wetland Park barely stirred in the afternoon heat.A question popped up on Huang’s screen, on which a virtual dashboard showed his current English level, unit score and learning focus – along with the sleek squirrel icon of Squirrel AI.“India is famous for ________ industry.”Huang read through the three possible answers, choosing to ignore “treasure” and “typical” and type “t-e-c-h-n-o-l-o-g-y” into the box.“T____ is changing fast,” came the next prompt.Huang looked towards the young woman, then he punched out “e-c-h-n-o-l-o-g-y” from memory. She clapped her hands together. “Good!” she said, as another prompt flashed up.Huang had begun his English course, which would last for one term, a few months earlier with a diagnostic test. He had logged into the Squirrel AI platform on his laptop and answered a series of questions designed to evaluate his mastery of more than 10,000 “knowledge points” (such as the distinction between “belong to” and “belong in”). Based on his answers, Squirrel AI’s software had generated a precise “learning map” for him, which would determine which texts he would read, which videos he would see, which tests he would take.As he worked his way through the course – with the occasional support of the human tutor by his side, or one of the hundreds accessible via video link from Squirrel AI’s headquarters in Shanghai – its contents were automatically updated, as the system perceived that Huang had mastered new knowledge.Huang said he was less distracted at the learning centre than he was in school, and felt at home with the technology. “It’s fun,” he told me after class, eyes fixed on his lap. “It’s much easier to concentrate on the system because it’s a device.” His scores in English also seemed to be improving, which is why his mother had just paid the centre a further 91,000 RMB (about £11,000) for another year of sessions: two semesters and two holiday courses in each of four subjects, adding up to around 400 hours in total.“Anyone can learn,” Li explained to me a few days later over dinner in Beijing. You just needed the right environment and the right method, he said.The idea for Squirrel AI had come to him five years earlier. A decade at his tutoring company, Only Education, had left him frustrated. He had found that if you really wanted to improve a student’s progress, by far the best way was to find them a good teacher. But good teachers were rare, and turnover was high, with the best much in demand. Having to find and train 8,000 new teachers each year was limiting the amount students learned – and the growth of his business.The answer, Li decided, was adaptive learning, where an intelligent computer-based system adjusts itself automatically to the best method for an inidual learner. The idea of adaptive learning was not new, but Li was confident that developments in AI research meant that huge advances were now within reach. Rather than seeking to recreate the general intelligence of a human mind, researchers were getting impressive results by putting AI to work on specialised tasks. AI doctors are now equal to or better than humans at analysing X-rays for certain pathologies, while AI lawyers are carrying out legal research that would once have been done by clerks.Following such breakthroughs, Li resolved to augment the efforts of his human teachers with a tireless, perfectly replicable virtual teacher. “Imagine a tutor who knows everything,” he told me, “and who knows everything about you.”In Hangzhou, Huang was struggling with the word “hurry”. On his screen, a video appeared of a neatly groomed young teacher presenting a three-minute masterclass about how to use the word “hurry” and related phrases (“in a hurry” etc). Huang watched along.Moments like these, where a short teaching input results in a small learning output, are known as “nuggets”. Li’s dream, which is the dream of adaptive education in general, is that AI will one day provide the perfect learning experience by ensuring that each of us get just the right chunk of content, delivered in the right way, at the right moment for our inidual needs.One way in which Squirrel AI improves its results is by constantly hoovering up data about its users. During Huang’s lesson, the system continuously tracked and recorded every one of his key strokes, cursor movements, right or wrong answers, texts read and videos watched. This data was time-stamped, to show where Huang had skipped over or lingered on a particular task. Each “nugget” (the video to watch or text to read) was then recommended to him based on an analysis of his data, accrued over hundreds of hours of work on Squirrel’s platform, and the data of 2 million other students. “Computer tutors can collect more teaching experience than a human would ever be able to collect, even in a hundred years of teaching,” Tom Mitchell, Squirrel AI’s chief AI officer, told me over the phone a few weeks later.The speed and accuracy of Squirrel AI’s platform will depend, above all, on the number of student users it manages to sign up. More students equals more data. As each student works their way through a set of knowledge points, they leave a rich trail of information behind them. This data is then used to train the algorithms of the “thinking” part of the Squirrel AI system.This is one reason why Squirrel AI has integrated its online business with bricks-and-mortar learning centres. Most children in China do not have access to laptops and high-speed internet. The learning centres mean the company can reach kids they otherwise would not be able to. One of the reasons Mitchell says he is glad to be working with Squirrel AI is the sheer volume of data that the company is gathering. “We’re going to have millions of natural examples,” he told me with excitement.The dream of a perfect education delivered by machine is not new. For at least a century, generations of visionaries have predicted that the latest inventions will transform learning. “Motion pictures,” wrote the American inventor Thomas Edison in 1922, “are destined to revolutionise our schools.” The immersive power of movies would supposedly turbo-charge the learning process. Others made similar predictions for radio, television, computers and the internet. But despite small successes – the Open University, TV universities in China in the 1980s, or Khan Academy today, which reaches millions of students with its YouTube lessons – teachers have continued to teach, and learners to learn, in much the same way as before.There are two reasons why today’s techno-evangelists are confident that AI can succeed where other technologies failed. First, they view AI not as a simple innovation but as a “general purpose technology” – that is, an epochal invention, like the printing press, which will fundamentally change the way we learn. Second, they believe its powers will shed new light on the working of the human brain – how repetitive practice grows expertise, for instance, or how interleaving (leaving gaps between learning different bits of material) can help us achieve mastery. As a result, we will be able to design adaptive algorithms to optimise the learning process.UCL Institute of Education professor and machine learning expert Rose Luckin believes that one day we might see an AI-enabled “Fitbit for the mind” that would allow us to perceive in real-time what an inidual knows, and how fast they are learning. The device would use sensors to gather data that forms a precise and ever-evolving map of a person’s abilities, which could be cross-referenced with insights into their motivational and nutritional state, say. This information would then be relayed to our minds, in real time, via a computer-brain interface. Facebook is already carrying out research in this field. Other firms are trialling eye tracking and helmets that monitor kids’ brainwaves.The supposed AI education revolution is not here yet, and it is likely that the majority of projects will collapse under the weight of their own hype. IBM’s adaptive tutor Knewton was pulled from US schools under pressure from parents concerned about their kids’ privacy, while Silicon Valley’s Alt School, launched to much fanfare in 2015 by a former Google executive, has burned through $174m of funding without landing on a workable business model. But global school closures owing to coronavirus may yet relax public attitudes to online learning – many online education companies are offering their products for free to all children out of school.Daisy Christodoulou, a London-based education expert, suggests that too much time is spent speculating on what AI might one day do, rather than focusing on what it already can. It’s estimated that there are 900 million young people around the world today who aren’t currently on track to learn what they need to thrive. To help those kids, AI education doesn’t have to be perfect – it just needs to slightly improve on what they currently have.In their book The Future of the Professions, Richard and Daniel Susskind argue that we tend to conceive of occupations as embodied in a person – a butcher or baker, doctor or teacher. As a result, we think of them as ‘too human’ to be taken over by machines. But to an algorithm, or someone designing one, a profession appears as something else: a long list of inidual tasks, many of which may be mechanised. In education, that might be marking or motivating, lecturing or lesson planning. The Susskinds believe that where a machine can do any one of these tasks better and more cheaply than the average human, automation of that bit of the job is inevitable.The point, in short, is that AI doesn’t have to match the general intelligence of humans to be useful – or indeed powerful. This is both the promise of AI, and the danger it poses. “People’s behaviour is already being manipulated,” Luckin cautioned. Devices that might one day enhance our minds are already proving useful in shaping them.In May 2018, a group of students at Hangzhou’s Middle School No 11 returned to their classroom to find three cameras newly installed above the blackboard they would now be under full-time surveillance in their lessons. “Previously when I had classes that I didn’t like very much, I would be lazy and maybe take naps,” a student told the local news, “but I don’t dare be distracted after the cameras were installed.” The head teacher explained that the system could read seven states of emotion on students’ faces: neutral, disgust, surprise, anger, fear, happiness and sadness. If the kids slacked, the teacher was alerted. “It’s like a pair of mystery eyes are constantly watching me,” the student told reporters.The previous year, China’s state council had launched a plan for the role AI could play in the future of the country. Underpinning it were a set of beliefs: that AI can “harmonise” Chinese society that for it to do so, the government should store data on every citizen that companies, not the state, were best positioned to innovate that no company should refuse access to the government to its data. In education, the paper called for new adaptive online learning systems powered by big data, and “all-encompassing ubiquitous intelligent environments” – or smart schools.At AIAED, a conference in Beijing hosted by Squirrel AI, which I attended in May 2019, classroom surveillance was one of the most discussed topics – but the speakers tended to be more concerned about the technical question of how to optimise the effectiveness of facial and bodily monitoring technologies in the classroom, rather than the darker implications of collecting unprecedented amounts of data about children. These ethical questions are becoming increasingly important, with schools from India to the US currently trialling facial monitoring. In the UK, AI is being used today for things like monitoring student wellbeing, automating assessment and even in inspecting schools. Ben Williamson of the Centre for Research in Digital Education explains that this risks encoding biases or errors into the system and raises obvious privacy issues. “Now the school and university might be said to be studying their students too,” he told me.While cameras in the classroom might outrage many parents in the UK or US, Lenora Chu, author of an influential book about the Chinese education system, argues that in China anything that improves a child’s learning tends to be viewed positively by parents. Squirrel AI even offers them the chance to watch footage of their child’s tutoring sessions. “There’s not that idea here that technology is bad,” said Chu, who moved from the US to Shanghai 10 years ago.Rose Luckin suggested to me that a platform like Squirrel AI’s could one day mean an end to China’s notoriously punishing gaokao college entrance exam, which takes place for two days every June and largely determines a student’s education and employment prospects. If technology tracked a student throughout their school days, logging every keystroke, knowledge point and facial twitch, then the perfect record of their abilities on file could make such testing obsolete. Yet a system like this could also furnish the Chinese state – or a US tech company – with an eternal ledger of every step in a child’s development. It is not hard to imagine the grim uses to which this information could be put – for instance, if your behaviour in school was used to judge, or predict, your trustworthiness as an adult.On the one hand, said Chu, the CCP wants to use AI to better prepare young people for the future economy, and to close the achievement gap between rural and urban schools. To this end, companies like Squirrel AI receive government support, such as access to prime office space in top business districts. At the same time, the CCP, as the state council put it, sees AI as “opportunity of the millennium” for “social construction”. That is, social control. The ability of AI to “grasp group cognition and psychological changes in a timely manner” through the surveillance of people’s movements, spending and other behaviours means it can play “an irreplaceable role in effectively maintaining social stability”.The surveillance state is already penetrating deep into people’s lives. In 2019, there was a significant spike in China in the registration of patents for facial recognition and surveillance technology. All new mobile phones in China must now be registered via a facial scan. At the hotels I stayed in, Chinese citizens handed over their ID cards and checked in using face scanners. On the high-speed train to Beijing, the announcer repeatedly warned travellers to abide by the rules in order to maintain their personal credit. The notorious social credit system, which has been under trial in a handful of Chinese cities ahead of an expected nationwide roll out this year, awards or detracts points from an inidual’s trustworthiness score, which affects their ability to travel and borrow money, among other things.The result, explained Chu, is that all these interventions exert a subtle control over what people think and say. “You sense how the wind is blowing,” she told me. For the 12 million Muslim Uighurs in Xinjiang, however, that control is anything but subtle. Police checkpoints, complete with facial scanners, are ubiquitous. All mobile phones must have Jingwang (“clean net”) app installed, allowing the government to monitor your movements and browsing. Iris and fingerprint scans are required to access health services. As many as 1.5 million Uighurs, including children, have been interned at some point in a re-education camp in the interests of “harmony”.As we shape the use of AI in education, it’s likely that AI will shape us too. Jiang Xueqin, an education researcher from Chengdu, is sceptical that it will be as revolutionary as proponents claim. “Parents are paying for a drug,” he told me over the phone. He thought tutoring companies such as New Oriental, TAL and Squirrel AI were simply preying on parents’ anxieties about their kids’ performance in exams, and only succeeding because test preparation was the easiest element of education to automate – a closed system with limited variables that allowed for optimisation. Jiang wasn’t impressed with the progress made, or the way that it engaged every child in a desperate race to conform to the measures of success imposed by the system.One student I met at the learning centre in Hangzhou, Zhang Hen, seemed to have a deep desire to learn about the world – she told me how she loved Qu Yuan, a Tang dynasty romantic poet, and how she was a fan of Harry Potter – but that wasn’t the reason she was here. Her goal was much simpler: she had come to the centre to boost her test scores. That may seem disappointing to idealists who want education to offer so much more, but Zhang was realistic about the demands of the Chinese education system. She had tough exams that she needed to pass. A scripted system that helped her efficiently master the content of the high school entrance exam was exactly what she wanted.On stage at AIAED, Tom Mitchell had presented a more ambitious vision for adaptive learning that went far beyond helping students cram for mindless tests. Much of what he was most excited by was possible only in theory, but his enthusiasm was palpable. As appealing as his optimism was, though, I felt unconvinced. It was clear that adaptive technologies might improve certain types of learning, but it was equally obvious that they might narrow the aims of education and provide new tools to restrict our freedom.Li insists that one day his system will help all young people to flourish creatively. Though he allows that for now an expert human teacher still holds an edge over a robot, he is confident that AI will soon be good enough to evaluate and reply to students’ oral responses. In less than five years, Li imagines training Squirrel AI’s platform with a list of every conceivable question and every possible response, weighting an algorithm to favour those labelled “creative”. “That thing is very easy to do,” he said, “like tagging cats.”For Li, learning has always been like that – like tagging cats. But there’s a growing consensus that our brains don’t work like computers. Whereas a machine must crunch through millions of images to be able to identify a cat as the collection of “features” that are present only in those images labelled “cat” (two triangular ears, four legs, two eyes, fur, etc), a human child can grasp the concept of “cat” from just a few real life examples, thanks to our innate ability to understand things symbolically. Where machines can’t compute meaning, our minds thrive on it. The adaptive advantage of our brains is that they learn continually through all of our senses by interacting with the environment, our culture and, above all, other people.Li told me that even if AI fulfilled all of its promise, human teachers would still play a crucial role helping kids learn social skills. At Squirrel AI’s HQ, which occupies three floors of a gleaming tower next door to Microsoft and Mobike in Shanghai, I met some of the company’s young teachers. Each sat at a work console in a vast office space, headphones on, eyes focused on a laptop screen, their desks decorated with plastic pot plants and waving cats. As they monitored the dashboards of up to six students simultaneously, the face of a young learner would appear on the screen, asking for help, either via a chat box or through a video link. The teachers reminded me of workers in the gig economy, the Uber drivers of education. When I logged on to try out a Squirrel English lesson for myself, the experience was good, but my tutor seemed to be teaching to a script.Squirrel AI’s head of communications, Joleen Liang, showed me photos from a recent trip she had taken to the remote mountains of Henan, to deliver laptops to disadvantaged students. Without access to the adaptive technology, their education would be a little worse. It was a reminder that Squirrel AI’s platform, like those of its competitors worldwide, doesn’t have to be better than the best human teachers – to improve people’s lives, it just needs to be good enough, at the right price, to supplement what we’ve got. The problem is that it is hard to see technology companies stopping there. For better and worse, their ambitions are bigger. “We could make a lot of geniuses,” Li told me.• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7bd9767d665353f69914aa1589b610c426e656d9/423_425_4260_2556/master/4260.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f8d0a84ecc1b477bde6ad7261dad9ecb","title":"samsung galaxy s20 ultra review the superphone thats a little too massive","story":"New flagship smartphone is supersized in all dimensions with a giant 6.9in screen, massive zoom camera and ginormous priceSamsung’s new Galaxy S20 Ultra superphone is packed to the brim with chart-topping features, including 100x zooming, 108MP cameras, a ginormous screen and 5G.The £1,199 S20 Ultra leads an important new lineup of 5G-as-standard smartphones from Samsung, which looks to make the technology a normal part of mobile life rather than an expensive add-on for early adopters.But in 2020 5G alone isn’t enough to stand out, so the S20 Ultra has a smorgasbord of stats and features that, on paper at least, make it unbeatable.First is the sheer size of the thing. It has a 6.9in QHD+ display, which is practically the size of a tablet. It is 222g in weight and 76mm wide, which is right at the limit of what I can handle. The 166.9mm length makes it difficult to pocket without injuring yourself or the phone when you sit down.The glass is slippery when cold or put on the sofa, but the phone is so big I can’t see many using it without some sort of case or a handle.The screen’s 120Hz refresh rate is twice the standard 60Hz, and faster still than last year’s OnePlus 7 Pro and Pixel 4. Animations and scrolling through lists, sites and other content is so much smoother at 120Hz that it’s difficult to go back to 60Hz, even if that limits the resolution to FHD+.Flip the phone over and you’ll find the super-sized lump containing four cameras and a flash in the top left corner. It’s big, sticks out miles and you can feel it with your fingers when you use the phone.The S20 Ultra is the first smartphone to ship in Europe with Samsung’s latest Exynos 990 processor. In the US it has Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 865 instead. Both variants come with 12 or 16GB of RAM, which is more than most laptops.Performance all round was brilliant. Snappy, responsive and smooth, even with graphically intensive games. Like everything else, the battery is supersized in the S20 Ultra, with a capacity of 5,000mAh, which is about 1,000mAh bigger than the one in the iPhone 11 Pro Max or OnePlus 7T Pro, and bigger than the 4,500mAh battery in the S10 5G.Battery life ranges from an excellent 42 hours on 4G with the screen set to FHD+ at 60Hz, to 40 hours with that upped to 120Hz, and a solid 38 hours on Vodafone’s 5G with 120Hz active. The S20 Ultra will get through even the heaviest of days without needing a charge.Fully charging the S20 Ultra took 70 minutes with the included power adapter, but closer to two hours with other 30-45W USB-C chargers. Fast 15W wireless charging and 7W wireless power-sharing is also available – great for charging your Galaxy Buds+ or other Qi-compatible phones from the back of the S20 Ultra.Samsung does not rate the battery in the S20 Ultra for a set number of charge cycles (which is typically 500) but does provide a one-year warranty. Despite being rated as difficult to repair, Samsung says the device is generally repairable and that the battery is replaceable, by authorised service centres at costs likely to be in excess of £200.The Galaxy S20 Ultra runs the same version of Samsung-customised Android 10, called One UI 2, as the Galaxy Z Flip.One UI has become one of the best implementations of Android, particularly for big-screen smartphones, because it treats the top of the screen as an information display section and the bottom – the bit you can actually reach with your thumb – as a place for all interactions.You have to use Samsung’s apps to really take advantage of it, but broadly it works very well. You can also do split-screen multitasking, have apps float over other apps (not just video), duplicate messaging apps such as WhatsApp so you can have two accounts on one phone, quickly manage two sims from the notification shade, and a plethora of other features.One UI 2 defaults to the traditional three-button Android navigation bar, but Android 10’s new gesture navigation system makes using the super-sized screen easier.Samsung guarantees only two major Android versions from release. It provides monthly security updates for its devices but does not commit to a particularly length of support, instead listing the current support status of handsets on its security site. Other models such as the Galaxy S7 Edge from 2016 are currently receiving only quarterly security updates.Apple supports its iPhones for approximately five years, including security and full iOS version updates. Google offers about three years of security and version updates for its Pixel line, while OnePlus offers two years of software plus another year of security updates.Samsung has recently made great strides, but you will still likely have to wait in the region of three months for major version Android updates to appear after Google releases them. £1,199 is also a lot of money to pay for a phone that is only guaranteed updates for two years.The massive lump on the back of the phone contains Samsung’s new quad-camera system: a large 108MP wide angle, 12MP ultra-wide angle, 48MP telephoto with periscopic 4x optical zoom and a depth sensor. There’s a 40MP front-facing camera poking through a small hole in the screen too.Samsung’s camera system has taken a big leap forward over the last year, after lagging behind competitors from Apple, Google and Huawei. The quartet of cameras allows you to smoothly zoom from ultrawide angle (0.5x), through the wide angle (1x) and out to 4x optical zoom, then on to 10x hybrid zoom. From there you’re into what Samsung calls “Space Zoom”, which is essentially a digital zoom on top, taking you all the way to 100x magnification.The 12MP ultrawide camera produces some really good shots in most lighting conditions, excellent for creating a fisheye effect close up or for capturing more of a cityscape in one shot.The main 108MP camera shoots 12MP photos by default, combining nine pixels on the sensor into one pixel of final image, in a process known as pixel binning. The resulting photos are great, striking an excellent balance of detail and low noise, although occasionally a little over-sharpened on full crop, even in the kind of middling light of British homes where previous Samsung cameras struggled. Samsung’s dedicated night mode is good but not quite on the same level as Night Sight on the Pixel 4, taking considerably longer to take the same shots.The live focus portrait mode is improved too, but given that the wide-angle camera takes images with plenty of natural bokeh, I found I didn’t need to use the artificial mode. The camera app has the usual array of beautifying and smoothing features, if that’s your jam.The camera can also shoot full 108MP shots, but I found that most of the time the 12MP mode produced better images. It’s nice to have the creative option, though, as you can crop right into a 108MP image for a closeup without using a zoom.The zoom is the star of the show though, rivalling the previous zoom king, the Huawei P30 Pro, which uses a similar periscope lens system for a 5x optical zoom. Shots at 4x optical zoom are best, but push it to 10x and, while not quite lossless, the images are very good indeed, blowing everything but the P30 Pro out of the water.Zooming to 30x, images are still very good, while Samsung’s 50x zoom beats Huawei’s equivalent from a year ago. The 100x headline figure isn’t really worth using except as a surrogate pair of binoculars, as images are full of artefacts. It’s also worth noting it is very difficult to hold steady at 100x, despite Samsung’s excellent picture-in-picture aiming box that pops up to help hit the target over 20x magnification.The S20 Ultra also captures very good video, arguably the best on Android. It will shoot up to 8K video, consuming upwards of 10MB a second in the process, but stabilisation and effects are limited to 1080p.The 40MP selfie camera shoots 10MP images by default, again using pixel binning, and produces some of the very best, most detailed shots I’ve seen on any selfie camera.The S20 Ultra has the same ultrasonic fingerprint scanner embedded underneath the screen as the S10 and Note 10 series of smartphones, but it performed slightly better in my testing.Land your clean, dry finger on the correct spot on the screen and the phone unlocks pretty fast. It also worked better once I removed the included screen protector and re-registered my fingerprints. But it’s neither as fast nor as forgiving as the best in-display fingerprint sensors used by OnePlus in the 7T Pro, nor Face ID on the iPhone 11 or Face Unlock on the Pixel 4.The Galaxy S20 Ultra is Samsung’s superphone to conquer all superphones. Everything pushed to excess.That excess is great when it means a massive battery, future-proofed 5G and a camera that’s leagues ahead of where Samsung was a year ago. The combination of great main, ultra-wide and 4x optical cameras, with a 10x hybrid zoom, is so flexible and fun to use. Even at zooms of 30x you get pretty good pictures, and 100x zoom can substitute for binoculars in a pinch.But all that excess also makes the phone far too big: I can barely fit it in my pocket and I wouldn’t be comfortable using it as my own phone without some sort of ring or Popsocket on the back.It’s also incredibly expensive: £1,200 is a lot of money for a phone, particularly one only guaranteed to receive two years of updates from release, but then you can easily spend that on an iPhone. And despite all the features and finesse, the massive black slab looks positively boring next to the Galaxy Z Flip.There’s no doubt that the Galaxy S20 Ultra is one of Samsung’s best phones to date. I just wish all that camera was squeezed into something considerably smaller and cheaper.Pros: 120Hz screen, 5G, great and flexible camera, long battery life, microSD card slot, dual sim, One UI, wireless charging and powershare, fast performanceCons: absolutely massive, very expensive, no headphone socket, ultrasonic fingerprint sensor not as good as competitors This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

But I am. Wholeheartedly and without reservation. It’s a glorious, shining jewel in the middle of what I think we can safely call the greatest global shitstorm since the second world war (Brexit almost begins to look like village pensioners riven with dissent over the prize for best onions at the summer show.).Canadian standup Mae Martin’s six-part semi-autobiographical series for Channel 4 (she writes and stars) centres around the relationship between Mae the character and her new girlfriend, George (Charlotte Ritchie). It captures the early days of a romance beautifully, when lust obscures detail and difference, and everything is precisely as thrilling as it is anxiety-making. “She’s like a dangerous Mary Poppins,” Mae says admiringly of her quintessentially English beloved. “And I’m Bart Simpson.”The idiotic banter between fledgling partners is refined, via Martin’s immaculate writing and delivery so clean and fleet that you can actually feel it doing you good, to a hilarious point. “I didn’t know you have a mug with ‘I Heart Guernsey’ on it,” says Mae during the couple’s first trip to Ikea. “Is it true? DO you heart Guernsey? What even is a Guernsey? It’s making me question everything.”By the end of the first episode, Feel Good has shifted focus slightly, to concentrate on what happens when reality begins to reassert itself. Their particular reality includes George not having dated a woman before and being reluctant to come out or introduce Mae to her friends and family, and Mae being a recovering addict who retains all the impulses that lead her into dangerous situations, encourage bad choices and strain relationships. “I knew she was an addict,” says George’s depressed flatmate, Phil. “Her legs were always moving and her eyes are spooky.” Martin looks like an angel adulterated with duckling, but Phil is right in a larger sense – the restless energy beneath means you daren’t take your eyes off her for a second.Feel Good moves so quickly and lightly that it seems impossible it could also be managing to construct characters and burrow into psyches as deeply and empathically as it does. While also, I must emphasise, remaining as funny as any comedy dedicated to that end. Lisa Kudrow as Mae’s appalling mother is emblematic of all Feel Good’s strengths, periodically popping up on Skype (“Don’t look at me! I’m 3,000 years old!”) to deliver – inadvertently, if you’re generously inclined – the latest quota of maternal blows to her child’s psyche. She blames Mae’s addiction issues on the fact that she was four weeks premature. “You were in an incubator. It’s why we’re not close.” “We’re not close?” replies Mae, duckling suddenly to the fore, innocence bruised, and viewers cackling.As the series goes on, it takes in not just the peaks and troughs of romantic relationships, as George and Mae unpack their considerable baggage, but also the impact of toxic family influence (George’s mother, embittered by but still in emotional thrall to her ex-husband, casts her own pall and is played with the magnificence you would expect by Pippa Haywood) and probes the nature of various forms of friendship. Mae is a passionate attachment seeker, whose pulsing need rather than rational decision-making habitually leads her into disaster. Her chosen sponsor, Maggie (Sophie Thompson, in a part that makes glorious use of her effortless eccentricity), is fun but not nearly aware enough of her own issues to be of help to anyone, let alone another, younger addict. Maggie’s backstory, as it emerges, adds another perspective on the mother-daughter relationship and poses more questions about how we love, negotiate with and protect ourselves from each otherGeorge, by contrast, has a vast array of friends. Or at least, as she comes gradually to realise, a lot of people with whom she spends a lot of time. Whether they mean anything to her, or she to them, is another point of scrutiny for the show. What is any friend worth if you don’t feel you can introduce your loved one to them?Feel Good should make you feel good. It’s not only an immaculately written and paced piece of work and a properly funny comedy, it is also has created a delicately and intricately constructed, deeply humane world where people make mistakes but are not damned, and have flaws that are not fatal, and – despite all the obstacles – connect across and despite their ides. It is good for almost everything that ails us."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5e9aaa288e39ff81e53163cb17a34b449422cda2/0_127_3842_2307/master/3842.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3f837f2958c3ef2850b2cf31ba84e426","title":"bernie sanders campaign joe biden democrats","story":"The Vermont senator’s presidential campaign has seen little but bad news recently as it admits ‘losing the battle over electability’ The Vermont senator Bernie Sanders got thumped in the latest round of Democratic presidential primary contests and, once again, Sanders and his team are reassessing their path forward.It’s becoming a familiar cycle: former vice-president Joe Biden beats Sanders, the darling of progressive grassroots voters the Sanders campaign concedes the situation isn’t ideal, and spends some time reassessing. That’s what happened earlier this month after the Super Tuesday contests on 3 March, and this Tuesday night and Wednesday morning.On Wednesday Sanders, the campaign said, would first vote on coronavirus legislation in the Senate and then later in the day he would fly with his wife Jane back to Vermont where he would have conversations with supporters.“The next primary contest is at least three weeks away. Senator Sanders is going to be having conversations with supporters to assess his campaign,” Sanders’ campaign manager, Faiz Shakir, said in a statement. “In the immediate term, however, he is focused on the government response to the coronavirus outbreak and ensuring that we take care of working people and the most vulnerable.”The Sanders campaign also sent out an email to supporters with a similarly gloomy tone.“No sugarcoating it, last night did not go the way we wanted,” Shakir wrote in that email. “And while our campaign has won the battle of ideas, we are losing the battle over electability to Joe Biden.”The email did not include a usual link to make a donation to the campaign. Instead it linked to Sanders’ response on how the federal government should be responding to the coronavirus pandemic, a signal that the campaign is at least slightly inching away from a relentless campaign mode.There were three contests on Tuesday night and Biden beat Sanders in all of them. More ominous for Sanders, Biden beat him by double digits in all three states. Biden won decisively by about 14 points in Illinois.In 2016, Sanders narrowly lost to former secretary of state Hillary Clinton there by less than three percentage points. In Florida, Biden beat Sanders by almost 40 percentage points. In Arizona, Sanders lost to Biden by about the same margin he lost to Clinton in 2016.The prospect of Sanders dropping out is so strong that for a few moments on Wednesday a report about Sanders suspending campaign ads on Facebook was misread as Sanders suspending his campaign.The next set of contests are in states that were more favorable to Sanders in 2016 –Hawaii and Alaska, in particular. But the larger problem for the Vermont senator is the delegate math. As of Wednesday Biden led Sanders by 1,153 pledged delegates to 874. Even before Tuesday, Sanders would have to have won the lion’s share of delegates in coming contests.The Biden campaign has been hesitant to declare victory outright but has argued publicly and behind the scenes that Biden’s delegate advantage is unassailable.In a conference call with donors ahead of the Tuesday’s primary results, Greg Schultz, a top adviser for the campaign, said the Biden team felt they had a “very clear delegate trajectory that would require Sanders to so overwhelmingly out-perform” in the next few primary contests, according to audio obtained by the .On Wednesday morning, Unite the Country, a Super Pac supporting Biden, released a memo going even further.“Last night’s overwhelming victories in Arizona, Illinois and Florida are likely to add at least 150 delegates to Joe Biden’s already commanding delegate lead. Even without Ohio voting, Joe Biden effectively ended the race last night,” the memo said.“He will be the Democratic nominee, and for Unite the Country, the focus now turns to November. The turnout generated by the vice-president continues to surprise everyone. Despite the virus, total turnout in Arizona and Florida exceeded 2016 numbers, and just like in previous states this primary season, there was particularly robust turnout in the types of suburban communities where we need to show strength this fall.”More concerning for Sanders and his progressive movement within the primary contest are the limitations the coronavirus outbreak is putting on the campaign. Because of the pandemic, Sanders’ campaign cannot hold the energetic rallies that are a pillar of the campaign, Democratic strategist Julian Mulvey, who advised Sanders in 2016, said.“Part of the difficult challenge now is they can’t hold rallies. The rallies have always been, in one sense, the central part of the campaign,” Mulvey said. “It’s direct connection with Bernie and the grassroots and people. It’s him getting on the ground, delivering his 90-minute stump speech – delivering his giant stump speech. I think it’s very important for the energy on the ground, it’s very important for Bernie.”But Sanders allies and strategists from the progressive wing of the party still see value in the Vermont senator continuing the campaign.“In this moment of national crisis, Bernie’s platform is more salient than ever: Republicans and centrist Democrats alike are suddenly echoing his calls for free healthcare, expanded paid sick leave, and unemployment insurance,” progressive Democratic strategist Monica Klein said in an email to the  on Wednesday.She added: “We’ve seen from exit polls that Bernie’s economic and healthcare platforms are widely supported by Democratic voters – so whoever we end up with as our nominee, the Democratic ticket needs to embrace the bold economic solutions that Bernie has championed since day one.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb4f60beaf02c889cc43c587626dacdf961d7639/505_975_6561_3937/master/6561.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=251433f3cb61be81b5ae741679f73530","title":"have you recovered from the coronavirus","story":"If you have been tested positive for the virus and have since recovered, we would like to hear about your experience We’d like to hear from people who have tested positive for coronavirus but have since recovered.

Here is what we know now.Yes. They can be infected with and appear to be able to transmit coronavirus, even if they do not have symptoms. That is why it is important for children to practice social distancing and hand-washing, even if they do not appear ill.It is generally believed to cause milder symptoms in children, but the specific impacts by age are becoming clearer as the outbreak goes on.That remains unknown. Dr Jay C Butler, deputy director of infectious disease at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said, “The phenomenon is very significant,” on a live-streamed show hosted by the Journal of the American Medical Association, but that the mechanisms are “really unknown”.People aged 60 and older or with existing health conditions remain the most vulnerable to the coronavirus. That includes people with conditions such as high blood pressure, diabetes, cancer, cardiovascular disease and chronic respiratory conditions, according to the WHO.Respiratory conditions such as asthma often result in more severe cases of viral diseases such as influenza. But the coronavirus is new, and it remains unknown whether it will more severely affect children with asthma.Similarly, there is not yet evidence about whether coronavirus could more negatively affect children with diabetes, which is a risk factor for adults. That said, experts at Johns Hopkins University are warning parents to be vigilant.On Monday, the White House recommended parents homeschool their children in an effort to expand social distancing. Here is more information on how to practice social distancing.Of course, social distancing has caused its own kind of upheaval. Many parents are scrambling after schools closed. Efforts are being made to ease the burden on parents with bored children at home. That includes some celebrities, such as actors Amy Adams and Jennifer Garner, who are reading children’s books online."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1df32ad822097442fbb99addd156e0786c236be7/0_324_4928_2956/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3f5f6d931788c39ec1af967d42afbacd","title":"coronavirus testing us q and a availability shortage","story":"Capacity has slowly begun to increase, but frustration is widespread as there appear to be no guaranteesTesting for Covid-19 in the US has seen a lot of setbacks in the past few weeks thanks to a seemingly endless list of problems – and few solutions from the White House. As the virus has no cure or vaccine, the lag in testing has led to health departments suggesting that anyone who is experiencing symptoms should self-isolate rather than seek testing, unless they meet specific requirements. But as the virus spreads rapidly, the need for quick and accurate testing has become clearer each day.Here is what we know about testing in the US so far.A precise number of people who have been tested in the US has not been made available. Every day, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) publicly reports the number of specimens collected by CDC labs and public health labs, using numbers from state health departments – some of which only report positive cases.The most accurate publicly available data on testing in the US is being provided by a volunteer-run data collaboration project called the Covid Tracking Project. The project collects data directly from all US states and territories and breaks down the number of tests by positive, negative and pending cases.As of Wednesday morning, the project said 56,590 people had been tested, with about 2,000 cases pending.For the last few weeks, public health experts have been raising serious concerns about the availability of testing. In a four-day period from 8 March to the morning of 11 March, only 77 people in the country were tested.Within the last few days, however, the US testing capacity has slowly started to increase. Earlier this month, the CDC said labs were conducting about 2,500 tests per day. On 16 March, the number rose to 8,200. To put things into perspective, South Korea – which has been hailed for its rapid testing of its population that is about one-sixth of the US’s – tests about 20,000 people a day.The uptick can be attributed to the ability of more labs to process tests and the rollout of equipment that makes processing quicker. Though the US is starting to see more tests being processed, Deborah Birx, a top official in the US team responding to coronavirus, warned hospitals and labs on Sunday that there would be a “pent-up demand” for testing and advised that they stock up on their equipment.With this demand, it will probably be a while until testing is available for all those who are showing symptoms.Decisions about who is getting tested are being made at the county and state level.Broadly, CDC guidelines to healthcare professionals say that those tested must be showing symptoms, and priority is given to those who are in hospital, are at risk for the virus’s most deadly effects (elderly people and those with chronic medical conditions or weakened immune systems) or had known contact with a person who tested positive as priorities for testing. The CDC also says those who have a history of travel from “affected geographic areas” – China, Iran, South Korea and parts of Europe – should be prioritized.But there appears to be no guarantee of a test. Over the past few weeks, there has been a flood of stories of people who are symptomatic and should be prioritized by testing, but were not: for example, the elderly husband of a coronavirus patient who died from the illness, healthcare workers who may have been exposed to the virus and countless numbers of symptomatic travelers to countries with known outbreaks. Those who have been tested have often described frustrating experiences of being sent from one place to another seeking a test.Fueling the frustration are stories of high-profile figures who have managed to get tested. The NBA got 58 tests within six hours for players of the Utah Jazz, though it is unclear how many players were actually showing symptoms. A fashion influencer who had body aches and a fever was tested with the help of a friend, after other doctors she spoke with told her she did not qualify for testing in New York state.The CDC says public health labs in all US states and most territories are currently processing tests.People who have been able to get a test have mostly been tested in hospitals and urgent care centers, but many places are now moving to mobile testing sites with the goal of making sure symptomatic people do not further spread the illness. Dozens of drive-through testing sites have begun popping up across the country, though many require an appointment to be tested.The mobile sites are meant to be places where people can get samples taken – essentially a swab up the nose – and then their samples are taken to a lab for processing.Broad recommendations from the CDC and local health department recommend calling a primary healthcare provider or the local health department if experiencing symptoms associated with the virus, such as fever and coughing. Those who experience severe symptoms such as chest pain and shortness of breath are advised to seek medical attention immediately."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6dee53ed3a9f5ab0dac3511d8dd5300f66faf65/0_0_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6545e252bfa8f09bf05d37da87ef68ec","title":"coronavirus uk cases how many are in your area","story":"Latest figures from public health authorities on the spread of Covid-19 in the United Kingdom.

But Boris Johnson said the government had been forced to change tack because the rate of Covid-19 infections was increasing faster than anticipated. He said the public health benefits of keeping schools open had shifted and the scientific advice was that schools should close to slow the spread of the virus. But by the time the announcement was made, many schools had already been forced to close because of staff shortages due to illness or self-isolation measures.What does it mean for parents?When schools close on Friday, many parents will have little choice but to take time off work to look after their children at home. The measures apply to state and private schools alike, nurseries and sixth-form colleges. The advice is to not ask grandparents to help with childcare, because of their vulnerability to the virus. Schools have been drawing up homework packs and online resources to help parents home educate. Without being able to provide immediate details, the government said it plans to provide a skeletal school service for parents who are key workers on the frontline of the national effort to stem the pandemic – including doctors, nurses, and food delivery workers – so they can stay at work. Vulnerable children, those who have a social worker, and pupils entitled to special needs support will also be able to stay in school. Where possible special schools and residential schools will continue to look after children and young people.Is it safe to send my child to school if I am a key worker?The government has emphasised throughout that children do not appear to be severely affected by the virus, and with only small numbers of pupils and staff attending school in the coming weeks and months the risk of transmission will be much reduced. The government’s chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, has stressed that schools are not dangerous for children and the decision to close now is to “knock down” transmission and delay the progress of the virus.What if only one parent is a key worker?If one parent is a key worker, the government will expect the other parent to have their child at home. Single parents who are key workers will obviously be entitled to a school place.What about the summer exams?GCSEs and A-levels have been cancelled and it’s not clear exactly what will replace them. In England, almost all qualifications are now assessed by end of course exams so there is no continuous assessment to rely on. However, teachers ordinarily provide predicted A-level grades for students applying to university, and GCSE students have already sat mock exams which will have given their teachers some idea of their pupils’ likely results. The education secretary was at pains to reassure pupils and their families that every child would get “the proper recognition” they deserve. “We’re working very closely with Ofqual to have a detailed set of measures that make sure no child is unfairly penalised,” he said.Is there any special provision for children eligible for free school meals?Emergency plans are being drawn up to try to ensure that vulnerable children who are entitled to free school meals do not go hungry when schools close. The government is planning a voucher scheme to make up for free school meals.Where possible schools will be encouraged to keep their kitchens open to cook hot meals and act as a food distribution hub for children in need, while elsewhere headteachers are making supermarket vouchers available to try to ease the burden on the most vulnerable families. More than a million children in England who come from the most disadvantaged families currently benefit from a free school lunch. For many it may be the only hot meal of the day they enjoy and experts say it is vital that children continue to benefit, despite the closures which could last for a long time.How long are schools likely be closed?At this stage no-one is able to say exactly how long schools will stay closed, though it seems clear it’s more likely to be a matter of months rather than weeks, depending on how the pandemic progresses. The education secretary, Gavin Williamson, told MPs he would be “guided by scientific and medical advice” on reopening. In practice they could remain closed until the start of the next school year in September.What will children be able to do while they are off school?The government is keen to encourage as much educational activity at home as is feasible, but parents are going to have be creative – and very patient. As well as homework materials provided by inidual schools, the government is working with the BBC to develop resources to keep children occupied and stimulated and many e-learning platforms are offering their resources free of charge.With cinemas, museums, theatres and libraries closed, all normal entertainment is ruled out. Like everyone else, children will be subject to the same social-distancing rules which mean travel and outings are curtailed and most activities will have to be home-based. One of the challenges will be to keep children physically active with group sporting activities and space confined."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/05fd2ab939e86ec301215650a33ca6b5ac050ded/0_55_1944_1167/master/1944.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b98c4931a9dfd8d0fa0dc1976bbc02f3","title":"covid 19s deserted landscapes then and now","story":"As countries close borders and bring in curfews, photographs reveal the impact of coronavirusBeirut’s Corniche promenade in Lebanon.

Here are some key questions:The government is offering mortgage payment holidays that will benefit homeowners, but tenants, most of whom have no savings, also need urgent help if they lose their job. Likely short-term solutions could be much faster access to improved housing benefits, now wrapped into universal credit. It can take five weeks before benefits are paid out. They are also disqualified from housing benefits if they have savings over £16,000.Current benefit levels may have to be temporarily increased so that tenants are able to pay their rent in full. A single unemployed person over 25 is currently eligible for £323 a month or about £73 a week basic benefit. They also receive help with their rent although in most cases they won’t get the full amount that they pay their landlord, says the advice group Turn2Us. This is because the amount of rent payable to claimants is set locally, and varies according to the local housing allowance.The campaign group Generation Rent is calling for a temporary halt to all section 21 “no fault” evictions and section 8 evictions for rent arrears. It wants the five-week wait for housing benefit removed, and for rents to be frozen for a year.Council tax will be another issue. The government may be looking at ways local authorities can delay demands for payment, or suspend it for a short-term period.Housing associations have already promised not to evict any tenant because of coronavirus, and are calling on the government to urgently strengthen the welfare system so tenants can get help quickly.Kate Henderson, the chief executive of the National Housing Federation, said: “No one should be evicted because of the coronavirus. We are confident that no housing association will do this, and want anyone affected by the outbreak to be reassured they will not be evicted.“We urge the government to further strengthen the welfare system to ensure that everyone who needs it can quickly get help if their income drops,” she added.There are 2.6 million buy-to-let landlords in the UK, but their mortgages are not part of the “payment holiday” measures introduced by the banks. If there is widespread non-payment of rent by tenants losing their jobs, landlords are likely to default on their loans and possibly be repossessed, and the tenants evicted.The Residential Landlords Association wants landlords to be given the same access to payment holidays as conventional mortgage holders.Some but by no means all landlords will have bought insurance which includes rental guarantees. Direct Line, for example, has a deal that promises to “provide cover for any unpaid rent if you have to repossess your property. If your tenants can’t pay, we will.” Quite how that will work in this crisis is unclear – especially as the landlord can only claim on the policy if they have issued a section 21 eviction notice.Employers must pay statutory sick pay worth £94.25 a week to employees, including agency workers. Workers need to earn £118 a week to qualify. The prime minister has shortened the period for the payment of statutory sick pay from day four of illness to day one, as a result of the coronavirus outbreak.According to research from Close Brothers Asset Management, supporting just half of Britain’s wage bill would cost the government about £40bn a month. “This is the sort of protection that might be required to ensure that when we come out the other side, consumer demand returns to pre-crisis levels and the economy isn’t damaged beyond repair,” said Robert Alster, the head of investment management at the firm.The CIPD says there is a strong case for eligibility for statutory sick pay to be temporarily expanded to help the self-employed.Out-of-work benefits are worth less than sick pay, while cuts imposed in the past decade of austerity have reduced the level of support. The government made changes at the budget to expand eligibility for universal credit, while employment and support allowance – the benefit for those with health conditions – will be made available from day one rather than eight.However, there are demands for the government to go further and to provide grants instead of loans to new universal credit claimants, who need to wait five weeks until their first payment comes through.In the US, the Trump administration is looking at sending cheques worth at least $1,000 (£915) directly to American citizens, in a form of “helicopter money” to boost the economy.Britain may lack a mechanism to easily make such payments. Andy King, a member of the Office for Budget Responsibility, told MPs at a hearing of the Treasury committee on Monday that the government considered such a policy during the 2008 financial crisis, but lacked the mechanism to make the payments. The government paying people’s utility bills or council tax could be easier.Paul Donovan, the chief economist of the Swiss bank UBS, said the support might not be the best use of taxpayers’ money. “A $1,000 cheque buys lots of toilet rolls. In a lockdown, it does not save jobs at a bar or cinema. Cash for consumers focuses on phase two – supporting the bounceback.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/331d5191851cb7dbef8c07e496d88f39b49431db/0_51_2510_1506/master/2510.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bf6cf15d67e1926c373dc04e196ed90e","title":"private firms criticised over 295 coronavirus testing kits","story":"Health businesses under fire for profiting while NHS workers cannot get access to testsPrivate health firms have come under fire for profiting from the coronavirus pandemic by selling thousands of testing kits for up to £295 each – while frontline NHS workers go without.Another firm, which normally lets patients book face-to-face GP appointments via an app in London, is selling home tests for £295, boasting laboratory results within 72 hours for what it warns is a “lethal” disease. The firm claims it was in talks with an unnamed NHS body after being approached about providing testing for staff.It comes amid growing concern that NHS workers are not getting access to tests, with some forced into isolation for two weeks if someone in their household is showing symptoms – meaning they cannot treat patients.Celebrities, sports stars, the wealthy and businesspeople have talked of testing positive or negative for Covid-19 while members of the public and health professionals with clear symptoms of the virus have been unable to get tests via Public Health England (PHE).Idris Elba, the star of Luther, posted on Instagram this week that he had tested positive for the virus even though he had not displayed any symptoms. The Arsenal head coach, Mikel Arteta, also tested positive for Covid-19, and the club tested the whole team. A spokesman for the club declined to comment on the suggestion that the team were tested privately.PHE moved last week to stop testing people for coronavirus if their symptoms were not severe enough to warrant hospital treatment. However, on Wednesday Boris Johnson announced plans to dramatically scale up its operation and to test 25,000 people a day for the disease.Summerfield Healthcare – which runs three private clinics in Derby, Shrewsbury and Wolverhampton – is selling home delivery Covid-19 testing kits for £249 that people can carry out themselves by using a throat swab. Customers then send them to one of two laboratories accredited by the United Kingdom Accreditation Service (UKAS).The firm, whose director says more than 1,000 kits have been sold in the last 10 days, increased the cost of the tests in recent days from £149 citing increased demand and supplier costs. The website of the company, which is registered with the Care Quality Commission, states: “Coronavirus testing – due to exceptional demand and rising supplier costs we have been forced to increase our test price to £249.”Dr Grant Charlesworth-Jones, medical director at Summerfield Healthcare, said the firm was making a margin of approximately £50 on each testing kit sold. He admitted that the tests were not endorsed by PHE but said he believed laboratories were pursuing accreditation.As well as private care workers and other iniduals, businesses in finance, logistics, warehousing and haulage had been buying the tests, Charlesworth-Jones said. Asked to justify the perceived unfairness of those who could afford to pay being tested before frontline NHS workers, he said: “Do you want an honest quote? I think it’s grossly unfair. If you want to look after anyone, you’ve got to look after the care workers and the caregivers, otherwise you’ve got no personnel fabric with which to run the system on which you’re relying to run this pandemic.”Qured, a company which normally offers face-to-face private GP appointments within two hours at homes or workplaces in London, started selling coronavirus testing kits for £295 on Monday and had already taken 1,500 orders. Co-founder Alex Templeton explained the firm also used Randox for its testing, and said he understood the laboratory was in the process of seeking accreditation from PHE with trials.Symptoms are defined as either:NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should\u0026nbspstay at home for at least 7 days.If you live with other people,\u0026nbspthey should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.After 14 days, anyone you live with who does not have symptoms can return to their normal routine. But, if anyone in your home gets symptoms, they should stay at home for 7 days from the day their symptoms start.\u0026nbspEven if it means they\u0027re at home for longer than 14 days.Information: If you live with someone who is 70 or over, has a long-term condition, is pregnant or has a weakened immune system, try to find somewhere else for them to stay for 14 days.If you have to stay at home together, try to keep away from each other as much as possible.After 7 days, if you no longer have a high temperature you can return to your normal routine.If you still have a high temperature, stay at home until your temperature returns to normal.If you still have a cough after 7 days, but your temperature is normal, you do not need to continue staying at home. A cough can last for several weeks after the infection has gone.Templeton said Qured’s package included a GP phone consultation both before and after, with the “novel coronavirus extended array testing kit” courier-delivered to people’s doorsteps and lab results within 72 hours. The first batch of tests had been sent off by the company on Wednesday morning, he said. Healthcare workers were among those who had paid out of their own pocket for kits, he said, as well as businesses in media, finance and property.In response to a question about whether the home test kits were being trialled for accreditation by PHE, a spokesman highlighted government guidance stating: “Some manufacturers are selling products for the diagnosis of Covid-19 infection in community settings … The current view by PHE is that use of these products is not advised.” Randox was contacted for comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a0d91c199ba69af390f41b5bf4fe346d895682c8/0_93_2218_1330/master/2218.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=051a1a533e9d4a5a54f5c0c1c46c430b","title":"scientists say mass tests in italian town have halted covid 19","story":"A study in Vò, which saw Italy’s first death, points to the danger of asymptomatic carriersThe small town of Vò, in northern Italy, where the first coronavirus death occurred in the country, has become a case study that demonstrates how scientists might neutralise the spread of Covid-19.A scientific study, rolled out by the University of Padua, with the help of the Veneto Region and the Red Cross, consisted of testing all 3,300 inhabitants of the town, including asymptomatic people. The goal was to study the natural history of the virus, the transmission dynamics and the categories at risk.The researchers explained they had tested the inhabitants twice and that the study led to the discovery of the decisive role in the spread of the coronavirus epidemic of asymptomatic people.When the study began, on 6 March, there were at least 90 infected in Vò. For days now, there have been no new cases.“We were able to contain the outbreak here, because we identified and eliminated the ‘submerged’ infections and isolated them,” Andrea Crisanti, an infections expert at Imperial College London, who took part in the Vò project, told the Financial Times. “That is what makes the difference.”The research allowed for the identification of at least six asymptomatic people who tested positive for Covid-19. ‘‘If these people had not been discovered,” said the researchers, they would probably have unknowingly infected other inhabitants.“The percentage of infected people, even if asymptomatic, in the population is very high,” wrote Sergio Romagnani, professor of clinical immunology at the University of Florence, in a letter to the authorities. “The isolation of asymptomatics is essential to be able to control the spread of the virus and the severity of the disease.”There are many experts and mayors in Italy who push to carry out mass tests in the country, including asymptomatic ones.“A test does no harm to anyone,” said the governor of the Veneto region Luca Zaia, who is taking action to test every single inhabitant of the region.” Zaia, described Vò as, ‘‘the healthiest place in Italy’’. ‘‘This is proof that the testing system works,’’ he added.“Here there were the first two cases. We tested everyone, even if the ‘experts’ told us this was a mistake: 3,000 tests. We found 66 positives, who we isolated for 14 days, and after that 6 of them were still positive. And that is how we ended it.’’However, according to some, the problems of mass tests are not only of an economic nature (each swab costs about 15 euros) but also at a organisational level.On Tuesday, the WHO representative, Ranieri Guerra, said: “Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has urged the identification and diagnosis of suspected cases and symptomatic contacts of confirmed cases to be increased, as much as possible. At the moment, the recommendation to carry out mass screening has not been suggested.”Massimo Galli, professor of infectious diseases at the University of Milan and director of infectious diseases at the Luigi Sacco hospital in Milan, warned carrying out mass tests on the asymptomatic population could however prove to be useless.“The contagions are unfortunately constantly evolving,” Galli told the . “A man who tests negative today could contract the disease tomorrow.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b08fd9ea1ad475532ead513bb1f2362b7e653934/0_182_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=86912ff4209d77eee7423f1520156774","title":"thank you parisians dont bring the virus plea from rural france","story":"As Parisians flee to countryside, rural-dwellers accuse them of spreading infection and emptying shopsParisians who fled the French capital before the national lockdown are finding the welcome to second or family homes in the countryside less than warm after locals accused them of spreading the coronavirus.Trains leaving Paris for the countryside were packed on Tuesday morning, hours before the government’s order to stay at home unless absolutely necessary or face €135 fines came into effect at midday.In places, however, the Parisian arrivals were met with a frosty reception.Graffiti on a fence at Cap Ferret near Arcachon in south-west France set the tone with “Parigo home virus?”. Parigo is French slang for Parisians.The local Sud Ouest newspaper reported that a number of rural inhabitants were less than happy to see their Parisian compatriots.On the Facebook page of Lège-Cap-Ferret in the Gironde, the reaction was equally critical.“Already the Parisians and others with a second home have arrived … given that the supermarket has been stripped in two days,” wrote one local.Another wrote: “It’s very worrying to see all those people fleeing Paris – that will certainly spread the virus.”Ludovic Pons, a local politician, reported “feeling angry” on his Facebook page tweeting: “Thank you Parisians don’t bring us the virus.”When criticised for the post, he replied: “Some of them are walking on the beach and in the oyster-producing villages … It’s not a holiday, it’s quarantine for ALL.”In Brittany, Le Télégramme newspaper reported widespread local anger at urbanites descending on the region.A doctor from Auray, where one of the first coronavirus clusters was reported in France, was also concerned about the new arrivals.“It would be a pity if the influx of visitors aggravates the situation, which has been mostly well contained so far across in the area,” he said.On Belle-Île-en-Mer, one of the Breton islands where no cases of coronavirus have been reported so far among the 5,500 permanent residents, the atmosphere was reportedly tense.Fréderic Le Gars, president of the community committee, asked those with second homes to stay away.The mayor Thibault Grollemund, president of the hospital committee added: “There’s an obvious risk of saturation at our local hospital, that has no intensive care,” he said.One non-resident named only as Mathilde, who arrived just before the lockdown, told the paper: “It was already strained on the boat here and the welcome from locals has been icy.“They are blaming us for bringing the virus, emptying supermarket shelves and saying we risk taking up the rare number of hospital beds here. My neighbour gave me a ticking off from behind her hedge as I was unloading my suitcases.”She added: “As a result, we’re feeling guilty and keeping a low profile as well as applying as best we can the confinement measures.”Isabelle Ezanno, a doctor in Crac’h in the Morbihan, Brittany, described the Parisian exodus as “irresponsible”.“I wonder if people understand the gravity of the situation.”On Wednesday morning, the local police prefecture issued a decree limiting access to the Breton islands and banning non-residents from renting property on them."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8226a914f99e9aea7c420a3e22b650e647fbe2cd/0_0_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=91433abc53dfbaa014d909e5dad31ba2","title":"what a coronavirus lockdown might mean for london","story":"How countries from China to Italy have imposed measures to curb the spread of Covid-19When China announced plans to lock down Wuhan and most of the surrounding Hubei province, the news was greeted with astonishment around the world. Experts warned that it was an unprecedented and risky attempt to control the virus that might not work.Nearly two months later, with the daily number of new cases in China down to single digits last week, Wuhan is starting to emerge from two months of isolation, and this approach has become the model for other countries with outbreaks that appear to be sliding out of control.Now there is speculation the British government is preparing to implement something similar in London, the centre of the coronavirus outbreak in Britain.Other countries appear to have suppressed or contained the disease without such stringent measures, including Taiwan and Singapore, but they acted early and fast on other measures including testing, contact tracing and social distancing.On 23 January China locked down Wuhan city, home to 11 million people, where Covid-19 is thought to have originated. It was probably the most extreme lockdown so far and at the time it was brought in the move was met with some international scepticism, including from the World Health Organization.No journeys were allowed in or out of the city, even for those with compelling medical or humanitarian reasons.Inside the city, public transport was suspended and private cars barred from the roads in most circumstances, except as part of the fight against the virus.Most people live in residential blocks or compounds, and management barred visits. Only inhabitants, authorities, or people providing help to elderly or disabled were allowed in.Schools and universities were already closed for the lunar new year holiday but that was extended. Most shops were closed only pharmacies and supermarkets remained open.People were only allowed to leave their homes to get essential supplies or seek medical help, and anyone who did go out was required to wear a mask.Two weeks later conditions were tightened, with authorities ordering house-to-house searches for potentially infected iniduals, and forcing them into quarantine.Some restrictions have been lifted, allowing residents in key industries to start returning to work, but schools remain closed and curbs on transport are still in place.On 8 March Italy shut down the northern region that was most severely affected by the virus two days later it extended the controls to the entire country.Travel is only allowed for “urgent, verifiable work situations and emergencies or health reasons”.People who have tested positive for Covid-19 must not leave their homes for any reason, while anyone with a fever or respiratory symptoms is strongly encouraged to stay at home and limit social contact, including with their doctor.To avoid work-related travel, public and private companies have been urged to put their staff on leave.Supermarkets and pharmacies remain open, but little else.Schools and universities are closed, and all exams cancelled. Religious institutions will stay open, as long as people can stay a metre from one another – but ceremonies such as marriages, baptisms and funerals are banned.All gatherings “in public places” have been banned, not just large-scale events. All museums and cultural venues are closed, as well as nightclubs, cinemas, theatres and casinos.Sporting events were cancelled. Swimming pools, spas, sports halls and ski resorts across the country are shut.France’s full lockdown began at midday on Tuesday. People are barred from leaving home except to buy food or essentials, visit the doctor or get to a job certified as not doable from home.They have to carry a special document, certifying why they are outside, to show to security forces.About 100,000 police officers have been deployed to enforce the lockdown, with checkpoints to be set up nationwide.These are the toughest restrictions on public life outside wartime, and the president, Emmanuel Macron, described the battle against coronavirus as a “public health war … against an invisible and elusive enemy. There can be no more outside meetings, no more seeing family or friends on the street or in the park.”France had already closed all bars, restaurants and non-essential shops from midnight on Saturday and creches, schools and universities from Monday morning.After crowds continued to gather outside, Paris closed all its parks and gardens.San Francisco and five other Bay Area counties in California ordered all residents to “shelter in place” to curb the spread of coronavirus, the first lockdown of its kind in the US.Effective until 7 April, it is a voluntary order, directing residents to stay inside unless absolutely necessary – in contrast with legally binding restrictions elsewhere.All businesses considered non-essential – such as bars and gyms – were ordered to close, and their workers to work from home. But grocery stores, pharmacies, launderettes, restaurants serving takeaway, petrol stations and other “essential businesses” will remain open, and municipal services such as rubbish collection will continue.Residents can leave their home for essential tasks, exercise and care duties, but have been asked to keep six feet away from other people.All non-essential gatherings of any size are prohibited, as well as non-essential travel “on foot, bicycle, scooter, automobile or public transit”.Airports, taxis and public transport will continue running, but only for essential travel."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7200859fb487792e1336e456cb1a1b0c126614c/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3c3503426875ecac8614c1ddb0a46742","title":"coronavirus latest at a glance","story":"A summary of the biggest developments in the global coronavirus outbreakKey developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include:China reported 34 new cases of Covid-19 on Thursday, but for the first time, none were in Hubei province – the centre of the outbreak.

The Windrush Lessons Learned review is expected to criticise Home Office staff and government ministers for continued failure to admit the magnitude of their mistakes and the scale of damage inflicted on thousands of legal UK residents who were wrongly treated as illegal immigrants.

Here is what we know – and what we don’t.Larry Elliott considers how the crisis has forced a return to wartime economic thought – the government wants manufacturers to make ventilators in the same way factories once switched to churning out planes and tanks. Politicians are also adopting the language and policies of the left: social solidarity, help for struggling firms, bailouts for hard-hit industries. “In a battle for economic survival the constraints of peacetime have to be ditched.”Lily Kuo writes that China has been using the outbreak to position itself as a leader and benefactor in public health – sending ventilators, masks and help to Italy and France, pledging to help the Philippines and Spain, and dispatching medics to Iran and Iraq – and build the kind of soft power that Beijing craves.Donald Trump has moved from dismissing coronavirus as similar to the winter flu that would disappear in the spring to declaring a national emergency.

A digital detox is probably more necessary than ever during this period and yet also less feasible.Over the past few days, overwhelmed by rolling news coverage and conspiracy theories, I’ve only managed to survive online by frequenting the “sunny side up” social media channels that are so often the subject of ridicule.Most of us have a certain level of scepticism for the perma-positive brigade. I’ve eye-rolled at the endless captions demanding “good vibes only”. I’ve scrolled past the posting of a reposting of a quote on silver linings, which appear only to be visible through rose-tinted sunnies. But I must admit, eternal optimists have been a godsend during this time.For me, the relentless, almost aggressive optimism of many Instagrammers is an unexpected comfort when I’m distinctly lacking in any of my own.I’ve come to love twee, child-like illustrations assuring that “we’ve got this” or reminding that we’re “all in this together”. Accounts documenting small, medium and big acts of kindness have been heartwarming displays of human spirit. When you are feeling powerless, Twitter users offering advice on how you too can muck in can make you feel slightly less so. Just last month, we urged each other to be kinder online via the hashtag campaign #BeKind, created after the tragic death of Caroline Flack (which itself illustrates just how sad and strange this year has already been) to little avail. And while the usual callousness will never disappear from the internet entirely, being in this for the long haul has meant that it finally occurred to me that I don’t have to give it any time. Things are already dark enough.Snark and cynicism are mainstays of the world wide web – even the most wholesome corners of it usually have comment sections dripping in sarcasm. But there is nothing like being in the throws of a global pandemic to put the time you spend online in perspective. Like a social media Scrooge, faced with Covid-19 instead of Christmas, I’ve found the true meaning of being on Instagram. Despite our previous scoffing, it’s the “Live, Laugh, Lovers” who will inherit the Earth."},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Photograph Nick Bradshaw A further 74 cases of Covid-19 were confirmed by the National Public Health Emergency Team on Wednesday night. The new cases involve 29 women and 45 men. The total number of cases in the Republic is now 366.It also published an analysis of the first 271 cases. Of these, 40 per cent involved men and 59 per cent are female, with 23 clusters.To date 42 per cent of cases are travel-related 22 per cent are associated with community transmission 17 per cent are as a result of local transmission and 20 per cent remain under investigation.Two-thirds of cases were among people aged under 55 years, with almost one in four aged 35 to 55. One baby aged under one contracted the virus, but no children aged one to four years. There were four cases among children aged five to 14 years.One case in five involved a healthcare worker, and one-third of these cases were associated with travel.Dublin has the highest number of cases with 129, followed by Cork (48) and Limerick (14).The cases were also analysed by severity. Of the 271 cases, 84 (31 per cent) saw the patient hospitalised this figure is artificially high because at the start of the outbreak all patients were sent to hospital, even if their symptoms were mild.Six patients have required treatment in intensive care this is 2 per cent of the overall number. There have been two confirmed deaths, giving a case fatality rate of 0.7 per cent.Leitrim, Laois and Monaghan were the only counties not to record a case, while 15 other counties recorded fewer than five cases.ComplianceThere has been an “extraordinary level of compliance” with the social distancing measures introduced last week, chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan told a media briefing. People were showing a “high degree of understanding” in relation to symptoms, and the importance of self-isolation for people showing symptoms.“You see it every day,” Dr Holohan said, adding that he had counted just 11 passengers on six buses on his way to work.He said as the measures have taken effect, public health doctors have started to notice that the number of contacts of confirmed cases has grown smaller.However, he said it was too early to know if the measures were having the desired impact, and it might be “towards the end of the month” before this would be known.He said the Taoiseach’s prediction of 15,000 cases by the end of the month represented an “unmitigated situation”, and he was hopeful a lower number of cases would be observed as a result of the measures taken.Asked about reports online of a third death from the disease on Wednesday, Mr Holohan said he did not have any notification of this but it can take time for cases to “come through” in processing.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Regional breakdown: Emergency team publishes analysis showing highest number of cases are in Dublin, Cork and LimerickExperts have tough job communicating evidence around policy issues such as Covid-19Student sharing room with three others fears being unable to self-isolate if virus spreadsUnion calls for agreement on pay and risks for student nurses combating Covid-19 surgeGarda\u0026iacute appeal for witnesses following incident near Mallow on WednesdayFear growing among poorest working families they will be hardest hitNorthern Ireland to close schools, as Minister warns \u0026lsquomany more\u0026rsquo will become unemployedAn Post has outlined a series of measures designed to combat the spread of Covid-19Department of Foreign Affairs advises against all travel to Germany unless residentBelfast woman was one of three founders of Peace PeopleDiscussions due to continue on Thursday and Friday between FG and FFProducer of the Jameson and Powers whiskey labels offer to help the HSE meet demandEuro Car Parks director says clamping is \u0026lsquothe last thing we need\u0026rsquo amid outbreakAdjournments and jury member absences bring legal system activity to a near-haltCourt\u0026rsquos decision in Ruth Morrissey case will impact on other cervical cancer casesIan Dowling acquired the object at an auction three years agoRetail Ireland calls for emergency support for shops \u0026lsquodevastated\u0026rsquo by Covid-19 pandemicArlene Foster move was likely to mean they would remain shut during the summerStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4204988.1584444197!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"share your covid 19 story have you lost your job or business","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA shopper wearing a face mask on Grafton Street, Dublin last weekend.

Photograph: Oliver HosletReutersThe European Union released a draft of its hoped-for future relationship deal with Britain on Wednesday, setting out ambitions for a tight relationship on trade and security.The 440-page document crosses several of Britain’s red lines, spelling out the bloc’s ambitions for Britain to agree “uniform implementation” of state subsidy rules, with the European Court of Justice remaining the adjudicating authority.It also makes reference to the so-called “level playing field”, provisions to ensure fair competition by keeping rules aligned, which London has already rejected.“The Parties recognise that the establishment of conditions that ensure a level playing field between the Parties is necessary for trade and investment between the Union and the United Kingdom, ” the draft reads.The EU’s draft envisages reciprocal access to waters for fishing rights, with negotiations held each year by December 10th on fishing opportunities for the following year, another contentious point.The UK negotiating team said it had also sent a draft to the EU. This includes a free trade agreement with annexes, as well as agreements on aviation safety and air transport, and a civil nuclear agreement.“We are sharing ours in confidence as a negotiating document, as part of the ongoing negotiating process,” a government spokesman said.“Teams will now analyse each other’s texts and we expect further conversations between the teams next week.“We will keep under review which documents it is appropriate to publish during the course of negotiations and whether it is useful to make them availablle more widely.”Though Britain has left the EU it is is currently in a transition period, continuing to adhere to prior norms pending the agreement of a deal on the future relationship. If none can be agreed, it will automatically begin trading on World Trade Organisation terms from January 1st, 2021, with potentially severe effects on the Irish economy.The government of prime minister Boris Johnson has until July to request an extension to the transition period, but has insisted it will not do so even as the Coronavirus pandemic delayed talks this week.Both sides said they were examining options such as using video conferencing in place of face-to face talks.“The negotiations can still proceed given all of the logistical arrangements that have been put in place,” British foreign secretary Dominic Raab said on Tuesday.“We’re confident that we can get this done and, actually, I don’t think delaying Brexit negotiations would give anyone the certainty on either side of the Channel that they need.”Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4206134.1584558426!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"italians look at aid from china and a series of slights from the eu","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Italian foreign minister Luigi Di Maio  holding a press conference with a limited number  of reporters  at the Farnesina Palace in Rome. Photograph:  EPAEttore FerrariIt was a black Thursday in Italy. The country was in lockdown. Coronavirus deaths were soaring. Hospitals were overwhelmed, with more patients than available equipment. Italy’s youthful deputy prime minister and foreign minister Luigi di Maio addressed the public from his office, speaking directly into a hand-held camera streaming live on Facebook. “I wanted to show you the first help that has arrived. From China, ” Di Maio said. He pointed to his laptop, which played a video of people in face masks descending the steps of an aeroplane.“These are the specialised medical staff who faced the coronavirus emergency in China, and in this moment have arrived in Rome,” Di Maio said. “This is the aid. There are the first 40 ventilators, there are masks,” he said as the screen showed blue crates being unloaded. “This is what we call solidarity.”Di Maio was also pointing out the aid that hadn’t come.Rome formally asked EU states to urgently send facem asks in February. “Not a single EU country responded,” Italy’s ambassador to the EU wrote last week.It’s one of a series of slights playing into existing bitterness in Italy towards the EU, which has been fanned by years of austerity and helped bring euro-critical parties such as Di Maio’s Five Star Movement into power. Media coverage of Italy’s initial outbreak from northern countries was at times unsympathetic, and governments briefed that Rome’s response was over the top. The French ambassador to Rome was forced to apologise after a skit about a “Corona pizza” by French television caused outrage. An eagerly-awaited intervention by the European Central Bank last week failed to help.“We are not here to close spreads,” said its president Christine Lagarde, in an abrupt dismissal of hopes that the bank might act to reduce increasingly expensive borrowing costs. The remarks added to market turmoil that caused a record 17 per cent drop on the Milan stock exchange, and sent Italy’s borrowing costs even higher. Powerful impressionIn contrast to all this the aircraft from Shanghai has made a powerful impression. China is making the most of the propaganda value of the aid, co-ordinated by its National Health Commission and Red Cross Society of China, to override previous associations as the origin of the outbreak. “You see your true friends in the time of need,” the Chinese embassy in Rome wrote on its Twitter page, a stream of homages to Italo-Sino solidarity.Messages circulate on social media in Italy reflecting the sentiment. The aid was followed by a donation of a million face masks and 100,000 test kits from Chinese tech magnate Jack Ma in boxes stamped with the stirring lyrics of “Nessun dorma”. He also sent aid to France, Slovenia, Spain, the US and the 54 countries of Africa. The pandemic is increasingly the subject of a propaganda war between global powers against the backdrop of a trade war and increasingly toxic relations between Washington and Beijing. US president Donald Trump has taken to calling it “the Chinese virus”, while Chinese officials promote a conspiracy theory that the disease originated in the US.It’s worth remembering that Italy is a battlefield of influence, and, as the EU’s third largest economy, a crucial one.Last year Italy became the first G7 country to endorse China’s Belt and Rail Initiative, a massive infrastructure and influence project to connect the continents, risking the ire of Washington and Brussels in the hopes of bringing investment to its long-stagnant economy.This year was supposed to be “Italy-China 2020”, a year of tourism and cultural exchange to mark half a century of diplomatic relations between the two.  GeopoliticsThe European Commission is attempting to play the game of geopolitics too, albeit within the usual limits of its power and charisma.“Dear Italians ... you are not alone,” commission president Ursula von der Leyen said in message delivered in her best Italian. “Italy is part of Europe, and Europe suffers with Italy.”The commission reprimanded France and Germany for blocking exports of face masks in the scramble for equipment, eased spending strictures for member states, and unleashed billions in funding for Covid-19 research and to shore up economies.It has also tried to co-ordinate a collective approach to medical procurement and border checks. Yet as health and borders are national powers, EU countries can ignore much of this, and have done so with abandon. The disease is turning out to be the EU’s greatest challenge yet.“The coronavirus crisis is a test of the EU’s cohesiveness and credibility – one that can only be passed through genuine concrete solidarity,” warned Italy’s ambassador to the EU Maurizio Massari. “If we are courageous and united, we will win. If we are selfish and ided, we will lose.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4205655.1584558782!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"bernie sanders reassessing campaign as biden extends lead","story":"Former US vice-president Joe Biden has further cemented his lead in the Democratic presidential nominee race with three more primary wins. Video: Reuters\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tJoe Biden delivers remarks at his primary night election event in Columbia, South Carolina on February 29th. Photograph:  Getty ImagesUS presidential candidate Joe Biden swept to victory in Florida, Illinois and Arizona on Tuesday night, cementing his path to the Democratic nomination as the party chooses its candidate to take on Donald Trump in November’s election.Mr Biden won the Florida primary by a huge margin, scooping up the majority of the 219 delegates at stake in the state. He also secured wide-margin wins in the rust-belt state of Illinois and further west in Arizona.Mr Sanders wasreassessing his White House bid after his latest bruising losses to Mr Biden, a senior adviser said on Wednesday, as the campaign suspended its political advertising on Facebook.“The next primary contest is at least three weeks away. Senator Sanders is going to be having conversations with supporters to assess his campaign,” his campaign manager, Faiz Shakir, said in a statement.Exit polls suggested that Mr Biden won a high percentage of the African-American vote in Florida, as expected. But he also polled extremely well with white blue collar workers who bolstered Mr Sanders in his run for the Democratic nomination in 2016.The three states — Florida, Arizona and Illinois — held their primary contests as planned despite the threat of coronavirus. But Ohio postponed its primary until June, generating tensions between the state’s governor and the courts over the decision. As well as the two front-runners, Hawaii congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard was also on the ballot in the three states.DelayedSeveral primaries that had been scheduled to take place in the coming weeks, including in Louisiana and Georgia, have delayed their selection processes by several weeks. The party’s nominee will be chosen at the Democratic National Convention in July in Wisconsin, though the deepening coronavirus crisis has thrown the trajectory of the primary cycle into question.Mr Biden’s strong performance on Tuesday follows his victory in five of the six states that voted a week ago, as well as the vast majority of states on Super Tuesday on March 3rd. While Mr Sanders lost all three states to Hillary Clinton in 2016, his margin of defeat against Mr Biden was greater on Tuesday.The former vice-president has now established what appears to be an insurmountable lead over Mr Sanders, who failed to capitalise on his wins in the early voting states in February. Mr Biden’s latest wins have given him a lead over Mr Sanders of 971 to 737 delegates to the convention in July, according to Edison Research. A candidate needs 1,991 delegates to clinch the nomination.Addressing supporters on Tuesday night from Wilmington, Delaware, via a livestream feed and wearing a green tie to mark St Patrick’s Day, Mr Biden’s focused on coronavirus in much of his speech.“Tackling this pandemic is a national emergency, akin to fighting a war,” he said. “This is a moment when we need our leaders to lead.”“The coronavirus does not care if you are a Democrat or a Republican,” he said, it will “touch people in positions of power as well as the most vulnerable in society. We’re all in this together”.He also attempted to reach out to younger voters who have tended to back Mr Sanders in the Democratic primaries so far. “I hear you, I know what’s at stake. I know what we have to do. Our goal as a campaign and my goal as a candidate for president is to unify this party and unify this nation.”PandemicDespite the rapidly spreading coronavirus pandemic, which has started to impact on daily life in America, turnout in Florida appeared to be higher than in 2016, though this may have reflected the large number of postal and early voting. The total number of people who voted in Illinois was much lower than in 2016, reflecting the fact that fewer voters voted early.In the last debate before Tuesday’s primary contests, both Mr Biden and Mr Sanders said they would support the other, whoever became the party’s candidate.Mr Biden also pledged to choose a woman as his running-mate if he is selected as the party’s nominee, and reiterated his pledge to appoint the first black woman to the supreme court, saying it was “long overdue”.Mr Biden’s public commitment prompted immediate speculation as to who his choice would be.

He is due to return to his home in Lombardy soon.Bruce Aylward of the World Health Organization said last month: There’s only one drug right now that we think may have real efficacy. And that’s remdesivir.Drug maker Gilead, which distributed the drug on a compassionate use basis to several hundred patients globally, expects to start its own late-stage trials this month.Remdesivir has so far been proven to inhibit the related virus Mers-CoV - the cause of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in animal models. However a study out last week on three US patients showed mixed results. There are currently no approved therapies for coronavirus, but many countries have been repurposing anti-virals in the the hope they might work against the infection.Thailand claims to have cured some patients with a combination of the dual HIV antivirals ritonavir-lopinavir and Tamiflu. China has also approved the antiviral favilavir for use in coronavirus. Additionally, the anti-malarial chloroquine has shown efficacy in some early lab trials. The first clinical trial for vaccine has begun in the US after skipping animals trials. More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"johnny depp told doctor chopped finger","story":"Johnny Depp texted his doctor admitting he chopped off his own finger after a row with Amber Heard, it was revealed in court yesterday, despite previously blaming his ex-wife for the injury.The Hollywood star wrote panicked messages to the physician saying he regretted mutilating his hand and thought he should go to hospital.Depp, 56, had previously accused actress Heard, to whom he was married for 18 months, of severing his middle finger during a furious row in 2015. He claimed she threw a bottle at him which broke and cut him, as well as put a cigarette out on his face.But text messages aired for the first time yesterday at the High Court in London, where the Pirates of the Carribean actor\u0027s libel claim against The Sun newspaper is being heard, revealed this wasn\u0027t the case.Writing to Dr David Kipper on March 7, Depp said: I cut the tip of my middle finger off. What should I do? Except of course go to hospital. I am so embarrassed for jumping into anything with her. F**K the world. JD.In a second message sent on March 19, he wrote:Thank you for everything. I have chopped off my left middle finger as a reminder that I should never cut my finger off again. I love you brother, Johnny.Depp is suing the publishers of The Sun and its executive editor, Dan Wootton, over an article which alleged he was violent and abusive towards Heard and referred to him as a “wife-beater”.It was alleged during a hearing at the High Court yesterday, ahead of a full libel trial due to begin on Monday, that Depp tore off 33-year-old Heard\u0027s nightgown and grabbed her breasts, pinned her against a ping-pong table and strangled her.Adam Wolanski, QC, representing The Sun and Mr Wootton, described the events of March 4, 2015.He said: That night the complaint shoved Ms Heard into a ping-pong table, throw bottles through window panels of a glass door, then grabbed Ms Heard and tore off her nightgown.The complainant grabbed Ms Heard by her neck and choked her against the refrigerator.The complainant mocked her, while touching and grabbing her by her breasts and repeatedly shoved her up against the refrigerator.The complainant then grabbed Ms Heard by the neck and collarbone, slammed her against the counter-top and strangled her.The court heard the former couple had another fight in 2013, during which Depp fell to his knees and began crying, and said he had a monster living within him.Heard made a witness statement about the row last year.Summarising it, Mr Wolanski said: He said he was sorry, and he wouldn\u0027t doing it again. He thought he had killed that other person. The monster as he called it. He said it was sickness.He would blame his actions on a self-created third person.Recordings of Heard recently emerged in which she appears to discuss having been physically violent towards Depp.David Sherborne, the barrister representing Depp, previously said that evidence “demonstrates in her own voice that she was not a victim of domestic abuse, but rather that she was the aggressor.\u0027\u0027In addition to the libel case Depp has brought against The Sun in the UK, he is bringing separate libel proceedings against Heard in the US.Depp and Heard met on the set of 2011 comedy The Rum Diary and married in Los Angeles in February 2015.Heard obtained a restraining order against Depp in May 2016, accusing him of abuse, which he denied. The pair reached an out of court orce settlement in 2017, with Heard donating her £5.5m share to charity.Depp is currently staying in his palatial chateau in the South of France, while Heard is in Los Angeles.His lawyer, Adam Waldman, said: “What the court heard today was not evidence – it was Amber Heard’s newest storyline about a \u0027late night bust up\u0027.Facts matter.  Back in reality, as hospital records and eyewitness testimony show, Amber Heard’s attack story could not have occurred the night of Sunday March 8, 2015 as she alleges.Because Johnny Depp went to the hospital the early AFTERNOON of March 8, 2015 to reattach the finger Amber Heard severed, and Mr Depp did not see her again in Australia. Our opponents are so lost in their lies, they can’t even get their fake sequence of events, times or dates straight.”A spokesperson for Heard said: “In court today, numerous contradictions and inconsistencies in Mr Depp’s evidence – which the judge described as ‘troubling’ - were exposed.Ms Heard obtained a domestic violence restraining order from a judge in 2016. Four years later, Mr Depp has dragged her to give evidence to a court in London and subjected her to trial by media.As today showed, the evidence in court will ultimately speak for itself.”More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"london lockdown government set shut city weekend","story":"Boris Johnson insisted Britain remained a land of liberty but refused to rule out a draconian lockdown for London that is expected as early as the weekend.The Government is drawing up sweeping plans to enforce the emergency closure of restaurants, bars, pubs and cinemas in the capital and restrict the use of public transport to only essential key workers. The measure would put hundreds of thousands of people out of work and effectively turn London into a ghost town.The Cabinet Office is understood to have written to departments about how the shutdown could be implemented and, crucially, enforced. Downing Street did not rule out London residents eligible to travel requiring paperwork to do so.Asked at the daily press conference if London faced a possible shutdown like other European cities, the Prime Minister said: We live in a land of liberty as you know, and it\u0027s one of the great features of our lives that we don\u0027t tend to impose those sorts of restrictions on people in this country.But I have to tell you we will rule nothing out and we will certainly wish to consider bringing forward further and faster measures where that is necessary to suppress the peak of the epidemic to protect our NHS, to minimise casualties, and to minimise suffering.He added: Absolutely we do not rule it out, because it would be quite wrong to do so. We do not rule out taking further and faster measures in due course.”The  understands that London is likely to go into a lockdown as early as the weekend under the most dramatic measures yet to curb the spread of Covid-19. London has more cases than anywhere else in the country (see map below).Legislation in the Coronavirus Bill would give the Government emergency powers to close premises and restrict or prohibit events and gatherings, including restricting transport networks. The Bill was introduced on Wednesday and could be passed into law by the end of the week. Downing Street said it could also draw on existing public health legislation to combat the spread of disease to ensure any Paris or New York-style lockdown is effective.Supermarkets, corner shops selling food  and pharmacies would remain open under plans to be discussed at the latest Cobra meeting.Officials believe that London, with its population of nine million people, has become a city of superspreaders, prompting the Government to consider its effective closure.Official figures from Public Health England show 929 cases recorded in London, more than a third of the UK confirmed total of 2,626. In reality tens of thousands of people in London will already have the disease. A well-placed Whitehall source said an announcement would be made by the weekend and is likely to be put in place in time for Saturday night. Downing Street declined to rule out the introduction of measures by Friday.The closure of bars and restaurants will have a devastating effect on the economy and threatens to put hundreds of thousands of people out of work. It is estimated that one in seven people in London work in the tourism, hospitality and leisure sector.The Whitehall source said public transport would be limited, although it is not clear how the measure will be enforced. It is understood that the wider population will still be able to travel across London in their cars and on bikes.An internal Transport for London (TfL) memo said: We must provide transport services for essential workers and keep transport going to critical locations such as hospitals.”Legislation in the Coronavirus Bill would give the Government emergency powers to close premises and restrict or prohibit events and gatherings.There is alarm in Whitehall that Mr Johnson\u0027s call for the public to avoid pubs and restaurants and to work at home is being ignored in large numbers.New figures from TfL show a 19 per cent decline in passenger numbers on the Tube - still equivalent to four million journeys a day - and a 10 per cent reduction on the buses to about 5.5 million daily trips. This week, commuters on the Tube were still complaining of overcrowding after it emerged that TfL had begun to reduce the numbers of trains, matching service levels to the actual demand for travel.Anecdotal reports suggest pubs remain packed after work, although plenty of others reported that premises were empty. On Twitter, Francesco Ragni, an Italian writer who lives in London, posted pictures of his packed local pub, adding: Restaurants and pubs closed? Well, not exactly. Plenty of people at my local pub tonight, enjoying a pint and some food and company. Boris coronavirus advice clearly ignored by many.A Downing Street spokesman said :We haven\u0027t ruled things out but we will only take decisions where they are based on medical and scientific advice.The 1984 Public Health Control of Diseases Act, which was strengthened earlier this year by the Department of Health and Social Care, allows for iniduals to be kept in isolation for their own safety. It is a long-standing piece of legislation.Civil servants have opened talks about the restrictions with staff in the London Mayor\u0027s office and other public bodies about coordinating the action. The timescale of the changes is still fluid to give Boris Johnson the option of ordering it this weekend or delaying by a few weeks.Sadiq Khan, London’s mayor, has complained that he is not being kept informed about the UK government’s plans and his aides are unsure whether the lockdown will take place, or what form it might take.  A source close to the Mayor said: We expect a shutdown of London but nobody in central Government is saying when that will be or what form it will take. The Prime Minister is saying we need to go faster and further and there is a spike of cases in London which is running ahead of the country but what that actually means the mayor’s office doesn’t yet know because Downing Street hasn\u0027t said.Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u0027s First Minister, said she believed the UK Government was about to announce more stringent measures for London. Mr Johnson has already admitted that London has become the country’s worst affected region. Asked how far the UK was from a complete lockdown, Ms Sturgeon said the capital could see tougher measures first because it was further ahead on the curve of the outbreak. Ms Sturgeon receives briefings on UK-wide coronavirus measures.Mr Johnson’s allies said no new measures were planned for the capital on Wednesday or Thursday, but Government insiders said the lockdown could be announced on Friday. People are looking at it, but it\u0027s too early to say when or whether we will do this, said another government official.Asked if people could be barred from leaving home without paperwork to show they have a legitimate reason, Mr Johnson’s spokesman said: We’ve set out the steps which we think are necessary at this point in time.But we will be guided by scientific and medical advice to ensure we take the right steps to protect the public.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"silver shoppers rising against panic buyers","story":"One might have expected the genteel shores of Lake Windermere to be immune from the panic buying that has gripped Britain’s cities in recent days. But on Wednesday Booths – known as the Waitrose of the North – was one of several supermarket chains across the country to introduce a dedicated morning slot to ensure its elderly customers could still buy their essentials in the face of unprecedented demand.This being Booths, there were no security guards keeping younger shoppers at bay outside the Windermere branch, just politely worded easels placed at the entrances informing customers to give the elderly and disabled free reign between 9.30am and 11am.The opening morning was, says store manager Richard Nolan, a resounding success with hundreds of elderly shoppers coming through the door.“I had elderly customers coming up to me and saying that they have already been through a war and of course are going to get through this,” he says. “They were demonstrating a really good stiff upper lip attitude but also were just so grateful to be able to buy what they needed.”Among the most popular items being snapped up by the Windermere shoppers were the loo rolls, longlife milk and cans of beans and soup which have been stripped bare in recent days. But Golden Syrup and Marmite also proved a big draw with sales of the latter having increased by 250 per cent in a single week.Supermarkets across the country are following Booths lead. On Thursday Sainsbury’s will be the latest to introduce an elderly hour across all of its branches with only the over 70s and disabled allowed to shop during the first hour of trading. Iceland has also started weekly Wednesday early openings for the elderly, while the building society Nationwide is trialling a similar scheme at 100 of its branches across the UK.  It is expected other supermarkets will follow suit over the coming days, as well as prioritising the elderly with online deliveries. A queue of largely silver-haired shoppers formed outside the Iceland in Winton, Bournemouth, on Wednesday morning, with the supermarket implementing a two hour slot from 9am to allow them to buy what they needed.Sandra Roberts was among 150 pensioners stocking up on essentials. The 75-year-old, who suffers from a lung condition, says the sight of so many fit and able stockpiling in recent days has been “bloody disgusting” and left her feeling very vulnerable that she would not be able to fight through the throng.She was content stocking up with a single multipack of loo roll. “That will last me for long enough now,” she said. “People should just buy what they need and not be selfish.” Similar queues formed outside the Iceland in Brentwood, Essex, prior to opening with a shopper in a mobility scooter the first to stake his place at the front. Others wore masks or pulled up their scarves around their mouths in an attempt to avoid the virus.Staff manned the doors in order to maintain control though here, too, the selflessness and civility of the older generation was on display. Edyta Skonieczna, 31, was opening up the British Heart Foundation charity shop next to the supermarket and says the elderly Iceland shoppers offered to help her carry in the donation bags that had been left outside overnight. After finishing their shopping a few of the shoppers popped in to stock up on jigsaw puzzles, board games and books for the long days of isolation ahead. “It was a really social gathering and all their spirits seemed very high,” she says. “When they offered to help it melted my heart.”More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"supermarkets planning coordinated closures staff swaps keep","story":"Supermarkets are asking the Government to relax competition laws allowing rival stores to open on alternate days and share staff in order to cope with the coronavirus crisis.The proposed arrangements would see food retailers, including the so called ‘big four’, coming together to ensure supplies are maintained across the country.With fears that demand could start outstripping supply in some areas in the coming weeks, supermarkets and other grocery stores are considering a number of radical proposals to keep the shelves stocked.One suggestion is to introduce coordinated closures, where rival shops in close proximity, agree to open on alternate days, allowing them to restock more easily when the doors are locked.Supermarket bosses are also in talks about sharing staff in the hope of preventing sudden store closures if large numbers of workers fall ill or have to self isolate.It would mean workers might be required to operate in unfamiliar stores, but their pay would be unaffected by the arrangement.The bigger shops, which have on-site cafes and restaurants, have also been closing them and re-deploying staff onto the shop floor.Because some of the measures would technically be a breach of competition laws, the Government would need to remove legal barriers to such arrangements.The proposals are being discussed along with rationing systems which are all intended to ensure stocks continue to reach customers.An industry source said: “There is a real desire for businesses in this sector to all work together to ensure food and other essentials are getting out to those who need them.“This is an unprecedented situation and so radical solutions are needed. One of the major concerns is how to maintain staffing levels as more people are diagnosed.“By sharing staff it is hoped they will be able to mitigate any losses through sickness and self isolation. “Supermarkets are also in talks about having coordinated closures so that different stores will open on different days. This would mean customers at least have some outlets open at any one time.”One sign of the new collaboration in the normally fiercely competitive world of grocery retail, is the rationing agreements that have been reached.After Sainsbury’s announced that it would begin rationing all products to three per customer, Asda has also adopted the same policy, with other major retailers expected to follow in the coming days. Tesco became the latest major retailer to introduce widespread rationing, with customers limited to three items across all products. From Thursday the supermarket has also closed its meat, fish, deli counters and salad bars, and has asked customers where possible to pay by card. A ‘silver hour’ between 9am and 10am will also be introduced on Monday, Wednesday and Friday. Elderly customers will receive priority for online shopping, with others asked to use click and collect over delivery to free up slots.But there remains concern over the issue of getting fresh produce from the fields and into the shops.The problem is being exacerbated by the unavailability of seasonal pickers, many of whom travel to the UK from Eastern Europe and further afield.Travel restrictions and the grounding of flights has decimated that prospect and it is feared there will not be enough manpower to meet the demand.George Eustice, Secretary of State for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, is in talks with the National Farmers Union over ways of addressing the shortfall in seasonal workers.According to Government sources, the main concern for the sector is securing enough staff in May, when the majority of labourers travel to the UK. The period is also expected to coincide with the peak of the coronavirus outbreak. With the fruit picking season due to commence next month, HOPS, one of the leading suppliers of labour to farmers, has called on British students, job seekers and staff laid off from catering and hospitality jobs to apply for jobs. HOPS Operations Director Sarah Boparan said: “We urgently need a UK labour force who can help harvest crops to feed the nation. At a time when international travel is restricted and people are panic buying due to the Coronavirus, it is crucial that growers can provide enough British produce to our supermarkets and local shops.   “As the peak season for soft fruit picking gets underway, HOPS are calling on British workers to help support the industry in jobs that are usually filled by EU workers.  “We are aware that there are many people facing sustained periods away from their usual employment or studies and HOPS can offer paid positions for those who are willing to work.”The Royal Horticultural Society has also urged Britons to begin planting their own salad plants in gardens and even on windowsills, in a bid to become more sustainable.For those with smaller gardens, produce such potatoes, lettuce, radishes and spinach can be planted in containers and gathered in June. Guy Barter, the society’s chief horticulturist, told The  that while larger vegetables such as carrots, beans and peas would not be ready for several months, pea shoots, rocket, lambs lettuce and other greens could be grown now. “These can be raised on windowsills so even those without gardens have scope to grow incomparably fresh food,” he added.    “It is worth doing this as the coronavirus related disruption in Spain where most of our fresh winter veg comes from may lead to uncertain supplies this spring.   “Herb plants are worth buying too – mint and chives for example are shooting up now and repeated light pickings can be taken to add flavour and vitamins to store cupboard ingredients, rice or pasta say, that the self-isolating may have to fall back on.” Meanwhile the police remain on standby to deal with any potential civil disobedience that flares up around shortages.A source said: “At the moment incidents have been sporadic and isolated and it is hoped that people will remain sensible and proportionate, but clearly the police are there if needed and will respond if things get out of hand.”More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"wonderchicken fossil could help reveal modern birds evolved","story":"A wonderchicken fossil unearthed in a quarry is one of the best preserved of all time and could help us discover how modern birds evolved.The 66.7-million-year-old skull, found wedged in limestone near the Belgian-Dutch border, is the oldest modern bird fossil ever discovered and believed to be among the earliest ancestors of chickens and ducks.Dating back to around a million years before the asteroid impact which eliminated all large dinosaurs, it has been nicknamed wonderchicken because of its potential to shed light on the mysterious origins of living bird ersity.It has been formally named Asteriornis - referring to Asteria, the Greek Titan goddess of falling stars.Researchers from Cambridge University said it was the most exciting moment of their careers and had to pinch themselves upon realising they had found such an important relic of the history of our planet.They used high-resolution X-ray scanning to peer through the rock and view the skull.Dr Daniel Field, who led the study, said: This is one of the best-preserved fossil bird skulls of any age, from anywhere in the world.This fossil tells us that early on, at least some modern birds were fairly small-bodied, ground-dwelling birds that lived near the seashore.Asteriornis now gives us a search image for future fossil discoveries - hopefully it ushers in a new era of fossil finds that help clarify how, when and where modern birds first evolved.Albert Chen, who co-authored the research, added: The origins of living bird ersity are shrouded in mystery - other than knowing that modern birds arose at some point towards the end of the age of dinosaurs, we have very little fossil evidence of them until after the asteroid hit.This fossil provides our earliest direct glimpse of what modern birds were like during the initial stages of their evolutionary history.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day 19th march 2020","story":"Thousands of Muslims have joined a special prayer in a southern Bangladesh town seeking protection from the coronavirus to almighty, officials said on March 18 as the south Asian nation confirmed its first casualty by Covid-19Coronavirus latest news: Up to 40 London Underground stations to shut from todayComment: At war, Brits can be trusted to do the right thingComment: Under the shadow of coronavirus, normal things become positively heroicUK coronavirus lockdown plans: What the Government advice means for youWhere in the UK have cases of coronavirus been detected -

As less people go out, taxi drivers will earn much less, for example.Some gig economy firms such as Deliveroo have set up hardship funds for their riders but there are problems here too.Some riders have reported that they aren’t able to access the fund because they require a sick note, which they cant obtain because people with coronavirus symptoms or who are self-isolating are told not to go to the doctor.The government announced in the Budget last week that people could get confirmation of their illness through the NHS 111 helpline but Deliveroo says the government has not actually made this available yet, leaving some riders with no income and no access to the hardship fund.The Independent Workers’ Union of Great Britain is demanding gig economy companies grant workers full sick pay without preconditions.Following sustained pressure from the Labour Party, the government announced emergency legislation on Wednesday\u0026nbspto ensure that renters are not evicted as a result of being unable to pay rent because of the pandemic.However, this still means people unable to work may fall into arrears through no fault of their own.\u0026nbspBenefit charity Turn2Us is calling for the government to increase universal credit payments to help cover rent costs while Jeremy Corbyn wants the government to suspend rent payments during the pandemic.Labour leadership candidate Rebecca Long-Bailey has called for a universal basic income – an unconditional payment made to every citizen – to help people, including renters.Given that the chancellor announced a three-month mortgage holiday for anyone struggling to make repayments because of Covid-19 he will remain under pressure to give renters equal leeway.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

We know that many schools have already drawn up plans to do exactly that and are well ahead of the curve.“However, this is an exceptionally demanding situation and they will need support.

So it is not a safe environment for those teachers to be there.”On decisions to partially close, she added: “We are hearing that some schools are keeping open for key workers’ children, but also children on free school meals and children who they feel are vulnerable.“It has really ramped up in the last couple of days.”Many parents had already begun withdrawing\u0026nbspchildren from school this week. Dr Bousted described the school drop-off in London on Wednesday as being like a “ghost town”.Fiona Boulton, chair of the Headmasters’ and Headmistresses’ Conference (HMC), which represents the most prestigious private schools, added that it had\u0026nbspbecome “increasingly difficult” to stay open.Ms Boulton, head of Guildford High School, said:\u0026nbsp“Heads who have had to close their schools have done so with a heavy heart because normal operations have become unsustainable and their pupils are better served by moving to online learning.\u0026nbsp“Some will be able to keep their doors open to key workers, according to their resource.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The new Magic Keyboard for iPad Pro – which includes the trackpad, and will be compatible with last year\u0027s iPad Pro too\u0026nbsp– will be available in May.The new iPad Pro starts at £769 for the smaller 11-inch model, or £969 for the 12.9-inch one, and each has more expensive options that add cellular connectivity and more storage. The new keyboard costs £299 for the smaller version or £349 for the bigger one.The new trackpad required Apple to re-write its iOS operating system for the iPad, Apple said. The new system does not take the traditional pointer system from the Mac but rather allows people to see items highlighted as they move through menus.It will work with other pointing devices like Apple\u0027s own mice and Magic Trackpad, as well as third-party ones.Apple shuts all stores outside of China because of coronavirus“We’re making\u0026nbspiPad\u0026nbspeven more capable and versatile by bringing trackpad support to\u0026nbspiPadOS,” said said software boss Craig\u0026nbspFederighi in a statement.“We carefully considered the best way to integrate trackpad use into a touch-first environment while retaining everything our customers know and love about\u0026nbspiPad. We’re thrilled to bring this new way of interacting with\u0026nbspiPad\u0026nbspto the millions of people using\u0026nbspiPadOS\u0026nbsptoday.”\u0026nbspAs well as adding the trackpad, the new keyboard includes the ability to adjust the angle of the keyboard, and backlights for the keys.The 3D scanner, which uses LiDAR technology, allows the new iPad Pro to measure the distance to objects that are up to 5 meters away, and works both indoor and outdoors. Apps will be able to use the data from it to improve the augmented reality features that are already in iOS, Apple said.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But what I’ve been told is: Number one, the doctors are getting new information about this novel coronavirus. It’s new, that means we’re learning about it and the symptoms that present. That’s thing one,” Guthrie said.“And the other thing is, if you’re sick at all, the CDC is saying this is the time to stay home. You know me, I like to come rain or shine, spread my germs around, but we don’t do that anymore. We stay home and we keep everybody safe. I think of it as a way of loving your neighbour.

This is what we call responsible social distancing.“I went to the doctor’s yesterday to check myself out, just to make sure, and he gives me the all-clear to go to work and I’m getting ready to do it – and then I start hearing these inconsistent messages from everyone.”The host, who had pneumonia last year, explained that she decided she shouldn’t go into work as long as New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and New York Governor Andrew Cuomo agree on plans.De Blasio has floated the idea of a shelter-in-place order for the city. Cuomo said on Tuesday he wasn’t interested in local quarantines but hasn’t ruled them out.On Wednesday, De Blasio said he was “almost to the point” of recommending a shelter-in-place order to Cuomo.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The following morning, she received a phone call asking more questions, and requesting she give a blood sample for screening. She checked out.At 8am on Monday the 43-year-old, who has two teenage children, Ellie and Hayden, was the first of 45 volunteers from the Seattle area to be injected in the upper left arm with a drug its developers believe could help beat Covid-19. Nothing is certain, the outcomes are unknown. But Haller and the other volunteers are happy to be playing their part.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“I think we all feel so helpless,” Haller tells The Independent, when asked why she was so willing to take part. “And this was a great opportunity to try and make a difference. I’m so thankful that I have this opportunity. It’s a privilege to be healthy, and to have a job that is flexible enough to let me do this.”\u0026nbspHaller is a small but crucial part of a global effort to confront the coronavirus, that has upended lives, threatened economic ruin, confined people to their homes, and, perhaps, take stock of what in our lives we ought most to value.Created with Sketch.Before and after photos show impact of coronavirus around the world Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.1020 Gateway of India, Mumbai1320 Church of the Nativity, Bethlehem1020 Gateway of India, Mumbai1320 Church of the Nativity, BethlehemAs of Wednesday, global infections reached 215,000 and the death toll raced past 8,880. Across the world, stock markets are in free-fall, and governments are struggling to enforce measures to “flatten the curve”.A light at the end of what could be a very long tunnel would be a vaccine to effectively treat the disease and allow life to try and return to normal. Experts point out the disease has disrupted and devastated life in way we are struggling to conceive. But so once did diseases such as measles, polio, smallpox and tuberculosis.Reports suggest as many as 35 pharmaceutical firms, some aided by grants from government or philanthropists are involved in the hunt for a vaccine for Covid-19. These firms are part of a massive industry and a vaccine market said to be worth $35bn.The trial in which\u0026nbspHaller is taking part involves a drug developed by Moderna, a biotechnology firm based in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Another trial, involving a drug developed by Pennsylvania-based Inovio Pharmaceuticals, could start next month. A German firm, CureVac, is said to be working on a potential vaccine, one the Trump administration reportedly tried to buy.“They are all racing against the disease, rather than against each other,” says John Tregoning, an expert in infectious diseases at Imperial College London.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Also, it will help with the ability to produce as many as nine billion vaccines.”The trial underway in Seattle, backed the national institutes of health (NIH) and Kaiser Permanente Washington Research Institute, involves a drug called\u0026nbsp​mRNA-1273.“Over the past few years, we have demonstrated its potential in vaccines across more than 1,000 subjects in our clinical trials,” Moderna says. “This includes successful early-stage (Phase 1) clinical trials against five other respiratory viruses (two pandemic influenza strains, RSV, hMPV, and PIV3). Over the last four years, we have started 9 clinical trials for mRNA vaccines.”It adds: “We had previously collaborated with the NIH on a vaccine for MERS-CoV, which is a different type of coronavirus than the current pandemic. While the programme was only at the research stage, it provided significant insights.”Experts point out one of the reasons there is much excitement about what is happening in Seattle, is that unlike many previous vaccines,\u0026nbspmRNA-1273 does not involve a sample of the actual virus. Rather, with input from Chinese authorities about the genetic sequence of the coronavirus first detected in the city of Wuhan, it makes use of so-called messenger RNA molecules.\u0026nbspThese instruct the body to produce its own immune response to fight again the coronavirus. It means those taking part in trials are not exposed to the virus, and could theoretically speed up the process of identifying a vaccine.“We don’t know whether this vaccine will induce an immune response or whether it will be safe. That’s why we’re doing a trial. It’s not at the stage where it would be possible or prudent to give it to the general population.”In what critics have said is a succession of factual errors about the coronavirus and its threat to the US and the world, Donald Trump told reporters a vaccine could be produced within “weeks”One of his top health officials, Anthony Fauci, director of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases, was soon obliged to pour cold water on the president’s claims.“The whole process is going to take a year, year-and-a-half at least,” he said. “I don’t want to overpromise.”Tregoning, of Imperial College London, says there is a very strict protocol that is followed with developing potential vaccines, despite, or perhaps because of, the pressure to move too quickly. As such any drug can only be made available after approval of a national licensing body or else the World Health Organisation.\u0026nbspCoronavirus: What is herd immunity and is it a possibility?Israeli spyware firm builds software to map Covid-19 patient movementInfluencer Arielle Charnas tells followers she has coronavirus “What we don’t want is something making the situation worse,” he says.Haller, 43, who works for a tech start-up and who said her children think its “cool” she is taking part, has been asked to write a daily journal and speaks on the phone with one of the Kaiser team most days.Every week, she needs to give a blood sample, and in a month she will receive the second dose of the vaccine. The 45 volunteers, all aged 18 to 55, have been split into three groups, with different strengths given to each.\u0026nbspThe monitoring will last a year, but Moderna says safety data would be available a few weeks after the injections were given.\u0026nbspA Moderna official told the New York Times if the drug appears safe it will ask the food and drug administration (FDA) for permission to move ahead to the next phase of testing to assess its effectiveness. That would involve a larger number of volunteers.For now, Haller is going about her life, hoping her efforts can help not just her fellow Americans, but people around the world.“It’s wild,” she says. “It’s incomprehensible to me right now, but I am so thankful to be part of it.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

But it is the universal $2,000 payment that sticks out as truly radical.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“Bottom line here: workers need to continue to get a paycheck, even when their businesses are shut down,” said Mr Sanders.“Further, we need to provide a direct emergency $2,000 cash payment to every household in America every month for the duration of the crisis to provide them with the assistance they need to pay their bills and take care of their families.”How to be productive if you have to work from home during coronavirusWhich countries around the world has coronavirus spread to?The dirty truth about washing your handsShould you be taking paracetamol or ibuprofen to treat coronavirus?What are symptoms of coronavirus – and where has it spread?Mr Sanders, who is losing the fight for the Democratic nomination, then conceded that his plan is not likely to go anywhere.“Now, we’re throwing out a lot of ideas. And when you deal with the United States Congress, you don’t get everything that you want. There will be a picking and a choosing here and there.“But I think it’s important for us tonight to discuss the various options that they have, and one of those options is to make sure that people at least get a $2,000 a month cheque to take care of their basic needs.”Created with Sketch.Before and after photos show impact of coronavirus around the world Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.1020 Gateway of India, Mumbai1320 Church of the Nativity, Bethlehem1020 Gateway of India, Mumbai1320 Church of the Nativity, BethlehemThe proposal for what would essentially amount to a universal basic income has helped direct attention back to Mr Sanders’s onetime fellow presidential candidate Andrew Yang, who dropped out of the race after the New Hampshire primary.\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Once dismissed as a technocrat fantasy, it is now surfacing in proposals from people on all sides, from Mr Sanders to progressive congresswoman Ilhan Omar to former Trump administration press secretary Antonio Scaramucci.In his full written proposal, Mr Sanders expands on how the payments would work, calling for an effort involving “the IRS, the Social Security Administration, the Treasury Department, credit unions, community banks and other financial institutions”.He also acknowledges that not all Americans need the money, and carves out a different role for them: “For those who will not need their payments, we will partner with organisations to take donations from patriotic families who can contribute their payments to fighting the coronavirus pandemic.”Mr Sanders has fallen well behind Joe Biden in the race for the Democratic nomination, most recently losing primaries in Arizona, Florida and Illinois by wide margins. While conceding he is losing the race, he has so far declined to drop out many of his supporters want him to stay in to continue influencing Mr Biden and the Democratic Party more broadly.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

As a result of the attacks 192 health facilities were closed, of which only 34 were reopened. The Taliban denied responsibility for the attacks that Afghan authorities have blamed on their fighters.Afghanistan currently has 22 confirmed coronavirus cases, with concerns growing particularly over the danger of infections among the thousands of Afghans crossing the border with Iran: one of the worst-affected nations.The country’s woefully inadequate health system would undoubtedly be overwhelmed if the virus were to take hold. Moreover, after 18 years of war the government only controls about half of the country.The rest is either controlled or contested by the insurgents, who have agreed a peace deal with the United States but have yet to open talks with the government.Communities in ethnic Pashtun rural areas where the Taliban hold sway could suffer from the loss of access to health support in their villages as a result of past militant action.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Everyone in our village will be affected. If magic happens and helps the Taliban, then the Taliban can prevent coronavirus in our village.”Zabihullah Mujahid, another Taliban spokesman, said fighters were encouraging people to listen to health workers and messages broadcast by Mullahs, and would force anyone not obeying to comply.“Our Mujahideen are helping the health workers to spread out the messages about the dangers of Covid-19 among the public in our controlled areas,” he said.Religious scholars would also be consulted over whether gatherings in mosques should be suspended if the health scare intensified, he added.Trump to workers hit by coronavirus: ‘Money will soon be coming’A Taliban commander in southern Helmand province said the group would provide what services it could for people who became infected, but added that they neither had adequate facilities nor trained personnel to deal with an epidemic.Along with two other commanders that Reuters spoke with, he said the Taliban had clinics where sick or wounded fighters were taken for treatment.Otherwise, some Afghan non-government organisations are operating in insurgency-prone areas.Waheed Omer, an aide to President Ashraf Ghani, said he was still seeing reports of Taliban harassing health workers in some areas.“It should be stopped immediately,” he Tweeted on Wednesday.\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

So whats the latest advice on testing for the virus On March , there has been a major sht in the way potential Covid- sufferers are treated.Following an emergency Cobra meeting, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced that testing of mild cases will end.Before then, people were referred to test centres after phoning NHS .Those suspected of carrying the disease were advised to drive to a special testing site, or a hospital car park, where a nurse wearing protective gear would conduct the test in assessment pods.The NHS was also testing people at home for the virus to help contain the spread.But the government has changed its stance, and widespread testing will no longer be applicable.Hospital-testing onlyThe chief medical officer for England, Professor Chris Whitty had confirmed that the NHS will alter its approach to testing for coronavirus, with only those at hospitals to be formally examined.Testing in hospitals will be carried out on patients suffering from respiratory problems - and this will probably be extended to other conditions.On March , Prof Whitty originally said it was no longer necessary for us to identy every case.He has since defended the UKs new plans after the World Health Organizations advice is to keep testing.On March , Prof Whitty did say: We do intend to continue to scale up testing.He said tests only showpeople are currently sick or not, but not where or not someone had previously had the virus.Prof Whitty said that test would be transformational and that Public Health England was very rapidly developing such a test.Potential coronavirus sufferers experiencing mild symptoms are also being advised to us the NHS  online service.People have been advised against phoning the NHS  helpline unless their health begins to deteriorate, as the service is struggling to cope with demand.The Times says that public health is giving up on tracing every case.And those suffering mild symptoms, such as a high temperature of .C and above, or a new continuous cough, are being told to self-isolate for seven days rather than ask to be tested.Thats regardless of whether they have travelled to infected areas, such as Italy, Iran or China.An NHS spokesman told the Sun Online that people can still check their symptoms online, andtheyre otherwise fine, they dont need to go to hospital or be tested.He said its not known as yet what will happen to the special testing sites, but people dont just go to them anyway, they would have to be referred first.Health crisisOn March  it was announced by researchers at Imperial College London that drastic restrictions will be required for up to  months in order to save thousands of live.The new move came after the Goverments previous and more relaxed plans to try and mitigate the epidemic - but researchers then advised an estimated , people could have died.Since then, the PM has ramped up his battle plan.He said:Levelling with a worried nation in a dramatic No press conference, Boris said: Clearly what we’re announcing today is a very substantial change in the way we want people to live their lives, and I can’t remember anything like it in my letime.I don’t think there’s really been anything like it in peacetime.It’s a very considerable, psychological, behavioural change that we’re asking you, we’re asking the public, the nation to do.But I’ve absolutely no doubt that we can do it, that we can do it together.Testing for coronavirus looks for signs of infection in blood, other bodily fluids or secretions.There are a number of ways the virus can be tested.Testing for the virus comes with some minor side effects, including tingling and slight discomfort. These however, are temporary.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And you’d also hope they take more care than they did with the actual production, which started to betray a “will-this-do ” attitude with almost its first caption of the night.“Dermot Munaghan.” And the next one: “Colston Smith.” .A foretaste of what was to come, because the event had technically unravelled within the first hour when Lineker had to introduce a comedy sketch about VAR and the  World Cup final.First it appeared, then it vanished. So Lineker explained the punchline: VAR had not just found in England’s favour it had decided to award the  World Cup to Scotlandand Euro  to Wales.Then the sketch suddenly reappeared again and took six minutes to reach its bloody, teeth-pulling conclusion: “I’m going to change my name to Jamie VAR-dy.”In such circumstances, you can sit and hope the rest of Sport Relief moves, inspires and thrills with a perfect blend of laughter, compassion and entertainment.And I can also hope Scotland are going to win the next World Cup. It ain’t going to happen.Sport Relief is never ever over quickly, ’cos there are a whole load of BBC formats to be put through the ringer, like Line Of Duty, and far too much dancing, featuring everyone from Lineker and McGuinnes to a “social media influencer”, called “HRVY”, which wasn’t another spelling mistake. I think he’s just an RSHOL.At ious other points in this back-of-a-fag-packet evening: Hockey player Sam Quek took , football penalties against a short fat bloke, from point-blank range, and contrived to miss more than a quarter of them. Mel Giedroyc farted on a Question Of Sport special. Rylan accused Romesh Ranganathan of being over-exposed, before playing Andy Murray at crazy golf. And they flagged up an Action Line number, for people who were feeling “emotionally vulnerable”, after the Killing Steves parody, which may have been the most benevolent gesture in the event’s history.What really irks about Sport Relief, though, is that, evencompassion fatigue has never been more of a problem, they’ve decided it’s a triumph before it’s broadcast and the “Best Bits” Sunday show is all ready to go.Corporate backing also means there’s little risk of them not beating the previous total either, which, I hope, doesn’t sound like I’m diminishing the sincere efforts of the public.If there’s one thing I’ll remember about Sport Relief , however, it’s the contribution of David Beckham, who, infor a y advertorial for his new MLS franchise and some crashing product placement , offered two entire people the chance to attend an Inter Miami game and win a shirt signed by such global talents as Lewis Morgan and A J DeLaGarza, who’s played  entire games for Guam.There are moments when the generosity and humanity of celebrities simply overwhelms me.This wasn’t one of those moments.Bloke.CHANNEL  seemed to have all bases covered for its hugely entertaining new dating show Five Guys A Week, at least in terms of complete bellends.So, crammed into a semi-detached house in St Albans, hoping to win the heart of its owner Amy, it had: Christian, whose job “isn’t as glamorous as it sounds” . Uber-woke Glen, from accounts. A stuntman called Michael, who seemed to have mistaken the show for SAS: Who Dares Wins and voluntarily withdrew on day two. Mad, goggle-eyed surfer Trystan, who appeared to be casing the joint for a “kill room”. And the lowest form of le known to any single thirtysomething man – the bloke with the acoustic guitar, Scott, who used to be a bank manager, but now earns a living as a country and western singer and will be performing under the stage name Johnny Cashpoint,he’s got an ounce of sense.The five were chosen for their ability to get right on the viewers’ nerves rather than real boyfriend potential, obviously.And it made for a cracking hour of TV, because they all competitively fancied the pants off Amy, who looked like a younger and much hotter Camilla Parker Bowles,you can imagine such a thing.The show’s greatest strength, of course, is also its biggest format failing, as I’d imagine no one wanted any of them to win.In the event, however, it came down to a straight fight between the lesser of two evils and, probably wisely, Amy chose cocky Christian, who’s looking to whisk her off for breakfast in France, ahead of grovelling Glen, who, rather than looking for “the Michelle Obama to my Barack”, should probably be aiming for the Michelle Collins to his Ian Beale.Five Guys A Week, C, tonight, .pm.The Chase, Bradley Walsh: “What caused the cancellation of six Wimbledon championships in the s ”Tipping Point, Ben Shephard: “Which city in north-east England shares its common name with the body of a ship ”Spin To Win, Phillip Schofield: “What Saturday night TV show is Anton du Beke most famous for ”Hunted, Dan: “Who painted the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel ”LISA NANDY wasn’t born stupid. She volunteered to be, by standing for Labour Party leader.It means noisily backing every woke cause of the day, until their interests collide, as they did spectacularly on last Tuesday’s Good Morning Britain, where Piers Morgan hit her with two innocuous-sounding questions.“Are babies born either male or female ” and “Would you be happyUsain Bolt and Floyd Mayweather self-identied as women, spent a year having testosterone treatment and competed against women ”Correct answers: Yes and no.But Lisa couldn’t say that for fear of offending either the transgender or feminist lobbies.So instead she blathered, lied, evaded, shouted, demanded an apology from Piers , accused him of laughing and describing transgender people as “grotesque”and at one point muttered: “I don’t know what . . . I don’t know what, well, you know, I don’t know what.”Others would’ve let her off the hook at that point, as she was almost crying at her own stupidity by then. Chunk didn’t.To his eternal credit he ignored two ad breaks and kept up the pressure for a spellbinding  minutes that only ended when Nandy offered to settle the issue of whether Floyd Mayweather should be able to box women by “setting up a commission”.To which Piers responded: “It’s not a commission issue, it’s a common sense issue.”But that, as a wise man once said, is the problem with common sense, Piers. It’s not all that common.Ian Wright: “At this stage, I think three points is three points.”Jamie Redknapp: “Switching off from football is always beneficial sometimes.”Piers Morgan effectively ending Lisa Nandy’s Labour leadership bid on TV’s most consistently entertaining show, Good Morning Britain.Saturday night eye balm from BBC’s Ireland: Edge Of The World. Larry David ending up in the “ugly section” of Tiato’s restaurant, on Curb Your Enthusiasm.Sky’s Breeders managing to make a comedy about children bearable.And John Humphrys’ opening curveball on Saturday’s Celebrity Mastermind: “Name ” “Bez.” “Occupation ” Pass.This Morning, Holly Willoughby: “What should a ‘support neighbour’ look like  ’Cos my mum’s older than me.”Andyour mum isn’t older than you, self-isolate immediately.THIS week’s winner is Future Stewie, from Family Guy, and Chief Medical Officer Professor Chris Whitty.All those self-defined “experts” whose coronavirus response is framed not by their humanity or expertise but the desperate need to be proved right.Every selfish moron in the country being filmed panic-buying toilet rolls.Firebrand left-wing stand-up Guz Khan taking the gig economy advertising shilling from Uber Eats.The comically awful use of Photoshopped throwback pictures in BBC drama The Split.And the never-ending queue of fantasists and egomaniacs at E’s Sex Clinic, like third person-speaking Drew, who announced: “I’m not having vanilla sex.

You will be expected to start your day at the same time as you would normally arrive in your office or workplace, and finish at the same time.Although creating a solid routine when working from home is essential, it is important that the process doesnt become tedious. To stay on top of things you should take regular screen breaks - get up and stretch those muscles to avoid getting aches and pains. Research has shown that short breaks throughout the day are more beneficial than less frequent, longer breaks.If youre a sociable person by nature and miss the daily hustle and bustle of the office, being at home away from your pals can get you down. But being away from the office doesnt mean you have to skip your daily interactions with your friends. Pick up the phone and have a chat with your colleagues throughout the day, or Skype instead of sending an email when working on a joint project.When working from home, it may be dficult to separate work time from your own time and merge them as one.Whatever system you and your team communicate on, be sure to turn it off once your hours are complete.

Their kids will continue to get childcare throughout the Easter holidays too.It is the first nationwide school shutdown in modern history.The only similar move was when schools in London shut as pupils were evacuated at the start of World War Two.Education Secretary Gavin Williamson announced the move in the Commons at the same time as the Prime Minister at No .Boris Johnson promised the one million  and -year-olds due to take GCSEs and A-levels they will not be penalised.He insisted: “We will make sure their progress is not impeded.“We will make sure in time they get the qualications they need.”Parents will also get free meals or vouchers for .million children who qualy for school dinners.Mr Johnson also promised that schools already providing free meals will be reimbursed.He added: “I want to thank families for their sacrice at this dficult time. I want to thank the whole country for the efforts people are making to comply with these measures.”Quizzed on how long the school closures will last, the PM would only say: “We will try to keep it to an absolute minimum. I wish I could give you an answer for how long it is going to be.”He insisted schools are still safe places for key workers’ kids.And he explained their closure for most was because children, who suffer the least symptoms from the virus, can also be some of the most virulent spreaders.Mr Johnson said: “The objective is to slow the spread of the virus and we judge it is the right moment to do that.”He added: “Hitherto the advice has been that we should keep schools openpossible in order to reduce the pressure on the NHS and on all other public services.“But I have always been very clear that this is a balanced judgment and one that we have kept under constant review.“So looking at the curve of the disease and at where we are now — we think now we must apply further downward pressure on that upward curve by closing schools.”But he added childcare for key workers’ children is “crucial to make sure the critical parts of the economy keep ing.” Ministers will publish a full list of who has been designated a key worker today.Prince George and Princess Charlotte were sent home from their London prep school yesterday.The school closures were welcomed by teachers’ unions.National Education Union joint general secretary Kevin Courtney said: “It is better for this to take place in an ordered way than the chaotic pattern of closures that was developing”.The PM had faced a growing clamour to take action after countries around the world, including France and Italy, ordered a schools shutdown.Scotland and Wales had already announced schools would shut on Friday.Before the announcement many head teachers were being forced to shut or partially shut because so many staff were in self-isolation.The Harris Academy Trust partially shut  of its schools.Diverse Academies Trust said it had shut all  of its schools across Nottinghamshire and Lincolnshire.Paul Tarn, chief executive of Delta Academy Trust, which runs  schools, told The Sun they had been drawing up contingency plans in case they were told to only open for key workers’ kids.The chain is sending out , text books so pupils can study at home. It is considering keeping some schools open for longer hours and even at weekends to give extra support to key workers.Mr Tarn said: “Our teachers have been teaching extra classes — showing some proper British spirit.“We are taking a very strong line in doing our bit in support.”He added: “We want to make sure those workers out on the front line have support for their children at schools.”CAN you get time off workyour children’s school is closed Parents are entitled to take time off to look after children — and you can’t face disciplinary action or lose your job.This is known as “dependant leave” which allows time off to deal with an unexpected problem or emergency.The downside is that you may not be paid, unless your employer agrees to.You may be able to negotiate paid time off, but it is down to your employer.Workers may also be able to negotiate taking time off as holiday or lieu days.Your employer cannot make you work extra hours or make up the missed time.CAN you work from home or request flexible working The UK government has said everyone should work from home, where possible.This is only advice, so whether you are allowed to will depend on your employer.All employees have the right to request flexible working — not just parents.But you must have been with the same employer for at least  weeks.Employers must assess the advantages and disadvantages, as well as hold a meeting with you to discuss the request.Flexible working can include working from home, flexitime and job sharing.Employers can reject the request for a number of reasons, including costs to the business and getting your work covered."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus thinking revive blitz spirit","story":"People have lost loved ones and will continue to do so, and the virus is going to cause an unprecedented, global economic crisis that could see businesses go under, job losses, and severe financial dficulty for those already living hand to mouth.You’ll no doubt have read the latest bad news.So, solely for the purposes of this article, forgive me , instead, I focus momentarily on trying to find the admittedly few green shoots poking through the rubble.For, unlike Brexitwhich caused bitter ision among communities, the coronavirus pandemicis already bringing communities together that, in the modern age of “smart” devices absorbing our attention, had perhaps become slightly detached from each other in recent years.Professor Steven Taylor, author of The Psychology of Pandemics, says: “People need reminding that they can cope with this. They are resilient. You aren’t going to like it, but you’ll get through it.“You can compare it to the Blitz. People got through the Blitz. It was very stressful but they did it.”My elderly mother lives just a few roads away from me and, like so many with similarly vulnerable relatives, I’m making sure she’s OK.“Just pop a tin of Spam through the letterbox, and I’ll be fine,” she joked in reference to her time growing up during World War Two.But yesterday, three of her immediate neighbours — one of whom she’s never met — put notes through her door to say she should give them a callshe needed anything.In times of such crisis, our first thought is naturally of ourselves and our immediate loved ones.But it seems the upsideof the world slowing down and re-grouping might be that, no longer distracted by the busyness of our normal working days, we will “look up” and “reach out”, as they say in business circles, to those in our communities who might need help.There are plenty of people who already do sterling work in their area, but the onslaught of the coronavirus will perhaps lead to everyone now doing their bit.Quite right too. But the onus can’t solely rest on the shoulders of iniduals, so it’s only right the Government has stepped up to offer some practical help to businesses that will suffer throughout the coming weeks and months.Boris Johnson’s advice that people shouldn’t go to pubs cafes theatres etc is understandable in health terms, but will leave businesses facing a critical downturn in custom through no fault of their own.Yesterday, London restaurateur James Chiaini urged him to “crack open the war chest” and allow local businesses to stay afloat while simultaneously channelling efforts towards helping out in their immediate communities, and it seems that new Chancellor Rishi Sunak has listened.In James’s case, he has staff on hand and lots of food supplies, so instead of shutting down because there are no customers, he and other restaurants across the country could potentially now operate a batch-cooking and delivery service for those in need.Equally, the skill sets of many other businesses can be channelled into providing much-needed, state-funded help where it’s required.And the Government shouldn’t stop there. It should repurpose certain facilities too.Last week, it was reported that the £million Defence Medical Rehabilitation Centre in Loughborough, Leics, is currently seriously underused because only current personnel can access it and only  have done so in the past  months.Madness. At the very least, it should be thrown open to all injured veterans who currently have to go through the overstretched NHS.Or how about temporarily repurposing it as a treatment centre for anyone who could benefit from its facilities, thereby alleviating some of the pressure on local hospitals The Government is clearly in uncharted territory right now because it is dealing with an unprecedented situation.But a continuation of joined-up thinking on how best to get us through this critical phase in our history will ensure that Britain’s enviable “Blitz spirit” is encouraged and kept strong for as long as it needs to be.PRINCE Harry is now back behind the closed doors of his rented Canadian mansion, licking his wounds after his public humiliation at the hands of phone pranksters.During a chat with what he thought was climate change activist Greta Thunberg and her father, Harry pledged his support to the non-existent island of “Chunga-Changa” and failed to question why the hoaxers wanted to ship penguins to the North Pole when they’re actually native to the South Pole.Poor Harry.Still, it perhaps explains why, despite attending Eton, he got D at geography A level.Indeed, on all our faces in these challenging times.Heartfelt congratulations to her and husband Chris.FORMER All Saints star Nicole Appleton has given birth to her second child, a girl called Skipper, at the age of .“After hiding my pregnancy for the last nine months – which was so dficult and keeping her a secret from all my friends – I can finally announce our incredible news!” she wrote on Instagram.Fascinating.

sending shrapnel through the foyer killing himself and  innocent gig-goers in a terror attack that horried the nation.The haunting CCTV was released after brother Hashem Abedi, , was yesterday found guilty of mass murder over his part in the atrocity.Hashem, who was , miles away in Libya at the time of the blast, was the ringleader in the attack and helped his brother source nuts and bolts to pack into the IED.The monster denied he was a terrorist - but the Old Bailey heard how he was every bit as responsible as his older brother as he plotted further bloodshed across the world.Heartbroken families of the victims wept as jurors took less than five hours to convict him  counts of murder, one count of attempted murder encompassing the injured survivors, and conspiring with his brother to cause explosions.But there was fury as coward Hashem Abedi refused to appear in court for the verdict and avoided the dock to give evidence during the seven-week trial.Daryl Price, whose son John Atkinson, , was among those killed in the blast, said: The last few weeks have been draining, both mentally and physically, and when the jury read out their decision it felt like somebody had kicked me in the stomach.I was expecting it but it still knocked the wind out of me, I couldnt breathe for a few seconds.I am annoyed that he couldnt make an appearance in court to face those people whose lives he ruined.I had planned to go to London for the verdict, I wanted to look him right in the eye, but he is too much of a coward for that.During his trial, the Old Bailey heard how the sadistic brothers spent months hatching the bloodbath - using bank accounts of pals to buy chemicals online.The pair used their mums £-a-week benefit payments, which she continued to receive after she left the UK for Libya, to buy tools.They flew back to Libya when friends noticed signs they had been radicalised but just days before the attack, Salman Abedi ed to Manchester.Haunting CCTV caught him skulking around the arena at a Take That gig on a practice run.And Hashem Abedi, a former electronics student, continued advising him by phone — and is believed to have been the last person he spoke to when he stopped at a bench on his way to the gig.Salman later left for the nearby Arndale shopping centre where he bought batteries and a blue Kangol suitcase so he could move his bomb-making equipment to the flat he rented in Manchester city centre.He was then caught in chilling CCTV images with a rucksack packed with thousands of nuts just  seconds before the deadly blast.Salman Abedi waited for around an hour in the Manchester Arena foyer before parents and children left the gig at .pm.One minute later, he detonated the bomb as  people stood in the City Room - with  declared dead at the scene.Among debris found after the blast were , nyloc nuts,  flanged nuts,  plain nuts and  fragments from Salman Abedi and his victims.There were also screws recovered by investigators but they were so damaged they couldnt be counted.Images shown to jurors also feature charred clothing recovered from the scene and labels from vegetable oil used to make the bomb.Among other debris were fragments from a money tin decorated with the design of a £ note also used to maim innocent gig-goers.The youngest victim, Saffie-Rose Roussos, eight, suffered more than  external injuries, with  metal nuts in her body, and died from blood loss due to multiple injuries.Student Chloe Rutherford, , suffered more than  injuries, including a brain injury which would have left her immediately unconscious, the court was told.Jurors also heard Salman Abedis body was later recovered in four parts and he had to be identied by his DNA and fingerprints.Forensic investigators later found more than , nuts from the homemade bomb at the scene.After the blast, Hashem Abedi denied he was an extremist but the court heard his DNA was discovered in a Nissan Micra used to store packs of nails for the bomb.Saman Abedi was captured in CCTV footage ing to the car after his Take That practice run four days before the terror attack.The brothers were born in Manchester to Libyan parents and booked one-way tickets the country in April  after stockpiling chemicals used to make the homemade explosive.Salman Abedi then ed to his native Manchester on May  to carry out the atrocity.Hashem repeatedly denied any knowledge of his brother’s plot and suggested he had been conned into believing the bomb parts were for household use.He was arrested by Libyan authorities soon after the attack but an extradition bid proved dficult because of the civil war raging in the North African country.The Sun on Sunday revealed the extradition bid cost UK taxpayers £,.Detective Chief Superintendent Simon Barraclough said: If you look at these two brothers, they are not kids caught in the headlights of something they dont understand.These two men are the real deal, these are proper jihadis - you do not walk into a space like the Manchester Arena and kill yourself with an enormous bomb like that, taking  innocent lives with you,you are not a proper jihadist.He was with his brother throughout the entire process of making this explosive and building this bomb, I believe he provided encouragement right up to the end.This was all about the sick ideology of Islamic State and this desire for martyrdom.Victoria Higgins, from law firm Slater and Gordon, which represented  of the bereaved families, said after the verdicts: “Families have waited a long time to see Hashem Abedi face justice for his crimes and I think the overwhelming emotion for most will be one of relief that he cannot hurt anyone .“It has been incredibly painful for them to hear, in detail, what happened to their loved ones and the calculated way in which the Abedi brothers plotted to end their lives.”Abedi will be sentenced at a later date.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

A couple of hours in the morning and another one in the afternoon is plenty, although for young people sitting exams this year they may still need to do some evening work to keep up.Agree the timing for each child with them — and expect them to stick to it. Everyone needs to be dressed and ready when their morning start-time arrives.Near the end of each “work day”, spend a little time together planning the next day’s activities so everyone knows what they have to do.Older children will probably have at least some work set by their school to complete but younger ones can still be kept busy in ways that help them learn.Reading, writing, drawing, sequencing, sorting and ordering are all simple to manage and great for learning.Do not be fooled by so-called ‘‘educational’’ online games — most are not unless they really make kids think.Keep telly-watching for ­evenings. With many programmes, there is not a lot of learning opportunities unless an adult is inter- acting with the child — maybe by posing a challenge such as “How many X did you spot ”Puzzles are good. Old- fashioned board and card gamesare fun and work the brain.Look out for those that are easy to learn but hard to play well, such as draughts, Ludo, dominoes, backgammon and chess.Simply sorting Lego into piles or boxes according to size colour is a great activity. Collecting ten objects that they think will float and trying them in the bath helps them test their own ideas.Taking pictures or writing and drawing the results turns a fun activity into a proper experiment.Do not forget to work their bodies too —you have a ­garden then four ten-minute sessions to run, hop, skip, jump or throw or kick a ball around are essential.If kids need to be indoors, then source some keep-fit or dance sessions on YouTube to work on together. If all  fails, use up some energy by dancing to loud music.Expect the children to be more involved in household chores than usual — a family that pulls together in tough times is a strong family.Expect the kids to tidy up after activities, help with the cooking, take on laundry and offer care of younger siblings — maybe helping them with ­breakfast or reading stories.Be sure to praise when they do things right or try .::  Everyone washed, dressed,   fed and ready to begin. Discuss with each child their day’s work and what they need to show you at the end.::   Literacy. If older children have   work set by school, they should do that. Otherwise this is time for reading for pleasure or to practise writing. Older children could write a book report, begin a diary, plan a short story or email friends and relatives.::  Hop and pop. It’s important   to move your body, so make time for a -minute dance-and-fitness break. Whack up the radio and get moving.::  A -minute snack break,   ­followed by maths, science and numbers. If older children have work set by school, they should do that. Otherwise, activities such as sorting, creating sets, counting or sequencing are ideal.Younger children can play at shops with real or pretend money. Things such as number puzzles and working on a simple family budget could work well too.:: Movement challenge –  star jumps,  continuous bounces on a trampoline,  rope-skips, a five-minute “keepy uppy”, ten press-ups. Make it challenging for each child.::   Have a break for lunch and   some time to relax.::   Inidual project. Let the   child choose something they want to become an expert in, such as ­dinosaurs, Vikings, mini-beasts, transport or flesh-eating plants.

Boris Johnson said one measure being mulled over by the Government is a aposuniversal basic incomeapos as a temporary fix to help protect workers and ensure they have enough cash during the Covid- breakout, reports the Daily Mail. This comes after calls from Labour leadership contender and shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey who said a streamlined cash measure was needed with the pandemic yet to fully sink in for most people.In the meantime, amendments to the current Universal Credit system are also being toyed with by the Treasury, among a range of other measures - while some experts say GDP could plummet by a fth before .  The PM has already vowed to safeguard private renters from eviction due to the virus, with landlords barred from starting the ball rolling on evictions for at least  weeks. Across the Atlantic, Donald Trumpaposs administration could give the go-ahead for monthly , payments to every US citizen as part of an billion injection to keep the economy from sinking. On Tuesday, UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced a £bn package to help businesses stave off ruin as the country goes into semi-lockdown with social distancing likely meaning certain sectors could be decimated without proper Government support.This could otherwise lead to swathes of job losses, particularly in London where one in seven people work in the tourism, hospitality and leisure sector. There are also fears that Government loans and aid measures - amounting to a £bn boost - will only paper over the cracks and that grants are needed to ensure proper futures for those companies at risk, while some have called for national insurance to be halted and VAT bills deferred as well.And with OBR financial watchdog suggesting stopping council tax and getting the state to pay for utility bills, Mr Sunak urged employers to postpone lay-offs until the full package has been reviewed. Some, including Adam Marshall, chief executive of the British Chambers of Commerce, have said the level of cash handouts and rates holiday to smaller firms - as part of a £million injection - would be great, but said the money needs to get out quickly. While Paul Johnson, director of the Institute of Fiscal Studies, believes the business rates holiday is unlikely to allow bosses to target saving jobs. He said instead delaying employer national insurance contributions or delaying bumping up the living wage as well as increasing Universal Credit Allowances could be needed.CBI boss Carolyn Fairbairn has suggested VAT be axed to free up £ billion, and that national insurance be reversed. The banks, meanwhile, have given the green-light for a three-month mortgage holiday for those most at risk.

What no-one appears to have noticed is that the disease has got  times more expensive in the space of a week, and itaposs still in the post. We have had more than  months’ warning of the tidal wave coming our way. To start with, it was dismissed as just another flu, then blamed on bats, and finally an economic headache for eBay traders alone.But we were thick, and we were slow. Today that wave is roaring up the Thames, where after sucking a few poor souls to an early grave it’s going to wipe out those bits of the City still at work.Our economyaposs biggest contributors are services, manufacturing, construction, and tourism. Theyaposre all in shutdown. The governmentaposs big idea is to save them by bailing out the bosses - big and small - but they are ignoring the real problem. The vast majority of us may outlive the virus, but every single survivor is going to be violently mugged afterwards. The Prime Minister and Chancellor say it’s a bump in the road and we’ll be over it in  months. Medics say it’s more likely to be - months. Imperial College London says we won’t be in the clear for  months, or as long as it takes until there is a vaccine. If £bn was all it took when they thought there’d be a couple of weeks of it, and £bn had to be magicked up for  months, then the back of this beermat says that for a year and a half you’re looking at £. TRILLION of government bailout.Or four times what the banking crash cost us in . And remember - that’s just for businesses. Never mind the knock-on costs of healthcare, unemployment and sickness benefit, lost tax revenue and an economy that needs restarting.  It’s also a conservative estimate, considering our annual GDP is at the moment £.tn. Of course, it won’t be next year.After the -month mortgage holiday, the mortgage still has to be paid. After the government-backed, low-interest loan, it has to be ed, with interest. And after you’ve handed out a load of cash to every business owner from Richard Branson down to the local pub landlord, you may find they did not use it in the manner you hoped.The Daily Mail’s economic editor Alex Brummer wrote today:  “The lack of directly-paid support for employees, as outlined above, may prove to be an economic and political mistake. Relying on the kindness of bosses to keep paying wages on borrowed money, for a long time, is placing too much trust in their hands.” He added: A further package of measures which directly places cash into the pockets of British citizens would feel more real than promises of mortgage holidays and access to benefits.”Hooo-weee. Is this a call for a universal basic income I see before me, and in the Daily Mail of all places   But suddenly, the sort of radical socialism even Jeremy Corbyn didn’t have the blind optimism to put in his manesto is looking like a credible idea. There is no other way for the nation to get through an indefinite period of economic shutdown. The average Brit owes £, on credit cards. Mortgage holidays mean the banks will lose billions of guaranteed income. Rent holidays mean landlords default on mortgages, and we all stop servicing our debts the whole Tower of Banking Babel will fall. If staff are paid, rates are eased and tax takes a holiday, businesses can be mothballed. But customers cannot hibernate from this crisis -staff stop being paid, they stop being customers where. Take nursery schools. Fees are paid in advance for each term, so staff get paid regardless of how few toddlers turn up. But the new term starts on April , and how many parents, then, will be sending their children  How many nursery staff will still be in a job in a month’s time, and how many parents will be unable to go back to work   Fighting coronavirus is hard enough. But the real issue is how people get back on their feet afterwards. Chicken soup might get you out of bed, but it won’t pay the bills. If you don’t have a job, are on unpaid leave, are one of the .m self-employed whose savings just went up in smoke, you won’t be able to patronise the pub, shops and other businesses that just reopened.And the chances are this won’t be a -month thing. In China, factories are reopening, but m in-country migrants that form a massive part of its workforce havenapost turned up. When they do, there is a very real risk of a new wave of infections, and a new lockdown. In , the Spanish flu showed its head early in the year then ed with a vengeance in winter. If covid- does the same, we could be facing repeated global shutdowns until NEXT spring. If last weekaposs £bn looks puny and ineffective now, imagine how piddling £bn will look by then. Boris Johnson’s fiscal stimulus is, at present, the equivalent of offering half a paracetamol to someone who needs a ventilator. Itaposs just not enough. Itaposs not aposwhatever it takesapos, because what it is taking is the piss.At Prime Ministeraposs Questions today Labour MP Kevin Brennan said: On the matter of aposwhatever it takesapos, it takes more than a  word slogan, is what I would say to the Prime Minister. And in this case it actually takes a bit of war socialism we need to get money into the pockets of the workers. Has he seen Early Day Motion , which I proposed, about bringing in a temporary universal basic income to support workers and get money where it’s actually needed The PM replied: I hear the honourable gentleman loud and clear… and of course that is one of the ideas that will certainly be considered.First the Mail , and now this. A Thatcherite, Eurosceptic, Commie-bashing Tory PM, saying heaposs considering a universal basic income. Well Iaposll be...Of the  MPs who have signed that motion so far, none are Tory or Lib Dem. But that will change, when they start to see the price of not doing it.With a guaranteed amount in the bank every month, people can still feed their families. They can pay some,not all, of rent and mortgage costs, and when the shutdown ends theyaposll have the wherewithal to begin spending again. The government, too, wonapost have an expensive backlog of benefit claims to deal with. The only way for a nation to keep its head above water is for its citizens to each have a le jacket. The government is already the insurer of last resort, and faces a bill of trillions to mop up this mess.

The children of key workers and those most in need will still be able to go in, the Government said – but it was not clear how this would work. Most pupils will notthis school year in an escalation in the Government’s coronavirus response. It came as the UK death toll climbed to  as another  people in England and one in Scotland died. And it emerged a lockdown of London is planned as early as next week as the infections race ahead in the capital. Multiple sources told the Mirror they expected restrictions to be hugely tightened, with businesses closed and restrictions on travel.  A senior Government source signalled it could come within days, saying: “It’s not going to happen today or tomorrow.” It took London’s City Hall by surprise, with a source saying: “We haven’t heard anything on this – this lack of information doesn’t sound like the best way to govern in a national emergency.” A mobile mortuary was set up in the capital to cope with expected deaths from the disease. But there was hope with news that a “game-changer” test to seean inidual has developed antibodies to tackle the virus is “coming down the track”. Announcing the closure of schools, nurseries, childminding services and colleges from tomorrow, Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said: “They will remain closed until further notice. This will be for all children except to those of key workers and children who are most vulnerable.” From Monday all schools will be expected to open but only the children of key workers and those classed as vulnerable will be allowed to attend. Over the next two weeks headteachers will work out the best way to run a skeleton operation, with some teachers and children being asked to go to a dferent school than usual. But the head of the NUT union said the announcement left “more questions than answers”. The move will radically change le for almost nine million children, millions of parents and more than , teachers across the UK. The Prime Minister said exams will be cancelled but the government would ensure pupils get the qualications they need. However, he did not say how or what form that would take. Thousands of students will have university or college offers dependent on their A-level results. Clare Marchant, boss of universities admissions body UCAS said plans had already been put in place for this scenario. But it remained unclear how the new system would work with some teachers worrying that relying on predicted grades would disadvantage worse-off families. GMB chief Rehana Azam said: “More detail is urgently needed.”  Scottish leaders said there is no guarantee schools there would reopen before the summer. Schools in Wales will be re-purposed to help “people in need”.

Schools in Wales close on Friday “at the latest”in Scotland they shut by the end of the week. They close in Northern Ireland from Monday. Special schools, private schools and nurseries shut too. Who will look after the children  Millions of children will be sent home meaning in most cases, parents will stay home to care for them. Asking elderly relatives to help out is not an option as over-s are at risk. Employers will be expected to make allowances for working from home.  Which children can attend school  Children of key workers which include NHS staff, police, social care workers and delivery drivers. A full list will be published today. “Vulnerable pupils” will also be asked to turn up - meaning those who either have a social worker, or an education, health and care plan. What about kids who have exams  All GCSE, AS- and A-Level exams are to be axed. The PM said pupils would get the qualications they need. Options include teachers submitting predicted grades. Thousands will have university or college offers dependent on results. Primary school SATS will be cancelled for Year  children. Teachers have to draw up home lesson plans. What happenskids get free meals  There will be vouchers for children eligible for free school meals.

Millions of British children will be sent home - meaning their parents are forced to stay home too to care for them. And sending children to live with grandparents is not an option because they are most at risk from COVID-. It will radically alter millions of parentsapos lives - and mean GCSEs and A-levels are cancelled leaving millions of teenagers in limbo. But not all children are being told to stay away from school. Those of key workers - including police, NHS workers and delivery drivers - will still attend. The move was announced today as UK cases soared by  in a day to ,. The government admitted the virus was spreading more quickly than anticipated and needed drastic action. Here is everything you need to know.When are schools shutting in each region  Schools in England will operate this Friday and then shut their gates from the end of the school day. The below details mostly concern schools in England but many of them will also apply to other regions. Schools in Wales will close on Friday at the latest. The Welsh government said: From next week, schools will have a new purpose. They will help support those most in need, including people involved in the immediate response to the coronavirus outbreak. Schools in Scotland will also close by the end of the week. Schools are to close across Northern Ireland from Monday - with the potential to remain that way until summer.Are all schools affected  Yes. But the government hopes no schools will shut entirely, at least not at first. All schools will shut their doors to most pupilsfrom Friday. The Department for Education hopes all schools will remain open for some pupils . However, officials accept that as the virus takes hold, it may not be possible for some schools to remain open at all. Itaposs understood all schools will be told to stay open for at least two further weeks , which will give them time to work out alternative arrangements. This could give time to allow, for example, some schools to remain open and take another schoolaposs pupilsit has to shut. What about sixth form colleges, FE colleges and universities  Sixth form and Further Education colleges will also close from Friday.Universities however are not being told to close - although many suspended face-to-face teaching last week. Are all children affected   No. Children of key workers will still be told to go into school. Key workers include NHS staff, police and delivery drivers. That is not the exhaustive list of key workers and those three job titles are just examples. A full list of aposkey workersapos will be published by the Cabinet Office on Thursday. Vulnerable pupils will also be asked to turn up to school. That means children who either have a social worker, or an education, health and care plan.  No, not especially. Research so far suggests the younger you are, the less likely you are to have complications from COVID-. The death rate is tiny for the under-s. Chief Scientic Advisor Sir Patrick Vallance said children often wonapost even know theyaposve had the virus. The problem is thatall children are going to school they spread the virus more quickly and could pass it to their families and wider society. This is about a measure to protect all of us. Itaposs not a measure because thereaposs some specic risk to children, he said. Can I leave my child with their grandparents   No, notyou can help it. Older people are more at risk from the virus and the over-s, or people with underlying health conditions, have been warned to be particularly strict with social distancing. Boris Johnson urged parents not to leave children in the care of grandparents or older relatives who are at higher risk of becoming seriously ill with coronavirus. What will happen to GCSE and A-level exams   They will be cancelled. Exams will not take place as planned in May and June, Boris Johnson said. The Prime Minister said the government would ensure pupils get the qualications they need. However he did not say how or what form that would take. Thousands of students will have university or college offers dependent on their A-level results. We will make sure their progress is not impeded as a result of the decision weaposre having to take now, Mr Johnson said. It is possible universities could use predicted grades,they resume as normal in September, but this is not confirmed. Whatmy child gets free school meals   The Government will put in place a national voucher system for children eligible for free school meals. The exact details of this voucher system - including how to redeem vouchers, where and whether they are online or on paper - have not been confirmed yet. Details will only be issued in the coming days. It is thought this applies to children who receive means-tested free school meals in low-income families, rather than infant school pupils who receive them universally. However, we are double checking this with the government. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said the government has not ruled out making extra payments from the DWP to make up for the loss, but the first step was a voucher system. Asked for more detail Mr Williamson said: In order to make sure that every child who is eligible for a meal is able to access it we are moving to issue vouchers to every eligible child immediately from next week. I would like to progress to a stage where in some schools there are meals provided, but that depends on staffing in those schools. Will all teachers still have to go to work  We have asked the government to clary whether all teachers who are able to be in the school will be expected to. Naturally, some teachers will be unable to attend due to the need to self-isolate or due to illness. Itaposs thought the nature of teachersapos work - whether they will be teaching lessons to pupils who turn up, or whether it will essentially be a childcare- will be at the discretion of head teachers.

Boris Johnson may have acted with the best intentions but telling people to avoid pubs, restaurants and other meeting places has been a disaster for the retail and hospitality sectors. The Government is promising to announce a package of support in the next few days to protect workers during this challenging time. A better course would have been to have put these measures in place at the same time as the new guidelines. This is not just an economic priority but a social one. Many low-paid workers may face the choice of losing their incomethey stay at home or soldiering on to work where they risk either falling ill or infecting others. We should be following the example of Denmark, Norway and Austria where the state has agreed to underwrite the cost of salaries making sure people stay in work. Next, the Government must raise sick pay and improve support for the two million who earn too little to be entitled to it. Ministers must also raise benefits, end the five week wait for Universal Credit and offer support for those most in need. The virus does not discriminate so the Government should not discriminate in who it helps. In a bow to the inevitable yesterday it announced schools will close from tomorrow. This is not a decision taken lightly when it will cause disruption to millions.

Derek Nally, , and Gemma Stubbs, , were set to tie the knot on Saturday,  years to the day they first met. But they have now decided to cancel due to the flu-like virus which is now causing a global health emergency.  Derek, who is from Great Barr in Pheasey, West Midlands, said the realisation their big day might not go ahead dawned on them after Prime Ministeraposs press conference on Monday, where he asked the country to begin practising social distancing. That was the moment we realised we would have to rethink, he explained.Follow our LIVE blog for updates on the coronavirus outbreak We could have put a buffet out and people could look around and think ‘I’m going to get coronavirus’. Also the photographer is pregnant. She was originally quite happy to go forward, but when they said that pregnant woman was at risk, she cancelled.

They had chosen their wedding day to coincide not only with the anniversary of their first date in , but seven years since Gemma said aposyesapos to Derekaposs proposal in August . The couple - who have three children - were first introduced by Gemmaaposs mother, who met Derek at a social club he used to run. I met her mother first and we got on very well and she brought her daughter in to meet me, Derek continued. Weaposre broken. It has hit us both pretty bad. I think last night when we threw in the towel, there was a sense of relief, but also the realisation that all our hard work has been for nothing. I’m not going to say I’m depressed and ready to jump off a bridge, but it is definitely affecting my mood. I tried to tell my mum last night and she was in bits. Just thinking about it again has given me goosebumps.  But the couple are taking it all their stride and say they have no hard feelings. The people we spoke to have been really understanding of the situation - I have to give them credit, Derek said. They have offered not to charge us againwe can find a day that works for all of us. I definitely don’t blame the government. They are trying to put a plan in place for something that’s never happened before. When the advice was ‘wash your hands and sing happy birthday’, I was over the moon.

The poignant image shows the man looking down at a shopping list in front of bare shelves in his local store in Epsom, Surrey. Other shocking images of pensioners looking for food in supermarkets with limited supplies have also circulated on social media. Lauren Taylor, , who took the photo of the gentleman, said she hoped the picture would kick the public into action to take care of the elderly. The mum-of-two explained that multiple aisles on the supermarket had limited supply. She said: It was awful and just really sad. That was only one aisle and the others were in a similar state of empty shelves. People were grabbing lots of the stuff that were still on the shelves. Itaposs really just sad and disappointing in society that itaposs got to this point. Everyone needs stuff, but he had been left with nothing. Supermarket giants have moved to limit the number of crucial items people can buy. Tesco said shoppers will be limited to buying just three products per line from Thursday. Chief executive Dave Lewis added all counter services will close, to free up staff to restock shelves, and a priority hour will be launched at larger stores between am and am every Monday, Wednesday and Friday. Stores that previously opened  hours, will also now close at pm each evening.  The move follows similar measures by Sainsburyaposs, Aldi, Asda and Morrisons, to ease stockpiling pressure amid the Covid- outbreak. Sainsburyaposs revealed it will only allow customers to buy a maximum of three of any single item, while Morrisons said it is limiting purchases across , lines. Asda also announced it is restricting shoppers to three items on all food and closing its cafés and pizza counters, while temporarily reducing the opening hours of all its -hour stores for re-stocking. Aldi has already introduced limits of four items per shopper across all products.  Tesco boss Mr Lewis wrote to staff on Wednesday: It is fair to say that we find ourselves in uncharted waters. Covid- is bringing a change to the UK and itaposs clear that lots of things are going to have to sht around in order to help us cope.At Tesco, we have been doing everything we can to keep business as usual, but we now have to accept it is not business as usual. In the last two weeks, we have seen signicant and prolonged increases in demand across all of our stores and this is leading to shortages in some products for some customers. It comes as Britainaposs supermarket chains are also launching action to help elderly and vulnerable customers, while ramping up operations to meet surging demand for home deliveries.  Sainsburyaposs became the latest group to offer priority home delivery slots to elderly and vulnerable customers, as well as exclusive shopping hours. Its supermarkets will only open to these two groups for the first hour of trading on Thursday, chief executive Mike Coupe said, but will open for an hour longer so other shoppers do not miss out. Sainsburyaposs Local convenience stores will not offer the service. Supermarkets have seen a huge rise in demand for delivery services, with no slots available until next month for both Tesco and Waitrose in some parts of the south east. The surge came as Transport Secretary Grant Shapps authorised a temporary relaxation, until April , of the driversapos hours rules to help deliver goods to stores across the country. The government has advised the British public to:Avoid pubs, clubs, restaurants and all social gatherings Cease all unnecessary travelEveryone should work from home where possible Mass gatherings and sporting events have been cancelled Avoid “all but essential travel” to more than  countries If one person in any household has a persistent cough or fever, everyone living there must stay at home for  days Pregnant women, those over , and people with certain health conditions have been asked to stay at home for  weeks Schools will remain open  A Department for Transport statement said the relaxation applies only to drivers supplying food and essential products to supermarkets. The statement added: This includes the movement of such goods from importers, manufactures and suppliers to distribution centres. It does not apply to drivers undertaking deliveries directly to consumers. Iceland outlets across the country have also introduced reserved time slots to give the vulnerable and the elderly a chance to shop in store. Sainsburyaposs said customers over  and those with a disability will have priority access to online delivery slots from Monday, and the chain is also expanding its click and collect service.

Criminal trials are also to be put on hold as part of the ongoing efforts to delay the spread. In a statement issued late on Tuesday, it was announced that the Lord Chief Justice Lord Burnett - the most senior judge in England and Wales - has decided no new trial should start in any Crown Court unless it is expected to last for three days or fewer. As a result, cases longer than three days that were due to start before the end of April will be postponed.A statement read: “Given the risks of a trial not being able to complete, the Lord Chief Justice has decided that no new trial should start in the Crown Court unless it is expected to last for three days or less. “All cases estimated to last longer than three days listed to start before the end of April  will be adjourned. “These cases will be kept under review and the position regarding short trials will be revisited as circumstances develop and in any event next week.

Despite the doom and gloom surrounding the deadly pandemic, with London said to be on the verge of going into complete lockdown, there are some good news stories emerging to give people hope.The game-changer new antibody test to see who has already contracted and recovered from coronavirus but not shown symptoms is not far away, according to Boris Johnson.The PM said someone who has already had the virus will feel confident - thanks to the test - they are most unlikely to get it again and canto work. So for an economic point of view, from a social point of view, it really could be a game-changer. The Governmentaposs chief scientic adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said Public Health England is currently undertaking in-house testing and is looking at ways of getting the much more widespread version out.Hopes that the experimental drug remdesivir could cure patients have been raised after a -year-old Italian man who had testedpositive was given the all-clear following treatment. The broad-spectrum antiviral is being tested in five Covid- clinical trials including by the US National Institutes of Health on  patients admitted to hospital after contracting coronavirus on board the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan. China, meanwhile, has recorded no new cases in Wuhan, where the virus first originated last year, or in the surrounding Hubei province.

As European nations crackdown on freedom of movement, and encourage people to work from home, what can you expectyou fall sick with the novel flu.Since the outbreak was announced in Wuhan, China, in December , medical professionals have been grappling to understand the virusaposs symptoms and how they can be treated, Somerset Live reports. Health experts say that the risk of becoming critically ill remains low and not everyone who contracts the virus will become ill. Those who do are likely to experience symptoms similar to that of a normal bout of flu. Now, the experiences of some of those that have recovered from the virus sheds some light on what we should prepare for. . Painful sinuses Painful sinuses are common when you get a fair few strains of a cold or the flu. Sinusitis can leave you feeling awful, both physically and mentally. Pain, most often paired with a dull pressure, generally occurs when your sinuses become inflamed and swollen. You may feel pain in your forehead, on either side of your nose, in your upper jaws and teeth, or between your eyes. While suffering with coronavirus, one man said that his sinuses were agony. Connor Reed, a resident of the Chinese city of Wuhan, is believed to be one of the first Brits to have caught coronavirus. Connor, who is originally from North Wales, contracted the virus in November  - a whole month before Chinese authorities officially announced the outbreak. After  days of feeling ill, recording his day-to-day le in his diary, Connor was treated at a hospital that diagnosed him as being one of the first people to get the new strain of coronavirus, Covid-. The -year-old English teacher described his symptoms starting out with just a snfle which he tried to medicate using hot whisky and honey, before succumbing to what he believed was the flu around a week in. In his diary he wrote: This is no longer just a cold. I ache all over, my head is thumping, my eyes are burning, my throat is constricted. He said his aposbones were achingapos and he had a aposhacking coughapos.  A few days later, the pneumonia had gone but he said he ached asIaposve been run over by a steamroller. My sinuses are agony, and my eardrums feel ready to pop. I know I shouldn’t but I’m massaging my inner ear with cotton buds, trying to take the pain away. Just a couple of days later, he reported feeling better. . Ear pressure As Connor discovered, another of the symptoms of coronavirus is pressure in the ears that make them feel ready to pop. But unlike Connor, you shouldnapost be pushing cotton buds into your ears to try and relieve the pressure - youaposll end up doing more harm than good. Because many of the virusapos symptoms are flu-like, this ear pressure is most likely to be caused by clogged up tubes in your ear thanks to all the nastiness of a virus inside your system. More scientically speaking, when the Eustachian tubebecomes clogged, you can feel fullness and pressure in your ear, as well as some muffled hearing and sometimes even earache. These ear congestion symptoms can also be caused by problems in your middle ear or the ear canal that affects the eardrum. So sometimes itaposs just a case of waiting for the virus to pass. . Thumping headache Again, a pounding or thumping headache is sometimes typical of a bad cold or the flu. But it can also be a symptom of other things too, such as tiredness, dehydration and even a lack of iron in your system.  So donapost go panicking straight awayyouaposve got a bit of a sore head. Make sure you drink plenty of water, get plenty of rest and try to relax. Take time away from your computer screen and avoid alcohol. Health experts are advising anyone suspected of suffering with coronavirus symptoms to take Paracetamol instead of ibuprofen, but keep yourself updated on all the latest NHS information, as things may change as more tests are done on the virus.. . Burning eyes The best way to describe the sensation of burning eyes is to compare it with the itchiness and irritation you would faceyou suffer with hayfever or other allergies. This kind of itchiness and irritation can also come about when you’re among smog, smoke, dust, mold and even animals. The only dference between these cases and the cases described by coronavirus patients, is the fact that the virus triggers this symptom and not an external factor like pets. . Constricted throat It seems as though patients suffering with COVID- experience a mixture of cold and flu-like symptoms, paired with typical symptoms of a small allergic reaction. A constricted throat can be due to swelling and inflammation, brought about after lots of coughing, which we know to be a common occurrence among coronavirus sufferers.  But a constricted throat can also be caused by an infection, allergic reaction, as well as a iety of other conditions. If you find yourself really struggling to breathe, swallow or find any lumps or bumps you’ve not seen before, you may need to be checked by a doctor immediately. So, it’s wise to keep monitoring your symptoms, in a diary like Connor, so you can see when things are beginning to change. . Aches all over It’s no secret that having a cold or a bout of flu normally comes with feeling achy. And coronavirus is no dferent.  Those falling ill with the virus have described aches and pains all over their body, not just as a result of blocked sinuses, ears or nose, but also in their arms, legs and chest too. Many people will find the current coronavirus outbreak a stressful time, too, and this stress and tension can also worsen these aches and pains. . Lungs that apossound like a paper bagapos If when you breathe, your lungs sound almost crackly, then this could be a sign of something more serious than just your average cold or flu. This sort of noise can often occurthe small air sacs in the lungs fill with fluid, as well as the air you’re breathing in and out. These air sacs filling with fluid can often happen as a result of pneumonia - which is a condition linked to coronavirus. If your breath sounds wheezy, this may be down to an inflammation of the bronchial tubes in your lungs. . Fatigue Another common symptom of Covid-, as well as cold, flu and many viruses in general, is feeling extremely tired or fatigued. Being told to rest is common when you’re ill, but feeling tired and not being able to sleep due to coughs and dficulty breathing, can make things all the more dficult. Jaimuay Sae-ung, , was the first Thai national to contract coronavirus in December last year. Despite having underlying health conditions, including a heart problem, Jaimuay survived the illness after doctors isolated her at a hospital in Thailand for treatment.  Her symptoms included a fever and a bad cough, but she developed pneumonia while in quarantine and her family were worried she may not survive. I only knewafter I came to the hospital, the mother of seven told Sky News. I felt a bit sad, a bit shocked, tired and fatigued and I couldnapost eat. Jaimuay said she argued with doctors and nurses at the hospital because she believed she didnapost need to stay there. After  days, her condition had improved and she was eventually discharged following two negative test results. . Lack of appetite Jaimuay also mentioned not being able to eat while suffering with coronavirus. The saying goes that you should feed a cold and starve a fever, so not managing to eat much may help to burn off coronavirus in the long run. Of course, those who are ill should be sure to keep their energy up. . A fever When coronavirus was first brought to people’s attention, a fever was one of the first symptoms to be on the look out for. It was later advised thatyou had been in contact with, or indeed lived with, anyone who had a fever, you should self-isolate. For some people, this is the only symptom of coronavirus they get. One young man, who did not want to be identied, is being treated for coronavirus in hospital after ing home from a short trip and noticing his temperature had risen, the Irish Mirror reports.  He told the RTE’s Claire Byrne Live show: “The only symptoms I had was, basically, the fever. I didn’t have any respiratory problem, any lung inflammation, any cough, any sneezing so was just the fever. “I actually feel great now. I had a fever for a couple of days and now from Friday, I don’t have any more symptoms and so I am just here in the hospital being tested for the virus. The man said he was a “little worried” but “not scared” and said he can not leave the hospital until two consecutive tests show he has tested negative for Covid-. He added: The only thing I would say is that it is boring, I am here and I just have to read, watch some movies and that’s the only things. Apart from that I am fine.” . Tight chest and coughing spells Another of the first symptoms of coronavirus to be identied, was a tight chest and persistent cough. Many scientists and health professionals have suggested that the water droplets passed through a cough or sneeze are the main cause of the virus spreading, which is why they have advised the entire population to wash their hands, cough and sneeze into a flexed elbow and use tissues wherever possible. Having these symptoms on their own has meant that some people with the virus have not considered the possibility that they may have Covid-. Those experiencing coronavirus symptoms, such as a cough or fever, should self-isolate for  days.You should stay at homeyou or or anyone in your household has a high temperature or a new and continuous cough - evenitaposs mild. Everyone in your household must stay at home for  days and keep away from others DO NOT go to your GP or hospital.Go to NHS.UK to check your symptoms and follow the specialist medical advice.Only call you canapost get online, you feel like you canapost cope at home, or your symptoms do not get better after the seven days. If you are pregnant you should call you have any concerns about yourself or unborn baby during self-isolation. Pregnant women are advised to contact their midwe, out-of-hours helplines or a maternity team who will provide information on whether you need to go to hospital.  Carl Goldman from Santa Clarita, who was on board the Diamond Princess cruise ship and later tested positive for coronavirus, said the virus aposhasnapost been that badapos. In an article for The Washington Post, he explained that he developed a fever and aposa bit of a coughapos during his flight back to America and was quarantined on his . I am in my late s, and the sickest I’ve ever been was when I had bronchitis several years ago. That laid me out for a few days, he said. This has been much easier: no chills, no body aches. I breathe easily, and I don’t have a stuffy nose. My chest feels tight, and I have coughing spells.  If I were at home with similar symptoms, I probably would have gone to work as usual. His treatment, he said, consisted of what felt like gallons and gallons of Gatorade. . Jet lag One coronavirus sufferer described her symptoms as feeling like jet lag - a temporary sleep problem that can affect anyone who quickly travels across multiple time zones. Your body has its own internal clock, or circadian rhythms, that sends signals to your body telling it when to stay awake and when to sleep. Similar to fatigue, the feeling of jet lag can make people feel that they’re not quite with it or even a bit spaced out. Bridget Wilkins, who lives in London, flew to Australia via Singapore for a friendaposs wedding last week - but is now quarantined in a hospital in Brisbane after testing positive for coronavirus.The -year-old said the symptoms she had suffered included a headache, a sore throat and tiredness.Without realising she had contracted the virus, she believed her symptoms were from jetlag after her long flight. Speaking to Australiaaposs NEWS she said she had still had symptoms but aposnothing more than thatapos. “There’s a lot of hype and hysteria on the news around coronavirus,” she said. “There should be. It’s very serious, particularly for the elderly and people with existing conditions. But I think we have to calm down, because for most people, like myself, it is just a long cold that we can shake off.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailSchools will remain open to the children of key workers - including NHS staff - despite countrywide closures to try and stop the spread of coronavirus COVID-.Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced that primary and secondary schools will shut their doors until further notice at the end of the day on Friday.However the government hopes that while they will be closed to most children, they will still open to look after kids of key workers, allowing them to carry on going to work. A full list of aposkey workersapos will be published by the Cabinet Office on Thursday. Vulnerable pupils will also be asked to turn up to school, believed to mean children who either have a social worker, or an education, health and care plan. Speaking at a press conference this afternoon, Johnson said it has become necessarily to take the next step to stop the spread of coronavirus, which has now claimed the lives of more than  people in the UK and thousands more around the world. He said: We must apply further downward pressure on that upward curve by closing the schools. Speaking about why some children will still be able to work, he said: We need to keep the NHS going and to treat the rising number of cases, so we need health workers who are also parents to continue to go to work.  And we need other critical workers with children to keep doing their jobs too, from police officers to the supermarket delivery driviers. We therefore need schools to make provision for the children of these key workers who will otherwise be forced to stay home. He also warned that children should not be left with older relatives or friends while the schools are shut.  Mr Johnson said the Government would try to keep the duration of school closures to an absolute minimum and intended to get things going again as fast as we can. Exams have also been scrapped. Speaking about the decision to close schools, Education Secretary Gavin Williamson told MPs he wanted to provide parents, students and staff with the certainty they need as he announced the closures.  After schools shut their gates on Friday afternoon they will remain closed until further notice, he said. This will be for all children except to those of key workers and where children who are most vulnerable.

The global race to find a treatment has been joined by a team from Southampton University.  They have been developing a drug known as SNG to help people with chronic lung disease fight off viruses and believe it could have the same effect on Covid-.  Up to ten hospitals will begin giving the inhaled drug to  patients next week and a further  will receive a placebo. If effective, it could be available for wider use within months.  Chief trial investigator Professor Tom Wilkinson told the: “The science definitely adds up. We’re learning a lot about the pandemic every day. “But that’s why we need to do this study, to understand whether the drug does work.  “If we see positive signals of safety and benefit in patients, we can then move rapidly into much larger studies and even into treatment. I’m optimistic and we will soon see the results.” The development comes as Boris Johnson revealed that Public Health England is close to perfecting an antibody test that will be a game-changer for diagnosis. Chief scientic adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said Public Health England’s work on the antibody test is “progressing very fast” and will provide valuable insight into the pandemic.  Sir Patrick said: “It is a game-changer. It allows you to understand the proportion of the population who’s had this disease but hasn’t had symptoms.  “It’s going to be critically important to be able to monitor this disease well because only by being able to monitor it can we start relaxing measures again.”  The Government has announced schools will close from tomorrow and it is believed London could soon go into lockdown to slow the spread of the disease, with the Tube service cut back and  stations shut.

And today the UK death toll from the coronavirus outbreak reached . That number is expected to increase in the coming days and weeks with more stringent lockdown measures expected before the end of the week. Officials are reportedly considering placing London on a strict lockdown, fearing the capital has become a city of superspreaders, with a third of the total UK cases. Due to the school closures exams such as GCSEs and A-Levels have been scrapped and emergency legislation has been pledged to suspend new evictions from social or rented accommodation for the duration of the pandemic. Yesterday Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Chancellor Rushi Sunak unveiled new measures from mortgage repayment holidays to business loans in £billion package.  Schools and public gatherings After days of pressure  the Government finally announced that schools across the UK would shut their gates on Friday aposuntil further noticeapos. Yesterday the PM hinted that a decision was imminent and said that the advice from scientic experts was continually under review. With schools closed planned exams have also been scrapped. Mr Johnson said the Government would ensure that in time pupils due to sit exams this summer get the qualications they need. I donapost want to go into detail about when and how those qualications will be administered, but it will be done fairly and in order to protect their interests. Isolation Presently, the NHS advice remains for anyone with symptoms - thataposs a cough or fever - to self-isolate at home for at least seven days. If those with symptoms live with others, they should all stay at home for at least  days, to avoid spreading the infection where. After two weeks, anyone living with someone with symptoms who has not developed the symptoms themselves canto their normal routine. But anyone in the household who gets new symptoms should isolate from that point for seven days, meaning everyone in the home may have to remain in self-isolation for longer than  days. If symptoms do not get better after seven days or a patientaposs condition worsens, the NHS non-emergency  number should be called.  During isolation, people within a household should attempt to keep two metresfrom each other and sleep alone, while asking friends or family to deliver food and essentials. Anyone self-isolating is urged to wash hands regularly with soap and warm water for  seconds and take everyday painkillers to help cope with the symptoms. Those in self-isolation should not invite visitors and should tell delivery drivers to leave deliveries outside. The official advice says they should not leave home even for a walk. The government has asked as many people in the UK as possible to work from home.  Buying food and drink Brits are being advised to steer clear of pubs, clubs, theatres and other mass gatherings under the current measures. Pubs and restaurants will be able to offer takeaways without planning permission. The Treasury said: We will relax planning regulations to allow pubs and restaurants to start providing takeaways without a planning application. Some enterprising restaurants have already converted into hastily-arranged takeaway restaurants after they failed to get people through the door. The relaxation will happen to support the food industry and help provide meals for people who need to self-isolate. Some supermarket chains in the UK have taken it upon themselves to allow elderly people to have a window of time to shop to ensure they can get groceries.  Travel The government has advised against all non-essential world travel for a period of at least  days from today. It comes after the EU closed its borders to travellers and countries including France followed Italy into lockdown. Making a statement in the House of Commons yesterday, Foreign Secretary  Dominic Raab  told MPs: With immediate effect Iaposve taken the decision to advise British nationals against non-essential travel globally, for an initial period of  days and of course subject to ongoing review. The Foreign Secretary also said that while the government would do its best to try and help Brits home that it would be unrealistic for the UK government to bring all travellers affected. The Foreign Office has said that whether travel is essential or not is a personal decision and circumstances dfer from person to person. They say those who make the decision to travel should check their travel insurance. A package for airlines and airports could be announced soon. The Chancellor and Transport Secretary will discuss in the coming days specic support for airlines and airports. Londonaposs Tube service has been scaled back You canhere. And here is a full list of countries that have banned or restricted entry to people traveling from the UK. aposLockdownapos It is being widely reported that a lockdown could be brought in to curb the spread of the virus in London, which is currently outstripping other parts of the country. Measures to implement and enforce this could be announced as early as tomorrow. Currently, an official lockdown is not in place in Britain like in other countries. But Imperial Collegeaposs Covid- Response Team - who are advising the UK Government -  yesterday said a apossuppressionapos approach was the only viable way to tackle the disease. The PM announced last week measures were in place to aposmitigateapos the outbreak but this has now been replaced by apossuppressionapos with Brits encouraged to avoid restaurants, pubs and confined spaces. He also recommended people work from home wherever possible. Experts at Imperial College found that apossocial distancingapos, self-isolating at home and closing schools and universities would stem the outbreak.  Over-s and those with underlying health problems People in Britain aged over  and those with underlying health problems or vulnerabilities are being instructed by the government to stay in strict isolation for three months from next weekend. Pregnant women were added to those most at risk who are being advised to quarantine themselves. The advice includes those normally advised to take the flu vaccine. If someone in a household displays symptoms all those they live with must isolate for  days - however. If someone over  is in an aposinfectedapos household or has a long-term condition or has a weakened immune system, it is advisable for them to stay where for their quarantine period. Emergency coronavirus laws The government last night set out emergency legislation proposing handing new temporary powers to police and immigration officers to detain people and put them in isolation to protect public health. The new measures we will be introducing in the Emergency Coronavirus Bill this week will only be used when it is absolutely necessary and must be timed to maximise their effectiveness, health minister Matt Hancock said in a statement. Police and border officials could be given powers to detain people for a limited periodit is feared they could spread the deadly virus. The bill also includes measures to offer additional employment protections and compensation for those volunteering in health and social care.  It also makes it easier for potentially highly-skilled health and care staff who have retired toto the frontline. The measures are not yet in force, and will be brought before parliament for politicians to debate on Thursday. Ministers have not declared a aposstate of emergencyapos under the Civil Contingencies Act -  meaning Parliament must pass these proposals before they can be enacted. You can read the full list of of UK coronavirus emergency laws here. Mortgage-holders to be offered three-month repayment holiday Mortgagelenders have voluntarily agreed to help customers who have issues with their finances as a result of Covid-. Those measures will include a three-month payment holiday.has asked the Treasury for more detail on this - including whether all lenders are taking part whether it includes buy-to-let or interest-only mortgages or whether the holiday will affect peopleaposs credit score. The Chancellor said: For those in dficulty due to coronavirus, mortgage lenders will now offer a three-month mortgage holiday.  So people will not have to pay a penny towards their mortgage costs while they get back on their feet.” In France, rent payments and utility bills have been suspended. These measures have not been announced in the UK. Read more about the emergency mortgage repayment measures here.

If you are pregnant you should call you have any concerns about yourself or unborn baby during self-isolation. Pregnant women are advised to contact their midwe, out-of-hours helplines or a maternity team who will provide information on whether you need to go to hospital.  Grants for pubs, clubs, theatres and other virus-hit venues The government announced a huge scheme of £, cash grants for “pubs, clubs, theatres and other hospitality, leisure and retail firms”. The Chancellor had already said business rates won’t apply this year to retail, hospitality and leisure venues with a “rateable value” between £, and £,. Now those same firms - basically, small businesses in the sector - will be also be offered an additional cash grant of up to £, per firm. However, Chancellor Rishi Sunak claimed his new funding won’t be needed for firms that have specic insurance against pandemics - despite firms warning they may be unable to claim. The Chancellor said: “For those businesses that do have a policy for insurance that covers pandemics, the governments action is sufficient and will allow businesses to make an insurance claim against their policy.” Read more  about what is in the £bn package here.

The countryaposs capital is set to go into lockdown as early as the weekend, according to reports, with plans already announced to drastically reduce all public transport, while Boris Johnson has refused to rule out further draconian measures imminently. Official figures from Public Health England show  cases recorded in London compared to a total across the UK of ,. And the proportion of deaths is higher in London than where in the country, with reports putting the capitalaposs death toll at .  The Army are set to deploy , troops to enforce new laws and the crisis has prompted the Queen to leave London for Windsor. In response, Number  is said to be finalising an emergency plan which could see restaurants, bars, pubs, cinemas and more closed across the city turning it into a ghost town. The Times reported the Cabinet Office has written to departments asking for recommendations about restrictions, how they could be implemented and how to ensure “compliance”.  Boris Johnson had admitted last night further and faster measures may be needed after coming under fire for initially pushing for business as usual when the first cases hit the UK. Whitehall sources yesterday told the Mirror lockdown-style measures in London - which the Prime Minister admitted is a few weeks ahead of the rest of the country - are imminent. It is estimated one in seven people in London work in the tourism, hospitality and leisure sector, and with the expected closures, as well as grounding of aeroplanes, such steps could leave thousands without jobs. Thereports the Government is not ruling out forcing London residents to require paperwork to travel.  It is currently unclear whether Londoners will be able to continue travelling via cars and bikes, however. Emergency laws to be introduced to Parliament tomorrow will include powers to close premises and restrict or prohibit events and gatherings anywhere in the UK,the government chooses to. The Coronavirus Bill will also allow the government to limit activity in any place, vehicle, train, vessel or aircraft. The governmentaposs advisory group SAGE was meeting from pm yesterday to examine next steps. Transport for London then announced it will run a reduced service to enable the cityaposs critical workers to make essential journeys - with no Waterloo  City line from Friday.  Until further notice, on Friday and Saturday nights there will be no all-night aposNight Tubeapos service or the all-night aposNight Overgroundapos service that currently runs on the East London line - though late Tube and Overground services will continue for essential journeys. London buses, meanwhile, will operate fewer services, but TfLaposs extensive night bus network will continue to provide critical workers with a reliable night option on Friday and Saturday nights and throughout the week. Everyone is urged not to use public transport for anything other than essential journeys.Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said: People should not be travelling, by any means, unless they really, really have to. Londoners should be avoiding social interaction unless absolutely necessary, and that means they should be avoiding using the transport network unless absolutely necessary.

Our willingness, as a people, to step up in the face of what we are all experiencing with COVID- is awe-inspiring. This moment is as true a testament there is to the human spirit.  We often speak of compassion. All of our lives are in some way affected by this, uniting each of us globally. How we approach each other and our communities with empathy and kindness is indisputably important right now. Over the coming weeks, this will be our guiding principle.

Martell Watson, from Croydon, claims a worker in the Thornton Heath store said aposnot againapos when they saw what had happened.She was forced to complete the rest of her shopping with just one hand, with none of the staff offering to help her, MyLondon reports.The -year-old was buying dinner for her son when a wet section of the ceiling reportedly fell onto her on March . The mother said: “All of a sudden this thing just literally fell straight on my hand. After a minute and a half one of the workers came over and said, aposnot againapos.” She claimed that staff told her that another tile had fallen earlier that day but not hit anyone. Martell, who has been shopping there for five years, described wanting to cry when the wet tile slapped down onto her hand. The worst part of her ordeal, she explained, was how unsympathetic some of the staff were after her hand became swollen. She said: “I asked the managershe could get me something I could wipe my clothes and hands with. The manager didn’t really acknowledge what I was saying. “She askedI was OK and can I leave you now. I thought, aposwowapos. She swept up all the dust and she left. “I stood in that same position for about  minutes in total, maybe a bit more. It was only the security who askedI wanted a drink or a chair.” After a further wait, Martell said another manager filled out an accident report, but didn’t offer to help her finish her shopping. She said: “They askedI wanted to fill out an accident form and I said aposof course, isn’t that normal procedure apos  “He said head office would contact me and that was it. He didn’t ask me a recollection of what happened, nothing. That was the end of that.” Ms Watson said she asked the second manager for help completing her shopping, but was given no assistance. When she explained to him that she was shocked by the incident, he allegedly asked her why she was upset. She said: “How can you ask me why I’m shocked when something has just fallen from the ceiling on to me  “That made me feel like I wanted to cry there and then because I can’t believe I’m being treated this way. “I’m not saying you have to fall at my feet but, for god’s sake, you don’t want people to complain. You would think they would help you or try and make it better even though it’s already happened. “Nobody helped me. I didn’t see another worker after that. Needing to feed her son that evening, Martell carried on shopping, by now pushing the trolley with one hand. She believes she should have been allowed to skip to the front of the checkout queue to make it easier for her to get home. She said: “I’m just appalled at the way they treated me. It was a total shock and I can’t believe the way they treated me. “It’s your shop. I’m not saying it’s your fault but it’s your shop. It’s close to my work but I would never go back there after being treated like that.” Lidl has since apologised to Martell about the incident. A Lidl spokesperson said: “We were extremely sorry to learn of this matter and sincerely apologise to the customer for any distress caused.

Terri Calvesbert was not expected to survive after suffering % burns in a house fire when she was  months old. She was left with no hair, lips, nose or fingers and lost a foot. Terri endured more than  operations, and was presented with a Child of Courage award by the Duchess of York in . Now , Terri, is planning her dream wedding to fiancé Richard Holmes, , this summer. The mum-of-one said: “I’ve always wanted to get married but I never thought this would happen at my age, especially to me. In previous relationships my partners have never really understood me or what happened to me. “Obviously, I’ve only got the one leg now, but Richard took it really well and he understands me. He is everything to me. He’s my best friend and soulmate. “Sometimes it has been dficult to build relationships with people, especially when I was younger. But I’m much more confident in myself now.

Patrick Vallance, chief scientic advisor, explained that the decision has been made to stop the disease spreading further and to protect the NHS from an increasing number of cases. He said: Itaposs not because schools are dangerous places for children. Theyaposre not. Children have a very mild or asymptomatic version of this disease in many cases. They are the least at risk. Itaposs also not a dangerous place for teachers. The reason for this is because of the affect it can have just to knock down further the transmission and put some delay into the system, to put some breaks into the system of the transmission of this disease to bring it down, to protect those people who might get the much more serious version and end up in intensive care. He later stressed this point further, adding: Children are not getting the serious form of this illness. They are very mild, often symptomatic and therefore donapost have a big risk around each other.  They also might not spread it as much, we donapost know that. We donapost know the exact spread of this. Itaposs not like influenza. This is about a measure to protect all of us. Itaposs not a measure to because there is some specic risk to children. Dr Jenny Harries added: The whole approach is to reduce the social contact throughout society and we have taken the measures which maximise the impact to health and safety whilst minimising those to the way that we live.  This measure moves this on a small amount, but itaposs not to do with the safety of the children, itaposs simply about a background level of the number of social contacts that we have. Todayaposs announcement will see millions of British children remain at home.

Many have suggested keeping routine, changing out of your PJs and taking regular screen breaks, others have been sharing photos of their rather creative desk set ups. While most people are just working from the sofa or sitting at the dining room table, limited space has forced others to think outside the box.  Jules Forrest was the first person to start the trend, posting a photo to her Twitter of her make-sht desk which quickly went viral.She said: “Can we do a WFH workspace setup thread, unglamorous edition  “My partner and I are both working from our studio apartment. My setup is a chair in front of the front door and my desk is our clothes hamper.” The post received over , likes and nearly , comments from other workers sharing their set-ups. One person shared a picture of her laptop and notebook on top of her ironing board, with the caption: “I’m lucky enough to have a height-adjustable workstation at home…” With which one lady then commented: “I’ve been working from home full time for  years - why have I never ever thought of this”. The government has advised the British public to:Avoid pubs, clubs, restaurants and all social gatherings Cease all unnecessary travelEveryone should work from home where possible Mass gatherings and sporting events have been cancelled Avoid “all but essential travel” to more than  countries If one person in any household has a persistent cough or fever, everyone living there must stay at home for  days Pregnant women, those over , and people with certain health conditions have been asked to stay at home for  weeks Schools will remain open "},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus good news newborn baby","story":"NewsCoronavirus good news!

A few pieces of good news are starting to come out across the world in the fight against the potentially deadly Covid- infection, following travel bans, lockdowns and mass self-isolations. More than , people have been confirmed as contaminated by the disease which has killed nearly , since December, but there does appear to be some hope on the horizon. Over , people have successfully recovered worldwide and in mainland China, where the highly-infectious disease originated, only  new cases were confirmed by officials on Tuesday. Just one of those was a domestic transmission. And despite the death toll in Italy - the worldaposs second biggest hotspot - continuing to skyrocket, the confirmed cases are now slowing. Cases are also declining in South Korea - just  yesterday, a signicant drop from  at its peak just over two weeks ago. This comes as researchers in Rotterdam and Utrecht University claim they have found an antibody that can successfully cure a patient of the disease, reports the Sun.  It could lead to a vaccine and also allow people to test themselves at home, freeing up valuable time for struggling health services across the world. Doctors at the Sawai Man Singh Hospital in Jaipar, India, meanwhile, have been using a cocktail of HIV, swine flu and Malaria medication to cure Covid- patients. The Cleveland Clinic also apparently has technology which can turn around coronavirus tests in eight hours - though it still needs further in-house testing. Japanese pharmaceutical firm Takeda Pharmaceutical Co has revealed it is working on a new coronavirus drug which uses blood plasma of recovered patients, and researchers in Ontario, Canada, have replicated the virus which could prove invaluable for testing.

The secretive state continues to maintain that it has no confirmed cases of COVID-, despite tens of thousands of cases in neighbouring China and South Korea. Now, without acknowledging the escalating crisis, the dictator has ordered construction of a new hospital in the heart of Pyongyang. In a speech detailed by state propaganda, the dictator insisted that the project was to celebrate  years since the ruling party was founded and had already been agreed at a meeting months ago. A report of that meeting from the time, however, makes no mention of a hospital and sets out only the vague goal of “improving… public health”. Kim Jong-un never acknowledged the pandemic directly in his speech, but he admitted the country faced its “harshest-ever internal and external situations”, a full transcript shows. He also said it was “urgent” to “improve the health of the people” and warned that “conditions are bad and many dficulties lie ahead”. He further demanded that the facility ready by the “earliest possible date” while warning builders not to cut corners. Photos of the groundbreaking ceremony show that the hospital will be built close to the Workersapos Party Foundation Monument, near Pyongyang’s Taedong River.General Robert Abrams, a commander of US Forces Korea, said it was unlikely that the hermit kingdom remained free of infection. “It is a closed-off nation, so we canapost say emphatically that they have cases, but weaposre fairly certain they do,” he said. A source in the North’s military told South Korea’s Daily NK newspaper that  soldiers had already succumbed to the virus, with most deaths happening near to the closed border with China.

The -year-old told Corkaposs Red FM that China is starting to come out of the coronavirus crisis and encouraged people to have faith in the lockdown system, claiming “it does work”. “It’s been a long, long, looong seven weeks, RSVP Live reports.“But it’s getting a lot better. Today is the first day that malls, shops and restaurants have opened again. We can go out of the complex now everyday, there’s no monitoring of our movements. “Secondary schools and universities will probably open around the third week of March, but kindergartens won’t be open until maybe the middle of April”. In total, China has had more than , confirmed cases and suffered over , deaths. But the country is finally seeing light at the end of the tunnel. The last  hours saw just  new caseswhich Katie says is down to foreigners bringing the virus back to China. “We had  confirmed cases in Harbin, and now we have  treated so once the confirmed and treated match up we’ll be virus-free. “Nationally, the numbers are reducing, but in the last week, thereaposve been foreigners coming into Beijing and Shanghai and they have brought back the virus with them. “I read online that from tonight onwards anyone coming in from any country to China has to be self-quarantined for  days. Before, it was only for affected countries like Italy, Japan, Korea but now it’s for anywhere outside China.”  So just how did China manage to turn themselves from the epicentre of the coronavirus, with several thousand new cases per day at its worst, to near total eradication  According to Katie, the answer is simple: Lockdown. “Ireland needs to shut the country down, otherwise it’s going to spread faster,” Katie advised. “Harbin had  cases but for the last two-three weeks we haven’t had any new cases so lockdown does work, it is working and it has worked. There’s proof of it here in China.” In China, all citizens are required to use an app that tracks their location at all times. Now, before entering a store, a mall or any business, citizens scan their phone on a QR code located at the entrance, that checksthey have been out of the country over the past  days and gives them a green or red tick for entry.  “People need to realise thatyou put the country on lockdown it’s actually ok. It’s not going to do damage. To keep the elderly and vulnerable people safe, going on lockdown is the best thing you can do.”  The debate as to whether face masks do more harm than good has been continuing since this epidemic emerged. The HSE have repeatedly advised that face masks are not necessary for people who are healthy. In contrast, Chinese people have been known to wear masks for even the earliest of cold symptoms, ever since the SARS epidemic swept through the nation in the early s. “All my Chinese friends have been asking me ‘why are people abroad not wearing masks ’.

But, at the same time, I also completely disagree.While our minds are being blown with stress and mild panic about being shut in our homes and where we’re going to locate our next roll of toilet paper, we all desperately need a release to think about something .Netflix, Amazon Prime, Disney + and the rest will be doing a roaring trade right now as people figure out what to fill spare time with.It’s exactly the same for football debate – there’s no games but that doesn’t stop the debate, thankfully.Doesn’t make le easy for a football writer, mind you . . .Nor is it easy for the likes of Ian Maxwell and Neil Doncaster as they attempt to navigate the minefield that is now our game.The big clubs haven’t wasted any time in applying pressure for what they want to see – Celtic want to be awarded the title, Rangers obviously disagree and Hearts don’t want to be relegated.I have to say, apart from the Hearts viewpoint, it’s all pretty nauseating.What the heid honchos have on their plate right now is probably the biggest decision ever in the history of Scottish football.The Rangers Sevco debate pales in comparison and it’s not like we’ve ever heard the end of that one in Glasgow.Definitely rather them than me. Stuck between a rock and a hard place, whatever decision they come to, it’s going to hurt somebody.And I think they were right to give themselves some breathing space with Monday’s statement.Personally, I’d have picked a date in the middle of April and said we’ll see what’s what at that point with some plans thought up in the meantime.Initially, I was in favour of restarting the season in the autumn and then running straight into the new one, maybe scrap the League Cup. The transfer window and players’ contracts ending in May June just makes that a can of worms.Now, though, I’ll echo my colleague Lee Wilkie’s thoughts yesterday – expand the structure and keep as many clubs happy as possible.As in so many situations in le – do what big Wilkie says . . .It was only right Uefa postpone the European Championship until next summer – there was no other call to make.The championships would have put a completely unreasonable time limit on getting club football – whenever it gets going again – finished in time.However, the decision to knock the qualying play-offs back to June seems very short-sighted.I would be delightedany football is played before June, to be honest.I really think we’re in for a long, long haul of society shutting down to deal with the coronavirus pandemic.And Uefa should be aware they will likely just have to kick the can on the play-offs down the road again in three months’ time.They are such massive games for countries like us and I’m sure Scotland boss Steve Clarkewill want his players to have been in action for a few weeks going into the Israel game.Very little of this situation is fair but I can’t help but think Uefa have been a bit quick to make these decisions.Dundee and Dundee United have more to lose from this season being cancelled than almost anybody.Hearts would be the exception and possibly Partick.However, missing out on a place in the Premiership, particularly for United when it was nailed on, would be massively unfair. The Dark Blues can make an argument themselves about the play-offs, too.The work, and pots of cash, already put in this season has to count for something.THE world might be going down the drain but I have to try to see a silver lining. With the season stopped and, possibly declared null and void, my team Queen of the South can’t be relegated, so there’s that . . ."},{"url":null,"title":"kanzen karate announces cancellation of its international competition in may","story":"Kanzen Karate has announced it has had to cancel its international competition, The Kanzen Cup.The th Kanzen Cup International Open was scheduled to take place in May.

Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets. Even into the s local authorities ran youth clubs and had excellent people called #youth leaders#. No more. #We cannot afford them# is the call of the day. Without them the honourable behaviour of society will continue to deteriorate.So my plea to politicians is simple # stop making us all criminals by passing more and more laws and start supporting and encouraging agencies, groups and people who indirectly and directly instil in iniduals behaviour of which all can be proud.Finlay CraigCoveSir,There is all the hoo-ha at the moment over the lesser royals deciding its going to be a better le that beckons from opting out from royal duties # perhaps wanting a less stressful, more normal, le for themselves and their family as ordinary people away from the media hype and national newspapers.It was lovely, however, to see in the same week front page on the local paper a real regional award for a less well-known commoner.An MBE given for services to the local youth community, making this two great awards for Lochgilphead in recent years and showing that local strong ladies in Mid Argyll do have what it takes.Hard work and true Scottish grit and determination in their hearts for the area and community.

So how did Britain look before human interventions  Dense forest  or open woodland Research now favours the latter.Plants and animals evolved in equilibrium for thousands of years before humans impacted the landscape. Essential to this balance were ‘keynote species’ including aurochs , bison and tarpan . By grazing, these animals trampled and eroded soils, dispersed seeds and redistributed nutrients, thereby keeping the forest open. This in turn encouraged growth of large trees while also creating numerous habitats and microenvironments for a wonderful ersity of plants and smaller animals.Now this bioersity is severely threatened by modern monocultures , and massive quantities of pesticides, fungicides, fertilisers and #weed# killers. It is no wonder that insect numbers have plummeted, many bird species are endangered and wild-flower meadows have virtually vanished. So could we recreate this natural order on unproductive land and save our wildle For Isabella Tree and her husband Charlie Burrell the answer is a resounding #yes#. In her book #Wilding#, Tree describes #wilding# their , acre farm at Knepp, West Sussex, that had been unproductive for years.They introduced longhorn cattle, Exmore ponies, deer and pigs but otherwise left well alone. Within months they saw a dference # most scrub was cleared, producing an explosion of plant and animal species. And where grazers were deterred by spiny or unpalatable plants, oaks emerged that will eventually form an open woodland.But Knepp is isolated. More rewilding sites are needed with wildle corridors between them to support the populations and genetic ersity essential for long-term survival.Surely parts of Argyll are ideal for rewilding. We already have beavers creating new waterways to support aquatic species – now how about some large grazers to open up the landscape and perhaps one day recreate the ancient Celtic rainforest "},{"url":null,"title":"hair raising happenings at the co op","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsLochgilphead Co-op staff are on a fundraising mission which they hope will raise awareness and help overcome stigma around mental illness.Trusting her hairdresser Nicky MacDougall, from Casa in Ardrishaig, Tina Holloway will have her hair shaved off to raise funds for the Scottish Association for Mental Health .Explaining why she decided to take on the challenge, Tina said: #I didn#t really think before I opened my mouth.

The Purser, however, found the lure of the theatre too great and she decided to spend her holidays working with a Repertory Company in Aberdeen.Again we were lucky in having a ready-made substitute in Chris Paterson, the Pilot’s we of nearly a year’s standing. We gave her the rank of Tanky – a piece of gunroom slang meaning the midshipman who trots around with the navigator or, in other words the Pilot’s Mate.As usual at the beginning of a cruise we got up early – .am – and quickly finished up our packing, loaded the car, shut up the house, and were on our road by ten minutes past seven. It was a fine bright morning with a light southerly breeze and quite promising though the weather forecast the night before had been not too cheerful. It was dead low water at Renfrew Ferry and as there was a big convoy of Army Transports crossing from north to south there was no delay in our getting across and at .am we were at the top of The Rest having had an easy and practically trafficless trip up Loch Lomond. Twenty minutes later we had Inveraray behind us.We called in at the BRS Depot at Lochgilpheadand collected our three boxes of stores and at ten to ten arrived at Crinan having passed several yachts already making their way east. The basin was busy with in it, amongst others, Arcturus, Vivien, Makoya, Boomerang, and Tookay, most of which were homeward bound. The Fulmar was lying at the back of the basin outside a motor boat and Vanda and as we unloaded the car we had a long carry round and everything was dumped on the basin wall before being taken aboard. Luckily it was turning into a lovely day. The only fly in the ointment was the poor Major – he had developed a paralysis of his back legs the day before and could do nothing but sit where put and look pitully about and only occasionally managed to drag himself a foot or two.The Mate and Bosun after being treated to tea on board Vivien got down to unpacking and stowing our gear and while they were about it the Doctor arrived with his gear and plentul supplies of Medical Comforts, a huge cake, packets of chocolate and a big box of chocolates. Dumping his stuff with the rest on deck he and the Skipper then went to the hotel and drank success to the cruise. They learnt that the night before had been a bit of a night and Arcturus was still showing its effects rather markedly.While the Mate continued the storing the Bosun got petrol and paraffin and the Tar went up to the farm for milk and at half past twelve they, with the Doctor, had lunch. Meanwhile the Skipper had gone to Ardrishaig and got a lot of fresh storesa new screwdriver, and meths. Being too early for the steamer he, after having had a beer at The Anchor, sat on a seat near the pier and had his lunch of six cookies and a sausage roll and listened to the Test Match on a portable set a man sharing the seat had with him .The Pilot and Tanky duly came off the steamer and by half past one all were aboard and the final gear stowing was completed. The car was parked on the steep hill between the farm and the basin and the batteries were disconnected then, while the Bosun, Doctor and Pilot, shted Fulmar to outside Melora on the east wall, the Skipper and Mate went up to the shop and got some strawberry tarts.At half past two the Karma came in from sea and we went into her water but had to wait in the lock for a wee motor boat whose owner had not turned up but was due soon. While we waited a man from a big Belfast motor boat that was lying in the basin spoke to the Skipper and complimented him on the sailing directions and thanked him for them. The Skipper did his best not to look smugly gratied. We filled in the waiting time by having a cup of coffee and one was handed up to the Doctor who was waiting to see us sail.At five past three we were away under engine being waved on our way by the Doctor and promising to be at Tobermory on the following Friday to pick him up. As the wind was light west-south-west we kept the motor going until we could fetch the Dorus Mor then up went the sails and beer was indulged in to mark the start of the cruise.We went nicely for a little but the wind fell very light. An unknown yacht and Mimosa were coming south and, against the flood tide, were making nothing of it. We passed close by the latter and spoke to John Hamilton then as we headed up for the Ardluing buoy we could see her being pushed slowly back to the northwards stern first. We, too, were being carried too far to the eastward and the engine went on to get us into the Scarba Sound stream and we kept it going till up to Leica Point where the wind came away again, this time from the true west.The tide rips at Fladda were in very good form and we fairly roared through the narrows and on up to Easdale but thereafter the breeze went flukey and light ying between north-west and south-west but, as the sun was shining brightly, it was very pleasant slipping along slowly in the smooth water. There was no sign of the usual heavy swell one expects to meet either side of Easdale Point. Away up to the north between Duart and Loch Don we could see half a dozen boats, led by Cerigo, making their way south.At six o’clock we heard a poor forecast promising rain and strong winds to come and listened for a while to the Test Match and heard of the collapse of the Australians in the st innings. The glass was slowly but steadily coming back and we feared the forecast was probably on the right lines.As we came round the north-west point of Seil Island and headed over for Dun Island off Puilladobhrain the wind died and the sea turned to glass so we got the sails down and stowed and the motor was started up.As we approached Puilladobhrain we saw a nished yawl coming down from the Oban direction under power and she passed in just ahead of us. As we were to learn later she was the Sol and at her helmwas a #bearded ancient# with a shock of white hair and a white beard. As we rounded the Fulmar Beacon we passed Kerlo coming out. In the anchorage were two motor boats and as we went slowly up to the south end of the pool we passed far too close to the bows of one of them owing to the Skipper misjudging the tidal drt. One of the crew came hurriedly out on to her forecastle and frowned at us as we slipped past with only inches to spare.It was dead calm when we anchored at half past seven but we were sorry to see that the drop in the glass was now being accelerated."},{"url":null,"title":"ormsary man in oman endurance event","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAn Ormsary man is about to embark on the challenge of a letime as he cycles over ,km in a bid to be crowned BikingMan Oman .Lindsay McCrae, , will be one of only  cyclists to take part in BikingMan Oman, part of a series of ultra-endurance cycling events where competitors test their limits of strength and stamina.In , Lindsay bought a road bike through his employer#s cycle to work scheme and what started out as an active commute with a few local races thrown in for fun, soon became an opportunity to challenge himself in some of the toughest races on two wheels.His first big win came in the gruelling City to Summit duathlon from Edinburgh to Ben Nevis. The race was a half marathon of road running, km ride through Glen Coe then back on foot for the final off-road marathon summitting Ben Nevis and finishing in Fort William.Bitten by the cycling bug, he went on to win Revolve  at Brands Hatch race circuit, completing  miles and ascending , feet in  hours. Adding a second-place finish in last year#s BikingMan Portugal event against some of the sport#s top athletes means Lindsay has truly made his mark on the endurance scene.Lindsay said: #In my first few races I just wanted to see how I would get on but now I#m definitely in it to win it. I think I#m just stubborn and that#s what keeps me pushing on when other people take rest breaks.#Lindsay, who works in sales technical support for an aquaculture equipment company in Inverness, fits his training around his job, spending one to two hours on a turbo in his garage three or four times a week, with longer rides of two to five hours at the weekends. His father#s greenhouse in Ardrishaig proved to be a useful training venue to shelter from the elements over the Christmas holidays as he prepared for his biggest challenge yet.The BikingMan Oman race starts in Muscat, Oman#s capital city, before heading out on the Arabian Peninsula, through the Hajar Mountains, across the Ash Sharqiyah Desert and along coastal roads back to the capital. The competitors will climb over m during the race, that#s the equivalent of climbing Ben Nevis almost seven times.Unlike cyclists on the Tour de France, BikingMan athletes are unsupported so must carry all their food and equipment with them.For Lindsay, one of the biggest challenges will be the weather. #Temperatures at the moment are around - degrees but can reach higher which can be dficult to manage on the steeper sections of the course. That#s where my nutrition and hydration strategy will need to be spot on.#But in case it all sounds like hard work, Lindsay highlights one of the main benefits of his high-octane adventures: #The best part is definitely refuelling after the race. I will burn about , calories over the -hours of my target time, so my recovery will mainly involve eating cakes and other calorie rich foods.#Lindsay grew up on the Ormsary Estate and attended Lochgilphead High School. His family still live in the local area and will be following his adventures closely over the five days of competition.The race takes place from February  to  and Lindsay will cover ,km in a bid to take the title."},{"url":null,"title":"ceilidh to boost hall funds","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsToe-tapping tunes and a busy dance floor are on the cards for a Craignish ceilidh.Ardfern ceilidh band, All about the Cake, will take the stage and have the dancers reeling all night.

As we stood about on deck while the dishes were being washed a boy from one of the motor boats passed in his dinghy. He was wearing blue shorts and red stockings which brought from the Pilot the remark: #In Brodickyou don’t wear red stockings you might just as well be in Lamlash.#All but the Skipper and Mate went ashore on Centre Island for a stroll. The Major was still completely paralysed in his hind quarters but he was full of spirit and when the Bosun held up his hind legshe galloped along. It was a quiet peaceful evening with a very light northerly breeze but it was distinctly chilly and there was a magnicentsomewhat lurid sunset. The shore party back aboard the Bosun took the Tar off in the dinghy and they landed on Eilean na Beithe and while the former explored the island the latter played on a shingly shore – it was long after dark when they ed.At half past ten we began to turn in and, as always on the first evening, this was a longer business then usual as pillows and blankets had to be allocated and pillowslips put on but by a quarter past eleven we were all in bed and shortly after that a light shower pattered on the deck. The problem of what to do with the Doctor’s mattress was solved by the Pilot double banking his bunk. We were all very glad to have had such a good day for the start.It was noticed that voices were still coming from the ladies’ cabin when the last of us in the main cabin fell asleep.The Tanky brought an innovation to the Fulmar # #Quickies# # a patent washing gadget that saved precious water.We had a dead quiet night with, as far as any of us knew, no rain but the forecast was not good, promising north to north-east winds, force  to  with frequent heavy showers. The glass had continued its steady drop. When we turned out, a light but cold north wind was blowing from a well broken up sky.We had a breakfast of bacon and eggs then the Bosun took the Major ashore for his walk. The latter was possibly a little better and was able to take a few steps on the deck, but ashore on the rough ground could do nothing. While they were ashore the big motor boat with the red-stockinged boy left after very nearly going ashore on Seil Island while getting his anchor aboard.At twenty past ten we were away under engine, but as soon as we were outside the sails went up to the north-easterly breeze and we set off for the Sound of Mull. There was no sign of the swell that is usually met south of Kerrera and we got along quite well, but we could not point any higher than a mile or so south of Loch Don. The Pilot went below and brewed a welcome cup of tea which warmed us up, then we took a tack right up to the south coast of Kerrera and had a close up view of Gylen Castle and the Skipper waxed historical.Putting about again we passed close south of the Potlid Island, but when we were about halfway across to Loch Don the wind died and the strong ebb began to force us south and about the same time the rain came on.The engine was started and we headed up for Duart, but our progress was pitully slow, and indeed at one period we but barely held our ground. The Lady Rock and Lismore Lighthouse seemed never to get any nearer closing. When the engine had run an hour we waited for the first sign of the old familiar falter but none came and we began to hope a cure for its stopping had been effected by replacing the HT coil.This change was a despairing effort made because it was the only thing we had not tried, though all the pundits declare it could not possibly be the cause. The engine would either go or not go, they said, and it would never startthe coil was defective. We got one scare when it staggered for a moment, but the Bosun, who was at the tiller at the time, said we had just passed though a big mass of floating seaweed and may have got some round our propeller.As we were to prove later the cure had been found and the engine ran impeccably all the cruise and the Skipper had a lot of unkind thoughts about all the many professional motor experts who had caused him a great deal of trouble, not a little acute anxiety and more than considerable expense through their failure to diagnose a not very obscure disease.As we came up to the Black Memorial Tower Leonora crossed our bows making for Oban and another yachtpassed close by south bound under engine though by this time quite a reasonable and, for then, favourable breeze was blowing from the north-east and our sails were drawing.We learnt later that the owner’s we would not allow a sail to be set under any conditions as long as she was aboard – a pity, we thought, as she certainly was a lovely job and we felt it would have been betterthe we had decided to stay ashore.At Duart we stopped the engine and were able to make good progress, but the rain got heavier and heavier and our sandwich lunch was taken below in relays. Then at about three with the turn of the tide the wind died completely and the engine was started again. Near the Grey Rocks we saw St Roma coming south under power so we altered course to intercept her then at slow speed turned back the way we had come for a few hundred yards while we exchanged news.We heard a thoroughly bad forecast at mid-day, the wind had gone, the rain was stotting in the glassy sea, and, though the glass had come back only a fraction, we decided to call it a day so, with the Bosun the only dissentient, made for Loch Aline. As we turned inshore at Ardtornish we saw Seewolf to the north of us, becalmed but heading south, and guessed she would be joining us later. Coming in, when between Morven Pier and the Ferry Pier, the Skipper held too close to the west shore and the bottom showed up suddenly far too clearly for our peace of mind and a quick sheer out was necessary.Through the narrows we turned to starboard and anchored at half past four in Kyle Bay in a flat calm and the rain coming down heavier than ever. Gratefully we realised that it was not quite as bitterly cold as it had been out in the Sound.Seewolf came in shortly after going very slowly and Hamish Lawrence called over that he had run a big end and was on his way to Oban for repairs and to hand over to brother Alec and his family. Soon after that we were joined by a small motor boat, Saguenay, flying a blue ensign which, in view of her size, the Skipper was sure she was not entitled to do and then a little later, while we were warming up with some coffee, Lindisfarne arrived and anchored close beside us with Guy Clephane in his usual tremendousform – he’s a proper marvel is Guy.Hamish Lawrence came across in his dinghy and came aboard for a gin and while he was there Guy called over inviting Tanky and the Pilot across to Lindisfarne then sent the Pilot back to Fulmar to fetch the Bosun. Hamish gone, the Skipper began to put nine inch tacklines into our line of flags as we had discovered at Rothesay at the Royal Clyde Centenary Regatta that without them our line was about fteen feet too short and we wanted them to be right for the Queen’s visit to Tobermory.When the Pilot came back he and the Bosun got the tents up as the rain was by then torrential.We had a supper of sausages and beans and while the dishes were being done the Bosun took the Major ashore. He was walking a little bettervery slowly, but there was, unfortunately, no concrete results from his exercise.At nine o’clock we went in two loads across to Seewolf and were offered drinks OR tea, but the Skipper insisted on both. We were, however, not allowed any biscuits with our tea as to have them would have meant opening a new box and broaching Alec Lawrence’s stores. The Tanky had not wanted anything but tea, but Hamish had given her a good strong gin which she tried to hide on a shelf behind her and it was only got rid of when the Pilot took it off her hands and quickly put it to its proper use. The Bosun was drinking beer and when he opened up the tin a goodly portion of it bubbled onto the fitted carpet in the cabin.On board Seewolf were, besides the two paid hands, Hamish’s mother and his two sisters. The old lady, well over eighty, was in grand form and waxed eloquent on #The old days# and the greatness of #Belshaft#. Also on board was a great big collie who was obviously petted and spoilt beyond measure and he behaved more like a lap dog than the great big clumsy creature he was.It was half past eleven before we went back to Fulmar all in one load with little enough freeboard for the dinghy considering the conditions. There was a nasty little lop on the water, the northerly wind was bitterly cold, and the rain was as heavy as ever. As quickly as possible we got below and into our warm bunks, not even the Bosun wasting any time about it, though he did read for some time after all the rest were sound asleep."},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast podcast episode 10 nessie and the lost golf balls","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWelcome to Episode  of the Oban Time#s BOBcast.Charting Bob#s progress  and discussing lots of things golfare  presenters Stephen Day, George Graham, Martin Laing and Keith McIntyre.

As part of this project the fund provided MACPool with seven aqua cycles and training from Hydrorider.Arriving early to take photogaphs of the others giving these bikes a go, any sense of nervousness was set aside as I watched healthcare professionals and fitness and well-being enthusiasts laugh and chat through their shot.After some quick adjustments to the bikes June, from our advertising department, and I were raring to go.Partially submerged, the feeling of being weightless combined with the resistance of the water as we began peddling was initially a bit odd. As we got used to the feeling, we started to speed things up, pretending we were racing the rest of our group to The Cairnbaan for a gin and tonic.Finding our rhythm, instructor Kathryn Craig began to lead us through arm exercises. Our co-ordination was put to the test as we carried on cycling while doing simple arm movements that felt more impactive due to the water resistance. Then for the real challenge # floating off the back of the bike while continuing to pedal – not an easy taskyou are short-legged but a workout that feels like it is doing you the power of good.For me aqua cycling is everything I hoped it would be – a fun, impactiveand enjoyable way of exercising. And I could still walk after it!With no aches and pains the next day and still smiling, I signed up for some of the classes.Classes y in intensity and are currently running on Tuesdays from .-.pm, Wednesday evenings from .-.pm and Saturdays from  .-.am.

There were, however, large sections of the stages still swathed in snow and ice, making conditions changeable to say the least.Lochgilphead#s Alister MacArthur was back in the forests, after a two-and-a-half year break, in the MR Motorsport prepared Talbot Sunbeam. Co-driver Claire Tilley, from Craignure, Mull, had only completed one event prior to this in the car and that was on tarmacadam and mostly in the dark of Mull Rally. Gravel, snow and ice would be a whole dferent concept in the powerful rear wheel drive car.The car has seen development over the past season and the five stages ahead that day would be as much a test as a genuine attempt to score points.However, after a relatively clean run through the  miles of Stage  # the stage that claimed a large number of competitors due to the slippy conditions # thoughts quickly turned to getting up the leaderboard and grabbing as many championship points as possible.The crew had made it to the afternoon sitting in th place overall and a very quick run through Stage  saw them climb to st. Drama nearly robbed them of a great result when the alternator stopped working and the battery started to go flat in the last  miles of Lochletter , with Alister switching off all but the bare essential electric components to try and make it to the finish. Finish they did and in nd place overall and third in Class . A brilliant start to the new season.Also heading north to Inverness to compete was Ian Parker, whose normal seat in the MkII had been withdrawn as the car wasn#t ready. He had a late call to co-drive for Linzi Henderson in her Ford Fiesta but they were one of the unlucky crews to slide off the road in Stage , only a mile from the start, spectacularly attempting to knock down some trees in the process.Eoghan Anderson from Cairnbaan was out in the Subaru Impreza of Graeme Sherry in what is slowly becoming a weekend habit # one which has his mother watching nervously from the wings.

member for Midlothian South, Tweeddale and Lauderdale has resorted to Freedom of Information requests in a bid to get answers.A row erupted last month between the Conservative-led administration at Scottish Borders Council and the SNP government at Holyrood over funding for a replacement school.Claims by council leader Shona Haslam and education portfolio holder Carol Hamilton that the Scottish Government had rejected a plea for help was angrily refuted by both Ms Grahame and the Cabinet Secretary for Education, John Swinney.It emerged that no formal request for financial assistance had been made to the Scottish Government ahead of the claims being made.And it was several days later that Councillor Haslam eventually sent a letter - not in her role as council leader but as a ward councillor for Tweeddale East.Details of funding for a replacement Peebles High have remained sketchy with pound million being required to plug the gap between an expected pound million insurance pay out and the estimated demolition and rebuild costs of around pound million.Over the past few weeks Christine Grahames attempts for further clarication over funding from the council leader has been met with the cold shoulder.Ms Grahame told us: \"I have asked a number of follow-up questions to establish how plans for Peebles High would be progressing, however Councillor Haslam has now responded to say that she is not prepared to answer my questions.\"At the heart of this is the question of getting a proper replacement for Peebles High School that serves the school community properly.\"The issue should never have been made party political and I remain hugely frustrated that Councillor Haslam decided to issue a press release attacking the Scottish Government on February , apparently before any request was even made.\"How does trying to score cheap points against the SNP with a factually inaccurate press release serve the school community or indeed foster a co-operative approach between the council and the government \"It is behaviour that, frankly, should be beneath a council leader.\"Although Scottish Borders Council claim their decision to impose a record hike in council tax from next month is to help fund a new replacement school in Peebles, it is expected that money will still be required from Holyrood.But government officials have yet to receive any request from Newtown St Boswells.Ms Grahame added: \"As Irsquom sure Councillor Haslam well knows, her letter of February , issued after she claimed the Scottish Government had refused funding, does not constitute a formal funding request, given the lack of any details.\"And I remain unclear why shersquos written as a local ward councillor rather than in her role as leader of Scottish Borders Council.\"I have yet to see any correspondence that shows any formal request to the Scottish Government, let alone anything that constitutes it refusing funding, and Councillor Haslam is now refusing to share any further information.\"It is her complete refusal to engage with me on this matter which has led me to put in a formal FOI request to try to get to the bottom of whatrsquos actually going on.\"This is causing a huge deal of concern in the school community and I, like them, simply want to know what is actually being done to support replacing the school, all politics aside.We did put all the points raised by

She sought the help of Queen Elizabeth I of England, but Elizabeth thought she was a threat to her own throne and she imprisoned Mary in a series of English castles and manor houses.In , after more than nineteen years in custody, Mary was beheaded for plotting to assassinate Elizabeth.What will you see The house sits in attractive gardens which are home to some of Jedburghrsquos famous pear trees, descendants of the original pear trees planted around Jedburgh Abbey in the early s.Inside the towerhouse, a display of paintings, artefacts, and textiles associated with Mary explores not only her le and times, but the cult that has grown up around her.The period feel inside the house has been preserved with thoughtful design, which allows the story of Maryrsquos le to be told in an engaging way.The Rogues Gallery introduces the iniduals in the drama of Maryrsquos le, while the Last Letter Room reveals her final thoughts before her execution.VisitingThe museum is situated on Queen Street, near Canongate car park, where parking is free.

Keith Mitchell picked up the ball on the left and released McFadyen down the left flank, from where he produced a fine low cross which substitute Donald McCallum struck low into the Neilston net with his left foot to make it -.But with some  minutes to play and the Pupils cruising, Neilston halved the deficit, a visiting striker gambling on Ferguson’s kick, and blocking it, the resulting break of the ball landing in his path for an easy finish, providing a leline to the men from East Renfrewshire.But their hopes of an equaliser would quickly fade, after a Neilston player-coach – already booked on the touchline for dissent ­– was sent off for a foul on Mitchell within a minute of entering the field of play.The same player then proceeded to throw a running punch as he left the field, before both teams became embroiled in an on-pitch melee.After the fisticuffs fizzled out, the game of football resumed and a healthy Kintyre Park crowd watched a settled final  minutes of action as the Pupils did enough to seal a welcome three points, over the team they had beaten on the road in front of the BBC Scotland cameras a month previously.Finally, midfielder Ryan Gilchrist, enjoying a regularto first-team action, was given the man-of-the-match award, with the creative energy of McFadyen another highlight for the Pupils.Tomorrowthe Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils travel to Busby on league duty, with kick-off at pm.

Every year, as the summer faded into autumn, it gave its gt of apples to anyone who happened to pass. Children from the local village who were always hungry would sit under it and eat ripe apples until they had tummy ache. Old folk would come and collect the apples to make pies, sauces and chutney.When the apples from the lower branches had been eaten, the children would climb and pick the ones higher up. It was a game to catch them and put them in a basket.There were so many apples that the older children had to carry the heavy baskets down to the village and shared the apples with everyone.The tree gave so many apples that everyone in the village had as many as they could eat or use. There were always plenty left over on the ground for the animals and insects who also feasted on the fallen ripe fruit. Thankfully nobody owned the tree, it had seeded itself many years ago on the verge of the road that led to the village.Then one year, a traveller arrived just as the apple tree was beginning to bear fruit. He sat under the tree and admired the beauty of it. The apples were ripening in the sun and one of them fell by his feet. He picked it up and ate it. It was crisp and sweet and really delicious.A group of children arrived from the village. ldquoHello mister, they said with a smile, ldquowersquove come to pick apples. They set about picking the most reachable ripe apples, while of course eating some of them in the process.ldquoWhat delicious apples, I must tell my we and children about them, said the traveller as he set off along the road.ldquoHere, said one of the children, holding out a handful of apples. ldquoThese are really ripe, give them to your family. We have more than enough to carry.The traveller smiled. ldquoHow kind, he said. He put them in his pockets and went on his way.But that evening, the child who had given the apples to the traveller was chastised by her parents. ldquoWhy did you do that  Now that man will come back with his family and take our apples.ldquoBut the tree gives us more apples than we can eat, the girl said, ldquosurely a few can be shared with people outside the village. Besides, the tree is by the side of the road, arenrsquot the apples for everyone, thatrsquos what yoursquove always said ldquoYes, they are for everyone, her father replied, ldquobut not just for anyone.His daughter was confused by this answer she didnrsquot understand what it meant. However, it seemed such a small and unimportant issue that she said nothing more of it. She knew that there would be more than enough apples for everyone, and even anyone.A few days later, when the girlrsquos grandmother went to collect ripe apples for a pie, she met the stranger with his we and two children. They had a small basket full of apples. The family were friendly and greeted the grandmother, but she ed a forced smile. She quickly collected her apples and rushed home.She told about the strangerrsquos family collecting the apples and the girlrsquos father was angry.ldquoSee, he said to his daughter, ldquoI told you they were not for just anyone. Now there will be none left for everyone .But his daughter was still confused. There were always many hundreds of apples. ldquoYou are young and donrsquot understand, he said. ldquoTomorrow we will get up early and make sure we can collect our share of the apples.The following day the family were up at the crack of dawn. They took all the baskets they could and went to the apple tree. Their neighbours peered out of the window, wondering what the family were doing.Then they saw them at the apple tree, filling many baskets of ripe apples. Later in the morning, some children from the village joined them.One of them went to pick up an apple that had just fallen. But the grandmother rushed and snatched it first and put it in her basket. So the child just smiled and gently shook a branch and another fell.When the familyrsquos baskets were full, they carried them back to the house. But it took them three trips, and the father left his daughter to guard the full baskets while he and the rest of the family carried as much they could.ldquoWhy are you collecting so many apples at once  asked one of her friends.The young girl nibbled her lip and looked at the ground. ldquoDonrsquot know really. My father says Irsquom too young to understand, but he says the apples are for everyone but not just anyone.ldquoWhorsquos anyone then She looked up and shook her head: ldquoNot sure, but anyone is taking our apples so we have to get them first.When the children of the village ed home with their apples, they told their parents what had happened.ldquoAnyone is taking our apples, so there will not be enough for everyone.The next day, more families got up early and set off for the apple tree.This time, the apple picking was very dferent to the way it had always been. In the past, people would pick the apples with each other, because everyone knew there was enough to go round. This time they were picking them for themselves.Fights started and people began to pull apples that were not ripe. So many people climbed onto the branches to get the apples that the tree started to creak.Soon, not a single apple remained on the tree. For the first time ever, there were none left for the animals or insects. Some peoplersquos homes were so full of apples that they hardly had room to move inside the house.Other people, who were not quick enough, had no apples at all. Some of these were people who really needed the apples. But those who had many wouldnrsquot share them for fear that anyone would get them.The houses of the people who collected more apples than they needed became full of fruit flies and other insects as their piles of apples began to rot.But the next year, everyone was ready. They had made big baskets and were determined not to miss out. But when they arrived at the tree it was surrounded by a hastily built wall with a guard at the gate.ldquoWho has done this  they cried.It was the king. He had heard of the apple tree and how crisp and sweet the apples were, so much so that people would fight and hoard the fruit. So, as the richest and most powerful man in the kingdom, he decided he would make sure the apples graced his table.ldquoBut there are more apples than the king can eat! protested the people.ldquoIndeed, said the guard ldquoand the King is generous. He will sell you the apples he does not need.ldquoSell them  But the apples have always been free for everyone!ldquoNot any more, said the guard.The young girl went up to her father. ldquoNow I understand, she said, ldquoanyone is the king."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-gp-practices-east-lothian-introduce-new-measures","story":"North Berwick Health Centre has announced that none of its registered patients have tested positive for coronavirus and asked that people phone the Edington Hospital in advance before paying it a visit.Those who think they have been in contact with someone with the virus are asked to not visit the surgery and phone  for advice.From Monday , all GP and advanced nurse practitionerappointment requests will be triagedby phone call.Lammermuir Medical Practice in Haddington has also taken this approach.People who call either practice will be asked for a summary of their symptoms, information about recent travel andthey have been in direct contact with a person that has been tested positive for coronavirus.The inidualrsquos GP will thenthe call anddeemed safe and necessary, they will then be given an appointment for that afternoon.Those with pre-booked appointments with a GP will be contacted by the health centre to discuss arrangements.North Berwick Health Centre has removed its self check in service -people now have to check in with a receptionist.It has also launched a new online prescription ordering service, those not registered can visit northberwickhealthcentre.scot.nhs.uk news,.htm, download a form, fill it in and hand it in.Lammermuir Medical Practice has also disabled its online appointment service.Tranent Medical Practice has made its surgery pod, a self-service device that allows patients to get their weight and blood pressure checked, unavailable for use.Those with routine appointments at Harbours Medical Practice in Cockenzie are asked to phone the practice, pressing option two, as it is making changes to its routine appointment system.It has also asked that people with symptoms, those who have had contact with an infected person or those who have been in an affected place to not enter any of its buildings.Prestonpans Group Practice has also given this advice and asked that evenpeople have mild symptoms they should not visit the surgery.Meanwhile, Orchard Medical Practice in Haddington is asking all patients not to attend the practice but instead to phone to request an appointment.

Two alleged criminals are placed in isolation. Both care more about their personal freedom than solidarity with their accomplice. The prosecutor offers each the same deal:you confess and your accomplice remains silent all charges will be dropped against you and your testimony used to send your accomplice to jail for a long time the same appliesthe accomplice confesses and you choose to stay silentboth confess they will get early parole andboth remain silent the prosecutor will settle for token punishments.The crux of the dilemma is that whatever the other does, each is better off confessing than remaining silent. But the outcome obtained when both confess is worse for each than the outcome they would have obtained had both remained silent.The irony is that because neither trusts the other to \"do the right thing\" , both choose to act in their own self-interest - and end up worse off.Soyou want to understand why hoardes of panic buyers are clearing the shelves of pasta, paracetamol and antibacterial hand gel despite retailers assuring them that there is no need, and why they feel able to dismiss thoughts of elderly or more vulnerable people unable to load up a car or to afford huge stockpiles, the Prisoners Dilemma is a pretty good illustration.They are behaving selfishly because they expect that everyone  will too. Perhaps they are simply scared and want to ensure their family is protected. But the fundamental point is a lack of trust between iniduals.I may be wrong, but I am not aware tales of panic buying and stockpiling being reported in Asian nations such as China, Japan and South Korea.But when coronavirus swept through the West, one of the first things citizens of Australia, Europe and the US did was to plunder the supermarket shelves.Perhaps it is a marker of our contrasting cultural norms : the West values liberty and celebrates inidualism East Asian traditions seek to balance the interests of the inidual with their wider community, with each person seeing themselves in the context of their family, neighbourhood, and nation and encouraged to be mindful of others in whatever they say and do.It is notable that when a World Health Organisation team was parachuted into China in February on a fact-finding mission, its experts came back describing that everywhere they went they encountered \"a sense of responsibility and collective action\".All over China, not just in the epicentre of Hubei province, people had voluntarily quarantined themselves and were cooperating with neighbourhood leaders appointed to ensure that people complied with instructions to self-isolate or socially distance themselves as much as possible.Yes, of course Chinas Communist political system makes it easier to implement and enforce stringent lockdowns.But now the democracies of Europe are fast realising that these same tough measures will be the only way to curtail a virus that has no respect for cultural values or borders.Italy, the worst hit country in Europe and the first in the continent to impose a lockdown, is beginning to see signs that the spread is slowing. The most recent -hour data showed that Italy recorded , new cases on Tuesday - a rise of .% on the day before and the slowest rate of increase since the contagion first emerged.The deadly Spanish Flu outbreak in  already showed us the value of of early intervention. In the US, St Louis cancelled events, closed schools, churches, and theatres, and imposed tough social distancing restrictions two days after the the first cases were reported.Philadelphia delayed doing the same by more than two weeks, with authorities downplaying the signicance and allowing a city-wide parade to take place.The result  In Philadelphia the death rate from pneumonia and influenza peaked at  per , compared to  per , in St Louis.We know it works, but authorities also know it is hard for people to obey. For now the public are told that they \"should\" stay away from crowded spaces.But when I walked home last night there were people in bars and pubs, because - as we know already - people are selfish. Until pubs are forcibly closed, this will continue.The best advice is to behave asyou are already infected because \"no man is an island\" and our behaviour, however innocuous it might seem, could have unforeseen and catastrophic consequences on others."},{"url":null,"title":"alex-salmond-trial-accuser-was-not-dinner-said-attended","story":"Samantha Barber, , said she did not see the alleged victim, who cannot be named for legal reasons and is known as Woman H, at the former first ministers official residence that evening.She told the High Court in Edinburgh: \"I absolutely genuinely have no recollection of seeing [Woman H] that night.\"Mr Salmond, , is accused of attempting to rape Woman H in a Bute House bedroom in June .The alleged incident is said to have occurred after a dinner attended by a celebrity.Woman H, a former Scottish Government official, previously told the court she felt \"hunted\" by Mr Salmond, who \"full-on pounced\" on her and took her clothes off.Mr Salmond denies the allegation, which he previously called a ldquofabrication, and says Woman H was angry after he failed to back her in a personal political project.He also denies a further allegation that he assaulted the same woman the previous month.Giving evidence on Tuesday, he said Woman H was not at Bute House on the night of the dinner in June .He said he had a \"consensual sexual liaison\" with her the previous year.Ms Barber, a company director, said she was asked to attend the Bute House dinner at short notice by Woman H, who indicated she would not be attending.The defence witness said she arrived at Bute House just after pm, and only three people were at the dinner ndash herself, Mr Salmond and the celebrity.One bottle of wine was served during the meal, she said, and the conversation ranged from the celebritys work to the upcoming Scottish independence referendum.Ms Barber said she did not drink any wine because she was driving, and the evening \"drew naturally to a close\" at around pm.She then went home, leaving Mr Salmond and the celebrity at Bute House.Shelagh McCall QC, Mr Salmonds lawyer, askedonly three people had been at the dinner.Ms Barber said: \"That is my recollection, yes.\"Alex Prentice QC, the prosecution lawyer, later questioned why Ms Barber had sought advice before giving a statement to police.The businesswoman said: \"I wanted to take advice to understand the judicial process.

A myth maker. Unpleasant. Genius.

Their spot over, Mr Perry said he was walking down the stairs from the studio when he felt Mr Cummingsrsquo hands on his shoulders. ldquoHe was trying to push me down the steps, he claimed. At the bottom of the stairs he said he turned to confront Mr Cummings only for the younger man to seize him by the tie, push him against the wall and raise his fist. Mr Cummings said they had merely stumbled into each other.: Holyrood spring conferences axedThe programme asked what Mr Cummingsrsquo ldquoextraordinary rise told us about how politics was changing. Its central idea was that he was among the first to detect and then ride the wave of populism that led, among other things, to Brexit and the election of Boris Johnson. Scotland played a part in this tale in as much as Mr Cummings, then working for Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith, suggested his boss visit Easterhouse in a bold move to show how the party had changed. Easterhouse, then, was the early prototype for the ldquored wall that delivered a huge majority for Mr Johnson in .Going back to those one word assessments of Mr Cummings, Irsquom with the journalist Peter Obone who described him as ldquodull. It is hard to take seriously the idea of Mr Cummings as a genius, the sage of Downing Street, in large part because he has committed the most basic error of any adviser and become the story. Being visible, he is expendable.Moreover, one cannot help thinking thathe was that smart he would be in Boris Johnsonrsquos job and have a lackey of his own. Mr Cummings is not the messiah. Hersquos not even an especially naughty boy . He just happens to be the latest catnip mouse for the media to play with till it gets bored.: Schools to close by end of weekThe main feeling on watching Maitlisrsquos documentary was that the concerns it highlighted were dated and irrelevant. Not so much five minutes ago as five months. Much has been made of how the coronavirus crisis is changing our lives and will have a long term impact in ways we have yet to fully appreciate. I donrsquot know. The triumph and tragedy of humans is that fundamentally we do not change that much. Capable of great kindness and empathy, as in the many people who are volunteering to help others, they can also be the same grubby, panic-buying shower to be seen in every supermarket.That said, the crisis is having an impact on politics. I donrsquot mean the suspension of party hostilities. That will not last. As yesterdayrsquos PMQs showed, there is growing pressure on the UK government to help the poorest and most vulnerable to the same extent that it is aiding business.The crisis is, however, shaping the way Mr Johnson does political business, from the new ministerial structures and implementation committees to the daily televised press briefing. I would not be surprisedthese White House-style events became permanent fixtures, like televised debates during elections, in London and Edinburgh. Any chance to hold governments to account is good for democracy.One way and another, the man who a couple of weeks ago was being slated by critics as a part-time Prime Minister is putting in quite the sht.So, too, is Nicola Sturgeon, and though it is hardly a competition she is coming out of the process better. All over the world the virus crisis is testing leaders and governments as never before. Whatrsquos that Warren Buffett quote  ldquoOnly when the tide goes out do you discover whorsquos been swimming naked.Thus we have the so-called strongmen of politics, from the US president down, exposed as vacillating and unconvincing. The most prized government commodity today is trust, and we can see who inspires it and who does not. Mr Johnson is beginning to look tired and bowed. If this crisis does prove to be a marathon not a sprint he needs to pace himself.If the past weeks show anything about politics it is that in times of stre people still look to inidual leaders for guidance. No-one ever responded to a crisis by saying, ldquoSend for the PMrsquos chief aide. That reliance on leaders is fine, as long as the right man or woman is in the job.From Edinburgh, London and Paris to Tehran, Washington and further afield, we will soon see the proof of that."},{"url":null,"title":"neil-mackay-learn-love-lockdown-8-tips-surviving-life-home","story":"Then yoursquore walking through a supermarket ndash its empty shelves like missing teeth in a mouth ndash and eyeing an old lady piling toilet paper, oil, beans, soap, flour and rice into her trolley.

You get visions of the last scene from Threads ndash of you and your family being hunted by feral children through the smoking ruins of Scotland.And now yoursquove got lockdown to contend with. Whatrsquos that going to be like  Yoursquore worried that yoursquoll turn into Jack Nicholson from The Shining, or have to start drinking from the toilet when the water supply cuts off. Will there be enough wine to get you through this I may not be able to help you with schools and John Swinney, or rampaging old ladies, or people walking around in actual face masks terrorising the hell out of everyone, but I can help you with the lockdown. If itrsquos scaring you, find a freelance writer like me and just ask them what they do with their lives. Yoursquoll be reassured.Freelance writers are the Mozarts of self-isolation and social distancing. We spend most of our existence in one room ndash which wersquove the audacity to refer to as an office, when in fact itrsquos just a filthy cell with a desk. We usually see no-one from dawn until dusk. Wersquore basically vampires who like books.Surprisingly, although it may sound like a vacation in hell, this le is reasonably good fun. However, to be fair, my experience of home-working hasnrsquot included a global pandemic until now. Still, I think yoursquoll find being holed up in your own house not half as bad as you imagine.So herersquos a few tips of mine on learning to love the lockdown. Itrsquos all about food.Breakfast light as lunch will become one of the main events of your day. Lunch will take on a religious dimension ndash as itrsquos an excuse to get away from your desk. Be playful ndash therersquos nothing wrong with a baked bean toasted sandwich, with a fried egg on top.You can now enjoy cooking for others too. You donrsquot spend all day gossiping pointlessly in the office any more with people you pretend to like, so yoursquove got acres of time to make a decent dinner for your family, once your work is done.Ingredients may be hard to source during a pandemic, but therersquos plenty of wartime recipes online. Spam hash or potato rarebit anyone  Mmm, yes please. Dress.Only a fool spends their le in their pants. So even though you arenrsquot going anywhere, get up early, shower, make your bed and put on some clothes, please. Itrsquos too easy to turn into a delinquent tramp when yoursquore behind your own front door. You judge a person by how they dress, my grandmother always said. And shersquos right, particularly during a pandemic. She should know, she lived through Spanish Flu in . Boredom is good.Admit it ndash you fill your le with crap. Commutes you donrsquot want to take, meetings you donrsquot want to have. Learn to enjoy silence and doing nothing, evenjust for a little while. Itrsquos good for your brain ndash yoursquoll find yourself becoming more creative, and therefore maybe even more interesting, which will be a real bonus for the other people trapped in the house with you. Beware the internet.Once Irsquove read the papers in the morning, I do the rounds of ious websites that interest me ndash foreign media, podcasts, that kind of thing. But step carefully around wikipedia ndash one wrong click on one link thatrsquos just too interesting and you will be down a wiki-hole for hours and there may be no-one around to get you out. Yoursquoll eventually emerge knowing a lot more than you did about Panzer tanks, but that doesnrsquot pay the bills.Also, and this is just for us adults, I have it on good authority that there are certain sites that one can stumble upon online which are even more engaging that the wiki Panzer page. I speak here, obviously, of the saucier side of all things cyber. Avoid. Yoursquoll only end up a weak, desiccated, self-shaming husk at the end of a fruitless day. Result  Bills unpaid yet again. Men, women ndash you have been warned. Expand your horizons.It may sound counter-intuitive but when you live most of your le at home you really can skill up. Learn the guitar  Done it. A foreign language  Si. Be nice.When I spent my le in the rat race, I hardly had a moment for friends and family and especially neighbours. Well, yoursquoll have time now. Le as someone who works at home gave me so much more space to cement the relationships that really matter to me.Therersquos bound to be some old folk, or a single parent, or someone disabled in your street. Lockdown or no lockdown, let them know yoursquore therethey need you. Skype your pals. Irsquom having cocktails with an old mate this weekend via FaceTime as we canrsquot go to the pub. Donrsquot watch telly.Reading and good conversation are becoming lost arts. Now that yoursquore home all day, donrsquot just sit in front of Netflix eating Wotsits. Read books thatrsquoll take ages ndash David Copperfield, all the Game of Thrones novels. Have real conversations, not those empty conversations when you come home from work and just bitch about colleagues. Play games ndash dust off the old Risk. Enjoy the little things.Yoursquoll see your family more than you ever did before. Relish it. In truth, theyrsquore all yoursquove really got.Neil Mackay is Scotlandrsquos Columnist of the Year"},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/11167418.jpg?type=article-full","title":"news-seven-stories-not-coronavirus","story":"But the spread of a killer virus is not the only story on the planet right now.Weve compiled a few recent stories which are important, interesting and, crucially, not about the coronavirus.\" alt\"HeraldScotland: First Minister Nicola Sturgeon speaking during a press conference in Edinburgh \" class\"editor-image\"First Minister Nicola Sturgeon speaking during a press conference in Edinburgh A major academic report has claimed anindependentScotlandwould be fast-tracked into the EU.However, it would have to rejoin the Common Fisheries Policy and commit to using the euro.Accession could take four to five years, although reducing Scotlandrsquos deficit below the EU target could mean a severe ldquospending squeeze.Herald columnist Neil Cameron described the hire as a PR disaster for RangersA DUP councillor and senior Orange Order figure is going to quit his role on Belfast City Council to take up a role as head of communications at Rangers.David Graham will replace Jim Traynor as the new media supremo at Ibrox after standing down from his position as a councillor of the Balmoral district of the Northern Irish capital.Traynor announced his intention to leave Ibrox when his contract expires in May after an eventful eight years in the role.Paul McCartney is perhaps the most famous bass player on the planetBass guitarists could be about to step out of the shadows and take centrestagethanks to the pioneering work of Scottish scientists.Dr Jonathan Kemp of the University of St Andrewsrsquo School of Physics and Astronomy has developed revolutionary strings using which allow bassists to play higher notes than before ndash and in a more pleasing harmony.The better-sounding guitar was created by a Scottish team who tweaked the production process.\" alt\"HeraldScotland: The beloved red squirrel has suffered decades of decline \" class\"editor-image\"The beloved red squirrel has suffered decades of decline It was feared Scotlandrsquos red squirrels were on an inexorable path to extinction.But fresh hope has been sparked after a survey indicated the iconic rodentrsquos population in many parts of the country remained stable last year.A group calledSaving Scotlandrsquos Red Squirrels even said the animalrsquos non-native grey cousin was being pushed out of several areas.Scotlandis home to  per cent of the UKrsquos red squirrels but their numbers have fallen to just ,, largely due to the spread of greys.Alex Salmond is on trial at the High Court in Edinburgh Today, a court heard thata woman Alex Salmond is accused of attempting to rape was not at a Bute House dinner on the night the offence is said to have occurred.Mr Salmond faces multiple charges of sexual assault including an attempted rape.

ldquopaused work on preparing for Indyref in late .He said the government would focus its resources on coping with the health crisis instead.ldquoIt follows from this that a referendum will not take place this year, he said.The announcement followed a series of recent admissions from senior SNP figures that the outbreak had scuppered any chance of nation-wide campaign in the short term.Ms Sturgeon had wanted to revisit the No vote of  in the second half of this year, steppingup her demands for iton the back of the SNPrsquos gains in the general election.However Boris Johnson blocked her request for Holyrood to be given the required powers.Despite the Prime Ministerrsquos refusal, Ms Sturgeon had continued to maintain that Indyref remained a live possibility this year.Even in the face ofthe pandemic, her Westminster leader Ian Blackford said as recently as the weekend, that a date this year remained the SNPrsquos plan.However former SNP health minister Alex Neil later rubbished the timetable, saying the chances of another vote on the constitution this year were ldquozilch.Former SNP depute candidate Chris McEleny also said it was not ldquowise or possible to have a national campaign, with thousands of doorstep conversations, during the outbreakevenMr Johnson suddenly changed his position and backed a referendum.Mr Russell set out the decision in a letter to Cabinet office minister Michael Gove, in which he saidthe UK Government should likewise pause its Brexit negotiations with the EU.Mr Johnson has previously insisted that the UK Government will not extend the negotiating phase on future trade relations beyond the end of .The deadline for asking the EU for an extension is July.Mr Russell also said the government had told the Electoral Commission it need not test the question for Indyref ldquountil public health circumstances permit such activity.The Scottish Government had wanted the watchdog to re-test the question of , ldquoShould Scotland be an independent country  Yes or No for intelligibility.Mr Russell wrote: ldquoBecause of the crisis, the Scottish Government has paused work on preparing for an independence referendum this year.ldquoWe have also written to the Electoral Commission to make clear we do not expect it to undertake testing of a referendum question until public health circumstances permit such activity .ldquoThat will allow us to focus all available resource on current and future demands in what is an unprecedented set of circumstances.ldquoIt follows from this that a referendum will not take place this year.Turning to Brexit, Mr Russell adde: ldquoWe would now strongly suggest to the UK Government that the time has come for an equivalent action by you with regard to the Brexit process, and would ask you to institute a pause to EU UK negotiations for at least six months.ldquoIt would seem impossible for business and others to cope with the enormous challenge ofCoronavirus while at the same time preparing for a completely new relationship with the EU in nine monthsrsquo time.ldquoA pause is also necessary given the inevitable lack of parliamentary and public scrutiny of the negotiations and their progress over that period, when all attention and effort will be focused on our collective actions to tackle and defeat the Coronavirus.Tory MSP Murdo Fraser said: ldquoThis is very welcome news and will come as a relief to workers and businesses alike.ldquoSince the scale of this outbreak became clear, itrsquos been necessary for all governments and political parties to work together.ldquoThis announcement from Mike Russell is very much in keeping with that spirit.ldquoNow we can really dedicate all our efforts to enduring this crisis, supporting those who will be

It would be sensible to put all our energies to working together across Europe and the world.A Scottish Greens spokesperson said: ldquoIt is right that the Scottish Government prioritises its resources to deal with the public health crisis that we all face.ldquoThe way we live our lives has changed and will continue to be dramatically impacted over the coming months.ldquoClearly this unprecedented situation will demand all the attention of the Scottish and UK governments, and many important issues from independence to Brexit will not be progressed for the time being.Pamela Nash, chief executive of Scotland in Union, said:ldquoThis is a sensible announcement from the Scottish Government.ldquoAt this worrying time, the Scottish and UK governments must work together in the interests of every citizen in the United Kingdom.ldquoScotland in Union has already paused all campaigning and would like to thank everyone who is working on the frontline in the NHS and everyone who is volunteering to help in their communities.Scottish Labour MP Ian Murray added: ldquoThis is the right decision by the SNP government, but it should never have devoted resources to an unwanted second independence referendum in the first place. This is no time for constitutional politics.ldquoNot only should there be no second independence referendum, the Brexit timeline should also be extended.ldquoIt was already virtually impossible to secure a deal that protects businesses and workers, and now there is zero chance of securing that before the end of the year."},{"url":null,"title":"i-lived-rationing-elderly-shoppers-react-mass-panic-buying","story":"As supermarkets enforce rationing and pictures show increasingly empty shelves, for older people in the community their regular shop has become a stressful ordeal.Their thanks, then, go to the chain Iceland, which has introduced a Wednesday morning golden hour from am til am exclusively for the elderly and vulnerable.From am until am elderly shoppers are given priority, although anyone is welcome.: Care home residents pen touching messages to loved ones amid coronavirus isolationldquoThis is fabulous, absolutely super, said Sheena Mitchell, .ldquoItrsquos a wonderful thing to do and it means you wonrsquot be fighting with everybody .ldquoI find that in the shops you just canrsquot get the things you went out for.

Her tone throughout has been firm, calm, and her words realistic. Morale in Scotland is unlikely the worse for her public statements on this crisis of health and wellbeing.It must be the case that she has been a welcome presence at the Cobra meetings in Downing Street, and it should be recognised post-the-crisis that normalcy in Scotlands presence as a self-ruling member of the worlds nations will similarly be a bonus whenever member nations of the UN meet in discussion of urgent matters.Ian Johnstone, Peterhead.COUNCILLOR Alex Gallagherseems to think that striving for national unity or independence, as in Scottish nationalism, somehow prevents co-operation or working together for a common cause, i.e. the defeat of the coronavirus. There is no reason to suppose that an independent Scotland would be devoid of entente cordiale and fail to join other nations in the global fight against this nasty virus.

Furthermore, she appears to be blissfully unaware about the comprehensive financial package to support businesses and iniduals which has been announced by the UK Governmentwith the promise of further action to follow when required. Furthermore, unlike Spain, we have a very low unemployment rateand a much better debt to GDP ratio which means we can borrow at a more attractive rates. We are also very fortunate we have our own currency and Central Bank and not under the control of the European Central Bank like Spain.Finally, let us hope there is not a repeat of the hundreds of thousands of people that fled Spain which followed the last financial crisis in  ndash after all, the Chancellor of the Exchequer said: ldquoThe coronavirus pandemic is a public health emergency but it is also an economic emergency.Ian Lakin, Aberdeen AB.ECONOMIES have a natural tendency to bounce back from a recession, regardless of the size of the initial shock. In modern times around  per cent lasted less than a year and only  per cent lasted for more than two years.Of course we need substantial policy easing, but were in a better position than it might appear at first sight, since our growth had pretty much petered out but our labour market is exceptionally strong.Unemployment rose a little but is still below four per cent and as we enter a period of economic dficulty whose depth andis unknown there are very much worse conditions in which to start, believe me.Dr John Cameron, St Andrews.BOTH Scottish and UK governments are making daily statements on subject of the coronavirus. Neither has given any indication that it intends to protect healthcare professionals who are \"in the front line\".As a retired pharmacist, I feel very strongly that no signicant protection has been offered to pharmacists and their staff who are exposed to \"the potentially infected\". Despite notices on shop windows such as \"We have no stock of masks, gloves and hand disinfectant\" they continue to come in and ask \"have you got...\". The GP practices and health centres have declared \" Gonnae No come here\" and this policy is supported by the Government.Pharmacy is at the front line. Each dispensary should be provided with a protective shield ndash a Perpsex bank-type barrier. All front-line pharmacy staff should have total facial protection, disposable gloves and gallons of disinfectant. I know that none of these protective elements is currently provided by the Government: I accept that the NHS cannot be held responsible for this failure.I would also point out that the owners of the pharmacies have not made any signicant attempts to protect their staff. What resource will patients havethe pharmacist has to be isolated Stewart MacPherson, Kilsyth.IN the torrent of instructions on ious media about Covid- all the focus seems to be on \"reducing person to person contact\", with very little on the dangers of touching a surface on which virus droplets have landed. But a major infection route seems to be from surface to hand to face. Hands can be washed and surfaces can be cleaned , but what is the relative frequency of infection by touch versus infection by coughed droplet  Are there some surfaces we should particularly avoid  Is it safer to purchase from an assistant using a contactless card, or via a smart pay machine where countless people have been touching the screen  Surely someone has researched this, for cold viruses and SARS viruses,not yet for Covid- There was a suggestion on the radio that shiny surfaces are the dangerous ones, with shiny hard plastic being worse than hard metal. It seems that any fabric or absorbent surface is much safer. Is this because they absorb the liquid in the droplet, leaving the virus vulnerable  If so, it would support what many people do, grasping door handles through a soft garment or glove.It would be good to read an article containing answers to questions such as these.Peter MD Gray, Aberdeen AB.THE news that Glasgows Night Shelter is to close early is a terrible indictment on our society . The Night Shelter opened early last November because the weather was so bad and now, when it is still needed, it is to close early. We have a duty to provide these people, the most vulnerable in our society, with somewhere to live and to provide shelter at night is the least we can do.Homeless people, because of their lestyle, already use our health and social services more than those of us who have somewhere to live. This is the time for empty buildings to be brought into use and food and shelter to be provided. Time for Glasgow City Council and other local authorities, with the support of the Scottish Government, to take urgent action to protect homeless people.Patricia Fort, Glasgow G.THERE seems to be some confusion, or perhaps wilful obtuseness, on the part of some presenters of Radio s Today and PM programmes. They keep using the pejorative term U-turn to describe a change of direction in Government reaction to the coronavirus situation. In science, when new data comes to light that an extant theory cannot accommodate then a new theory is sought that can accommodate that new data. We do not say that scientists have done a U-turn. When new data came along which Newtons theory of gravity could not accommodate, Einstein devised a new theory which could accommodate the new data. Einstein did not do a U-turn on Newtons theory.Doug Clark, Currie.NEWS reports have shown Italians applauding front-line health workers from balconies.While the streets in several countries hit by the present outbreak of the coronavirus are eerily almost empty of people, it is noticeable that they are also clear of piles of rubbish and litter.Malcolm Allan, Bishopbriggs.ALAN Fitzpatrickmakes a good point regarding the TV licence.But why not take it a bit further  As most sporting events are being cancelled, the BBC wont need its highly-remunerated sports staff , so why not send them home now and use the savings to fund free licences for the over-s until at least next year If pubs and restaurants are having to lay off staff, why shouldnt the BBC John F Crawford, Lytham.THE announcement that the BBC has suspended filming of EastEnders due to the coronavirus shows even the darkest cloud has a silver lining.Mark Boyle, Johnstone.Read more: Sturgeon formally drops plan for Indyref this year"},{"url":null,"title":"these are the 10 most popular dog breeds in the uk","story":"Research conducted by Dogfriendlycottages found that these are the  most popular dog breeds in the UK - do you agree .

Where services are completely suspended, a full refund will be applicable.Mr Hinkles continued: “I would strongly advise our affected customers to manage their booking through our website as we are experiencing exceptionally high call volumes into our call centre.“The situation is incredibly serious and alongside the obvious health and safety implications, puts the future of the entire aviation industry in jeopardy.#With this in mind, we have joined with other UK carriers to seek emergency measures from the Government to support all airlines in the sector.”Hinkles revealed that Loganair staff have been asked to consider a series of measures aimed at protecting employment levels — including reducing working hours by  per cent and accepting a  per cent reduction in salary as a result or taking a period of unpaid leave.He said: “We are working hard to avoid redundancies and lay-offs as have already been seen at major international airlines and as are likely to follow at several UK airlines in the coming days.”It is expected that a quarter of Loganair’s fleet of  aircraft will be put into temporary storage as a result of the schedule reductions.Full details of how to manage your booking are available on its website at www.loganair.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

NHS Orkney and the Scottish Government have previously indicated, however, that local testing figures will not be released — unless a positive result is confirmed.A statement released by the Scottish Government today announced that the programme of testing for coronavirus will be extended to GP practices, covering up to . million people across all health boards in Scotland.Folk presenting at practices with relevant symptoms, including with flu-like symptoms or general respiratory illness and underlying health conditions will be tested. The programme will also support the continued testing of people admitted to hospital with symptoms. However, those following the guidance to stay at home for seven daysthey have mild symptoms of a new cough or raised temperature will not be routinely tested – and will continue to be advised to only phone NHS  or contact the GPtheir condition worsens.NHS Orkney announced yesterday that, GP practices in Orkney will be changing the way they offer and book appointments to reduce the number of patients attending face to face appointments when they do not need to be examined, from Monday, March . If your GP Practice has previously offered the ability to book appointments online this will stop with immediate effect.In a statement on social media, the health authority explained: #If you are experiencing symptoms of COVID-you should self-isolate for  days avoiding contact with other people wherever possible. If after  days or you continue to feel unwell and may need to see a GP, please call and speak to your GP practice.#Prior to an appointment being made a member of your GP Practice may call you to clary whether you have symptoms of COVID-. Following an initial conversation your GP Practice will advise on the most appropriate course of action.#To support in delaying the spread of COVID- we ask that you do NOT attend your GP Practice unless you have been asked to do so.#All appointment requests, repeat prescription requests and general enquiries should be made by calling your GP Practice.#If you already have an appointment booked, your Practice will be in contact with youthey need to change your appointment.#If you are currently being visited by our Community Nursing team you may be contacted to check there is no one in your household showing symptoms of COVID-.#The government believes that surveillance testing will provide real-time information on how the virus is spreading in Scotland, which will inform NHS planning and allow resources to be directed where they are needed most. It has confirmed that key workers such as NHS staff will continue to be testedthey show symptoms.Scotland’s chief medical officer, Dr Catherine Calderwood said: “This new approach to testing will enable us to understand the pattern and spread of coronavirus in the community, to develop a clear assessment of the situation and to predict the peak number of cases, without having to test everyone with possible symptoms.“Those with mild symptoms do not need to be tested. They should continue to stay at home for seven days and only contact their GP or their condition worsens.“Everybody has a role to play in helping contain this outbreak by following the latest health advice and basic hygiene precautions such as washing hands frequently, not touching their face and covering their nose and mouth with a tissue when coughing or sneezing.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

We are also increasing our staffing numbers across all disciplines.”NHS Orkney, Orkney Islands Council and the Integration Joint Boardare working very closely to ensure that our planning arrangements are comprehensive and to the very highest standard.”As ever, the response and action of the entire workforce has been overwhelming and the people of Orkney should take a great deal of assurance and pride from that fact.”NHS Orkney has also echoed national advice stating that folk should stay at home and self-isolate for seven daysthey display symptoms of the virus.The spokeswoman said: “All people with a new continuous cough and or high temperature , regardless of their travel history or contact with confirmed cases, should stay at home for seven days, do not come into the hospital and be aware you will not be tested.”If people are concerned about more serious symptoms ortheir symptoms worsen, they are advised to contact their GP in hours, or out of hours NHS on .”Again we ask that people stay home unless the GP or out of hours service suggests otherwise.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

That means we will continue to plan and prepare for the weeks ahead, working closely with our NHS partners and following national guidance on public health.“Our aim is to ensure the resilience measures we have in place best meet the needs of our local community and minimise disruption as far as possible to the services we provide.#There has been widespread concern regarding visiting cruise ships and the OIC has faced criticism for not shutting its ports.Council leader James Stockan moved to reassure the Orkney public.He said: “Elected members met our senior management team to review the extensive steps already taken to prepare for the likely impact on Orkney of the coronavirus pandemic.#I believe the organisation is well prepared to respond effectively to what is a fast-changing situation.“I am aware there is concern in our community about visits to Orkney by cruise ships. No other port in Scotland has stopped such visits and we are following national guidance on this.“We have had port health procedures in place for many years for dealing with cases of infection aboard ships of all kind. These procedures are aimed at preventing infection coming into the country.”All cruise ships have been asked to provide a maritime declaration of health before visiting Orkney, whether or not they have any illness on board.Cruise companies are already well underway with cancelling voyages.The council saysthere was a suspected case of Covid- aboard a ship, the council’s port health and NHS Orkney’s public health teams would work in conjunction with Health Protection Scotland and the Scottish Government to decide on the best course of action to take.If a situation of this kind arose, the most likely outcome is that the ship would be redirected to a port on the Scottish Mainland close to more specialist health facilities, OIC adds.Councillor Stockan added: “Although there has been a focus on cruise ships, people do of course travel to and from Orkney by other means — and that makes it very dficult to prevent the spread of the virus into the county.#This makes it all the more important that we as a council — and our wider community — do all that we can to reduce the potential impact on us all.”To help prevent the spread of the coronavirus, and to protect local communities as far as is practicable, OIC is only allowing travel by staff and elected members to meetings and training events on the Scottish Mainland in exceptional circumstances.In Orkney, councillors and staff will not be attending community council and other public meetings.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

We want to reassure you that we are prepared.Dame Gillian Guy, the head of Citizens Advice, said: ldquoKeeping people on supply, making sure they have warm homes and donrsquot face additional financial or other stresses about their energy supply will be essential.Experts say that while energy suppliers might need to change the way they buy energy from the wholesale market slightly, Britainrsquos gas and electricity grids should be able to keep the lights running during the crisis without much problem.And having people stuck at home might even out the peaks in the evening when people usually come back from work, when the strain on the energy system is at its highest.Meanwhile, as offices and factories shut down, daytime energy use is likely to fall slightly, even as more energy is used in British homes.ldquoTherersquos a bit of a question as to whether itrsquos more efficient to be heating one building with  people in, or  people heating their houses inidually, and the answer is probably no, said Rik Smith, an energy expert at Uswitch.But ldquoI wouldnrsquot expect it to be increasing the peak, he added.ldquoFrom that perspective I wouldnrsquot expect any material strain or additional sht, he told the PA news agency.But when taking into account industrial production, ldquooverall demand on the grid would be reduced, Mr Smith said.One of the bigger problems may be that customers who would normally rely on heating and lighting in their place of work will find their energy bills have increased at the end of the month.ldquoThis could mean that companies are money likely to experience bad debt hellip and that could place a strain on some of the businesses, Mr Smith said.Energy suppliers themselves had already been sending advice to customers. Last week, Bulb sent an email to pre-pay customers to ldquotop up more than usualyou can in case they have to self-isolate and cannot leave the house.Reports had already said that some suppliers were considering delaying payments.Anna Moss, at Cornwall Insight, said: ldquoSelf-isolating or working from home may mean consumers are using more energy, which for some consumers will pass through quickly to their energy bills. For those customers that fall into the vulnerable bracket, this can be daunting and dficult to manage.Mr Smith warned that coronavirus might also impact the Governmentrsquos already delayed rollout of smart meters.ldquoPeople at home might go: lsquoActually Irsquom ill, the installer probably doesnrsquot want to come into my housersquo, he said.copy -.

Van Morrison – Tupelo Honey, lesser known song from the Belfast Cowboy that in all the times I have seen him live, he has naturally never played!. The Waterboys – Whole of the Moon - just a wonderful anthem of my youth and still such a great song today, took me a long time to realise the lyric was a comparison between two people, “I see the crescent, you see the whole of the moon”. Sam Baker – Broken Fingers, a Texan who “got caught up in someone ’s war” after terrible injuries learned to play the guitar again and wrote this song about the process, read the back story before listening.. Dr Feelgood – All Through the City – first live band I seen in Belfast at  years old, had a huge impact on me and after all these years, Jim Bolan thank you for taking me!. Foy Vance – Two Shades of Hope – a wonderful singer songwriter from our wee country, and what a song!. Linda Rondstadt – Your No Good - I have probably bought this album times in dferent formats, loved it from no age.. David Bowie – Heroes - A song and artist who came alive for me when I went to Live Aid with John Connor in , best performance of the day . Bap Kennedy – Working Man – from the fantastic Sailors Revenge album, sadly Bap is not with us anymore, greatly missed. Was lucky enough to have him play at my th birthday party in the BT club, Vincent Close got him to do some Energy Orchard stuff!.

His mother had told him to run to her brother’s house to find refuge: the military had already come in the night and killed his father and his brother, and he was likely to be in similar danger. That night, the military forced his mother to sign over ownership of their family farm to the state.Eskander had been imprisoned for four months in an underground prison in Ethiopia without his family’s knowledge, almost one hundred miles away from their farmstead in Dima. Dima is in the Ethiopian regional state of Oromia, the homeland of the Oromo people: a large minority ethnic group who have been subject to political oppression, cultural suppression and the victims of internment and state violence. He had been taking part in a student protest at the technical college where he was studying electrical engineering, carrying a placard that read Stop Killing Oromo People, when the military arrived and opened fire on the protest group. Between forty and fty of the students were arrested and taken to a military camp. From there, he was sent to the underground prison where he was beaten with sticks, cut with knives and tortured with hot metal bars. His body is still marked with the scars from this torture. All of this happened in , and the following year, after he’d lived in hiding with his uncle for five months, his mother sold her possessions to raise funds for Eskander to escape Ethiopia to the relative safety of South Sudan.In April  he left Ethiopia. This was only the beginning of a decade of turmoil that saw the teenage college student progress through his twenties working for two years without pay on a building site in Sudan, imprisoned in Libya by people smugglers, crossing the Mediterranean in a plastic dinghy, being subjected to a brutal assault by a group of men in Italy, living in a bus station near Milan and spending time in Direct Provision in Monaghan before finally boarding a bus to seek a new le of safety in Belfast in April . He claimed asylum, but refugee status and the stability that comes with it has not yet been granted.All of this was written in a statement he’d made for the Home Office through an interpreter. It will form part of his application to be granted five years leave to remain. He sat in silence as I read it all in a coffee shop on the Ormeau Road along with our running coach at Annadale Striders, Michael McKnight. We had gotten to know Eskander well in the preceding year and his positivity and enthusiasm for running had won us over. The scale of the horror he’d been through was until then unknown to us. After he arrived in Ireland, a doctor in the south suggested that running would be a good way of helping to manage the trauma of his experiences, and he was a natural.“I ran my first race on St Patrick’s Day, , in Dublin, with no training,” he told me, “and I ran eighteen minutes for k.

His dedication to running is unwavering, and to those who know his story his successes have been inspirational. He has been on the podium of many road races in the north, including the Laganside k and the Armagh International k, and has matched the course record time at Ormeau Parkrun. The week after he matched the record, dragging me along with him to a personal best of under sixteen minutes, the two of us ed and he was treated like a celebrity: I was approached by several people excitedly asking “do you think Eskander can break the record this time ”For all his talent on the road, it’s cross-country racing where he really shines. At the McConnell Shield race in Ballyclare, one of the north’s oldest and most prestigious races, he put in a stellar performance against some of our best runners. When I crossed the line at that race, Paul Lawther, an original Annadale Strider, and a one-time NI record holder at every distance from m to ,m, immediately said to me with sheer delight: “Did you see what Eskander just did ” He had put a ten second gap on the field in the last four hundred metres, beating two Northern Ireland international athletes. Recently, he finished in second place overall at the prestigious NI and Ulster Senior Cross- Country Championship.It would appear that this is barely scraping the surface of his potential. Michael McKnight has talked with Athletics NI officials about Eskander’s talents and the international representation that could easily follow. Eskander himself dreams of running for Ireland at the European Cross-Country Championships.“I want to make a story for Belfast, for athletics and for Ireland,” he told me.For any of that to happen he needs to negotiate the dficult process of gaining refugee status. He often jokes with me that next year he’s “going to Kenya to train withEliud Kipchoge”, but when it comes down to it he says that what he really wants is “independence and safety, to be free from distress and to be able to breathe in peace again”.Eskander’s gentle manner belies the deep effects of the events of the last decade, of the toll they have taken on his body and mind. He tells me that he continues to require medication to manage the effects of the trauma, to cope with depression and to allow him to sleep. He feels that this is his last chance to make a le for himself he is committed to studying several days each week in Belfast Met, developing his spoken and written English. He tells me that he cherishes his friends and the sense of community he has found in Belfast, that he has been accepted to continue with his study of electrical engineering that was ended abruptly at the time of his imprisonment, but it depends on the Home Office’s decision.

West Belfast is continually at the bottom of Invest NI inward investor figures for the city.West Belfast MP Paul Maskey told the Andersonstown News that he has already requested a meeting with the newly appointed Invest NI CEO Kevin Holland to discuss his concerns and how the agency has “treated West Belfast over the years”.“It is clear that these figures highlight the inequalities in certain areas,” he said.“Invest NI have a history of igoring areas like West Belfast over the years and I will be stating that quite clearly at the meeting. Thankfully the unemployment rate in West Belfast has reduced in recent years, but it could be further reducedInvest NI stepped up to the mark and brought potential investors to this part of the city.“I will also be raising with them about their lands in West Belfast and what they plan to do to ensure they are used and developed to assist future investors. I will be insisting the new CEO recies this ongoing inequality as a matter of urgency.”SDLP representative Paul Doherty said that with signicantly less inward investment visits taking place here than in other parts of the city, West Belfast is yet again “being left behind”.“We want to see all of Belfast prosper, but this is simply unacceptable given the level of high unemployment and ongoing disadvantage experienced by the people of West Belfast.“I will be calling for an urgent meeting with Invest NI to seek clarity on why West Belfast continues to receive unfair treatment. Invest NI has a responsibility to target areas of need and I will be making it clear to them that they must ensure that West Belfast is given greater priority going forward.”The local rep said it is understandable why Invest NI have come under pressure to change the way they operate.“These figures are testimony to that. This isn’t a one-off either, we have seen similar figures year in, year out which are consistent with the decline in investment and jobs in West Belfast and a constant flow where,” he said.“At present, we have companies in West Belfast who are eager to expand and provide those all-important and much-needed employment opportunities. We also need to harness the potential of the talented workforce that already exists in West Belfast, and it is key that Invest NI assist companies in making that a reality.“I have met with some talented entrepreneurs in West Belfast in the last number of months and they too are understandably frustrated at what they see as constant missed opportunities of bringing investors to this part of the city where they can engage and pitch the potential of this area for investment.“We need to showcase West Belfast. The continued growth of Huhtamaki, based just off Kennedy Way, is further proof that West Belfast can be a great place for businesses to locate, but it is vital we build on that. Invest NI need to develop stronger relationships with all stakeholders in the West in order to grow current businesses such as Huhtamaki, who can continue to grow and employ more people.”A spokesperson for Invest NI said: “Invest NI and the  local councils are actively working in partnership to help grow investment and the economy in every part of Northern Ireland. Investment comes in many forms and a set of figures about the number of inward visits is not reflective of the work that is going on.“For example, nearly  per cent of Invest NI’s offers are to companies outside of Belfast, with recent investments in Derry such as the  jobs being created by Alchemy Technology Services, the  jobs being created by Fintru, the  jobs being created by Danske Bank, the  jobs being created by Terex Corporation as part of a £ million investment in a new facility in the city and expansions by Computershare and Axa.”“Addressing the point that over  per cent of inward visits go to Belfast – this should be viewed in context. The vast majority of visit programmes start in Belfast before going to other locations, or in some cases the investor has no time to visit specic locations so are hosted at our HQ in Belfast. What is more relevant is that over the last five years, nearly  per cent of investors chose to locate their project outside of Belfast.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/a81a8305-8941-4184-938b-d8cf49594400-e1584361711502.png","title":"keep the virtual presses rolling by subscribing to our e papers","story":"OVER the coming weeks, as the Coronavirus crisis most likely deepens, our priority will be to ensure our communities stay safe and healthy.As newspapers based in the heart of vibrant communities on both sides of the Atlantic, we recognise our special role in providing a measured, vital news service to our readers.We also have an obligation to bolster small businesses — the advertising backbone of our papers — who face uncertain times.Already many of those small businesses have either signicantly reduced their operations or, in the case of many entertainment venues, closed their doors for at least two weeks.That in turn will mean a precipitous drop in the display advertising revenues we depend on to keep thepresses rolling, pay staff and meet our overheads.One way in which you can support our teams is by taking out a subscription to our epapers.

The father-of-four was sent to Long Kesh, Cage , to serve out his sentence. It is understood that when Mr Dodds arrived he was in his bare feet after his shoes were confiscated. That night a serious confrontation took place which resulted in British troops being sent in to restore order. Francis was on the receiving end of a severe beating which left him heavily bandaged and needing crutches to walk.Medical notes detail how Mr Dodds consistently sought medical attention for chest pains, extending to his left arm and for a discoloured and infected big toe. The Medical Officer for the prison examined him and recommended that he be referred for an arteriogram. Despite this no arteriogram was ever carried out. On September   Francis was examined by a doctor and told he was fine. The following day, September , he collapsed and died. The post-mortem report determined that the cause of death as coronary thrombosis.Mr Dodd’s sister Joan Nolan told the Andersonstown News that any information from those who were in prison the same time as her brother would be of great help to her family’s case.“I was  when Francis died, there were six of us and Francis was the only boy. I had gone to Canada and was in Canada when Francis died. I didn’t get home for the funeral and Canada was just a nightmare then,” she said.The Dodd’s family, supported by RFJ, say Francis’ death may have been avoidedhe had been removed from Long Kesh for thorough medical examination. Joan described her brother as very much a “joker” and “young at heart”.“Francis left behind a we and four children. He would have been a very proud father with his daughter getting her -Plus and going to St Dominic’s Grammar School.“Unfortunately I’m the only one left of the family, any fresh information would be very beneficial to the family, he was my brother.”Speaking on behalf of RFJ, caseworker Paul Butler said Mr Dodds had been complaining of chest pains for several months before his death.“The prison’s medical officer had attended to him on six dferent occasions in the weeks before his death. Moreover, in April and May  – four months before he died – Francis had been taken to Lagan Valley and Royal Victoria Hospitals in relation to pain in his left foot which was also discoloured and obviously a circulation problem.“The hospital had recommended that he be referred to the Royal Victoria Hospital for an arteriogram. This is a procedure that examines the arteries to seethere are any blockages.

East Antrim DUP MP Sammy Wilson had sought assurances from the minister that there would be no border or disruption to trade. Mr Wilson said: In a recent visit to Belfast, EU officials and Michel Barnier made it quite clear to the business community that, first of all, they expected a hard border in the Irish Sea and, secondly, they expected the Government to start implementing the things which need to be done to put that in place. Would hegive us an assurance that given that the Government has a dferent interpretation to the withdrawal agreement than the EU has, that no steps will be taken to put either a physical, administrative or electronic border in the Irish Sea which would disrupt trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain  Mr Lewis responded:makes an important point and I#m very happy to be very, very clear about this. We are determined to deliver on the agreements that are not only within theprotocol but within the Good Friday Agreement, so we ensure that there is obviously no border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.

Mental health charity Mind says you can still get outside and benefit from fresh air and the natural environment while minimising your risk of catching the virus.. BirdwatchingBirdwatching is a good way to get out in the fresh air and interact with nature, says Phil Carson, policy officer for sustainable farming with the RSPB.I think it#s a good thing to do because you get away to quieten your mind and it#s quite a mindful activity. It allows you to tune out, appreciate the things that are around you and focus on something that isn#t on TV or negative news, he explains.If you#re going to a shoreline or estuary, you can still see some of the wintering waders and wildfowl.You can see curlew along the shoreline, which is pretty brilliant to look at, and there are redshank, another iconic bird,you are around Belfast Lough.Coming into spring,you are in woodland you#re starting to see migrant species coming back, such as the chfchaff, a warbler from northern Africa which is starting to make its way through.Rewarding places to birdwatch include the RSPB#s Portview Lough nature reserve which has plenty of wide open spaces where you can stay clear of other people while getting your wildle fix.Some of the waders are coming into breed there at the moment - you could see little grebe along the lake shore, reed bunting in amongst the reeds and wigeon and teal as well.Anywhere that has woodland would be quite interesting this time of year, such as Belvoir Forest or the woodlands in the Glens of Antrim are always pretty good, Phil adds..

ArtDrawing or painting can be a great way to connect with nature without stomping through miles of mud.Artist blogger Ella Masters advises bringing a small sketchbook and using drawing materials that dry quickly, such as pencils, pastels or thin layers of watercolours.. Tai chiWe#ve all seen footage of people in China outside in parks performing the elegant moves of tai chi.Bangor-born Tai Chi teacher Michele Gibsonsays: Normally we do our classes indoors because the weather in Northern Ireland is not generally very suitable, but it can be practised outside - in China they do it outside all the time.But you can do it in snow as long as you#re well wrapped up - you can do it outside at any time.Michele says Tai Chi is a series of exercises that work on dferent parts of the body.They tend to be breathing exercises as well as movement. The movements are aerobic without being like an aerobics class, so they#re good for your heart and lungs in a very gentle way, she says.Tai chi is good for high blood pressure. It massages all your internal organs and it#s very good for your balance.It#s good for your muscles and tendons, keeping them strong and keeping your bones healthy. It#s an all-round good exercise which can be done by anybody. It can even be done sitting down, although it#s mostly done standing.I would recommend it to anybody who feels they need a little exercise but doesn#t want to pound it out in the gym. It#s not overly taxing. If you get up sore the next day you are not doing it right.. Go on a picnicThere#s nothing stopping you from wrapping up in a warm coat and hat, filling a thermos of hot tea and talking yourself up to the top of a mountain.There are loads of places off the beaten track for a picnic with a view, from Divis Mountain and Cregagh Glen to the rugged Kearney coastal walk on the Ards peninsula..

Its job is to keep you safe from nasty germs that might infect you and most of the time it does a great job. This is why pc of people will fight this virus with minor symptoms.But sometimes your immune system isn#t up to the job. This can be because you become infected with a massive dose of a virus, which runs amok and makes you feel awful. Or perhaps you are over  and, like most things in your body, your immune system is less able. Or you might be taking drugs that suppress your immune systemyou have an inflammatory disease. Oryour heart or lungs are weak, the virus can really harm you. So the question is, is there anything you can do to boost your immune system  The answer is a resounding yes.Look after your immune systemTo know how to take care of your immune system, first you need to understand the weapons your immune system has, which are actually very impressive. When you come into contact with a germ you#ve never met before you#ve got ious barriers to try to stop it getting into your body. As well as skin, you have mucus - snot is a really important barrier as it traps germs and has special biochemicals that can kill them, in this case mainly bacteria. Your body is also actually covered in bacteria, inside and out , and many of these are beneficial. They out-compete the bad guys and even make chemicals to poison them. This stops the invader from eating the resident bacterias# lunch.The germs can sometimes win, however. They have cunning tricks up their sleeves to breach the defences. A virus like SARS-CoV burrows inside the cells that line your lungs. That#s where they multiply. However, pretty soon the rapid response unit of your immune system will arrive. Special white blood cells can attack the invader. So-called macrophageseat the germs up and destroy them. They also call the alarm to bring out another white blood cell called a T lymphocyte. These are like police superintendents, controlling everything and even killing off the virally-infected cell themselves to stop the virus spreading. It#s the T lymphocytes that remember, so that when you get reinfected they are good to go. T lymphocytes are an important aspect of why vaccines work. They also control another important white blood cell, the B lymphocyte. This is the cell that makes antibodies. These are very specic proteins that are great at stopping a virus like SARS-CoV in its tracks and B lymphocytes also remember.We remain optimistic that there will be a vaccine soon. Vaccines are weakened forms of a germ or part of it, which causes a weak immune response. But the cells of the immune system are now trained. And when the intruder comes they kill it. It#s a bit like the sherf has put up wanted posters around town and when the bad guy turns up he#s recognised and killed quickly and you won#t even know you#ve been infected. This is why it#s so important to get a vaccine for Covid-.What can you do The trick is to keep all these cells of your immune system fit and healthy. This begins with what you eat. A ied diet with lots of high-fibre foods really boosts your immune system - immune cells love healthy food and hate fatty foods, so a healthy diet is essential.Also,you don#t over-eat and have good gaps between meals, this really mobilises the immune system increasing the numbers of immune cells by as much as three-fold, so lay off that second piece of pie and have gaps of at least four hours between meals. Don#t over-do this, though, as being malnourished has a hugely negative effect, as can be seen in developing countries where it#s a huge cause of death from diseases like TB.Do probiotic drinks work The evidence for taking probiotic supplements is mixed. It#s much more effective to change your diet to a healthier one.And what about vitamins Vitamin D has become a hot topic in immunology. It is used by our immune cells, and is something that people across the island of Ireland can get quite low on in the winter. So it#s good to take in more of it. Taking extra vitamin C, however, is probably a waste of time for those who are well-fed. Eating your five-a-day of fruits and vegetables is the best way to maintain necessary levels. It#s water soluble so you will just pass any excess into your urine.Stay activeTo be immunologically fit, you also need to be physically fit. White blood cells can be quite sluggish. Exercise mobilises them by increasing blood flow in your body, so they can do their surveillance jobs and seek and destroy all over your body. Adults should be physically active in some way every day, and do at least  minutes a week of moderate aerobic activityor  minutes of vigorous activity . Either suffice.The advice for older people, who are more vulnerable to infection, is to do whatever exercise is possible. Anything#s better than nothing. But a letime#s exercise could signicantly stop your immune system declining with age. In , a study found that  non-smoking amateur cyclists aged  to  still had the immune systems of young people.Like eating, you can overdo it though. You can exercise to a point where it has a negative impact on your immune system. Elite athletes are more prone to infections. So don#t overdo it. As ever, moderation is the key.Stay calmOne of the many effects of exercise is that it reduces stress, which is next on our list of immune-boosting priorities. Stress hormones such as cortisol can decrease immune , a common example of which is when chickenpox strikes twice. If you have had it, the virus never completely goes away. During periods of stress, it can reactivate again and you get shingles. And we all know that stress makes us more susceptible to colds and flus. Worrying about Covid- might actually make you more susceptible to it.What about alcohol Forget boozing through the coronavirus crisis though, because heavy drinking also depletes our immune cells. This is one reason why alcoholics are more prone to infections. So the hot whiskey might make you feel better for a short time but it might also slow down recovery.Sleep wellExercising and eating well will have the likely knock-on effect of helping you sleep better, which is a bonus because a tired body is more susceptible to infection. A study last year found that lack of sleep impaired the disease-fighting ability of immune cells. If you#ve got a regular sleep pattern, you have natural body rhythms and everything#s fine.

But yesterday there were dozens of comments on Twitter in response to the advertisement, including from Sinn Fein Senator Niall O Donnghaile who said: Delete your account.Other comments included a post from a user called Steve saying: You guys have got this so wrong. Caoimhe Rua said: Ah cop on lads. No amount of takings is worth the health of your staff and customers. Get #er closed. We#ll buy a load of pints when we come out the other side.A user called Marymo said: What are you playing at. Literally in the middle of a pandemic Green Party councillor Brian Smyth called it a total disregard for the community around you.Meanwhile, Filthy McNasty#s on Belfast#s Dublin Road came in for flak for advertising on Facebook that it was business as usual as they wished punters a Happy St Patrick#s Day.They said on Monday: We want to ensure that you and all our customers feel safe during the St Patrick#s celebrations with us today and tomorrow.We are continuing to monitor the situation, following the advice from WHO and keeping our hygiene to the highest standard to safeguard all our staff and customers. We are still open for business and want to invite you to our events that will be controlled in a safe and healthy manner!But they faced condemnation on their Facebook page, including from Paul O#Hare, who said: Lots of other bars are closing! Do the right thing by closing, for the collective good!And Rory Brolly posted on their page: Every other bar has voluntarily closed its doors. All bars down South ordered to close. Nothing #safe# or #healthy# about it ... close your doors.The Belfastcontacted the bars yesterday and was unable to get through to The Rock Bar or Filthy McNasty#s.Quinns confirmed yesterday that they were open for their St Patrick#s Eve event on Monday and remained open for carry-out food and off-sales, but the bar is closed.On Monday evening Mr Johnson announced a number of recommendations to try and combat the spread of coronavirus, including advising everyone to avoid gatherings and crowded places such as pubs, clubs and theatres.On Sunday in the Republic the Irish Government asked all pubs, including hotel bars, to close from Monday until at least March  to curb the spread of Covid-, and also strongly advised against house parties while the pubs are closed.Belfast ,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

I#m still doing a stock take but there does seem to be some items missing.Because it was St Patrick#s Day and they had nowhere  to go, they ended up just drinking and wrecking the place.Mr Boylan said he also faced intimidation when he arrived at the auction house on Tuesday.I#m only one man and there were at least  people there when I got there, he said.Two of them got very righteous and called me a tout for contacting the police.Another young lad calmed them down. Apparently this happens quite a lot in the area but it#s the first time for me as the business has only been going five months.They just don#t care. When I closed the gate behind me one young lad walked past me andjust said he forgot his carry out.That#s the type of people they are, they#re dangerous when they get into a group.Addressing those responsible, he said: Why would you do this  I#m a local fella just trying to make a living.Don#t get me wrong. Everyone was young once, you don#t mind them having a drink as long as they don#t make a mess.But because I#ve other people#s stuff here it#s just a nightmare. Apparently it#s why the last tenant left here because every weekend there#s people congregating and drinking.Reviewing the CCTV footage, Mr Boylan said some of those loitering were urinating on walls and doors, and that a wing mirror had been broken off a van.It#s hard enough to make a living especially in the current climate, he said.I have to pay that money out to customers, that#s my job, I have to sell their goods. It#s going to have a knock-on effect as well with people not bringing their items here because they think it#s not safe.The PSNI said they are appealing for witnesses and information following a number of reports of criminal damage and anti-social behaviour in the Nursery Road area of Armagh on Tuesday. It was reported that sometime between pm and pm, a group of approximately  iniduals had been behaving in an anti-social manner in the area causing damage to several cupboards which were being stored outside.

Alongside £m already announced by the Treasury the day before, this amounts to an injection of more than £m, the Secretary of State said.Meanwhile, Stormont has unveiled a £ million official grants programme for vulnerable businesses, alongside a rates holiday for three months for all businesses.It comes after the public have been asked to avoid pubs, clubs and theatres, while hundreds of flights and hotel stays have been cancelled, leaving businesses struggling with cash flow.On Tuesday, the Chancellor Rishi Sunak vowed to do “whatever it takes” to help the economy, as he warned that “never in peacetime have we faced an economic fight like this one”.Among the financial measure outline by Mr Sunak is £bn in government-back loans for business and a rates holiday.If you are a Northern Ireland business owner, here#s what support is available to you.Q Will I still have to pay rates, evenI have had to close A On Tuesday, Finance Minister Conor Murphy announced an emergency £m rates package for all Northern Ireland businesses. This will mean businesses will not have to pay any rates for the next three months.In order to help businesses with short-term cash flow problems, rates bills from April to June will also be deferred.There have been calls, however, for the rates holiday to be extended to a year, as is the case for the hospitality sector in England.Q What other support is available for businesses A Businesses will now be able to avail of £bn in government-back loans at low interest rates. These loans are designed to help firms pay rent, salaries, stock and suppliers.The loan scheme has not been welcomed by all, however. Bill Wolsey, managing director of the Beannchor Group, which has temporarily laid off  staff and closed the majority of its pubs and hotels, said putting businesses into further debt is not the answer.Q The Chancellor also announced funding grants of up to £, for small businesses, does this apply to Northern Ireland A The Stormont Executive has unveiled its own grants schemes to assist businesses with cash flow pressures brought about by the Covid- outbreak. The official rescue package includes a grant scheme worth £, each for around , small businesses and a payment of £, to around , firms involved in retail, tourism and hospitality.The new small business grant scheme of £, will be provided to all small businesses eligible for the small business rate relief scheme with a Net Asset Value of up to £,. A new immediate grant of £, will go to for companies in the retail, tourism and hospitality sectors with a rateable value between £, and £,. Q Are any other financial measures expected to be announced in the near future A Yes, further announcements are due in the coming days.There are several concerns which have not been addressed, including whether VAT bills for small businesses due in April will be deferred. Business leaders have also called on employer#s national insurance contributions to be waived, while those self-employed are also facing a tax payment in July.If you rely on benefits or are struggling financially due to the coronavirus, here#s what has already been announced to help you.Q How can I sign on for benefits during the pandemic A Communities minister Deirdre Hargey has announced that all benefits offices will be closed and contact will be made over the phone to protect the public and frontline staff. All front line services will be suspended initially for a period of three months to assess where we are with this virus and any contact will be done via the telephone or other forms of communications, she said, speaking on BBC Radio Ulster. Appointments have been postponed for a period of three months, which may be extended. Q Do I still have to sign on in person A Ms Hargey said that those who normally have to sign on in person for benefits will no longer have to turn up to the benefit offices. No one will be penalised for any attending the office, she said, adding that those who usually have to submit medical advice or certicates in person are not currently required to do so. Q Will I be contacted about my face-to-face interview A We#re contacting those people over the next few days to let them know their appointments have been suspended initially for a period of three months. We will be constantly reviewing that, said Ms Hargey.  Q Is there any other support available A The Communities Minister said she will address discretionary support payment legislation over the next few days. These are payments for those who are on a wage from April  of under £,, low income families who are fallen on hard times - that they can come and apply for a grant for things like household costs, food bills, heating costs, she said. Ms Hargey said she is also moving on issues such as statutory sick pay and universal credit. Those workers who happen to lose their jobs here who are on contracts or who are self-employed can now come forward to claim those benefits and get that additional support, she said. Q I am on the Steps  Success employment programme - do I have to attend A Ms Hargey said: All programmes going forward will be suspended for a period and people will not be penalised for not attending the office.Q I work in a small business - what will my job prospects look like in the near future A Speaking in Stormont on Monday, Mrs Dodds revealed plans to re-ert laid-off staff in the coming months.I think it is something that my department will quickly look at,we are in the position where firms have to close, she said. Many people will have skills in food preparation that we may need in our hospitals and so on as this thing reaches a peak, so we will be looking at this and how,one business closes, there are opportunities in other areas.Belfast Related ContentCoronavirusCoronavirus fact check: From masks to mortality rates - how to separate fact from fictionThe coronavirus crisis has become a breeding ground for myths and conspiracies - how do we separate fact from fiction \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news world-news ab .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cdcd-b--ab-dccefd_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news world-news ab .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cdcd-b--ab-dccefd_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news world-news ab .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cdcd-b--ab-dccefd_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news world-news ab .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cdcd-b--ab-dccefd_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news world-news ab .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cdcd-b--ab-dccefd_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Republic of IrelandHow former army trauma surgeon Michael Ryan from Ireland is leading global fight against coronavirusDr Michael Ryan was at home in his kitchen in Galway one day, and his phone rang, the caller identied himself as Bill Gates.,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":Most ReadLibraries NI increases monitoring after girl sees user watch pornCoronavirus QA: What support is available for businesses in Northern Ireland DUP calls for abortion reform to be dealt with at Northern Ireland AssemblyCommons# most prolic contributing MP says he just wants to support colleaguesTyrone man who openly admitted beating his children jailed,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

As testing is only being carried out when cases are needing hospitalised, I would like to reiterate that it is a suspected case.I had made an application to the Department of Education for two exceptional closure days on Thursday  and Friday  March.However, I have been unsuccessful and these have been denied.A spokeswoman for the Department of Education said: Requests for exceptional closures should be made initially to the Department of Education.These are likely to be approvedneeded to facilitate an enhanced deep clean following discussions with public health professionals.If schools have submitted an exceptional closure which has not been approved and are able to provide a fuller explanation as to why the closure is needed, then the Department would be happy to review the request.Belfast ,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":Most ReadLibraries NI increases monitoring after girl sees user watch pornCoronavirus QA: What support is available for businesses in Northern Ireland DUP calls for abortion reform to be dealt with at Northern Ireland AssemblyCommons# most prolic contributing MP says he just wants to support colleaguesBelfast pharmacy builds glass partition to protect against Covid-,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

No one really knows how this is all going to pan out, but we came up with the WhatsApp idea because we thought it would be a good way of ensuring that people would always be able to make contact with someone near them.We delivered notes to all the houses in the street urging anyone who was interested to join the group so we would have a means of communication without coming face-to-face.The plan is to share any information we have with each other and to share any supplies that people desperately need over the next weeks and months. We#ve already shared out food, like pasta. The group is a very practical solution to a very real problem.One neighbour has been able to provide fresh food too.They keep chickens, so it#s hoped that eggs can be left on people#s doorsteps as and when they require them, said Jonny.The idea is one Jonny thinks could be rolled out in other areas.But he appreciates that a major dficulty could be networking with older people who do not have access to a mobile phone.We are lucky in that most people have mobiles and they#re happy to link up, he said. The feedback has been really positive.Jonny and Lisa have lived on Beverley Way for several years without knowing any of their neighbours particularly well - until now. Thathas been an added bonus, said Jonny.The mum and dad have jobs in east Belfast but are expecting to work from home for the foreseeable future.Their three children, Linusand six-year-old twins Edie and Tilly, are being prepared for home-schooling now that their school has closed. We#re drawing up timetables for the kids and we are also introducing contracts for them about their behaviour. They are similar to the disciplinary measures that there are in school for the pupils, Jonny explained.We#d been planning to introduce all this during the summer holidays, but we#ve now brought everything forward to term time.It#s not just Jonny#s home le that has been hit by the virus, but his love of football too.I#m a big fan of Ards Football Club and though it#s not the most important thing in the world at the moment I will miss watching them, he said.

I can#t see it happening at the moment, God knows how it#s going to affect the housing market, he said.Two of his friends were also among the  staff to be temporarily laid off by the Beannchor group.A lot of people will have dependants living in the household, others are living together and sharing rent, he added.People in hospitality are often on minimum wage and working on zero hour contracts. They have quiet periods after Christmas but they usually plan for that.But no-one expects that to go on after March. Those people definitely don#t have the savings to see this out.Mr Hagan#s mother Christine Boydsaid her son felt panicked over the sudden loss of his job.He#s lost everything, he#s literally no money to pay for his car insurance or phone bill. All he got was a call to say #sorry there#s no work#, she said.It was a big deal for Jack to get this job. He has ADD and Tourette#s Syndrome so he has a lot of issues with socialising.Now it#s been taken away and it#s set him back again.He#s had to go to the jobs and benefits office to get Universal Credit which for him is about £ a month.He#s panicking now because he doesn#t know where he#s going to get the money from, I#m going to have to try and help him out.He has been quite down and even I#m quite anxious worrying about him. I spent about three hours on Friday on the phone and filling out forms for Universal Credit.So that#s been stressful and I needed to take time off work to help him.She also called for measures to help the economy currently being used in Italy and the Republic of Ireland.I#ve got rent to pay andmy younger son comes home from nursery, will I have to keep paying for it  she said.If I knew those bills were frozen it would make a big dference to me. At the minute I#m not sleeping very well because of this stress.The government need to be clearer about what they#re doing to help everyday people.Meanwhile, the chief executive of Hospitality Ulster Colin Neill has said that Northern Ireland is now facing a tsunami of job losses.Speaking to the Stormont Assembly Economy Committee, he said: We now have a disaster on our hands. This is an emergency situation.Overnight thousands of jobs went to the wall and we are expecting thousands to go by the end of the day - this is real and the government are watching this happen as time ticks away.Belfast ,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":Most ReadLibraries NI increases monitoring after girl sees user watch pornCoronavirus QA: What support is available for businesses in Northern Ireland DUP calls for abortion reform to be dealt with at Northern Ireland AssemblyCommons# most prolic contributing MP says he just wants to support colleaguesTyrone man who openly admitted beating his children jailed,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Rt Rev’d Andrew Forster, Bishop of Derry and Raphoe, said the church, like all of society, had a duty to do what they can to ‘protect people’s lives and minimise suffering’. He said: “I am announcing the suspension of all public acts of worship in the United Dioceses of Derry and Raphoe. This includes Sunday services and regular midweek services. “Baptisms, weddings and funerals will still be permitted as long as they comply with the guidance of the appropriate public health authority. The bishop said churches would remain open at service times for those who wish to pray privately and stressed that that pastoral support was still available. googletag.cmd.push “Our church buildings will be open at service times for those who wish to pray privately. “Clergy who are well enough will ensure that they are available to parishioners for pastoral support –necessary by telephone or online. “We are also investigating options for non-traditional forms of worship, such as radio and online religious services.” Rev’d Forster also encouraged parishioners to continue to look out for one another and ensure that anyone who is struggling as a result of the crisis receives the support they need. He said: “In the midst of crisis, we have an opportunity to show what real Christian community is all about. googletag.cmd.push “Stay in touch with one another.Keep an eye on your neighbours, especially those who are older, those who are more vulnerable and those who are lonely. “Look after them. Don’t do anything that puts their health at risk. Make sure they’re okay. “Some in our Church family and in the wider community will be experiencing financial hardship. “Be generous. Give to charities. Support local foodbanks. Let us show what real community is all about.” The Bishop expressed his regret at having to take these measures in the face of what he described as a ‘rapidly changing situation’. He said: “We, at diocesan level, will be in regular communication with parishioners. “No bishop wants to suspend services – especially not a Church of Ireland bishop on the Feast Day of St Patrick. But it is done for the right reasons and with people’s best interests at heart.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

And meant it. Surely big Ron Atkinson put it best when he offered: “I never comment on referees and I’m not going to break the habit of a letime for that prat.”The men in black - universally castigated for their myopia, shunned for poor decision-making, and all too often the painted the perennial pantomime villains. Undeniably society’s last great unprotected minority, perhaps it’s time to redress the balance, to pay tribute to the unloved whistler.Storm Dennis, Storm Ciara and their exotic cousin Storm Jorge – that unholy Trinity of recent unwelcome weather phenomena, wreaked havoc on the recent sporting scene, and threatened to carpet bomb the entire sporting calendar.But across this great sports loving city, from Judges Road to Celtic Park our bold referees collectively drew back the curtains on teeth-chatteringly cold weekends. The show must go on, and the much maligned referees were the benevolent ringmasters. googletag.cmd.push MotivationLocal football referee Dennis O’Connor paints a picture of what would motivate an apparently sane looking man to take up this God-forsaken hobby.“It’s addictive,” enthuses O’Connor. “When you first start you can’t get enough of it!“I’ve always enjoyed refereeing Saturday mornings. It’s more local and I enjoy meeting the players. You run into them up the town and you talk about the game, have a laugh. It’s a social thing really.”Originally from Kent, the love of a local woman brought him to these shores in  where he played for BBOB and Foyle Wanderers.And like all sportsmen, father time eventually tapped his wicked finger on the shoulder and the time arrived for O’Connor to call it a day.“I wasn’t enjoying football anymore you worry about injuries as you get older. And I thought I’ll give refereeing a go.“The first game I reffed was a DuPont game and I loved it straight away,” says the Englishman with a straight face. “I don’t know what it is but I’ve always loved the Saturday Morning League. You really look forward to the weekend.”Boasting six dferent referee kits these days, the modern refereeing wardrobe is as colourful as some of the language O’Connor would endure at a Tamnaherin Celtic match. While watching games on television is very much a bus man’s holiday for the affable  year old whistler. “You’re watching the referee all the time you’re even watching the linesman. I find myself calling ‘Offside!’ during games like a lunatic.” googletag.cmd.push PreferenceGreysteel man Sean Curran officiates all codes in GAA and soccer, but has a strong preference. “I love Gaelic games,” he states. “I find the soccer to be a bit boring to be honest. Underage soccer is better because of the level of skill these days, it’s a joy to referee. But definitely Gaelic Games is my first choice.”Do referees need a thick skin  “Very! You have to be a certain type of person. You have to be strong mentally. You have to be able to deflect all the flack you can get.”  PICTURED: Local referee John Crossan. The  year old shares Dennis O’Connor’s passion for the officiating trade. “I love it,” he says. “It’s a passion I have. I started out just doing it for my club but then I wanted to do bigger and bigger games. And I wanted to improve my own standards. I’ve refereed over  matches now and I’ve enjoyed every one of them.”Hurling referee Mark O’Neill agrees with Curran that a hide like a rhinosaurus is crucial to succeed in the refereeing game.“%!” he laughs. “Look, I gave it to referees all my le. I argued with referees over most decisions, and I suppose this is now karma coming back at me. As a referee you have to take the higher ground. In the first five seconds after an incident you have to give the player a bit of time to digest a decision he or she may strongly agree with.“In GAA you can move the ball on  metres. You don’t have that in soccer. I find that really helps in GAA, as it turns it back on the player where their team-mates turn on themthe ball is moved forward.“Rugby has the same idea,” he continues, “but the respect rugby referees get is amazing. There’s nothing worse than slabbering, and the sin bingives the person ten minutes to simmer down.” ContrastingRugby referee Glenda Mellon cuts a very much contrasting figure on a Saturday afternoon. “I started  years ago after I stopped playing and coaching,” she explains. “It gave me a way of being involved in the sport I love without the bruises and pain on a Monday morning.”Finishing up her own stellar rugby career, Waterside woman faced the same dilemma as many of her refereeing compatriots. What next   PICTURED:Rugby referee Glenda Mellon “I really enjoy it as it gives me something to train for,” says the youthful  year old. “Its also competitiveyou want it to be. You want to improve your assessment scores and get moved up the levels to get better games.”But refereeing can prove to be a dficult balancing act too for the family woman. “The worst thing is the mummy we guilt of being away all day Saturday.“I enjoy the games most when the players have a bit of banter with me,” she continues. “But its usually quite funny when players forget whos reffing and call me ‘Sir’ during a game, and then get very embarrassed when they realise what they have said.”‘Fail to prepare, prepare to fail’ quoth the great Roy Keane, but he probably hadn’t anticipating this answer from Glenda Mellon on how she readies herself for a rugby match.“Fake tan, eyelashes and French plaits!” she chortles. Fair to say not the typical response you would hear from a referee, but a welcome addition in le’s rich tapestry.  PICTURED:Referee Mark McGarrigle gives a yellow card to Sion Mills player. As a potential hobby refereeing might appear as soul destroying as checking your bank balance after a big weekend. Apart from all the grief you endure from players and spectators alike, there’s not much glamour in changing your clothes in a small cattle shed, or in the back of a lorry container in Donemana – where a shower with warm water a dim and distant prospect.A sunken soggy pitch at Leafair, or a bracingly cold morning at Lisnagelvin where the wind would blow a traveller off his cousin – only the lion-hearted need apply to the reffing trade.It’s not for everyone. But to the small minority who take up the whistle, and remember we couldn’t play or watch sport without them, referees are an integral part of the game and we should salute them. And just like footballers, hurlers and rugby players across the country, the misery of a poor game can follow them around like a mangy dog.Playing the game tends to be a selfish act. ‘Love’, ‘passion’, ‘give something back’. These are the collective themes that knit together and resonate when you speak to referees about their motivations.Somebody once said being a rare boy is not a crime. Well neither is being a referee.  PICTURED:Former Derry City and Celtic star Niall McGinn with local referees, Marty Dunne, Dick Tucker and on right, Gerry Morrison.

And meant it. Surely big Ron Atkinson put it best when he offered: “I never comment on referees and I’m not going to break the habit of a letime for that prat.”The men in black - universally castigated for their myopia, shunned for poor decision-making, and all too often the painted the perennial pantomime villains. Undeniably society’s last great unprotected minority, perhaps it’s time to redress the balance, to pay tribute to the unloved whistler.Storm Dennis, Storm Ciara and their exotic cousin Storm Jorge – that unholy Trinity of recent unwelcome weather phenomena, wreaked havoc on the recent sporting scene, and threatened to carpet bomb the entire sporting calendar.But across this great sports loving city, from Judges Road to Celtic Park our bold referees collectively drew back the curtains on teeth-chatteringly cold weekends. The show must go on, and the much maligned referees were the benevolent ringmasters. googletag.cmd.push MotivationLocal football referee Dennis O’Connor paints a picture of what would motivate an apparently sane looking man to take up this God-forsaken hobby.“It’s addictive,” enthuses O’Connor. “When you first start you can’t get enough of it!“I’ve always enjoyed refereeing Saturday mornings. It’s more local and I enjoy meeting the players. You run into them up the town and you talk about the game, have a laugh. It’s a social thing really.”Originally from Kent, the love of a local woman brought him to these shores in  where he played for BBOB and Foyle Wanderers.And like all sportsmen, father time eventually tapped his wicked finger on the shoulder and the time arrived for O’Connor to call it a day.“I wasn’t enjoying football anymore you worry about injuries as you get older. And I thought I’ll give refereeing a go.“The first game I reffed was a DuPont game and I loved it straight away,” says the Englishman with a straight face. “I don’t know what it is but I’ve always loved the Saturday Morning League. You really look forward to the weekend.”Boasting six dferent referee kits these days, the modern refereeing wardrobe is as colourful as some of the language O’Connor would endure at a Tamnaherin Celtic match. While watching games on television is very much a bus man’s holiday for the affable  year old whistler. “You’re watching the referee all the time you’re even watching the linesman. I find myself calling ‘Offside!’ during games like a lunatic.” googletag.cmd.push PreferenceGreysteel man Sean Curran officiates all codes in GAA and soccer, but has a strong preference. “I love Gaelic games,” he states. “I find the soccer to be a bit boring to be honest. Underage soccer is better because of the level of skill these days, it’s a joy to referee. But definitely Gaelic Games is my first choice.”Do referees need a thick skin  “Very! You have to be a certain type of person. You have to be strong mentally. You have to be able to deflect all the flack you can get.”  PICTURED: Local referee John Crossan. The  year old shares Dennis O’Connor’s passion for the officiating trade. “I love it,” he says. “It’s a passion I have. I started out just doing it for my club but then I wanted to do bigger and bigger games. And I wanted to improve my own standards. I’ve refereed over  matches now and I’ve enjoyed every one of them.”Hurling referee Mark O’Neill agrees with Curran that a hide like a rhinosaurus is crucial to succeed in the refereeing game.“%!” he laughs. “Look, I gave it to referees all my le. I argued with referees over most decisions, and I suppose this is now karma coming back at me. As a referee you have to take the higher ground. In the first five seconds after an incident you have to give the player a bit of time to digest a decision he or she may strongly agree with.“In GAA you can move the ball on  metres. You don’t have that in soccer. I find that really helps in GAA, as it turns it back on the player where their team-mates turn on themthe ball is moved forward.“Rugby has the same idea,” he continues, “but the respect rugby referees get is amazing. There’s nothing worse than slabbering, and the sin bingives the person ten minutes to simmer down.” ContrastingRugby referee Glenda Mellon cuts a very much contrasting figure on a Saturday afternoon. “I started  years ago after I stopped playing and coaching,” she explains. “It gave me a way of being involved in the sport I love without the bruises and pain on a Monday morning.”Finishing up her own stellar rugby career, Waterside woman faced the same dilemma as many of her refereeing compatriots. What next   PICTURED:Rugby referee Glenda Mellon “I really enjoy it as it gives me something to train for,” says the youthful  year old. “Its also competitiveyou want it to be. You want to improve your assessment scores and get moved up the levels to get better games.”But refereeing can prove to be a dficult balancing act too for the family woman. “The worst thing is the mummy we guilt of being away all day Saturday.“I enjoy the games most when the players have a bit of banter with me,” she continues. “But its usually quite funny when players forget whos reffing and call me ‘Sir’ during a game, and then get very embarrassed when they realise what they have said.”‘Fail to prepare, prepare to fail’ quoth the great Roy Keane, but he probably hadn’t anticipating this answer from Glenda Mellon on how she readies herself for a rugby match.“Fake tan, eyelashes and French plaits!” she chortles. Fair to say not the typical response you would hear from a referee, but a welcome addition in le’s rich tapestry.  PICTURED:Referee Mark McGarrigle gives a yellow card to Sion Mills player. As a potential hobby refereeing might appear as soul destroying as checking your bank balance after a big weekend. Apart from all the grief you endure from players and spectators alike, there’s not much glamour in changing your clothes in a small cattle shed, or in the back of a lorry container in Donemana – where a shower with warm water a dim and distant prospect.A sunken soggy pitch at Leafair, or a bracingly cold morning at Lisnagelvin where the wind would blow a traveller off his cousin – only the lion-hearted need apply to the reffing trade.It’s not for everyone. But to the small minority who take up the whistle, and remember we couldn’t play or watch sport without them, referees are an integral part of the game and we should salute them. And just like footballers, hurlers and rugby players across the country, the misery of a poor game can follow them around like a mangy dog.Playing the game tends to be a selfish act. ‘Love’, ‘passion’, ‘give something back’. These are the collective themes that knit together and resonate when you speak to referees about their motivations.Somebody once said being a rare boy is not a crime. Well neither is being a referee.  PICTURED:Former Derry City and Celtic star Niall McGinn with local referees, Marty Dunne, Dick Tucker and on right, Gerry Morrison.

It was Magheras first year in the senior competition, after the school was formed seven years earlier. St Malachys Belfast were crowned as MacRory champions in the second game of the double header. Earlier in the season, Maghera ran them close in a challenge game earlier in the season. Managed by Sean Spud Murphy, the Derry men were back-boned by Laverty and Mickey Moran at midfield, stated ious press reports after the game. googletag.cmd.push Behind them, sat a solid half back line of Frankie McCotter, James Crilly and Kenny Bradley, whose second half covering was superb, and a forward line which displayed the ability to combine in their approach to scoring. Maghera were well drilled in the arts of the game. They knew when to hold the ball, when to pass and when to use the long delivery. Had the attack taken the point chances which came their way they could have doubled their final tally. Laverty elected to play with the wind at their backs and after hitting the first two points of the game, a defensive error allowed Omagh in for a goal. googletag.cmd.push Before the break, Maghera were back in the game with a goal that began in their defence. Frankie McCotter cleared a dangerous Omagh attack. Mickey Moran gained possession, who in turn passed to Fintan McCloskey. Pat ONeill took over and after drawing out the Omagh defence, he released Eugene Laverty. The Lavey man ran through in the clear before hammering to the back of the net past Tyrone senior teams reserve keeper Ciaran Harte. The goal helped Maghera go in at the break on level terms, - each. After the interval, skipper Laverty won the throw-in and after speeding up the wing, passed to Pat ONeill, who shot over the bar – giving Maghera into a lead they never lost. Liam Harbinson had a goal ruled out for square ball but made up for it shortly after for a neat finish. He was a noted soccer player and after dribbling the ball through the heart of the Omagh defence, he slotted past Harte. Fintan McCloskey and Brendan Kelly scored points for Maghera but Omagh hit back. After an error in the Maghera square, after Peter Finns long ball, Omagh dangerman Joe McGrade fired an unstoppable shot to the net. Only a goal separated the teams, - to -, but Fintan McCloskeys burst up the right wing relieved the pressure. Brendan Kelly pointed a free, followed by a Moran effort from long-range point eased the pressure before Lavertys point on the final whistle saw Maghera finish strongly.

Decisions taken by council to date has been to cancel the planned St Patrick’s Day spring carnival celebrations in Derry and Strabane, the cancellation of all travel and attendance at conferences by council staff and members and the introduction of proactive measures to protect and reassure staff and users. Members attending the meeting were also informed of the proactive contingency measures being put in place to protect vital council services. googletag.cmd.push In view of this, members agreed that council should close two of its public buildings with immediate effect, to allow vital services to continue in anticipation of other facilities being forced to close at a future date. The main civic council offices in Derry Road, Strabane and the Brandywell Sports Centre building will both close from this evening at pm for operational reasons, to allow these buildings to be available and fit for purpose to provide essential public services over the coming weeks. The Glenside office located behind the civic offices on Derry Road will remain open to the public and Derry Road staff are being relocated to alternative sites including Glenside, Strahan Road or the Civic offices in Derry’s Strand Road. googletag.cmd.push Members at the briefing heard that the closure of the buildings would allow council to carry out essential services such as waste management, the registration of births, deaths and marriages, cemetery provision and financial services, during this challenging time. Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council Cllr Michaela Boyle reassured the public that council is taking a very proactive role in its contingency planning to mitigate against the impact of COVID- and the decision to close the two centres was made in the best interests of people in Derry and Strabane and the safety of council staff. She said: “By closing these two buildings and making them sterile zones it will allow us to provide a reduced but essential level of service provision. The Council has a duty of care to its staff and the public and this is a very responsible approach to a very fluid situation. We will continue to work with our statutory agencies and partners in terms of contingency planning and reviewing all Council service provision and Council organised events on a regular basis. Any changes to services or events will provided as soon as any decision is made.” The Mayor also confirmed that she has cleared her public diary and has decided to cancel the Mayor’s monthly Tea Dance. Mayor Boyle said this decision was also made in the interests of the health and safety of the attendees, the majority of whom are older persons. She said: “The monthly Tea Dance is a hugely popular event for members of our older community across the city and district. In view of their age and the risks associated with this virus, it was felt that we needed to cancel this event for the foreseeable future. Council members will meet with senior officials tomorrow to consider progress and to further monitor the situation. The council will continue to liaise with Governments and statutory agencies, including the Public Health Agency and the Department for Health, on advice and guidance in relation its emergency contingency planning.  Members of the public with any queries are urged to contact the Council directly on    or follow us on Twitter and Facebook.

There had been criticism of the decision not to close local schools in light of the current situation. All schools in the Republic were closed last Thursday. However, First Minister Arlene Foster said a short time ago that all schools in Northern Ireland will close to all pupils from the end of this week.

She said schools would be unlikely re-open before the summer break.  googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

With her fresh complexion, sparkling eyes and ready smile, few would believe that Mrs Jean Kelly is  years old.Secretly enjoying the fuss, Jean appeared happy to be sipping tea from a bone china teacup and saucer at her birthday party, which was attended by family, friends and staff members.While Jean grew up in the Roaring Twenties, it wasnrsquot all flappers and jazz bands around Lisowen mdash the townland outside Saintfield which was her home.Born Jean Stewart, she lived with her grandparents and attended Doranrsquos Rock National School, a small two-room country school between Saintfield and Crossgar.When she left school she went to work at the Montalto Estate in Ballynahinch, which was owned by the aristocratic Clanwilliam family.Youngest son Malcolm takes up her story.He said: ldquoIt wasnrsquot long after she began working there when one fine evening she was pushing her bike along the Creevyargon Road toward home, exhausted after a dayrsquos work when she met a young man walking toward her in the other direction.Malcolm explained the young man was so taken by Jean that he offered to push the bike for her.ldquoThe young man was my father, Hugh, and within three years they were married, said Malcolm.Hughrsquos family were dairy farmers from the Creevyargon Road. When the couple got married Jean gave up her job at Montalto, as was customary in those days.Jean and Hugh were to be blessed with six children, three of whom mdash Malcolm and his elder sisters, Irene and Anne mdash are still alive. Two of the children died in infancy and another daughter, Margaret, passed away a few years ago.Jean has been a widow for over  years but her fabulous tapestries and hours spent volunteering at local charity shops are testimony to someone who enjoys being busy.

It is beyond time that we invested in this important part of our economy, creating new jobs and bringing new opportunities to local people.Cllr Curran mdash who invited Mr Poots to visit Ardglass to see the port at first hand mdash said such a visit would provide an opportunity for the fisheries minister to see that the development of the harbour is ldquoessential for the day-to-day lives of people in the village and the economic prosperity of South Down.He said that the local port is home to a large fishing fleet which lands some of the largest quantities of prawns in Ireland. In addition, Cllr Curran explained that Ardglass is the only all-weather harbour between Howth and Bangor.ldquoThe main economic activity in Ardglass is the fishing industry and although it is reasonable buoyant at present, harbour improvement is needed to sustain it., Cllr Curran continued.ldquoThis improvement is required to facilitate the large fish and prawn boats as they have encountered issues with access.Cllr Curran explained that due to their size, a number of vessels have scraped along the sea bed at low tides entering the harbour, causing damage to their hulls which can result in vessels being out of commission for repairs. leading to a loss of earnings.ldquoSome of the larger boats now bypass Ardglass and go where, mainly to Belfast, he continued. ldquoThis results in a loss of landings and additional transport costs to the local fish factories.Cllr Curran added: ldquoIf Ardglass harbour is not deepened, it could potentially lead to an economic collapse for the fishing industry in Ardglass and that is something no one wants to see happening.Newry, Mourne and Down Council is supporting plans to regenerate Ardglass harbour to help secure the future of the villagersquos fishing industry and has provided financial support to a harbour development group which has drawn up a series of proposals.The money was designed to help the group complete a business case aimed at paving the way for a number of projects including deepening the harbour to accommodate larger herring and mackerel vessels and to upgrade berthing facilities for local trawlers.The Ardglass group is also keen to relocate trawlers to the an area known locally as the Saw Pit at the harbour which it wants to deepen in order that vessels are able to put to sea when they want and not have to wait on the right tidal conditions.The provision of a dedicated repair facility for vessels is also a key aim for the new group as currently trawler skippers have to take their boats to Kilkeel or Portavogie which reduces the time they can spend at sea earning a living.Another key plank of the grouprsquos vision for the future is converting property at the harbour to provide a new hub offering essential office and training space. It is also hoped to provide a storage and work area and space for the community to use..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/11th March 2020 Coronavirus.jpg","title":"Coronavirus: St Patrick’s parade off  ","story":"NEXT Tuesdayrsquos St Patrickrsquos Day parade in Downpatrick has been cancelled over the coronavirus threat.Itrsquos only the second time the cross-community carnival has been halted since it was started in the s mdash it was called off in  due to the foot and mouth health crisis.Newry, Mourne and Down Council yesterday confirmed that parades would not go ahead in Downpatrick or Newry after party leaders on the council decided to pull the plug.The council has also cancelled open-air activities in St Patrickrsquos Square, but other events in Down County Museum and Down Arts Centre are going ahead.Chief executive Marie Ward spoke yesterday morning with the DUPrsquos Billy Walker, Sinn Feinrsquos Willie Clarke, UUPrsquos David Taylor and the SDLPrsquos Pete Byrne for their views after Belfast City Council voted to cancel its parade on Monday night.Dublin also cancelled its St Patrickrsquos Day parade, the largest event held on the island.A council spokesperson said the decision was made ldquoin consultation with party leaders and is in line with the recent cancellations of St Patrickrsquos Day parades where.The spokesperson added: ldquoThe council appreciates the negative impact this decision may have on local businesses at this time, however this decision has been taken as a precaution given our membersrsquo and the publicrsquos concern around the coronavirus response.The townrsquos religious ceremonies are to go ahead as planned.A service of Holy Communion in St Patrickrsquos Church of Ireland Church at Saul will be held at .am.The traditional mass in Irish and the distribution of shamrock will take place in St Patrickrsquos Church at am and the cross-community service will take place in Down Cathedral at .am.The Dean of Down, the Very Rev Henry Hull, said while he understood peoplersquos concerns, he pointed out that Patrickrsquos Day was also a religious festival and that services would be taking place as normal.ldquoPart of our theme this year is prayer for the country which is very apt at this time, he added.Mournes councillor Willie Clarke was the first politician to call for the event to be cancelled.The Sinn Feacutein man said it was ldquoessential to have an all Ireland response to this epidemic, which is spreading rapidly across Europe.He said: ldquoI believe there is an obligation on myself and all councillors to protect the health and well-being of citizens, given the spread of coronavirus and growing concern amongst the public.He said that the decision was not taken lightly but it was ldquothe responsible thing to do.Cllr Clarke added: ldquoI would like to see an event held at a later dateit is possible, to reschedule these celebrations, as sections of the business community will undoubtedly see a reduction in business, and the British government need to provide resources to mitigate these losses.Rowallane councillor Billy Walker said he felt that there would have been an increased risk to Downpatrickthe parade had have gone ahead as it could have attracted people who normally attended the Belfast event.ldquoWe may have had the situation that we would have increased crowds with increased risk, said Cllr Walker.ldquoI think itrsquos the right decision to take. I completely sympathise with all the council officials and employees who have planned the event, and of course all the community groups who love to take part and who have put in months of hard work with float and costume preparation.ldquoBut at the end of the day we have to think of health and public safety.Council vice-chairman Terry Andrews, of the SDLP, said he fully supported the decision but added ldquothat it was most unfortunate it had to be taken.ldquoCouncillors have done the right thing and itrsquos better to be cautious to minimise any potential risks, he said.South Down MP Chris Hazzard praised the council for its ldquoproactive and responsible leadership to protect our citizens in cancelling the parade.He added: ldquoThere will of course be huge public disappointment and hard-felt financial repercussions for our local retail and hospitality industry. But the health and well-being of our citizens must be the priority for all of us.One of the first associated casualties of the cancelled parade is Downpatrick and County Down Railwayrsquos planned park-and-ride service from Inch Abby to the town centre.Railway chairman Robert Gardiner said he estimated the not-for profit organisation would lose between pound,-pound, in income as a result.ldquoIf therersquos no carnival, therersquos no need for the park and ride, confirmed Mr Gardiner. ldquoWe normally carry about - people into Downpatrick on the day and they nearly all go to the carnival.ldquoWhile we can take this loss of income on the chin at the moment, we would be worriedthis continues as Easter is a very good holiday for us and we enjoyed a very busy summer last year..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/11th March 2020 Crossgar.jpg","title":"Crossgar hosts meeting on future of unionism  ","story":"THE first in a series of meetings to discuss the future of unionism in Rowallane was held last week in Crossgar.Guests included Lagan Valley MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, Orange Order Grand Secretary the Rev Mervyn Gibson and victimsrsquo campaigner Sammy Heenan.Organised by Rowallane councillors Kathryn Owen and Billy Walker, Crossgar Orange Order members and Crossgar Young Defenders Flute Band, last weekrsquos meeting has been hailed a great success.Around  people attended the meeting at Crossgar Orange Hall with plans confirmed for another in Saintfield over the coming weeks.Organisers say that they believe that local unionism is in a ldquomuch stronger place following the meeting with organisers thanking all those who took part.Also attending last weekrsquos meeting was Mr John Hanna, chairman of the UUPrsquos Strangfordrsquos Association.Cllr Owen said people spoke ldquoopenly and honestly during the meeting, with concerns voiced by those who attended ldquolistened to and discussed.She admitted while there is work to do across Northern Ireland, she is confident that unionism in Rowallane has taken a step in the right direction.Cllr Walker mdash who described the meeting as ldquoextremely worthwhile mdash thanked everyone who supported the event and encouraged people to attend the next one in Rowallane when the date and venue have been confirmed.ldquoThe turnout was tremendous and there was a lot of rank discussion which is good.

Monday when local politicians agreed to appoint a dedicated design team to oversee major redevelopment work at the sprawling park which covers over , acres.Newry, Mourne and Down Council mdash which is working to make the forest park one of Northern Irelandrsquos leading tourist attractions mdash has to date secured almost pound, in grant aid towards the cost of the ambitious project.The council has also committed just over poundm of its money to the project with a fresh application for pound.m to be submitted to the Heritage Lottery Fund in June, with an anxious wait until September to discover whether the bid has been successful.The funding secured to date has been provided by the Heritage Lottery Fundand Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs .Since the s, the sprawling forest park was the demesne of the Annesley family, who created a beautul landscape and a nationally and internationally important -hectare arboretum.The proposed development project aims to create a new vision for the historic Castlewellan demesne, delivering what is being described as a ldquoheritage-led destination to connect people with their built and natural heritage.Council officials and local politicians are keen to see the picturesque forest parkrsquos Arboretum, Annesley Garden and Grange Buildings redeveloped to help increase the number of visitors and provide the area with an economic boost.Officials say the focus is on improving amenities and the interpretation of the parkrsquos natural and built heritage.A recent economic appraisal recommended the development of what is being described as a welcome centre in the walled garden area designed to provide access via a lt to its upper floor, with the council keen to play a leading role, alongside the Forest Service, to help transform the parkrsquos fortunes and make it even more popular.At Mondayrsquos meeting of the local authorityrsquos Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourism Committee, it was confirmed that the council currently holds a -year operating licence for the parkrsquos walking, bike and horse riding trails, in addition to play facilities.In addition, politicians were told that during a workshop in January to discuss the way forward, it was identied that formal links will be required with a number of organisations in relation to the future management of the parkrsquos Bothy

Two previous consultation exercises have already been held.Councillors were told on Monday that the local authority may be asked to provide additional funding for the forest park development,the level of funding being sought from the Heritage Lottery Fund is not secured.They also agreed to investigate the potential of developing a partnership arrangement with Annes Grove in Cork which boasts an th century house and early th century garden, the latter of which includes a woodland garden with an interesting collection of rhododendrons, river garden, walled garden, wild-flower meadow and lily pond.Council officials believe there is merit for a joint marketing exercise involving Annes Grove and the Castlewellan park, alongside the propagation of trees and shrubs and student exchanges.Also on Monday, councillors granted permission for local authority officials to develop expressions of interest in vacant space at the forest park and hope that work to make one of the nest even better can

ends Strangford cup dream  ","story":"THERE was to be no fairytale cup ending for Strangford when Ballynagross ruled the roost in Friday nightrsquos NFU Mutual Harry Clarke Cup semi-final at Bignian Park.Philip Campbellrsquos side displayed a ruthless streak when they brushed aside their giantkilling neighbours to book their place in the Easter Monday showdown for the third year in a row and they can now prepare for a massive derby clash with Celtic Bhoys.First half goals from twin terrors Daniel Taggart and Declan Dowie sent Ballynagross on their way and Eoin Rooney smashed in an unstoppable third midway through the second half to finally kill off a game Strangford side.In a competitive opening, Ballynagross used the width of the pitch to get at Strangford and with just two minutes gone Dowie had an effort cleared off the line after a cross from Rooney threatened to cause damage.Five minutes later Rooney had an effort hacked away to safety by an alert Conan Hynds as Ballynagross threatened to run riot.However, Donnie Ritchie started to get a few tackles in and his physicality in the engine room enabled Strangford to mount a few attacks of their own, using Conall Magee and Eoin King as willing outlets.Darting runs from Hynds and Ritchiersquos no-nonsense approach was just the ticket for Strangford and with  minutes gone Patrick Kerr had the ball in the back of the net only for it to be harshly ruled out for offside.Two minutes later at the opposite end, Cultra again saved from Rooney and followed that up with another good stop to deny Dowie.Strangford were becoming increasingly confident as teenage defenders Fionn McFaul and Thomas Fitzsimons settled into the job and with Ritchie and Hynds rattling a few cages, Niall Hyndsrsquo side started to look the part.However, they were left crestfallen in the th minute when Dowie broke free on the right and crossed for Taggart to flash a ing header into the net, somewhat against the run of play.It was a cruel blow for Strangford, but things were about to get worse, much worse.Referee Aide Sharvin who had a good game, had the whistle in his mouth to blow for half-time when the influential Connor McCarron sent Dowie clear and with the Strangford back four caught flat-footed, he lobbed the ball over Cultra with the last kick of the half to make it -.Strangford knew they had no choice but to throw caution to the wind after the break and that they did, but Aaron Beattie and Conor Marron gave absolutely nothing away at the back for Ballynagross and chances were hard to come by.Ballynagross were now able to hit Strangford on the break and with  minutes gone Cultra pulled off a stunning save to deny the overlapping Tom McNeill and then John Shields on the follow-up.With  minutes gone King blasted wildly over the top for Strangford before Ballynagross were denied what looked a stonewall penalty when Cultra emptied Rooney as he darted into the penalty box, but the referee waved play on.Ballynagross were not to be denied their third goal and with  minutes gone Shields played a delightful ball into the path of Rooney and from the right hand side of the box he unleashed a vicious volley that had goal written all over it from the moment it left his boot.Strangford still refused to throw in the towel and apart from a double save from close in by Cathail Arnold, they never really threatened, despite seeing their fair share of possession.Ballynagross could have won by a bigger margin, but Cultra stood big and tall and kept the final tally down with several more good saves.Ballynagross: Cathail Arnold, Tom McNeill, Deaglan Craig, Connor Marron, Aaron Beattie, Conor McCarron, Cormac Byrne, John Shields, Daniel Taggart, Eoin Rooney, Declan Dowie.

That is what is happening. The campaign to incite schools to disregard measured advice from the executive and follow instead the southern Irish model is nothing less than a coup.  \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...These people cloak their agenda in apparent concern for lives and health, but nationalists scent blood and it is not the blood of Covid- victims. Rather it is the end of the United Kingdom that John O’Dowd, for example, surely thinks he smells when he tweets about the ‘shire’ of bastards in the British government.This crusade is likely to succeed because unionists too are worried about the disease and it is a very natural instinct to shout for something to be done, more to be done, now, when a serious problem is current. The Irish government is taking that view, but the Northern Ireland executive is following professional advice closely and taking an approach that can seem counterintuitive.It doesn’t much matter whether one is right and one is not. Nationalist Ireland has made up its mind without even listening to the arguments. Every time Northern Ireland’s status as part of the UK takes a concrete form, whether it’s the fact that people born here are British citizens, or that we will leave the EU with the rest of the country, or our inclusion in the UK’s medical advice, there is a fearful tantrum.I’ll be very clear, I don’t know how best to counter the coronavirus. My we is a doctor at the frontline of this crisis, and we talk about it every day, but this situation is unprecedented.Those who claim that they know better than public health experts should shut up.Public opinion is irrelevant in this crisis.All the tweeters and twitterers are irrelevant.The experts who are plotting a course through coronavirus are not infallible. But they know incomparably more than John O’Dowd, Martina Anderson, and their ilk.Amid the atmosphere of anglophobia, on Twitter, an economist, David McWilliams, described Britain as a ‘rogue state’. If Boris Johnson’s decisions applied only to the mainland this type of language would not be employed.After the Netherlands decided to follow a strategy close to that of the UK, thepublished an article including scathing quotes dismissing that position but not one from any of the scientists supporting it.Joe Brolly, the barrister and former GAA participant, similarly on BBC Radio Ulster Talkback cited a host of sources, without acknowledging that Britain’s experts know incomparable more than him.Nationalist Ireland is closing ranks. The Catholic church has called for schools to close, while the UK government and the health minister say that would be counterproductive. This overall response began to take-off on Friday morning, when Sinn Fein changed its stance on possible school closures in response to a demand from nationalists for an all-Ireland approach.Here is the lesson for unionists. Determined nationalists will try to erode Northern Ireland’s Britishness at any opportunity and forever and they will never be appeased. It’s psychological. They don’t care about science or facts — they will bend the evidence to their desired outcome. If we have any reason for optimism, it is the reaction of the ‘middle ground’, Alliance included. They have clearly been appalled by the tribal reaction of Sinn Fein et al to this crisis.Northern Ireland is behind both the rest of Ireland and the rest of the UK when it comes to coronavirus.We have grounds for optimism. But the insatiable, unrelenting demands of nationalism will continue whatever the crisis.\"\" for the newsletterKeep up with the latest news and views from Belfast News LetterSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg bZbGUI\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-gtfDJT hQGsjX\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg bZbGUI\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-gtfDJT hQGsjX\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bYSBpT sc-elJkPf kHpvMx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

I was one of the eighteen and a half million people watching on TV after midnight as Dennis Taylor from Coalisland recovered from a seemingly impossible deficit to beat the machine-like Steve Davis on the final black.Less than three weeks later Manchester United faced Everton in football’s FA Cup final on a sunny Saturday at Wembley. Everton were the strong favourites having easily won the league title that season. \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...The odds against United were stacked even steeper when defender Kevin Moran became the first player ever to be sent off in the cup final.The match was goalless in extra time when Norman Whiteside from the Shankill Road went on a solo run before curling a low shot past Everton keeper Neville Southall to win the fabled trophy for United.Three weeks after that Barry McGuigan, from the border village of Clones, was challenging the legendary Eusebio Pedroza for the featherweight boxing world title at Loftus Road in London.My da and uncle attended the fight. For a young boy from north Antrim who had never been off this island, their expedition could not have been any more exotic thanmy da had told me they were going on safari to Saturn’s rings and were stopping off for some sightseeing at the Great Red Spot of Jupiter on the way home.While my da experienced the fevered atmosphere in the ground, I watched on television on a stirring night as the seemingly inexhaustible McGuigan battered the grand old champion around the ring for  rounds to rip the world title from his grasp.In his corner that night was Barney Eastwood. At the time I knew Eastwood only as McGuigan’s manager and the man whose bald head was always protruding into the corner of the camera shot while Barry was being interviewed in the ring after his fights.Now I have a better understanding of how boxing is as much a business as a sport and an appreciation of the scale of Eastwood’s achievement in establishing Belfast as a base for the trade, and also for how he tempted the wily Pedroza to London to risk defending his title on alien soil in front of a raucously partisan crowd.I was planning to write that these memories were rekindled in my memory following the death of the veteran businessman and promoter last week but that’s not quite accurate. The truth is that Barry’s glory night, just like Whiteside’s goal and Taylor’s triumph are never very far from my mind and require no prompt.More than that, the images and emotions are seared into my consciousness, photographs that will never fade or turn sepia.Dennis Taylor shaking his cue and wagging his finger in delight after stunning Davis. Norman Whiteside, with the number  on the back of his stained jersey, running with his arms aloft to salute the crowd after his wonder goal. I still know the words from United’s  FA Cup final song.And the fight. Pedroza’s imposing moustache and sideburns. Barry’s father singing ‘Danny Boy’ in the ring. Commentator Harry Carpenter in the seventh bemoaning the fact that ‘McGuigan’s work has been less effective in this round’ just one second before the Clones Cyclone exploded a devastating straight right which felled the Panamanian champion.The older I get the more trouble I have retaining information, but the paint will always remain wet and brilliant on those great canvases.The common thread is obvious, three tales of local boys who overcame the odds to become masters on the international stage. Proving a point to an awed -year-old that where you come from does not have to be a barrier to what you can achieve, that the destination is more important than the starting point.But the real point is, I think, deeper, more profound. It’s the capturing and crystallisation of a precious stage of development of a child. Old enough to understand, but still young enough to have a sense of wonder.There was the guilty excitement of being able to sit up late to watch the snooker even though I had school the next morning. The bragging rights in the playground that my team had won the cup.The countless hours trying to recreate the goal in the field behind our house or potting balls on our miniature snooker table.And the fight. That Christmas I asked Santa to bring me boxing gloves and a punchbag. I wore those little red gloves out trying to convince myself that I could be like Barry McGuigan.Those three occasions have never left me, and few things have marked me in the same way since.Of course, local people had succeeded at world level before , and have continued to do so afterwards. But nothing ever seems as important as it did when you are . The world never again stopped like it did then.The years have wound on. Sometimes though, I’m still able to think like a child. It comes most often late at night when my brain is tired and unable to process coherent thoughts. Then, with my eyes closed in the dark the images of Taylor’s black ball finish or Whiteside’s goal are there.And the fight. The plan devised by Barney and executed by Barry. Sometimes the noise of the crowd is the last thing in my mind before I sleep, with my da somewhere in that throng, singing ‘Here we go! Here we go! Here we go!’\"\" for the newsletterKeep up with the latest news and views from Belfast News LetterSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg bZbGUI\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-gtfDJT hQGsjX\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg bZbGUI\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-gtfDJT hQGsjX\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bYSBpT sc-elJkPf kHpvMx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Michael said: “People think, the music is dark and intense, they’re going to be really dark and intense.The band’s original line-up of Michael, Andy and Fyfe \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Then they go on stage everything is rosy.“It’s really the old cliche – never judge a book by its cover. With us the lyrics are kind of twisted, but there’s a big, dark sense of humour there.“We let off steam when we go on stage and jump up and down for  minutes. You tend to be pretty chilled afterwards.”When the band first got together in  lead singer and guitarist Andy Cairns was a pupil at Ballyclare High. Michael, who attended Larne Grammar with Fyfe Ewing , wasn’t present for the band’s first recording though he was there in spirit.On the front cover of metal magazine Kerrang! in He said: “Fyfe and I were in the same English class and would have traded records. He was in a band, I was in a band. “His band and Andy’s band had played a gig at Jordanstown Uni. They had more in common than they did with their own bands. “They did a demo together. I was there in spirit because Andy didn’t have a bass guitar so Fyfe asked me and I lent Andy my bass. Andy played it on the first demo.” Michael soon joined to play his own bass and things clicked from the start: “Our first gig was at Giro’s supporting Decadence Within. It went down really well, I was flabbergasted. “We weren’t trying to be U or Guns N’ Roses – those were the two big musical things at that time in , . I don’t mind U and I quite like Guns N’ Roses but we had our own little thing going on.“You kind of gravitated towards anyone who liked something that wasn’t Bryan Adams at school. In Larne where I grew up the metallers hung out with the goths, the goths hung out with the indie kids and you heard Joy Division, The Dead Kennedys and Slayer. We clung together as musical outsiders.”The friendship between Michael and Andy has extended more than  years: “I think I was  or  when Andy and I first met. When the first album came out I’d just turned . I’ll be  later this month.“One thing we did find quite early on is that we tend to be huffers. We got that out of our system. If you don’t like something you say then, you don’t leave it for six months and have a meltdown in the middle of eastern Europe.“There’s a lot of rock and rolls myths and stereotypes out there that people love. One of them I think which is not correct is that you need to have creative tension in a band. Maybe that’s works for one or two albums, but that burns itself out really quickly.“It’s really great working together as part of the band, what I get out of it is quite special, I think I’m very lucky.”Michael contrasted the crazy intensity when the band shared a house together in Belfast’s Holylandswith the situation now where they all live in dferent parts of the UK.He said: “I think there was one time me and Andy worked out over an -months period we’d been within  metres of each other every day with the exception of Christmas Day.“Now I live in Larne, Andy lives in Cambridge and Neilour drummer lives in Derby. When we meet up there’s lots of interesting stories and dferent experiences to share rather than walk down the main street in Larne going, ‘oh there’s the lads’.”On Fyfe, his original bandmate who left in , he said: “I haven’t spoken to him since he left. We have friends in common. He’s doing alright I believe. He moved to Brighton, he’s been there  years now. He’s had very little involvement in the music business.“It’s a real pity because he was such a great drummer, it’s just he couldn’t really get on with the lestyle. Somewhere down the line we’ll meet again.”Family man with attic of collectablesLast year Michael contributed a recipe to a celebrity cookbook to support his nephew Matthew who had been diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia.Michael said: “Matthew is doing well. The family is getting things back on track. It was a big thing, he’s still a bit traumatised as you’d expect but he’s doing well.”Of family le at home in Larne he said: “My we works full time soI’m at home I’m daddy day care. The only downside is when I’m away, I’m away   so there’s a whole dferent set of challenges for my we who’s an absolute saint.”Askedhis children, aged nine and five, were excited about their dad being in an band, he said: “They saw us at a big festival in Europe which was great because they were at the side of the stage and they were able to see , people from the other side. “They’re quite blasé about their dad being in a band. They’re not into music that much, they’re more into games, football and karate.”Michael went on to discuss some of the Therapy  treasure trovecontained in his attic: “I’ve got Fyfe’s original snare drum that he used on Babyteeth, the basses that I used on Troublegum. I’ve got a lot of the flyers, posters, tour passes and recordings and audio stuff I’ve kept over the years. The attic is a disaster area.”In the early days of Therapy  a pair of denim dungarees were Michael’s stagewear of choice. Askedstill had them, he said: “I actually do. I’m quite pleased that I’d still fit into them but I never wear them.“When we did the Troublegum shows a while ago there were some bets that they’d turn up again, but it didn’t happen for whatever reason. But never say never – right now I don’t think the world is ready for that.”Michael explained that there were in fact two pairs of his trademark dungarees, one of them he referred to as ‘the good pair’ then immediately burst out laughing.“Can you imagine denim dungarees after three weeks of touring ” he said. “It’s hard to find a -hour laundrette when you’re on the road. They were crunchy. I’m surprised they’re still in one piece.”Dates cancelled due to pandemicTherapy  have had to cancel some European tour dates later this month because of the coronavirus.Michael said: “We’ve had to cancel where the crowds would have been above ,, some of the big festivals we were really looking forward to. As it stands we’re still planning to play some of the smaller shows unless told otherwise. “It’s something that you just can’t account for. Gigs sometimes have to be cancelled because of illness or injury but this is beyond the band’s control. It’s a bit of a headmelt.”Touring major European cities is a far cry from the band’s gigging schedule in : “When we started there was the Warzone Collective in Belfast and Hope Promotions in Dublin. They worked in conjunction and would bring hardcore punk bands over like Fugazi and Concrete Sox. “We knew the Warzone people and that led to us being invited down to Dublin to play with the likes of Babes In Toyland. “They’d rent rooms above pubs for gigs, in Belfast they used the Art College and the Conor Hall. “We were quite lucky to get in at that DIY stage.”It’s okay not to be okayMuch is currently being done to raise awareness and funds for musicians suffering from mental health issues, particularly through Aware NI, PIPS and Help Musicians. As a band Therapy  have been tuned into the struggle from day one with many of Andy’s lyrics exploring the pressures that weigh on the human mind.Michael said: “It’s something that we’re all very aware of and very sympathetic towards. Being a young male in Northern Ireland there’s a bit of a ‘come on, man up’ vibe. That has been very damaging for a couple of generations now.“There is a rock and roll myth that everyone’s an all-singing, all-dancing, all-fighting gunslinger – you roll into town decimate it and move on. It’s not really like that.“I don’t think anyone hasn’t been touched by themselves or someone  who has had a mental health issue.“It’s such a fragile thing. It’s right there, there just seems not to be the widespread acknowledgement that it exists and for treatment. It’s so underfunded. It’s a real tragedy.”He added: “We’ve always had a lot of empathy, we take people as they are, we don’t have the answers, but we do try to let people know that it’s okay to not be okay. “Just talk about it, talk to your friends, talk to someone, reach out. Thankfully that stigma is moving away.“We’ve always been celebrating the outsiders – be yourself, do you own thing, what makes you happy, self preservation, looking after yourself.”Michael continued: “It’s one of these rock and roll myths that people want their musicians to be messed up and die young and leave a pretty corpse. “None of us subscribe to that at all.“We like to have a good time when we’re on tour, but doing it for so long there’s a massive element of self preservation.“It’s about doing a good gig. People don’t come and see you againyou’re stood there looking bored or hungover. It’s not pleasant for anyone – the player or the watcher.“We all feel a big responsibility to put on a good show. There’s people who have seen us  plus times.“We want every show to be as goodnot better than the last time. You make a rod for your own back with that.”• Therapy  will play the Limelight on September  to celebrate the band’s th anniversary• To coincide with the ‘So Much for the  Year Plan’ tour the band re-recorded  of their UK Top  hits in Abbey Road with producer Chris Sheldon, who produced the original Troublegum album.

Of those who received the benefit,  per cent were unemployed.Universal Credit began in  and has been gradually rolled out across the country. It was designed to simply the benefits system for working age people by merging six separate benefits into one payment.But features such as the -week wait, the -child limit and the benefits cap, as well as public spending cuts, have been associated with a rise in rent arrears, food bank usage and child poverty.Local homelessness charity, Llamau, has expressed concern for young people who are being enrolled on the scheme.Joe Payne, head of vale services and family mediation for Llamau, said: ldquoPrior to the introduction of Universal Credit, a young person may have claimed Job Seekers Allowance or Employment Support Allowance but this is no longer an option.ldquoUndoubtedly, the five week waiting time and a very low National Minimum Wage for people under  is going to cause young people untold hardship and in a lot of cases, spiralling debt.A Department for Work and Pension spokesman said the increase in  to -year olds claiming Universal Credit is lsquoin line with expectationsrsquo as it has been rolled out to every job centre.Jane Hutt, AM for the Vale of Glamorgan, said: ldquoI am concerned at the rise in the number of claimants, particularly young people, who need to access Universal Credit.ldquoCare leavers in particular are being disadvantaged by the changes. I do not believe the concerns that have been raised by claimants, by employers and by organisations advising and supporting people affected, including those who are in employment, have been addressed and I will continue to raise them on behalf of my constituents.The government has committed to ending a four-year benefit freeze in April this year, meaning millions of people will see their payments rise by the same rate as inflation.Councillor Kathryn McCaffer, Vale of Glamorgan Council youth champion, said: ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council is working with a range of partners to mitigate any adverse impacts and offer a iety of support to young people in financial dficulties. Those classed as Not in Education, Employment or Trainingcan access the Inspire  Work programme, which provides financial help to pay for the likes of work clothes, training and travel costs.ldquoVulnerable tenants are protected from debt through the direct payments system. Currently around  per cent of tenants have this system in place, which allows a portion of Universal Credit payments to be made directly to the council to cover rent.ldquoThis year, the council has been able to secure over pound, of additional income for tenants by helping them secure backdated claims, ensuring the correct benefits are being received, assisting with appeals, and helping secure the best tarfs for utilities. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He made me feel very relaxed, said one patient after meeting Charles.ldquoWithin  seconds I felt at ease. It was nice to be able to say what you wanted, and he genuinely had an interest in the patients, said Kathryn Guercio, a Health Care Assistant at Marie Curie.For Kathryn, the royal visit was an opportunity to thank the prince.ldquoWhen I was  I left school with no qualications. I was an absolute angry drop out. I joined the Princes Trust volunteers because they didnrsquot know what  to do with me, Kathryn said.Established by Charles in , the Princes Trust helps vulnerable young people to find employment and gain valuable training.ldquoI did a fortnight of caring in Surry and I loved it. I absolutely loved it. Thatrsquos when I thought I could do this. I just love looking after people.ldquoItrsquos because of that choice to join the Princes Trust volunteers that I ended up where I am, so I genuinely do thank him for taming a very wayward -year-old.Describing her job at Marie Curie, Kathryn said: ldquoI love it here. Therersquos no comparison. You can give that  percent every sht. And wersquove got a cracking view. The sun rises and then the moon rises. We get to see it all across the water. Itrsquos gorgeous.Following the tour, the prince ended his visit at a reception where he met actor and Marie Curie ambassador, Suzanna Packer.In a brief speech, he commended the staff and volunteers for their dedication which he called lsquotruly remarkable.rsquoHe then unveiled a plaque to commemorate his visit and cut a daffodil-themed cake made by local Michelin-starred chef, James Sommerin.Angelina Hall and Cathy OrsquoDoherty, co-owners of Glass By Design at Station Approach, were commissioned to design and produce the plaque.ldquoIt was an honour for us as local artists to be asked to make this, said Cathy. ldquoItrsquos something which is going to be here for people to enjoy.His Royal Highness was also the first person to sign the charityrsquos Great Big Daffodil - a -foot tall model with paper books in the shape of petals which will start a UK wide tour this week.The Great Daffodil Appeal is an opportunity for people to share their stories, memories, or tributes to a loved one.After signing the book and cutting the cake, Charles gave a final farewell to the staff who had gathered to see him and left with his entourage.The prince met with flood victims in Pontypridd later that afternoon.His trip to South Wales also included engagements at the CAF train factory in Newport, the Aston Martin Lagonda factory in St. Athan, Barry, and the British Airways Maintenance Centre in Cardf. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

If anything at all is playing on my mind, I never lose my appetite, but I will lose slumber. I have friends who similarly suffer. I use the word suffer quite deliberately, because lying there in the dark at am it can feel like everyone  is snuffling softly but for the wide-awake person, it can feel horrendous. As the time ticks closer to the alarm and still sleep will not come, it can feel quite anxiety-inducing and so the vicious circle whizzes, fizzes and flies through your brain making sleep feel further and further away.But, as this is a lelong way of living for me and I am overwhelmingly a lsquocrack on kinda womanrsquo, I have developed ways to use this time effectively.

In a twisted way, this time and opportunity has become quite precious to me. I donrsquot know when  in the day Irsquod have the time and space to just ponder, muse, consider and percolate.

Rather than adhering to a nationally prescribed learning program, schools and practitioners will be able to make decisions that best meet the needs of specic learners.As well as contributing to the framework, St Josephrsquos has also introduced their own bespoke curriculum, and is one of only  Curriculum Innovation Schools in Wales.The St Josephrsquos curriculum is based on findings in child development and cognitive science, with staff undertaking extensive learning on how childrenrsquos bodies and minds develop.Lessons have been designed to enhance pupilsrsquo personal, social and physical development, whilst also providing a detailed knowledge and understanding of the world, both past and present.The school has also benefitted from signicant on-site works, including the refurbishment of all classrooms, a complete reconfiguration of the Foundation Phase learning spaces and a state of the art new-build Nursery.Staff regularly deliver learning experiences outside of the classroom, as the schoolrsquos grounds include a playing field, wooded area, pond, orchard, wildflower meadow and polytunnel.The implementation of the schoolrsquos ambitious curriculum has seen standards improve year on year. Last yearrsquos National Reading Tests saw the average child in St Josephrsquos score within the top  percent of the country, with similarly high standards achieved in mathematics.Headteacher, Gareth Rein said: ldquoWersquore extremely proud of our achievements at St Josephrsquos. Everything we do is based on the best available research and is designed to help each inidual child thrive.Cabinet Member for Education and Regeneration, Councillor Lis Burnett, said: ldquoThe new Curriculum for Wales is inspiring schools to take a more holistic approach toward learning. It encourages them to focus more on how and why the curriculum is being delivered, rather than delivering specic content and academic results.ldquoSt Josephrsquos have done a brilliant job in helping craft this approach, and in turn have seen their own curriculum and learning practices blossom.St Josephrsquos will be hosting an open day on Wednesday March . Parents and carers can visit the school at am, pm, and .pm.

The short list of potential locations for e-bike stations includes Penarth Town Centre, Cogan Train Centre, Penarth Train Station, Llandough Hospital, The Esplanade, Cosmeston Country Park, Cardf Bay Barrage, and Pont-y-Werin Bridge.The scheme hopes to encourage people to switch from their daily car journey to e-bikes, saving on average g of CO for every  kilometre travelled.The average round trip from Penarth to Cardf is km, which would save ,g of COused daily.Nextbike Managing Director, Krysia Solheim, said the Penarth scheme would be great for those who commute into the capital.ldquoWe know from our research that a lot of commuters already cycle from Penarth into Cardf, said Ms Solheim.ldquoE-bikes will make that journey easier and quicker than ever before, which will hopefully persuade more people to switch from four wheels to two on a daily basis. Picking up an e-bike instead of jumping in the car is also a great way for people to reduce their own personal carbon footprints to help our communities tackle climate change.ldquoPenarth will play an important part in leading the bike share revolution in Wales - itrsquos an exciting time - and we want the community to be as involved as possible.\"Councillor Peter King, Cabinet Member for Neighbourhood Services and Transport, said: ldquoFeedback from the Nextbike consultation was overwhelmingly positive, with many residents hoping to see the expansion of the scheme to the wider Vale.ldquoHaving declared a climate emergency last year, and having recently proposed a pound.m investment into tackling environmental issues, the Nextbike scheme will be a leading example of our commitment to tackling climate change and improving the wellbeing of our residents. We hope this will inspire the launch of similar schemes in future.The Nextbike project is being funded by Section  sustainable transport contributions. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The aim is that these virtues help to form them.With such a vast space at its disposal, the school ensures that children are given a rich and versatile experience.In the orchard, pupils pick fruit from pear, apple, plum, and damson trees which they use in cooking lessons during the autumn.They also grow  dferent kinds of fruit, salad, and vegetables in a polytunnel.Earlier this year, St Josephrsquos Primary was awarded a gold award in the UNICEF Rights Respecting School programme.The award is granted to schools which show a commitment to promoting childrenrsquos rights and raising awareness of these amongst young people.It recognises efforts to place the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child at the heart of a schoolrsquos policies and practice.ldquoAlongside our work on rights is the fact that we want our children to be aware of their responsibilities, said Mr Rein.ldquoYes, they have rights to be heard, but they also have a responsibility to listen to others.St Josephrsquos was the first school in Wales to develop a pupil parliament.Every child is a member of the parliament, and elected representatives from eight student groups form a cabinet which has decision-making powers.ldquoThe school parliament is a vehicle for the pupils to have a voice, so they can decide how the school can be a better place, how the local community can improve, and how we can help the UN to achieve their global goals, continued Mr Rein.ldquoSo the children are looking inward ndash at themselves and how the school environment can improve ndash and looking outward at how we can develop better links with the parishes and the areas of Penarth and Dinas Powys.ldquoOur Eco Ministry has been involved in a project to tidy beaches and pick up plastic, and our Healthy Schools and School Mission team have given food to local foodbanks.St Josephrsquos Primary is one of  innovation schools which have been chosen to contribute to the Welsh Governmentrsquos new curriculum framework, which will be rolled out to every school in Wales by . As part of the new framework, schools are required to design their own curriculum based upon the needs of specic learners, rather than adhering to a national learning program.St Josephrsquos curriculum is lsquoresearch-ledrsquo, meaning it is based on findings in child development and cognitive science.Teachers have undertaken training on how childrenrsquos bodies and minds develop, and lessons have been designed to enhance pupilsrsquo personal, social, and physical development.Mr Rein said: ldquoWe want our children to develop physically in terms of their gross motor skills, their fine motor skills, and their locomotion skills.ldquoWe have apparatus on which they can hang, climb, and swing, to build up their core strength.Mr Rein called the schoolrsquos curriculum lsquoreally ambitions.rsquoldquoWe are one of sixteen innovation schools in Wales helping to implement the new curriculum and develop special projects to do with the curriculum, he said.ldquoWe have taken that on by focusing on a knowledge-rich curriculum, so that we develop childrenrsquos knowledge, skills, and give them fantastic experiences.ldquoWe have taken good, rich materials from lots of dferent places, and developed some of our own, which we have implemented to a high standard.ldquoBehaviour in the school is exemplary partly because we have spent a long time asking what good teachers do.ldquoWe practice together as staff, so our teachers are working at a high level using a very well-researched curriculum.In last yearrsquos maths reasoning test,  per cent of pupils at St Josephrsquos scored higher than the national average, and  per cent of pupils scored above average in the National Reading TestldquoWersquore extremely proud of our achievements at St Josephrsquos, said Mr Rein.ldquoEverything we do is based on the best available research and is designed to help each inidual child thrive.The schoolrsquos curriculum has recently been praised by cabinet member for education and regeneration, Councillor Lis Burnett, who said St Josephrsquos had done a lsquobrilliant job.rsquoShe said: ldquoThe new Curriculum for Wales is inspiring schools to take a more holistic approach toward learning.ldquoIt encourages them to focus more on how and why the curriculum is being delivered, rather than delivering specic content and academic results.ldquoSt Josephrsquos have done a brilliant job in helping craft this approach, and in turn have seen their own curriculum and learning practices blossom. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We want to reassure you that we are prepared.Dame Gillian Guy, the head of Citizens Advice, said: ldquoKeeping people on supply, making sure they have warm homes and donrsquot face additional financial or other stresses about their energy supply will be essential.Experts say that while energy suppliers might need to change the way they buy energy from the wholesale market slightly, Britainrsquos gas and electricity grids should be able to keep the lights running during the crisis without much problem.And having people stuck at home might even out the peaks in the evening when people usually come back from work, when the strain on the energy system is at its highest.Meanwhile, as offices and factories shut down, daytime energy use is likely to fall slightly, even as more energy is used in British homes.ldquoTherersquos a bit of a question as to whether itrsquos more efficient to be heating one building with  people in, or  people heating their houses inidually, and the answer is probably no, said Rik Smith, an energy expert at Uswitch.But ldquoI wouldnrsquot expect it to be increasing the peak, he added.ldquoFrom that perspective I wouldnrsquot expect any material strain or additional sht, he told the PA news agency.But when taking into account industrial production, ldquooverall demand on the grid would be reduced, Mr Smith said.One of the bigger problems may be that customers who would normally rely on heating and lighting in their place of work will find their energy bills have increased at the end of the month.ldquoThis could mean that companies are money likely to experience bad debt hellip and that could place a strain on some of the businesses, Mr Smith said.Energy suppliers themselves had already been sending advice to customers. Last week, Bulb sent an email to pre-pay customers to ldquotop up more than usualyou can in case they have to self-isolate and cannot leave the house.Reports had already said that some suppliers were considering delaying payments.Anna Moss, at Cornwall Insight, said: ldquoSelf-isolating or working from home may mean consumers are using more energy, which for some consumers will pass through quickly to their energy bills.

It could be a last minute decision.”Of the cost of the trip which has prompted a lot of fundraising from the band, Sam said:“It’s cost £, to get everybody there.“We’ve been on the ball with fundraising since August last year.“Now we’re into March and the marching season has started, we’re really looking forward to it.“We did sayeverybody paid their own fare to get there we would raise funds to offset the costs when we get there, to pay for things like buses for excursions. “Some of us are going for  days, the majority just going for a week.“I’m going with my we Sharon, my son and my daughter, I’ve got an older son who isn’t going.“There’s  fathers and sons going out of the band. With one family there’s three generations – Victor Graham is going with his son David and his grandchildren Sam and Bobby.“Aside from the parade they’ll have us playing in Orange halls, clubs and places like that. We’ll be trying to get a bit of freetime for sightseeing, Niagara Falls, the CN Tower, places like that.“There’s people who will be meeting up with family when they’re over.”Of the ‘old boys’ going on the trip Sam said: “There’s a few boys going that were there in  and .“We’ve actually a boy coming from New Zealand, Philip Currie. The plan is he’ll come back to Northern Ireland and travel with us.“Another boy Jimmy McCullough, who was there in , he lives in Las Vegas now, he’s coming up to meet us from there.“He still has his unorm. When he comes home he guests with the band.“Two of the boys who are still in the band – Nigel Morrison and Trevor Whitten – they’ll be there too.“It’s going to be a bit of a reunion as well.“We’ve been going through the band archive to see who was in the band at the time, we’ve been in contact with them.“The reason why we’re going back is it’s the th anniversary or the formation of the Orange over there. It’s the longest running parade in the history of North America.“Because it was the th anniversary and they did ask us back we thought now was the time to go.”In  Portadown True Blues became the first blood and thunder band to form in Portadown.The band was founded by three men - Connie Linton, Glen Yeman and the late Eddie McKinney. Their practice takes place in Clounagh Orange Hall.Sam, who has been in the band since , said: “The band has between  and  members, from primary school age up to older ones. Me and Johnny Burns are there the longest. Johnny has been there  years.“I’ve been secretary, I’ve been chairman, the whole lot. I’m just an ordinary band member now and I’m on the Canada sub committee.”Sam is joined on the True Blues Canada sub committee by band chairman Stephen Woods, Stuart Currie, Dickie Craven and Jamie Kerr.Orangeism was present in Canada less than  years after its formation in Co Armagh, with the first documented Lodge being active by  in the city of Montreal in the province of Quebec. Other lodges soon came into existence, but they were essentially all a loose confederation until  when the Grand Orange Lodge of British America was formed. The ‘father’ of the Canadian Order is widely regarded to be the controversial Wexford born Canadian politician and newspaper mogul Ogle Robert Gowan. Initially membership was made up of Irish immigrants, however its ethos soon saw it expand its remit to recruit heavily from English, Scottish and other Protestants from across Europe. In the th Century it could boast lodges made exclusively from those of Italian descent, and of Mohawk Indians. From a membership of approximately , in the mid-’s, by the early th century it had well over , brethren across several thousand lodges. In Newfoundland a third of adult males were members, making it more popular there than even back at ‘home’ in Ireland. Four Canadian prime ministers were members of the institution while numerous other brethren have served at other levels, with famously almost every Toronto mayor between  and  unashamedly Orange. Whilst the membership today is a pale reflection of its past glories, there are still thousands of Canadian Orangemen, and the ‘Orange Hall’ is still a part of the physical landscape.Toronto’s Orange presence was such that it was often called the ‘Belfast of Canada’ and although numbers are reduced the annual procession is the longest running in North America.\"\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg bZbGUI\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-gtfDJT hQGsjX\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg bZbGUI\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-gtfDJT hQGsjX\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleMore from Portadown TimesAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bYSBpT sc-elJkPf kHpvMx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisCoronavirusSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us    "},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1584097229390.jpg--coronavirus__strule_house_closes.jpg?158409722900","title":"coronavirus strule house closes ","story":"Fermanagh and Omagh District Council has temporarily closed its Strule House premises on High Street, Omagh.The building has been closed as a precautionary measure due to a member of staff having had contact with a person who has tested positive for COVID-.
