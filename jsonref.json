This was set up by her mother Slavica Ecclestone —Bernie\u0027s former wife — in 1997 and raised £3 billion by selling shares in Formula One.Slavica and her daughters, Tamara and Petra, are the beneficiaries of the trust.The three women have been made so wealthy by the trust that Slavica — who orced Bernie in 2008 — blew £12 million on Petra\u0027s wedding to first husband, James Stunt.And there is nothing that goes down quite so well on Instagram as monumental excess.Tamara habitually shows off the fruits of her unfettered spending on social media, including a lavish £150,000 birthday party in June at which naked cowboys served tequila shots.There was speculation yesterday that her status as the blingiest woman in London might have made her a target for raiders, alerted to her leaving the property hours earlier when she posted pictures of her family aboard a private jet en route to Lapland.But friends insist the robbery is not connected to social media. \u0027I don\u0027t think it\u0027s got anything to do with her posting a picture of getting on a jet,\u0027 said the source.Be that as it may, father Bernie has been repeatedly dismayed by his flashy daughters — and their flashy husbands.The son of a Suffolk trawlerman, the 89-year-old former chief executive of Formula One is a workaholic and has no time for ostentation. His favourite meal remains egg on toast with brown sauce and, when they were growing up, his daughters didn\u0027t have a nanny or housekeeper.Bernie built up his fortune during his 40-year reign over world motorsport. In 2017, U.S. giant Liberty Media completed its £6.4 billion takeover of the sport, and Bernie was appointed chairman emeritus.Over the years, the Ecclestone family has fallen victim to numerous criminals. Bernie was mugged in 2010 on a London street, with £200,000 of jewellery taken.In 2016, his mother-in-law was kidnapped in Sao Paulo, Brazil, but released ten days later without any ransom being paid.Daughter Petra had jewellery worth £450,000 taken in 2013 from her house in Belgravia by a burglar posing as a prospective home buyer. He was later sentenced to eight years in prison.Meanwhile, the men in the lives of Tamara and Petra have also had brushes with the law.Jay Rutland, a former City trader who works for an art gallery, was accused in 2016 of helping a fugitive drugs baron — serious allegations that could have landed him in jail for up to seven years had the charges not been dropped for lack of evidence. Mr Rutland strenuously denied the allegations.         Husband Jay was in a less ecclesiastical mood, opting for a more pointed barb on the social media site which seemed to imply he knew who was behind the raid: \u0027I know u are lying, but continue\u0027 Three days after returning from their honeymoon in June, 2013, he was robbed at knifepoint at a petrol station in East London and had his £50,000 Rolex watch and a £20,000 gold bracelet stolen.Meanwhile, Petra\u0027s first husband James Stunt has been accused by Petra of being a fantasist and an art fraudster. Stunt, from Surrey, is a bullion dealer and art collector and his godfather is Terry Adams, the convicted money launderer and alleged gangster.Now bankrupt, Stunt told police he was the victim of a £90 million heist in his Belgravia home in 2017.But officers closed the investigation months later and no arrests have been made.Last month, open hostilities broke out between Petra — now engaged to former car salesman Sam Palmer — and Stunt.Petra married Stunt in 2011 and they had three children before orcing in 2017.She called Stunt \u0027horrible and narcissistic\u0027, adding: \u0027The man is not a billionaire and never was. Naively, I funded his life for our entire marriage.\u0027She added that Bernie had loaned him £10 million for his \u0027failed gold business\u0027 and said that Stunt \u0027spent most most of his days in bed high on prescription drugs\u0027.She said that he had threatened to kill her and expressed the hope that her unborn baby died of Aids. She added: \u0027The sad reality of it is James is not a gangster . . . he\u0027s just a prat.\u0027Stunt later responded to her accusations, describing them as \u0027falsehoods\u0027. He added: \u0027Petra, it\u0027s very sad that you\u0027ve had to tell so many lies.\u0027One daughter at war with her ex the other heartbroken by theft.As Bernie is no doubt sick and tired of being reminded, money sure can\u0027t buy happiness."},{"url":null,"title":"ANDREW PIERCE Tories latest cohort MPs provide portrait contemporary Britain","story":"Share this article Youngest Tory MP         Sara Britcliffe, 24Constituency: Hyndburn, majority of 2,951.Family: Her victory was sweet revenge for her father Peter, who twice tried and failed to win the constituency for the Tories.Education: Modern languages graduate from Manchester UniversityOccupation: Used to run a sandwich shop.Fun fact: The Tories\u0027 youngest MP, at the age of 22 she took a gap year from university to be the youngest Mayoress in the country – when she officiated by the side of her father, a councillor for more than 30 years, in Hyndburn.Trade union rep         Jonathan Gullis, 29Constituency: Stoke-on-Trent North, majority of 6,286.

In part that was because Mr Johnson needed the broadest possible support among MPs to have a hope of getting the Bill through.However, the Tory majority of 80 in the wake of the election means there is no danger that the government will struggle to get its tougher version through.  The move is designed to show Brussels that the PM will not soften his stance when trade talks begin next year.Michel Barnier, the EU\u0027s chief negotiator, has warned that securing a complete deal by next December is unrealistic.

The Vatican had long insisted that such confidentiality was necessary to protect the privacy of the victim, the reputation of the accused and the integrity of the canonical process.However, such secrecy also served to keep the scandal hidden, to prevent law enforcement from accessing documents and to silence victims, many of whom often believed that \u0027pontifical secret\u0027 prevented them from going to the police to report their priestly abusers.While the Vatican has long tried to insist this is not the case, it has never mandated that bishops and religious superiors report sex crimes to police, and in the past has encouraged bishops not to do so.According to the new instruction, which was signed by the Vatican secretary of state but authorised by the pope, the Vatican still does not mandate reporting the crimes to police, saying religious superiors are obliged to do so where civil reporting laws require it.But it goes further than the Vatican has gone before, saying: \u0027Office confidentiality shall not prevent the fulfilment of the obligations laid down in all places by civil laws, including any reporting obligations, and the execution of enforceable requests of civil judicial authorities.\u0027         Worshipers hold Christmas crib figures of the Christ Child during the Pope\u0027s weekly Angelus prayer on December 8, 2019 at St. Peter\u0027s Square the Vatican. Such secrecy also served to keep the scandal hidden, to prevent law enforcement from accessing documents and to silence victimsThe Vatican has been under increasing pressure to cooperate more with law enforcement, and its failure to do so has resulted in unprecedented raids in recent years on diocesan chanceries by police from Belgium to Texas and Chile.But even under the penalty of subpoenas and raids, bishops have sometimes felt compelled to withhold canonical proceedings given the \u0027pontifical secret\u0027, unless given permission to hand documents over by the Vatican. The new law means this explicit permission is no longer required.Inidual scandals, national inquiries, grand jury investigations, UN denunciations and increasingly costly civil litigation have devastated the Catholic hierarchy\u0027s credibility across the globe, and Francis\u0027 own failures and missteps on the issue have emboldened his critics.In February, he summoned the presidents of bishops conferences from around the globe to a four-day summit on preventing abuse, where several speakers called for a reform of the pontifical secret.Francis himself said he intended to raise the age for which pornography was considered child porn. "},{"url":null,"title":"Michael Gove says post Brexit trade deal end 2020","story":"Share this article Mr Johnson said the Tory victory in the election was \u0027seismic\u0027 and he was determined to lead a \u0027people\u0027s government\u0027.\u0027The voters of this country have changed this government and our party for the better, and we must repay their trust now to change our country for the better,\u0027 he said.He added: \u0027You ain\u0027t seen nothing yet.\u0027 Mr Johnson told ministers they should have \u0027no embarrassment about saying we are a people\u0027s government and this is a people\u0027s Cabinet\u0027. The meeting came after Mr Johnson moved to scotch speculation that he could embrace a softer Brexit in the wake of his election landslide.His official spokesman said he would insist on a \u0027Canada-style free trade agreement with no political alignment\u0027 – abandoning the closer ties planned by Theresa May.And parliament will lose its veto over the negotiating mandate Mr Johnson will take into next year\u0027s trade talks.

Witnessing this mega city from the plane is to suddenly realise the immensity of modern China. Roughly 50 million people live in this urban sprawl surrounding Hong Kong.Lianzhou is a four-hour drive from Guangzhou into the forested mountains of Guangdong province. It is perhaps an unlikely destination for a major arts event. But in 2005, Duan Yuting, a 47-year-old former photo editor for a Guangzhou newspaper, chose the city to found the festival, now firmly established as China’s leading contemporary photography event.For its 15th edition, the work of 50 artists from China and around the world can be viewed in a museum and two former industrial spaces in Lianzhou.One of the first exhibitions on show at the Granary venue is Argentinian artist Seba Kurtis’s series Immigration Files. Kurtis grew up in Buenos Aires before, at 27, escaping the Argentinian financial crisis of 2001 for a new life in Europe, only to find more hardship as an illegal immigrant in Tenerife.One of the few things Kurtis brought to Europe was a shoebox of family photographs and Super 8 films, rescued from his grandmother’s home after a flood. Mixed in with the photographs were artworks that Kurtis’ younger sister had created with glitter and glue. The flood had damaged the images, causing the glitter to meld with the emulsion from the photographs. Kurtis set about digitising these precious, distorted images. “I realised I couldn’t see the faces of family members I might never see again,” he says. “The water damage became representative of violence in my later work.”Kurtis, who is now based in Manchester, UK, would spend seven years as an undocumented immigrant on the Canary Islands and mainland Spain. The uncertainty and anxiety of that time, and his memories of the life he left behind in Argentina pervade the images on show at Lianzhou. In them, he returns to the bucolic coastlines of Tenerife and the Canary Islands – the first sight of land countless refugees glimpse as they cling to hazardous rafts crossing the Mediterranean.Evoking his sister’s artworks, Kurtis decorates these photographic landscapes with glitter. But he does so meaningfully as a way to visually illustrate recent sociological surveys detailing suicides, evictions and crimes among refugee communities in the Canary Islands. Aesthetically, he is linking his own history to that of the migrant experience. “The glitter represents my story, my family’s story,” he says.The tolls of migration, the loss of family and the pull of home are felt by many millions of Chinese citizens. These are captured with vivid detail by Chinese artist Qian Haifeng in his portraiture series The Green Train, an exhibition eight years in the making, and also on show at the Granary.“Green trains” are China’s cheapest form of long-distance travel. For the price of one first-class ticket from Shanghai to neighbouring Nanjing, one can travel the entire length of China on a green train. They are typically used by the lowest-income migrants. On the national day of the People’s Republic of China in October, these relics of the Cultural Revolution become the vessels for millions of Chinese migrants to return to their ancestral homelands.In the decade before he became a known photographer, Qian Haifeng was a fellow passenger. He was fascinated by the people with whom he shared such journeys – and never met again. In Lianzhou, he describes the carriages of the green trains as “live stages, where everyone’s lives are on display for others to see, and where everyone present has the potential to play a leading role”.Duan Yuting, the festival’s director, awarded Qian with the Lianzhou Foto festival’s Punctum prize in 2015. “When I gave him the award, many professional Chinese photographers did not like it,” Duan says. “But his most important characteristic is that he’s not an artist. He is just the same as the people on the trains. He lived there with them, and that’s how he related to them. That’s why only he was able to take these photographs.”The forested wilderness surrounding Lianzhou is home to some of the world’s rarest and most elusive animals, including China’s dwindling population of tigers.With this in mind, Swiss photographer Alex Hanimann displays his series Trapped at the Granary. This a collection of photographic portraits of wild animals taken by camera traps at night.Hanimann originally intended the images to be used in a scientific survey. But he realised his camera was capturing these secretive animals at their most expressive and characterful.Hanimann considers these images to be self-portraits – and unconscious selfies. The animals were unaware of the cameras, yet Hanimann saw “a world of small, dramatic happenings, micro-dramas and gestures”.Chinese authorities were present at the festival’s opening and did not take kindly to the work of Jenny Rova. Much of Rova’s exhibition, Älskling, which translates as “sweetheart”, was removed by censors before the public had chance to see it. In doing so, the authorities robbed Lianzhou of the chance to witness a beautiful and intimate example of conceptual portraiture.In 2015, the Swedish photographer, who lives and works in Zürich and combines her artistic practice with her work as a waitress, contacted each of her former partners. She asked them to send her all the images they took of her during their relationship. She ended up with 55 photographs from nine former lovers, revealed to us as Anders, Amir, Jonas, Henning, Étianne, Boran, Johan, Bruno and Dan.Speaking at the festival, Rova describes Älskling as: “My attempt to capture the way we look at each other when we’re in love, from one lover to the next.”Älskling begins in the hills surrounding Uppsala, Sweden, where Rova spent her teenage years, and ends with her facing orce while bringing up her infant son.By making these shared moments public, Rova reveals how different relationships can reveal contrasting, hidden sides of our personalities. The images comment on the role former relationships can play in the present of our lives – “you can sense the identity behind the camera,” she says.Behind the ScarA photographer dealing with memory, sex and the self in a radically ergent way is the Chinese photojournalist Liang Yingfei, who works for Beijing’s Caixin Media. Perhaps more so than any other artform, documentary photography is highly controlled in China, so Liang and her fellow photojournalists must develop creative conceptual techniques to explore their subjects without alerting the authorities.In Lianzhou, Liang tells the stories of sexual abuse survivors. The series, she says, was instigated after a friend was abused by a charity worker on a voluntary trip.After obtaining the trust of survivors of abuse, Liang used her camera to “reconstruct and visualise the recurring traumatic nightmares victims have experienced in the aftermath”. Her images include a slug crawling along a woman’s skin as she sleeps and a doll being held underwater.Resplendent with purple hair, the Shanghai-based photographer Coca Dai has been in trouble with the authorities before. But they allowed the festival to exhibit his compulsive, chronological portraits of his partner, Judy, over the course of their eight years together. The exhibition moves from portraits taken on the day they met, when the couple were still teenagers, through to the birth of their first child and on to the present day. Judy often poses like a conventional model but Coca’s images of her show her asleep, eating, or bathing herself or their child.Much of China remains avowedly patriarchal so unvarnished experiences of Chinese femininity are often hidden from view. Lin Ye, the Chinese curator, says of Coca’s exhibition: “In history, women have always lived under ship of men. They have been disciplined and trained to accept male scrutiny and cater to male standards. This visual mechanism has allowed women to internalise men’s scrutiny on themselves.”Coca’s unflinchingly honest portrayal of Judy, created in the linage of artists such as Nan Goldin and Wolfgang Tillmans, is an inversion of this lineage. These images may be authored by a man but they are a powerful portrait of modern Chinese womanhood. And they point, defiantly, to a more tolerant and hopeful future.For his series Freezing Land, Shanghai-based photographer Chen Ronghui used Kuaishou, or “choir show”, a Chinese social video app comparable to TikTok, to explore the lives of young people living in Fularji. The area was a once prosperous district in the province of Heilongjiang, near the border with North Korea. “Kuaishou is despised by many people in China,” Chen says in Lianzhou. “This is a story of young people getting back the right to express themselves.”The temperature can often drop to -30C (-27.4F) in Fularji, but the economy has frozen, too. “We’re used to thinking of Chinese cities purely in the context of massive growth but Fularji is an exception,” Chen says. Fularji was once China’s most renowned steel town. In the 1960s, it became home to the headquarters of China First Heavy Industries, and more than 15 million immigrants came to the region during Mao’s era. Today, it’s facing a bigger economic recession than anywhere else in China.Chen used Kuaishou to explore the lives of millennials living in the once great town, making contact first with Lin Zi, a 14-year-old who uses a local cafe to stream live performances online. After dropping out of school, Lin has gained almost a million fans. “My parents abandoned me and I make money by doing drag shows on a live streaming app,” Lin told Chen.“The young people I met on Kuaishou all experience a sense of uncertainty,” Chen says. “They face a choice: to leave for challenges in bigger cities or stay behind and embrace their fate. This is a wider story about China the uncertainty about our future, no matter who we are.”• Lianzhou Foto festival 2019 takes place in Lianzhou, China, until 3 January."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e7b6f083a914bc006c643135827c0aa04cb1e99/24_1706_2695_1617/master/2695.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=585cb654f980d86357d408c3ba7fb385","title":"top 15 photography books of 2019","story":"Pilgrims, hippies and voyeurs are among the subjects of this year’s most intriguing photo books, while the vivid dissonance of the Indian night conveys an essential truth about our times American photographer Gregory Halpern’s much anticipated follow-up to 2016’s acclaimed ZZYZX, which was a meditation on Los Angeles as a heightened state of mind as much as an actual place. With Omaha Sketchbook, Halpern explores the notion of American masculinity, his setting the midwestern Nebraskan city of the title where fundamentalist Christian values predominate. The book is designed to look like one of his work-in-progress notebooks, while his portraits and landscapes have a sense of suspended time as if the meaning of the place and its people remains somehow elusive despite the deep fascination he feels for them.Originally published on Bastille Day, 1968, by City Lights in San Francisco, On the Barricades is a sturdy zine-type publication that juxtaposes grainy images from the student uprising in Paris that year with the often elliptical situationist slogans that appeared daily on the city’s walls. It makes for an interesting, if surreal, blend of image and text, with lines such as “The smoke of grenades in the meadow of our eyelashes” accompanying photos of stone-throwing students facing off against cops firing teargas. This faithful facsimile from the ever-inventive Mörel books is an artefact from another, more revolutionary, time and a reminder of the impromptu creativity that attended the now distant youth protests of May 68.A complex photobook on every level, American Origami is an exploration of the psychological aftermath of seven American mass school shootings which combines Andres Gonzalez’s own detached, low-key photographs of now familiar towns and communities with a surfeit of statistical and forensic documents. Resembling a packed folder, the book unfolds to reveal a wealth of other related materials: news clippings, handwritten notes, drawings, memorabilia and an inventory of objects that speak of mass grieving. (More than 65,000 teddy bears were sent to Sandy Hook elementary school alone in the wake of the shooting there.) An ambitious attempt at understanding – and visualising – the fallout from a senselessly recurring American tragedy.A single retrospective volume that comprises Irish photographer Eamonn Doyle’s three self-published and now highly collectible photobooks, i, On and End. The first was described by Martin Parr as “the best street photobook in a decade”. Doyle’s often disorienting images of Dublin’s passing strangers are here paired with characteristically surreal prose by the Irish novelist Kevin Barry and the bold design is by the photographer’s longtime collaborator Niall Sweeney. The result adds up to a heady remix of Doyle’s small but vital back catalogue, its iconoclastic spirit more attuned to his parallel career as an electronic music producer and record label boss.A deceptively simple photobook that comprises just 14 portraits of Paul Graham’s elderly mother as she sits in an armchair in a retirement home. The muted colour tones and floral patterns of her clothes, bathed in natural light from a nearby window, seem almost universal in their evocation of old age and fragility. Graham’s point of view remains constant, his camera recording the slightest shifts in mood and expression. An intimate and meditative, but never intrusive, series of portraits that speak quietly of family ties, ageing and encroaching mortality.Peter Watkins was nine years old when his mother took her own life by walking into the sea. His long-term project, The Unforgetting, is part elegy, part meditation on the tides and long shadow of grief. Watkins creates sculptural still lifes from the things left behind, whether an unopened handbag or a cassette tape, each carrying its own secrets and imbued with a talismanic presence. Whether self-portraits or constructed tableaux, his starkly formal images reverberate with a sense of absence. A book about remnants, traces, memories and the unsettling power of photography.Alongside the recently published The Sound I Saw, which gathers Roy DeCarava’s beautifully meditative portraits of jazz performers including John Coltrane and Billie Holiday, Light Break offers a wider perspective on the life and work of a singular, somewhat elusive 20th-century American photographer. A master of often luminous street scenes and quiet, deeply observational portraits, DeCarava is perhaps most well known for Sweet Flypaper of Life, his collaboration with Langston Hughes. This illuminating retrospective shows the full range of his work and the consistency of his vision.The village of Älvdalen, in the west of Sweden, still has its own ancient language, Elfdalian. The place and its people cast a spell on Swedish-born photographer Maja Daniels, who spent her childhood summers there, roaming free in the woods. Her book is a meditation on memory, mystery and belonging that contrasts her own often impressionistic landscapes and portraits with the work of a pioneering local photographer and eccentric, Tenn Lars Persson, who was born there in 1878. It is this visual dialogue between old and new, strange and commonplace, that lends the book its quiet cumulative power.Prefaced by an Emily Dickinson poem – “Tell all the Truth but tell it slant” – Aaron Schuman’s book couples his own wryly revealing photographs (all taken within a 30-mile radius of the poet’s home town of Amherst, Massachusetts) with clippings from the police report section of the local newspaper. To give just one example: “A man shoveling snow on State Street told police he saw a strange orange glow coming from the eastern sky that might have been something on fire. Police determined the glow was probably the sun coming up for the day.” Slant is a witty, deadpan meditation on small-town America that carries a darker undertow in the age of fake news, post-truth politics and alternative facts.Some photobooks stand alone for their subject matter and the audacity of their approach. The Park is a case in point. In the early 1970s, Kohei Yoshiyuki captured the illicit sexual encounters that took place in Tokyo’s parks at night, creeping close to furtive couples and the voyeurs that observed them. His infrared camera lends these clandestine acts another layer of transgression, capturing the desperation and essential loneliness of these fleeting encounters as well as the creepiness of those watching. A compelling if unsettling book, reissued with additional previously unseen images.“The Second Shift is the term given to the hidden shift of housework and childcare primarily carried out by women on top of their paid employment,” writes Irish artist Clare Gallagher in her short introduction to a beautifully designed book of deftly observed images. They evoke the quotidian work rituals of home and family, and her own anger at what is taken for granted. For all that, Gallagher is a quiet photographer, a creator of intimately observed details that can often approach the dreamlike: unwashed laundry overflowing from a basket, a tangle of electrical wires emanating from an extension socket, vegetable peelings, eggshells, food residue soaking in an oven dish. Her images illuminate a domestic grind so familiar and habitual that it all but goes unseen.In 1968, Dennis Stock, best known for his iconic portraits of James Dean, took a five-week road trip through California to document the hippie counterculture of rock festivals, communes and drug-fuelled mind expansion. To the sceptical photographer, California had become a “head lab” for the adventurous and impressionable. The more he travelled, though, the more his fascination grew. His images of hippies, bikers, surfers, protesters and utopian dreamers remain resonant, becoming reflections of a freer, more questioning US bathed in the glow of collective optimism and that fabled California sun.Tomlinson has been acclaimed for her images of contemporary pilgrims in religious sites in France, Poland and Ireland. Ex-Voto gathers her stark monochrome portraits of pilgrims, large format landscapes and mysterious still lifes of offerings left in rocks and trees at Lourdes, Ballyvourney and Grabarka. The results possess a kind of serene calmness that befits the subject matter, her portraits in particular capturing the reverent otherness and simplicity of the devotional life.Close to where he lives in rural Sweden, English photographer Stephen Gill drove a tall wooden stake into the ground near a stream in a flat landscape of spreading fields. On an adjacent wooden pillar, he mounted a motion-sensor camera. From that simple idea, The Pillar was born: a book of photographs of wild birds in close-up, alighting and taking flight, resting, feeding, preening and watching. “I’d never seen birds in this way before,” writes Karl Ove Knausgård in his accompanying essay, “as if on their own terms, as independent creatures with independent lives … and so infinitely alien to us.”An evocation of “the loneliness and suspicion of the Indian night”, The Coast is a vivid, unsettling merging of the fictional and the real. Hura’s free-flowing visual narrative echoes both the overload of social media imagery and the edginess he encountered on unfamiliar Indian streets at night.Playing with ideas of privacy, voyeurism and trust, the young Indian photographer creates an almost hallucinatory world where spectral figures loom out of the enveloping dark, people grapple in the rubble and religious revellers give way to abandonment, their faces daubed with powdered paint.The context is what Hura describes as the “increasing dissonance” of India’s Hindu nationalist politics. The Coast possesses a visual dissonance of its own through his use of unforgiving flash, colour saturation and frequently jarring juxtapositions of the real and the staged. “For me,” says Hura, “the notion of photography as fiction is a given.” For all that, his unreal images convey an essential truth about our turbulent times."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc8e64a418bc6730796b4c97e63ab1730f5dd9d8/0_14_3984_2391/master/3984.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=deb6e29c0ff2dff91bc0989e15d50a6f","title":"australian heatwave records forecast to be broken as temperatures surge past 40c","story":"Oodnadatta and Port Augusta forecast to reach 48C and Sydney’s western suburbs to hit 45CDecember heat records are expected to tumble in Australia from Wednesday as a heatwave moves across South Australia to Victoria and New South Wales.Temperatures are forecast to peak in Victoria and South Australia on Friday, with Oodnadatta and Port Augusta to reach 48C, and peak in NSW on Saturday.NSW has been placed under a total fire ban from midnight on Tuesday to midnight on Saturday as firefighters battle to contain more than 100 fires burning around the state, including the 400,000 hectare Gospers Mountain megafire in Wollemi national park in the Blue Mountains.Smoke from this fire is forecast to lay thick over Sydney on Wednesday morning, but will shoot up to 3km up into the atmosphere on Thursday when the heatwave reaches western Sydney. Penrith is forecast to reach 44C on Thursday and 45C on Saturday, while the eastern suburbs of Sydney will reach 39C on Thursday and 35C on Saturday.Extreme fire danger is forecast for greater Sydney, the Illawarra and the southern ranges on Thursday.Tibooburra, a small town in the far north-west of NSW, has been above 40C since Monday and is expected to remain above that temperature until Christmas Day.Some of the official weather stations in NSW, like the Bathurst agricultural station, have records dating back 108 years. The hottest ever December day on record at that station is 38.9C on 27 December 1938, during a historic heatwave that wrought the deadly Black Friday bushfires on 13 January 1939.The hottest temperature ever recorded at that station was 41.5C on 11 February 2017, a day of catastrophic fire danger on which the St Ivan fire burned 55,000 hectares of bush and farmland and destroyed 35 homes around Uarbry in the upper Hunter Valley.“The forecast predicts that Bathurst is going to exceed that December record by a pretty big margin, with a forecast top of 41C,” Taggart said. “To be having these levels of temperatures at this time of year, not in the peak of summer but in mid-December, is pretty big.”This year was tracking to be Australia’s second hottest on record, behind 2013, based on average monthly temperature data from January to November. It would have sailed into second place had December temperatures been average.“It is going to provide pretty tough competition for Australia’s warmest year on record,” Taggart said.Three of the four hottest years on record in Australia have occurred in the past six years, and all have occurred in the past 15.“Australia has warmed by about 1.4C since pre-industrial times and that warming trend is increasing,” Taggart said. “So as climate scientists have been saying for 20 years, we can expect more frequent heatwaves, and more severe heatwaves, and this is certainly an example of that.”The southern parts of SA, from Port Lincoln to Mount Gambier, will also be under a total fire ban tomorrow, with extreme fire danger in the Yorke Peninsula, areas outside Adelaide, and the lower south-east.A total fire ban will also be enforced in the Wimmera region of Victoria on Wednesday, where the danger rating has been set at severe. The rest of the state, including the Mallee region, which will see the top temperatures tomorrow with Mildura to reach 43C, has a fire danger rating of very high.Melbourne is forecast to reach 39C on Wednesday and 41C on Friday, when Mildura is forecast to experience its hottest ever December day of 47C.“It’s going to be hot all the way through,” said Christie Johnson, duty forecaster with the Bureau of Meteorology in Victoria."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f50c5ed7ea999c75782f260939691b8217281d30/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=55d53b9920c43bada0ba523f53c6d0c1","title":"all nighters and sideways ideas readers books of the year","story":"From rich histories to intense, dystopian futures, commenters share the highlights of their reading yearsI immensely enjoyed almost all books that I read from this year. By far, Deborah Levy’s The Man Who Saw Everything (Hamish Hamilton) was my favourite. Very close behind was Ann Patchett’s The Dutch House (Bloomsbury), which I picked after reading Cardellina’s enthusiastic comments. I’m so grateful for it because I absolutely loved it … a stunning novel.VesnaD13The second book in Philip Pullman’s Book of Dust trilogy, The Secret Commonwealth (PenguinDavid Fickling) picks up the story of Lyra, her daemon Pantalaimon, Malcolm and others 20 years after Lord Asriel left Lyra at Jordan College under “scholastic sanctuary”. Lyra’s adventures continue in the complex and detailed worlds Pullman has created. Beautifully written, the story brings you to tears. Eagerly anticipating the third book. IsisWalnutThis Life by Martin Hägglund (Profile) challenged my beliefs. The Swedish professor of literature outlines his philosophy of life using literary memoirs by Augustine, Proust and Knausgaard as sources. He claims that true freedom is about how we choose to spend our limited time while we are alive contrasting this with religious ideas of an eternal afterlife that undermine the value we place on this life … Given the climate emergency, and the failure of capitalism to respond quickly enough, the time seems ripe for a radical rethink of how we live. rgilyeadNo trouble making a choice this year: The Five by Hallie Rubenhold (Doubleday). It’s a remarkable, well researched and readable book about the lives of the five known victims of Jack the Ripper. It was more than time that those women were shown some respect as human beings. So much has been written about the murderer’s possible identity and the victims have been sidelined for too long. I recommend this book to anyone. Maggie BAs someone who grew up on dance music and club culture in the late 80searly 90s, my book of the year is Join the Future: Bleep Techno and The Birth of British Bass Music by Matt Anniss (Velocity Press). Really well written and comprehensively sets the sociopolitical backdrop in Yorkshire to the most exciting five years or so in the development of British dance music. ColinKmagPatience by Toby Litt (Galley Beggar) is a desperately beautiful, emotionally intense, and uniquely moving novel told by Elliott, a remarkable narrator who is a wheelchair user. Elliott’s greatest abilities and greatest lessons for us are to make so great an experience from so little, to examine even the most mundane and limiting circumstances for their variety, meaning and experience, to approach life with a wonderful mixture of optimism and hope while still being fully aware of its sadness and tragedy. MrBrownDrive Your Plow Over the Bones of the Dead by Olga Tokarczuk (translated by Antonia Lloyd-Jones, Fitzcarraldo). Strange and unusual, it draws you in with its flat, brilliant sentences and brings up in a fresh, sideways fashion some crucial ideas: connection to the larger-than-human natural world the nature of authority economic venality how do we know anything? (For those who might have missed it, she’s the Polish writer who won the 2018 Nobel prize in literature, which I now think was an inspired choice.) cannotlookawaySince I tend to read either library books or secondhand ones, my reading list is a bit short on the latest bestsellers – my principle usually being if it deserves to be read it will still be good reading a year (or 20) later. But one book I did cough up for new this year was Plastic Emotions by Shiromi Pinto (Influx Press), about the relationship between Le Corbusier and Minnette da Silva, the first woman to become an architect in Sri Lanka and the first Asian woman in the Royal Institute of British Architects. Not everyone may share my enthusiasm for long discussions on modern architecture as voiced by the characters, or musings on feminism. But those interested will enjoy it. CloudyAgainI read The Fell by Robert Jenkins (RedDoor Press) twice. Once as an all-nighter and again slowly to really appreciate the beauty and simplicity of language as we follow the teenage narrator descend into dark and magical places. The bonding and rebelliousness of the urban tribe, the love and loss, the dislocation and abandonment but ultimately the triumph and sheer delight in chaos. It saved my life and it genuinely feels like something very special has been overlooked in this book not getting mass coverage. Ulysses meets Fight Club … a Catcher in the Rye for our times but so much more. JohnnyTbetterThe Giver of Stars by JoJo Moyes (Penguin) is about the horseback library women in Kentucky in the 1930s, who brought books to the desperately poor families in the backwoods and hills, in a scheme begun by Eleanor Roosevelt. It’s a lovely novel, full of beautiful description and memorable characters, and the overriding theme – the value of stories and literature – is one very close to my heart. elfwynAfter thoroughly enjoying Natalie Haynes’s The Children of Jocasta, I was not disappointed with her 2019 book A Thousand Ships (Mantle). I’m still enjoying Julie Armfield’s collection of short stories, Salt Slow (Picador). As for non-fiction, McKenzie Wark’s Capital Is Dead. Is This Something Worse? (Verso) is an excellent critique of lazy left thinking on the inevitability of capitalism, the “sacralisation” of Marxisant thinking and the need to think creatively about social life. She never disappoints. tony2014Middle England by Jonathan Coe (Viking), a fictionalised account of Britain from 2010-2018 as seen through the experiences of the Trotter family and friends the third book in the series. Insightful and humorous. Whimsy2015In the last couple of months, I’ve been very impressed by Yōko Ogawa’s The Memory Police (translated by Stephen Snyder, Harvill Secker), an extraordinary meditation on the nature of memory that is, at the same time, proof that dystopian fiction can be beautifully written.And with an eye on global climate change, Cynan Jones’s Stillicide (Granta) is a little similar in style to Reservoir 13, in that a whole community emerges through a series of more or less oblique, more or less self-contained chapters (in this case, originally written as 15-minute stories for broadcast on BBC Radio 4). I was alerted to it by a fine review in the  by Nina Allen, whose superb The Rift I had just finished reading, and whom I am fast coming to consider as a reviewer of comparable stature to John Burnside or M John Harrison. robjam10 Minutes 38 Seconds in This Strange World by Elif Shafak (Penguin) is a splendid book. It was so full of everything: history, geography, love and friendship, family. It was serious and comic … just a beautiful book. VignolesViewThe Wall by John Lanchester (Faber) is a fascinating and chilling story of Britain after “the Change”, which is the catastrophic consequences of global warming. All we really learn about that is that sea levels have risen. Britain is now surrounded by a wall built to keep the Others out. The narrator is a guard on the wall and the author brilliantly relates his story of long periods of boredom disrupted by the sudden violence of attacks by the Others. The story is, however, curiously ethnocentric and you are left wondering what happened to the rest of Europe and the world. Still, a thrilling and thought-provoking read. Buddha_indeedFighting the People’s War by Jonathan Fennell (CUP) draws on army censorship reports to paint a picture of the morale and motivation of British and Commonwealth armies in the second world war and shows that the citizen soldiers required more complex motivation to make them fight than “for King and Country”. It covers the efforts that the allied armies used to improve the morale of their soldiers and highlights the role of one of the forgotten heroes of the war, General Sir Ronald Adam, Adjutant-General of the British army, whose job it was. SackTheJugglerI read The Anarchy: The Relentless Rise of the East India Company by William Dalrymple (Bloomsbury) two months ago after reading this review in the . It did not disappoint. It is beautifully written. It has a superb cast of characters. It is driven by a strong narrative. It is related to our times with its focus on ruthless corporate greed and corrupt politics. The illustrations are gorgeous. theupsetappletartI’m nominating The Carer (Headline) by that writer’s writer Deborah Moggach. It’s a wryly humorous comedy of manners, though you might not expect it from an initial plot summary. James, retired from his position as an eminent academic and living in the family’s former holiday cottage, is not coping well after his wife dies. After he has a fall his children, who have the usual mid-life problems, decide he needs live-in care.Eventually they engage frumpy-but-cheerful Mandy, but then start to worry about her influence as the old man’s behaviour changes radically. And no, it’s not what you (and they) initially think. And yes, it should generate discussion about parents and children, relations between men and women, social expectations and obligations, keeping secrets and telling the truth.

In fact, at least as far as the financial sector is concerned, the bigger threat to European regulatory harmony could come from France.The phrase “Singapore-on-Thames” is shorthand for Britain becoming a low-tax, lightly regulated economy that can out-compete the sclerotic, over-regulated eurozone from a strategic position only 20 miles or so offshore. The general idea was first mooted a couple of years ago by Philip Hammond, then Britain’s chancellor of the exchequer, as a means of encouraging the EU to strike a friendly Brexit deal with the UK.Those who know Singapore well will quickly recognise that the analogy is far from perfect. True, Singapore has low tax rates (unless you wish to import an expensive foreign car), and low levels of public spending – although the latter does not seem to be part of the plan for Singapore-on-Thames advocates.But the idea that Singapore is a deregulated paradise is not borne out by reality, as anyone who has tried to dispose of a piece of used chewing gum there will know. As Guy de Jonquières has noted, Singapore’s success owes more to the fact that it is a “meticulously planned economy” with “handholding and cosseting” of overseas investors by “powerful, eager to please bureaucrats”.The political prospectuses of both major parties in the UK general election, with their nostalgic ideas for reviving British manufacturing, would seem to suggest that Britain should be reborn as a latter-day Stoke-on-Trent, rather than as a 21st century European Singapore. Nonetheless, the notion that the UK might seek a post-Brexit competitive advantage through deregulation – particularly in relation to financial services – has taken hold on the continent, where it has become something of a bogeyman, used to frighten other EU member states.The EU commissioner responsible for the financial sector, Valdis Dombrovskis, has warned that the UK cannot hope to retain access to EU markets if it departs from the bloc’s rules. “The more systemically important the market,” he argues, “the closer the regulatory alignment that is expected.” The UK, Dombrovskis says, must think very carefully before it moves away from rules followed by the rest of the EU. If it does erge, the access of UK-based financial firms to EU markets could be restricted.From the perspective of a London-based bank, this argument seems strange. I can identify no notable constituency in British politics that favours significant bank deregulation. The Bank of England argues that capital ratios are now adequate, and those who disagree tend to want even heavier burdens on banks. The issue of financial regulation has not featured prominently in the general election debates, which is hardly a surprise. And we have seen no sign that the pendulum is swinging back toward deregulation, as it has begun to do in the US.Whereas British politicians recently have offered no words of comfort to UK banks, France’s finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, has declared himself in favour of easing the capital burden on French banks in the interests of competitiveness. “We have gone too far in setting these requirements,” Le Maire said recently. Basel III, the stone tablets that contain the global standards for banking regulation, “must be simplified and lightened,” he declared, adding that “American banks are not subject to rules as strict as those which apply to European banks.”Le Maire thus seems to be on a collision course with Dombrovskis, the EU’s financial rule-setter-in-chief, who says, “the EU is committed to carrying through the final Basel III reforms faithfully.”That is the UK position, too, but it seems no longer to be the French view. So, in the world of financial regulation, a “Frexit” from the Basel framework seems more of a threat to the level European playing field than Brexit is. With the French president, Emmanuel Macron, having recently deemed Nato to be “brain dead”, it seems that a similar verdict on the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision is now being prepared.It is true that some aspects of the global agreement on Basel III, reached – reluctantly in the case of France and Germany – at the end of 2017, weigh more heavily on European banks than on their US peers. That is partly because mortgages are rarely securitised and sold in Europe, whereas in the US, two state-guaranteed enterprises, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, stand behind the mortgage market and warehouse loans originated by banks. Also, European banks lend more to large, highly-rated corporate customers, which in the US typically fund themselves in the capital markets. The so-called “output floors” in the Basel accord therefore affect European banks more severely.These are valid points. But, rather than launching another transatlantic political dispute, it would be preferable if consenting regulators could privately negotiate a way to smooth the hard edges in the Basel accord. Frexit could be just as damaging to Europe’s financial system as Brexit.• Sir Howard Davies, the first chairman of the UK’s Financial Services Authority, is chairman of RBS.

Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club forecasting group, says:There is little in the December industrial trends survey to inspire hopes that the new year will bring better times for the UK manufacturing sector after what looks to have been a very difficult fourth quarter.However, the hope for manufacturers is that reduced uncertainties following the decisive General Election result and the UK now leaving the EU with Boris Johnson’s deal on 31 January will encourage businesses to invest more and lift consumer willingness to buy big-ticket items.However, significant Brexit uncertainties remain which, along with a challenging global environment may limit the upside for investment in 2020. Consumers may also face less favourable fundamentals due to a softer labour market and reduced earnings growth.Time for a quick recap.The pound has suffered a sharp tumble as the government prepares to pass legislation that could cause a “cliff-edge” Brexit at the end of next year. Sterling has slumped by nearly 1.5 cents today to below $1.32, back towards levels seen before Thursday’s general election.Britain’s factories have suffered their worst slump in activity since the financial crisis a decade ago. Orders also took a worrying tumble, suggesting manufacturing’s recession isn’t over.The latest UK labour market statistics are a mixed bag. Unemployment is down (good) and employment is up (also good), but wage growth has slowed (bad) and vacancies are down too (worrying).The CBI’s director general, Carolyn Fairbairn, has issued a statement pledging to help Boris Johnson secure a new trade deal with the EU by the end of next year.“Business has had enough of uncertainty and shares the Prime Minister’s ambition for a fast EU trade deal. With only a year to go, we are committed to working with the Government to secure an ambitious deal that supports all sectors of the economy. Every step in the negotiations will have an impact on jobs, firms and communities.“Speed and ambition can go hand in hand if the right approach is taken. There’s no time to lose, with a top priority being to build a best-in-class trade architecture, with business round the table, enabling EU trade talks to begin early in the new year. Firms stand ready to bring the evidence needed from factories and boardrooms across the UK to enable a good trade deal to be agreed as quickly as possible.”In the past, the CBI - which opposed Brexit in 2016 - has sounded more critical about the issue. Last month, MPs attacked it for not applying for funds to help businesses with their no-deal preparations.The CBI also resisted commenting on whether it thinks achieving a trade deal by December 2020 is achievable. Former Trade secretary Liam Fox has said today that it’s possible....Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at Forex, says he pound was hit by a double whammy of bad news this morning. First and foremost, it was reports that the UK government will block the EU transition extension beyond 2020, raising concerns that this could potentially result in a hard Brexit. Then, the latest wages data came in below expectations while unemployment claims grew more than anticipated.As a result, the GBPUSD further extended its post-election losses to hit a low so far of 1.3156. But at the time of writing, the cable was coming off its worst levels as the buyers attempted to defend a key short-term support level around 1.3180.And here’s the result:Here’s our news story on today’s UK jobs report:Today’s dire UK factory data haven’t helped the pound - it’s still wallowing around $1.32, down a cent this morning.Deutsche Bank has warned its clients that the pound is likely to weaken in 2020, as renewed Brexit uncertainty threaten to drag the economy into a recession.UK manufacturers are crying out for some economic certainty, says Anna Leach, the CBI’s deputy chief economist.Here’s her take on this morning’s worrying factory data:“With manufacturers reporting that output is declining at a pace not seen since the financial crisis, alongside another month of softer order books, it is crucially important to rebuild business confidence in this sector.“After three years of gridlock, the Prime Minister now has a clear mandate to govern. Businesses across the UK will want him to break the cycle of uncertainty. Firms will be looking for reassurance of the new Government’s commitment to getting the UK economy fighting fit as it prepares to exit the EU.”The slump in UK factory output this autumn is due to Brexit worries, and weakness in the global economy, says Tom Crotty of chemicals giant INEO.“These disappointing figures are reflective of the widespread weakness in the global manufacturing sector and the impact of continued Brexit uncertainty in the run-up to the General Election. “Following the General Election, manufacturers will be eager to see the Prime Minister break the cycle of Brexit uncertainty as a priority. There is also a fresh opportunity for the sector to work with the government to solve long-term challenges such as raising productivity, addressing skills shortages, improving sustainability and tackling climate change.”NEWSFLASH: Britain’s factory sector has suffered its worth quarter since the financial crisis, as Brexit uncertainty hurts the sector.The CBI has reported that output volumes fell in the three months to December, at the fastest pace since the financial crisis, with output expanding in only six out of 17 sub-sectors.The headline fall in output was primarily driven by the motor vehicles sub-sector -- probably because several carmakers held shutdowns in November in case Britain had crashed out of the EU at the end of October.Factory bosses also reported that order books were weaker than normal, a worrying sign for prospects in 2020.Manufacturing activity worsened in December, finishing off what has been a generally difficult year for the sector following the stockpiling boost in Q1 2019. Output volumes in the three months to December fell at their quickest rate since the financial crisis. Export order books worsened noticeably, while total order books remained similarly weak to November, and both remain considerably weaker than their respective long-run averages.Meanwhile, stocks of finished goods rose further above “adequate” levels. Looking ahead, manufacturers expect output to fall at a slower pace.UK businesses need to pay attention to Boris Johnson’s Brexit strategy, and keep preparing for a no-deal crisis at the end of next year.So says Paul Hardy, Brexit director at global law firm DLA Piper:“Cementing the end of the transition in legislation is a game-changer. It shows this is not a negotiating tactic.Businesses must now expect a limited trade deal in goods with the EU on 1 January 2021, but not in services or the possibility of no deal at all. They should keep their no-deal Brexit planning warm: it may well come in useful in a year.”Shares in UK-focused companies are sliding further into the red, wiping out some of the gains recorded on Friday.Sterling’s slump today is a timely reminder that Brexit is far from over, despite Boris Johnson’s election claims that he would get it “done” and move onto other issues.Dean Turner, economist at UBS Wealth Management, has warned that sterling will remain highly volatile over the next few months, with a crucial deadline falling in the summer.“The pound’s latest slide is symptomatic of the fact that Brexit is a way off being “done”, and will remain important for sterling over the coming months.“Despite the Prime Minister’s new-found majority spurring a relief rally, gains were always likely to be capped as investors turned their attention to phase two of the talks. The deadline for extending the UK’s transition period beyond the end of next year comes on 1 July. The risk of the UK reverting to trading with the EU on WTO terms could still drive larger GBP moves, particularly given the latest noises coming out of Downing Street.“We expect a trading range between 1.30 and 1.40 until June.”Back in the markets, sterling is still being pummelled by Brexit fears.The recent ‘Boris Bounce’ is well and truly over, as the government hardens its commitment to ending the withdrawal period at the end of December. Remember, the pound hit $1.35 as the election results rolled in during the early hours of Friday morning.Michael Gove, who has been closely involved with no-deal Brexit planning, has defended the plan to make it illegal to request an extension to EU alignment beyond 2020.He told BBC Breakfast that the government is fully committed to delivering Brexit on time.We are going to leave the European Union on 31 January because of the withdrawal agreement. And then the political declaration, which goes alongside the withdrawal agreement, commits both sides to making sure that the follow-up conversations are concluded by the end of 2020.”And he denied that the December 2020 deadline could slip:“No. We are going to make sure we get this deal done in time.”There’s a real gender split in today’s unemployment report.The number of employed men jumped by 54,000 on the quarter to 17.31m, while the number of employed women fell by 30,000 to 15.49m. That reverses a recent trend, which has seen more women entering the labour market (partly due to pension changes).If you include bonuses, UK pay growth also took a hit last month.That’s partly because some workers received bigger bonuses in October 2018 than this year.Newsflash: Britain’s unemployment rate has stuck at its lowest level in 45 years, but wage growth has slowed.For August to October 2019, an estimated 1.28 million people were unemployed. This is 93,000 fewer than a year earlier and 673,000 fewer than five years earlier."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/200deffc48d715c8e35f89166b4c0a8a01ced9ac/0_76_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=32351b69f255de4e47b2e18a517278d3","title":"lib dems tories split vote labour","story":"The party’s only achievement was to split the vote. It should now merge with Labour and become a moderate influenceNo, it was not just Jeremy Corbyn. Last week’s crushing defeat of the left was also caused by the Liberal Democrat party splitting the vote. Yet again, by offering itself as the vote launderer of British liberalism, it has served as merely the fellow traveller of British Conservatism. Boris Johnson owes it a huge debt of gratitude.As for the election being a “second referendum” on Brexit, anti-Brexit or second referendum parties won more votes than did Johnson, even assuming all Tories were pro-Brexit. Yes, leave voters appear to have swarmed to the Conservatives, notably in the north, and are thus probably short-term. But the Lib Dem vote soared by 1.3m or 4.1 percentage points, while Corbyn’s fell by 2.6m. Johnson’s rose by only 304,000. The reality is that the left-of-centre vote was calamitously split. Polling during the campaign saw Labour surge only when the Lib Dems appeared to collapse.With the exception of the Tony Blair era, Labour has been persistently vulnerable to moderate leftwing sentiment defecting to the Liberals. Somehow such voters feel they can exonerate themselves from guilt by association with socialism without overtly siding with conservatives. They can comfort themselves that they voted “a curse on both houses”. In reality they did not. They effectively voted Conservative, or in a very few Lib Dem seats, they voted “hung parliament”.With the Lib Dems leaderless and in disarray, it must be time for them to do the honest thing and disband. They should reverse the old 1983 SDP marriage, and merge with a revivalist Labour. It would galvanise Labour’s moderate wing and dilute the influence of the Corbynites.The Liberals have never looked like winning an election since Lloyd George’s day. They have offered an electoral dustbin between political polarities, a media-cosseted Westminster club with a peerage auction for richer donors on the side. Liberals failed to capitalise on regionalism or nationalism. They were never truly radical, and in coalition were a broken reed. For the past year, the party has been a convalescent home for wounded warriors from the major parties, a gesture voters have treated with derision.This party is an anachronistic political spoiler. Its time is surely over. Liberal Democrats should disperse and confer their moderating influence on two bigger parties, who badly need it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/09f6e2ad7bbc826142cc083e6102d23694d1a43b/95_199_4161_2497/master/4161.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0bfa1eed8b0716b3893b92bbdcd15ffd","title":"now britains navel gazing has to end its time to keep our aid pledge to the world","story":"DfID must remain independent to safeguard aid commitments and our global reputation, says former ministerWe are standing at a pivotal moment in the UK’s relationship with the rest of the world.As parliament reassembles post-election, nations around the world, both within the EU and beyond, are waiting to see what direction the UK will take.The past three years have been dominated by Brexit. By deals forged and then lost. By a string of votes in parliament. By demonstrations and debates and disunity. Whatever side of the fence you fall on, it’s hard to disagree that our country has lost its united national purpose.Looking from the outside, many nations – even while accepting the referendum result – have been truly puzzled and dismayed by our handling of it.We cannot afford another three years of navel-gazing. While digesting the impact of the election on pressing national issues, it’s time that Britain confounded that puzzlement abroad and reaffirmed its place as an outward-facing, global leader. And there’s no better place to do that than within international development.The UK has a long and proud legacy of supporting and investing in the world’s most vulnerable communities. From Bolivia to Bangladesh, our investment has saved the lives of millions, and is helping them reshape and rebuild shattered communities.But while we’ve made huge progress in reducing extreme poverty worldwide, there is still a long way to go. Climate change is taking hold, natural disasters are becoming more deadly and frequent than ever before, new wars are erupting and mass displacement is growing. The world is becoming a more dangerous place, especially for children.They can’t wait for Britain to get its act together.I served as minister of state for the Department for International Development (DfID) until earlier this year I’ve seen first-hand what a difference aid makes. With the full backing of a parliament that is often bitterly ided on other matters, we helped deliver £30 million to rebuild hospitals, schools and other vital buildings destroyed by Islamic State in Iraq. As a result, families torn apart by the terror group’s brutality have been able to start moving back home. Aid is more than just platitudes by governments. It transforms lives.It’s because of this proven success that we can’t back away from our international commitments. In southern Africa, the worst drought in more than three decades has put a record 45 million people across 16 countries at risk of food shortages. Aid agency World Vision has estimated that put together, this is enough people to stretch around the world one and a half times.Across the globe, the impact of quakes, tsunamis, typhoons, floods and droughts is slowing economic growth, undermining development and trapping millions of people in poverty. Just this year, Mozambique suffered its two most severe cyclones on record within weeks, while devastating floods tore through Asia.These crises need urgent intervention if we are to avoid thousands of needless deaths.I hope the government will not make a hasty decision on merging DfID and the Foreign Office. A standalone DfID has been excellent for the UK’s reputation abroad, and those who work for it truly represent global Britain.As we enter this new season, my message to our new political leaders is this: use that unity between parliament and people as an anchor for rebuilding our national purpose, and demonstrate that we will not forget the world’s poor.They’re counting on us."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/24c3ad7634dee26574486df8a87d1070e3fc351b/186_291_4182_2509/master/4182.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=84ec20b6110e2bc9ee503fcca377b8a5","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of present","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘present’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘present’.Share your photos of what present means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 18 December at 10am.

He didn’t get a present last Christmas and it is unlikely he will get one this year, because his mother struggles just to put food on the table. But it is not all gloom for the lively eight-year-old. Next Monday, 23 December, his school will reopen and the teachers and support staff will return, unpaid, to organise a huge “Christmas Eve Eve” party for the 350 pupils and their families. Kitchen staff will serve 800 Christmas dinners and each child will see Santa and get to unwrap a present bought by the school with money donated by businesses.“We’re having unicorns and that’s what I’m looking forward to, as well as Santa and the dancing,” he says.Chris Dyson, its headteacher, says Christmas can be a confusing time for some children. “They see everyone making Santa lists and yet they don’t get anything they asked for,” he says. “We have children here who don’t get a present at Christmas or on their birthdays. When I came here five years ago I found very few children had been to see Santa. It broke my heart. I wanted to give them a dream, a hope, and show how invested I am in them, even in holiday times.” Over in Blackpool, Stephen Tierney, executive director of a small multi-academy trust consisting of St Mary’s, a Catholic secondary school, and two primary schools, Christ the King and St Cuthbert’s, says schools have become “the fourth emergency service” for families in crisis – because there is nothing else. The trust’s primary schools will open for five days during the Christmas break to provide shelter, food and warmth for vulnerable pupils. This week they are giving out hampers, funded by a charity appeal.“A decade ago schools wouldn’t have had to do it, but we have had 10 years of austerity. There are consequences for those at the bottom who are bearing the brunt,” he says.“It’s heartbreaking for some of our families. Children are going back to homes with no carpets, no heating, no food in the fridge, the place is cold, it is not in great repair, and Christmas will be about surviving. We were thinking of providing the ingredients for a Christmas lunch – but then some homes won’t have enough money for fuel to cook it and some don’t even have an oven.“Heads in Blackpool will tell you stories of family after family who make it clear there is no money for Christmas presents this year and there were no presents last year,” he says. “It is hard to comprehend the hopelessness these parents feel. That is where schools come in. Should we have to? No, but if we don’t, then who will?”Tierney’s staff are volunteering to come in without pay, and local organisations are providing food at no cost. Unless children get help, “what will they eat this Christmas?” he asks.“The boxes will be going out and they are not what you would expect in a Christmas hamper – they will have staples such as pasta and rice and tinned tomatoes, because Christmas is survival for these families, not a bonus.”Back in Leeds, the most expensive gifts are matched to those most in need. The reality of survival on the Seacroft estate kicks in, however. “The last three bikes we gave away ended up on eBay within hours,” says Dyson sadly.Families living in poverty are more likely to suffer breakdown, ill health and mental health issues, but headteachers in more affluent areas of the country say they, too, are having to provide welfare services that were once supplied by local authorities and the health service. “We are a typical comprehensive school in terms of socio-economic profile and ability intake and we are seeing a big increase in challenging behaviour and students with emotional health issues coming up from primary school,” he says.“It’s partly to do with changes in society but also because of the loss of help and support from local authorities. We are coping with challenges around anxiety about school, as the curriculum has become more academic, plus pressures from home. That manifests in a higher level of eating disorders and self-harm.” Fairer funding is top of Antiss’s Santa wishlist, as he struggles to afford enough specialist teachers and is having to cut down on teaching assistant numbers. Schools in West Sussex are the 10th-worst funded of England’s 152 local education authorities, because of a per-pupil funding formula that awards pupils more in some authorities than in others.Phillip Potter, head of Oak Grove college, a special school for 11- to 19-year-olds in Worthing, West Sussex, says funding to provide higher salaries for teaching assistants, the “unsung heroes” of special education, is at the top of his letter to Santa.He says he is struggling to buy essential mobility equipment for his high-needs students. “My dream for 2020 is that the high-needs block will be funded properly and there will be an integrated health, social care and education system to deliver joined-up services for our most vulnerable youngsters, without having to have arguments about who will pay and take things to what feels like 400 panels to get agreement,” he says.While headteachers all have a long list for Santa, they are likely to agree on one thing. “Every teacher’s dream is that politicians keep out of education,” says Potter. “We don’t tell doctors how to do heart surgery, so let 2020 be the year that politicians stop telling us how to teach and give us the resources.”Back at Dyson’s school in Leeds, money is not the problem, however. “I raised £350,000 last year from businesses and have just secured £150,000 to open the school at February half term, and in the Easter and summer holidays,” he says.Through the extra funds he has been able to employ more teaching assistants to give one-to-one support to the most vulnerable students, reduce class sizes and buy in support from specialists for conditions such as dyslexia. He has concerns about what is happening in education generally, however, particularly over discipline and the number of children other schools are excluding. When he arrived at Parklands, more than 150 children a year were being excluded now it is down to one – and that is one too many for Dyson.“I’ve started to take children excluded from other schools to give them a chance,” he says. “I’ve built this school on love. I’ve banned teachers shouting at children, I’ve got rid of the dreaded padded isolation cell, played music and given children respect.”He is concerned about the current “warm-strict” approach to discipline coming from the Department for Education and its behaviour tsar, Tom Bennett, who has defended a “zero-tolerance” approach to behaviour and the creation of centralised detention systems and internal inclusion units.“That way of thinking is that the only way to sort out discipline is to exclude them, to put them in isolation, ban them and put them in boot camps. No! You can do it another way,” Dyson says. “‘Warm-strict’ is having lots of rules but trying to put a warm spin on it by saying that as long as your discipline is strong and tough, you can afford to smile at children.” Dyson, a father of three, says he is not afraid to hug children. “We are a huggy school if children are upset we give them a hug.” The school is a happy place where children are allowed to wear trainers and joggers, and are not told how to wear their hair. Travis, a pupil excluded from another primary school for violence, appears now to be a model student. “Don’t run in the corridor because you might knock over someone who is disabled,” he warns some younger students. “Open the door for visitors,” he tells a girl who pushes past. He then rushes off to comfort a boy in his class who has suddenly broken down in tears in the corridor.“At my other school I used to get into fights and they put me in isolation,” he says. “It was come into school, go into isolation, come into school, go into isolation, come into school, go into isolation. Every day. When I came here, Mr Dyson spent a lot of money on me – £150 I think – to get me help for dyslexia three times a week and I really like it here. It’s magic.”Children’s names have been changed"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b9dc31c07374f897608b02b8189c0bb1c444446d/0_439_6588_3953/master/6588.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d833ff2fb101190474e134dc74166f84","title":"tate and steve mcqueen call for arts rich school curriculum","story":"Tate says many state schools ‘starved of the resources to support access to culture’Access to the visual arts will be a preserve of privately educated children unless the government takes urgent action to improve the school curriculum, the director of Tate, Maria Balshaw, and the artist Steve McQueen have warned.Tate has joined forces with McQueen and 35 museums and galleries across the country to complain that the curriculum in England is failing children. They are calling for an “arts-rich curriculum” as a “lasting legacy” for McQueen’s hugely popular school photo project which filled Tate Britain with thousands of class photos of year 3 children.Balshaw said access to the arts “must not depend on social and economic advantage”.She said: “Private schools place a premium on a rich cultural education for their pupils whilst many state schools are starved of the resources to support access to culture and creativity for their pupils. “We need a level cultural playing field for all children because we want and need visually literate adults. There should be fair access to arts in line with the offer to pupils in Scotland and Wales where the arts are already a core commitment.”More than 600 schoolchildren a day are visiting Tate Britain to see McQueen’s year 3 photos, which feature a total of 76,146 children – two-thirds of all London seven- and eight-year-olds.Tate argues that if the decline in secondary school arts provision continues, many of these children may have little opportunity to take art when they move on from primary school.Balshaw said teachers were too often thwarted in their aspiration to provide an arts-rich education by “the restriction of the curriculum and the dire lack of resources”.McQueen said the opportunity to study art had been transformative for him. “When I was a kid, I remember my first trip to Tate. It was a real eye-opener. It was wonderful to see an explosion of ideas and creativity, visual creativity. It gave me an understanding that anything was possible,” he said.“The curriculum needs to be big enough to include all subjects and be all for all children. Art and creativity are so important to science, to maths or to any other academic venture. Cutting arts education means you cut off inventiveness, which impacts on being creative.“We have many great artists, great thinkers and inventors in the UK and this has come through a sense of possibility. Arts education gives that sense of possibility.”Tate’s call has been backed by the Plus Tate network of 35 museums and galleries across the UK, ranging from the Baltic in Gateshead to the Towner in Eastbourne.Martin Clark, the director of Camden Arts Centre and a convenor for Plus Tate’s education working group, said the curriculum was failing young people.“In a climate where visual literacy, creative thinking and innovation are going to be key to the future of our country, millions of children are being failed by an education system not fit for purpose or for the new realities of the 21st century,” he said.

A number of vice-chancellors subsequently sought legal advice, promising to oppose “state control” over university admissions.Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: “It is infuriating that universities have apparently responded to calls to end the use of certain types of unconditional offers by making more of them.“There are circumstances in which unconditional offers are appropriate, but not when the offer is made on condition that the student makes the university their firm choice. This practice has more to do with the frenetic scramble to put ‘bums on seats’ than the best interests of students.”Following the lifting of the cap on student numbers, there has been fierce competition between institutions who are dependent for their survival on undergraduate tuition fees and are recruiting from a shrinking pool of 18-year-olds.Other details revealed by the latest Ucas figures include:Universities UK (UUK), which advocates for 136 higher education institutions, is currently conducting a review of admissions practices. UUK chief executive, Alistair Jarvis, said: “An important principle of the UK system is that universities decide independently which students they accept but with this comes a responsibility to ensure that the admissions system continues to work in the best interests of students.”A Department for Education spokesperson said: “We expect universities to look seriously at these figures which show the impact unconditional offers have on students’ grades, and make sure their admissions practices are working for students.”Nicola Dandridge, chief executive of the higher education regulator the Office for Students, said unconditional offers have a place in university admissions. “But we remain concerned by the continuing rise in so-called conditional unconditional offers, which risk pressuring students into making decisions that may not be in their best interests,” she said.

Kew scientists officially named 102 plants and eight fungi in 2019, but many are already in danger of extinction. The major threats are the destruction of natural habitat for farmland, timber, dams and mining, as well as the impacts of the climate crisis.“We all depend on plants,” said Martin Cheek, a senior botanist at Kew and who names about 10 new species a year. “It is shocking that we are still discovering so many. It is easy to think we know everything on this planet, but we don’t. The local people might know the plants, but they are unknown to science.”“It is important to name the plants now because natural habitat is disappearing rapidly,” he said. “Only when they have a name can they have an official assessment under the International Union for Conservation of Nature, and only then do we have a chance of getting national authorities to protect those areas.”The new snowdrop species was discovered in north-west Turkey when a paediatrician uploaded her holiday photos to Facebook, where they were spotted by a Ukrainian snowdrop specialist. The pair returned to the site and collected a sample, which was confirmed as a new species by Kew’s snowdrop expert Aaron Davis. The snowdrop has already been assessed as critically endangered.The new miracle berry species was discovered the rainforests of the Chimanimani Mountains, on the Mozambique-Zimbabwe border. The fruits of these species contain a compound called miraculin that blocks tastebuds so that sour foods, such as limes, taste sweet. The new species is classed as endangered, due to the continuing destruction of the forest.The rubbery shrub species was found on a single waterfall on the Bafing River in Guinea, west Africa. “They have some kind of biological superglue with which they can stick themselves to rocks to avoid being swept away, but this interesting compound hasn’t been investigated yet,” said Cheek.Kew scientists expect the shrub to become globally extinct when construction of a hydroelectric dam begins next year. “We have examples of species from that family that have been wiped out by other hydroelectric dams,” Cheek said. Plant extinctions in general are occurring at a “frightening” rate, according to scientists, and one in five of all plants are at risk.The rarest find in 2019 was the zonozono, a 20m-tall tree from the ylang-ylang family discovered in the Usambara Mountains of Tanzania. Just seven trees are known. The spectacular new violet family species was found in New Guinea.The bamboo fungus from Yunnan in south-west China was only given a formal scientific name in 2019, but has been used in the region as a traditional treatment for arthritis for more than 400 years. Scientific interest is increasing due to the discovery of compounds called hypercrellins in the fungus. When exposed to light, these compounds combat tumours, viruses and other fungi.Most new species are named after local places, but one Kew scientist took a more romantic approach. A new orange gladiolus found on top of a remote table mountain in Guinea is now called Gladiolus mariae, after Xander van der Burgt christened the plant after his wife Maria.“It is perfectly OK if other people name a species after you,” said Cheek. “But it would be considered very bad form to name a species after yourself.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c9b2179b5b58f89fc72691b31c4a15cb4bbc3600/0_13_3504_2102/master/3504.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cd0a489498316ab2c21440c64680ac9e","title":"best films 2019 uk no 4 little women","story":"Greta Gerwig’s freewheeling adaptation is the definition of a festive spirit-raiser, sending the sisters on a giddy and moving march to womanhood I hadn’t really been looking forward to Little Women. I didn’t love the book, nor the other four film versions, nor the innumerable times it’s been adapted for telly. Even more sacrilegiously, I didn’t much like Lady Bird, Greta Gerwig’s previous Saoirse RonanTimothée Chalamet love-in. My Chalamet allergy, kept in abeyance at that stage by his scant airtime, has considerably worsened in the two years since.Plus, I’m a bit iffy on films that appear to co-opt a post-MeToo manifesto for a period tale. Hence my reticence. And, perhaps, my evangelistic zeal after the screening.Because Little Women is an absolute gem. An instant five-star classic you’d be delighted to rewatch, in any company (elderly relative, small tot, total hipster – all would enjoy). It’s the definition of a festive spirit-raiser: funny and vivacious and moving, and so smart you’re happy to submit to outrageous button-pushing.This is a film which is busy in the best way. Scenes fall over themselves with chatter generally, of course, from the March sisters – Jo (Ronan), Meg (Emma Watson), Beth (Eliza Scanlen) and Amy (Florence Pugh). All the actors are terrific, with Ronan and Pugh standouts. Laura Dern is a balm as Marmie and Meryl Streep muzzles just enough of her camp as Aunt March. Chalamet is an ebullient, nervy Laurie, with Chris Cooper swaddled in beard and tough love as his grandfather and James Norton kindly as his Meg-smitten tutor. There’s a cute cameo, too, for Tracy Letts (who plays the dad in Lady Bird) as Jo’s crass publisher.Gerwig’s big innovation, other than some post-feminist self-authorship revisionism – which doesn’t feel nearly so grisly as that description suggests – is to shuffle the timeline. We start with Jo trying to flog stories in New York, then flit back and forth between present day and various stages of flashback.Given that most people will be going in knowing the two big twists (who dies, who turns down who), it’s only sensible. It also freshens the whole thing up. You’re never quite sure of what happens next, and Gerwig proves an innovative editor – there are great trims and terrific jumps, too. This is a film forever in an ecstatic rush.As for Chalamet? Luckily, Gerwig gives full rein to the horror of latter-day Laurie, burning through his cash and getting bratty and unattractive, which means his casting worked, for me at least, an absolute treat."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7c99533b06b1268769d3a10f8b47feed722c8530/442_1927_5021_3011/master/5021.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3aaea3135f31f670503a0080e88c863f","title":"nigel slaters fuss free christmas recipes smoked salmon pate vegetarian stuffing chickpea","story":"Smoked salmon, vegetarian stuffing and a versatile butter – festive dishes to take the pressure off this ChristmasThere is much to do in the kitchen. The traditional recipes are cast in stone, but those I value most at this time of year are often the simple, versatile, unerringly useful ones that will work for numerous occasions. A loose-textured pâté to press on small rounds of crispbread and pass round with drinks, or a stuffing that is suitable not just for the Christmas bird but for large and tender cabbage leaves and aubergines too.The pâté I suggest is straightforward and can be ready in minutes. Fat flakes of hot smoked salmon with crisp cucumber and basil leaves that can be served as a first course, perhaps with slices of treacley rye bread, or as a salad with bitter chicory or frisée. It will also serve as a filling for tartlets or tortilla.The stuffing here is a silky smooth chickpea mash with a crunchy, seedy texture from the addition of amaranth and dried figs. It can be baked in a loaf tin and spooned or sliced at the table. Softly spiced, it is suited to goose, turkey or pork, but also makes a good accompaniment to baked field mushrooms or roast root vegetables.I also offer a jolly useful butter. Deeply savoury, with crisply caramelised onions and notes of juniper, it has a smoky quality that lends itself to being used with salmon or trout, tucked into a baked potato or as something to spread on hot-from-the-toaster crumpets on Boxing Day afternoon.You can make this stuffing a day or more in advance. It will freeze, too. Cook it in a 20 x 12cm parchment-lined loaf tin, then let it rest for a good 20 minutes before spooning or slicing. Enough for 8Peel and finely chop the onions. Warm 3 tbsp of the olive oil in a deep pan, add the onions and let them cook over a moderate heat for 15-20 minutes until they are soft and pale gold. Take care not to brown them. Peel, finely chop and stir in the garlic, then add the cumin, coriander, chilli and a little black pepper.Bring a medium pan containing 400ml of water to the boil, then rain in the amaranth and let it simmer, partially covered, for 15 minutes. Drain using a fine sieve. Put the pan back on the heat, add the chickpeas and their canning liquor and warm thoroughly. Chop the figs and apricots. Pull the leaves from the parsley. Remove the chickpeas from the heat then purée with the parsley leaves and remaining olive oil using a food processor. Set the oven 200Cgas mark 6.Combine the chickpea and parsley purée with the drained amaranth, dried fruits, onions and garlic. Transfer to the loaf tin, smoothing the surface and taking care to push the stuffing into the corners. Bake for 25-30 minutes.I suggest keeping the flakes of salmon as large and intact as you can, pressing them only lightly into the dish. That way the pâté stays open textured and, I think, more pleasing to the eye. Pile the salmon on to dark rye bread or rough textured crispbreads. Serves 6Cut the cucumber into thin slices and then into thin matchsticks, discarding the wet, seedy core as you go. Put the cucumber into a mixing bowl.Chop the dill fronds and add to the cucumber with a twist or two of black pepper. Tear the basil leaves into the bowl, then stir in the cream cheese, taking care not to over-mix.Break the fish into large flakes, pulling away the skin. Add to the cream cheese and cucumber then spoon into a terrine dish and press down lightly, just enough to make all the ingredients stick to one another.

Just steer clear of the fake-meat roasting joints …Reviewed by Meera SodhaNot long ago, anyone who wanted a plant-based Christmas dinner got little support from supermarkets. With almost everyone opting for turkey, the best you could hope for was a nut roast for one and some boiled sprouts. This year, you can’t move for options – which vary from meat substitutes to real vegetables, delightfully transformed.Wherever you sit on that spectrum (personally, I prefer food from a real plant, rather than an industrial one), what is not in doubt is that, at Christmas, everything needs a little more sparkle. That sparkle can come in many forms – a dish could really look the part, be made with special ingredients, such as truffle, or using a fancy technique to elevate it from the everyday – but, above all, it needs to taste great and as if it were made with love.Puff-pastry-wrapped, barely seasoned and barely identifiable stodge that, according to the packaging, is a puree of spinach, squash and chestnuts. The mixture is perched on a layer of thick, jammy beetroot chutney so sweet that it would make a jelly baby rethink their purpose in life. Barely edible.★Oven-cooked butternut squash and mushrooms tucked neatly into a filo pastry wreath. Flavour-wise, it took me straight back to the school canteen and food that was neither awful nor wonderful, but somewhere in the middle. There is not much in the way of festive flavour here – no stuffing, for example, to elevate it to something special enough for Christmas. Call me Scrooge, but this is the sort of food that forms the forgettable layers in the great sandwich of life.★★★This is a clever idea – a bullet-proof tarte tartin for the home cook – that falls flat. It looks pretty enough, but it is just chunky boiled carrots layered over some quite vinegar-laden onions – which are not, as the packaging suggests, “caramelised”. The flavours are unbalanced, there is too much acid and, overall, it is one-dimensional.★★These are pretty, golden-brown latticed pies that can sit solo, but will also play nicely alongside some Christmas trimmings. The pastry is crisp and inside is a rich and wonderful creamy, cheesy spinach sauce, which gives way to sweet paprika and dill carrots. I can spot the vegetables! There is plenty of flavour and good times to be had here. Sing it loud: root en croute!★★★★M\u0026ampS Plant Kitchen festive roast with cranberry and chestnut stuffing and a vegan gravy, £12 (serves 4) in store from 20 DecemberGlory be! What a delicious thing this was over and over again: my husband and I could not stop eating it. Given that the nut roast has been relegated to the foods of Christmas past, I applaud the cooks at M\u0026ampS who bravely brought it back in 2019, updated with a merriness of flavour and texture. This is herby, rich and sausage-y with notes of chestnut, spice and a naughty smattering of cranberry stuffing in the centre, plus a vegan gravy so good I swear I heard angels singing as it slipped down. It does look like a big, fat brown log, but who cares? I’d be prepared to take out my contact lenses just to eat it all over again. Pure joy.★★★★★Aldi root vegetable and cranberry sauce pastry crowns topped with pumpkin seeds, £2.99 for twoHorrifyingly sweet. The sugar laced in the onions that top the “crown” was enough to make my teeth crawl up inside my gums and beg for it all to stop. Underneath the sweet onions was another layer of gloopy, sweet cranberry sauce and the odd (sweet) vegetable – parsnip, carrot or beetroot. Overall this is confused: pudding masquerading as a main.★The glowing fake bacon, artfully wrapped around the side of what looks like a circular slab of half-digested stomach contents (sorry) was enough to kill my festive spirit, but I took a hit and ate some. The “bacon” tasted like flabby, spammy Frazzles and the insides were an oily smoked mixture of sweet rice and herbs. I managed only a couple of bites. It is the vegan Grinch roast that stole Christmas.☆Sainsbury’s Taste the Difference no beef wellington, £7 (serves two)This parcel-shaped pastry, to its credit, looks like something you would want to bring to table. It suggests to the vegans that they are loved and cared-for members of the family. Until, as in a good thriller, a knife appears and things start to go wrong. When cut, the insides are like the sludgy brown bottom of the Thames, gushing out on to the plate, encouraging the central “no-beef sausage” to lurch forward. Despite all the drama, it tastes quite nice – like smoky mushroom pate wrapped in pastry. I would not complain if I were served it – but I might hope for something better next year.★★★Reviewed by Anna JonesThere is a lightness to a vegan dessert that I really appreciate. While I love cream and butter, it is not what I crave at the end of a big meal. So even if I have the choice, I will often plump for the vegan pudding in a restaurant, because it will be the thing on the menu that pops out.That said, you want a certain level of indulgence – creaminess without a cloying texture a jelly that has the right level of wobble. And texture is crucial a topping of demerara sugar or pumpkin-seed brittle, say, scattered over a ginger cake.This is lovely in appearance, with a good dusting of cocoa. But for something billed as extra-special, it really could have tasted more chocolatey. It has a nut base, which adds a nice bit of texture, but it is just not indulgent enough.★★These are pretty small – halfway between a chocolate and a cake. The hard chocolate exterior gives way to a very liquid caramel filling that is much too sweet.★★M\u0026ampS chocolate and cherry dessert, £10 (serves six)The only way to serve this, it appears, is to spoon it out of its plastic container like a mousse, which is a pity, since it looks like a layered cake. The cherry topping is reminiscent of a pie filling, not too sweet, with pieces of fruit. The chocolate ganache beneath is a tiny bit grainy, but with a lovely strong chocolate flavour.★★★★These look quite sweet and Christmassy, with gold dusting on the top, and they are not too big, which is always good because it means you can have a bite of something else, too. You get a big chocolate hit at the beginning, and a cleaner, fresher flavour – because they are dairy-free – at the end. They have a slight tiffin vibe, with dates for sweetness and pumpkin seeds for bite.★★★★This looked so beautiful when it first came out of its tub and would have been marked higher if it hadn’t collapsed almost instantly. The jelly has a good, soft consistency, which is hard for vegan jellies. Nice sharpness from the fruit, although I would prefer more elderflower.★★★Sainsbury’s raspberry and clementine snowflake jelly, £4 (serves four)This is pretty amazing-looking – a fancy gold star that holds its shape beautifully. I can imagine people being impressed with this one. But it all tastes a bit too much like orange squash – or the middle layer of a packet jelly trifle.★★Reviewed by Miguel BarclayParty food has to look appetising. You don’t want to feel embarrassed handing out platters.Co-op Asian style sharing selection, £2.25 for 11 piecesIt looks tasty. I like the stars on the vegetable twists, and the filo candles with their festive red tips. It tastes fresh and fragrant with lemongrass nothing greasy and, crucially, no soggy pastry.★★★Co-op Indian style sharing selection, £2.25 for 10 piecesThese are golden brown and crunchy. The curried jackfruit in the samosas is intense. Delicious.★★★★Reheating tempura batter in the oven doesn’t really work, especially since you are putting the sauce on it, which makes the pastry bland and soggy. Depressing.★These take an age to golden-up, but they are worth the wait. The pastry is flaky and the filling (pea protein and roasted mushroom) is better than the real deal. ★★★★The prettiest of the lot, and the flavour is excellent, too: the taste is like Thai green curry, with a powerful lemongrass flavour.★★★★I like the fact that the veggies are on show here, and not enclosed in pastry – it is refreshing for them not to be beige. Flavour-wise, the gooey filling contrasts nicely with the crispy filo. More lemongrass, though – definitely the ingredient of the moment.★★★These look interesting and mysterious and, as long as you don’t taste them, they will be a talking point. But the pastry tastes like doughy, cheap white breadcrumbs you have smashed into a ball. And if you closed your eyes, you wouldn’t even know there was a filling in there.★M\u0026ampS Plant Kitchen no pork pigs in duvets, £5 for 12The pastry is doughy, and while the sausage looks decent, it doesn’t taste like one. It is made with seasoned mushroom and soy, but tastes a bit like cheese. It is definitely savoury, though – almost too savoury – and it gets better with every bite.★★★The sweet plum gyoza with jackfruit taste vaguely authentic, although the tartness of the plum is a bit overpowering. Otherwise, they are a bit bland. I don’t like the hoisin pastry cones, which taste like stale, stodgy curry wrapped in soggy pastry. If they sold the Sichuan filo crackers separately, though, I might buy them – but they don’t redeem the whole pack.★★This is fun finger food. The sliders look great and taste great, as if fresh off the barbecue. I like the fact that they come with mustard, and that the burger is a very close replica of a beef burger. To the untrained palate, they taste like beef.★★★★Very run-of-the-mill spring rolls, the kind you get at an all-you-can-eat buffet. The pastry is a bit tough and thick, most likely to compensate for skimping on the filling.★★Aldi vegan cauliflower bites, £1.99 for 10They have an offputting watery consistency, a bit like curdled milk. And the flavour is unidentifiable. Asian? Indian? Tex Mex? British? No good.★There is no food with red crumbs on the outside except for red velvet cake, so the white puff pastry dotted with red here is immediately unappetising. Also, they look difficult to eat. Taste-wise I don’t like them. They are so sweet that they are almost like a dessert – but not a wellington.★They are so cute! They certainly look one of the most interesting offerings. They taste nice, too, with a bit of Moroccan tagine vibe. But that is only in the first mouthful. After that, they get drier and drier, and in the end it is just thick pitta.★★This looks good, with a lovely glossy finish from the red onion and balsamic chutney on top, but the bottom layer is so bland that caramelised onion is all you get by way of flavour. This neither tastes like, nor does the job of, a paté. It is a condiment, not a snack.★★Miguel Barclay’s Meat Free One Pound Meals is published by Headline.

Yet, back in the 1980s, teams played on consecutive days fairly regularly. Liverpool played league fixtures on successive days in 1980, 1982, 1983 and 1986 – and that was before they enjoyed the comfort of having a huge squad.Some clubs have even played on consecutive days in the Premier League era. Tottenham, Crystal Palace, Norwich and Nottingham Forest fulfilled Premier League matches on 26 December and 27 December in 1994. Teams playing matches in a short space of time is one thing, but how about a player taking part in two matches during the same day? On 11 November 1987, Mark Hughes accomplished this feat. For a man who had been short of match action, it was very much a case of making up for lost time.It was no secret that Hughes had been enduring a nightmare since his move from Manchester United to Barcelona in the summer of 1986. Whereas fellow new signing Gary Lineker hit the ground running, Hughes struggled in Spain, where his playing style was under-appreciated by fans and the media. “For the most part it was a full-blown, X-rated horror story,” wrote Hughes in his autobiography, Sparky: Barcelona, Bayern \u0026amp Back.By the start of the 1987-88 season, his days at Barcelona were numbered. Frozen out of the team and desperate for a return to Manchester United, the Welsh striker knew a move back to the UK before April 1988 would cost him thousands of pounds in tax as he had not been abroad for the full exemption period. And then came a lifeline. A loan deal with Bayern Munich until the end of the season was agreed. At last Hughes had “escaped from the physical and mental torture of his ‘imprisonment’ at Barcelona,” as Clive White wrote in the Times.The move seemed to be a perfect fit. Hughes scored one goal and set up another on his debut against Bayer Uerdingen on Saturday 7 November 1987. “I was getting credit for things that were part and parcel of my game that would never get a mention in Spain,” he said after the game. “I was given more opportunity to get into the penalty area, which I was rarely given at Barcelona. I think I can do well there. I’d like to repay Bayern for their faith in me.”Four days later he had a chance to repay that faith. Bayern were playing Borussia Mönchengladbach in the German Cup on the Wednesday night and general manager Uli Hoeness was desperate for Hughes to build on the momentum of his debut. Nothing unusual in that. But there was a tiny snag: on the same day as Bayern’s match, Hughes was due to play for Wales against Czechoslovakia in Prague in a crucial Euro 88 qualifier.Hoeness was not going to let this mere inconvenience get in the way. “Soon, he was off making dozens of phone calls,” Hughes explains. “Private jets, standby cars, minute-by-minute schedules. I couldn’t believe what was happening.” Hughes, who had played just three games in two months – two of those for Wales – was now preparing for two matches on the same day.A victory would have taken Wales to Euro 88 but, sadly for Hughes, they lost 2-0. He did not have long to mope about the situation when he returned to the dressing room. “Hustler Hoeness made sure of that,” wrote Hughes. “Outside engine revving, waiting to hurtle us to the airport, was … a Lada. I’m not kidding. Through the Czech countryside we zoomed at all of 30mph, but in that heap it felt as if we were breaking the land-speed record.” After a meandering drive he took a private jet to Munich and jumped into Hoeness’ Porsche and was whisked to the Olympic Stadium.Two hours before, Hughes had been playing for his country in Czechoslovakia. Now, as the second half of the German Cup match began, he was warming up on the touchline in his Bayern kit. “Hoeness had deliberately not told any of the players, officials or public of his secret scheme,” Hughes recalls. “So I was smuggled into the stadium and kept in hiding upstairs until the team had gone out for the second half. He wanted maximum psychological impact – and he got it.”Before Hughes could get on to the pitch, Gunter Thiele gave Borussia Mönchengladbach the lead. It was time for one of the most surprising substitutions in football history. “Nobody could believe it. I was supposed to be hundreds of miles away in Prague. It wasn’t possible. And nobody was more stunned than the Borussia players.”Lothar Matthäus equalised and Hughes almost completed the fairytale by scoring a trademark volley late on. The game went to extra-time, with two goals from Michael Rummenigge giving Bayern a 3-2 win. Hughes had been on the losing side for Wales earlier in the day but he felt a lot better when he left the field in Munich. “It’s good to have the ego polished occasionally – particularly after my recent experiences,” he wrote. “That particular exercise certainly did my heart good. To consider that any club would go to such lengths for a single player was quite staggering. It didn’t just make my day, it made my season … and almost convinced me to stay for another couple of years.”Alas, Hughes found the pull of his boyhood club was just too much to resist when Manchester United came calling at the end of the season. But the love that Bayern showed him made the decision to leave much harder. It’s not every day that clubs go so far out of their way to accommodate a player. But, on that one particular day in November 1987, Bayern Munich went the extra mile to ensure that Hughes would become part of a story that still beggars belief.• This blog first appeared on That 1980s Sports Blog• Follow Steven Pye on Twitter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c13277fc624c842e4b508716139c4a63dee087fe/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ba4b2bf22ba6f3426eb2d0ffec22c4f3","title":"top 20 games of 2019","story":"Take an intergalactic camping trip, shoot zombies in the face and go full battle royale on, er, Tetris … with the best games of the yearby  Keza MacDonald and  Keith StuartMetal Gear Solid creator Hideo Kojima crafts a strange, highly contemplative dystopian adventure about a deliveryman who must bring hope, along with couriered parcels, to the lonely survivors of a supernatural cataclysm.What we said: This uncompromising, unashamedly political work of artistic intent is 2019’s most interesting blockbuster game by a distance.

They soon found that singing had a “previously unseen” effect on the women, and decided to set up a dedicated group.Dickson says she can often see the effects of trauma in the physicality of new members.In a case study about one new recruit, Dickson wrote that when the woman was not singing, she would “sit on her chair holding her arms around herself, self-soothing by rocking back and forth”.Using her voice effected a dramatic change, though, reported Dickson. “The moment she engaged in vocalising musically, she became a different person.”The choir starts by playing group games, before moving on to rehearsals and eventually – for those who wish – performances. The “alumni choir”, made up of women who wanted to stay on after an initial year following their referral to Amies, has gone on to perform for the Desmond Tutu Foundation, Sadiq Khan at City Hall and, most recently, the packed Christmas service at St James’s in Piccadilly organised by Amos Trust – a highlight, says Dickson.“It’s changed me,’’ says Racheal Olawaniotogun, a soprano in the choir. “From my past experience to where I am today, words cannot describe it.”“My self-esteem – which was so low – gradually increased, and I was able to interact and ask questions of people. I wasn’t able to do that before.”Originally from Nigeria, Olawaniotogun has been singing with the choir for the past three years.“When I sing, I feel joyous. The inside of me feels very light – everything outside, whatever I’m going through, it disappears.”Olawaniotogun, who is now studying for a degree in accounting, says singing has provided her with coping mechanisms she can use to protect her mental health.She feels uncomfortable in large groups of people, but has gradually come to terms with performing in front of crowds.“Being in situations like that really helped me,” she says. “Let’s start with being in class at university. You’re in a massive room. In choir we focus on each other, we’re in the moment … so whenever I’m in such a crowd, I just close my eyes and try to focus on one thing.”Dickson agrees that the confidence the women show on stage can impact other areas of their lives. “It means that when they are speaking to lawyers and solicitors, they can stand up in front of them and look them in the eye and tell them what’s happened to them.”While the nature of the womens’ arrival in the UK means most have no support network, the choir offers a chance to make friends.“You laugh, you eat together, we don’t have that, we don’t have a family here, we’re more alone,’’ says Olawaniotogun.“We’re like a family. That’s why, when we sing, we sound amazing! Because we’re bonded like sisters.”The choir provides a weekly meal and travel expenses to rehearsals and performances, allowing those in the process of seeking asylum, who often have extremely limited access to funds, to participate.A creche is provided for those with children. “It means you’re not put at a disadvantage because you have a child … and you can have a couple of hours where you’re not with your child, which – for any single mother – is huge,” Dickson says.Providing these facilities helps to promote a supportive atmosphere in which the choir can bond. It doesn’t always work out though, says Dickson.“It’s very hard for people whose trust has been betrayed consistently to hold on to anything that’s good in their lives. Even if you might prove to them time and time again: ‘I’m not going to let you down, I’m going to be here, what I say will happen,’ it can be very hard for them to trust that.“Sometimes you get things where people start talking together in little groups in their own language and undermine the group.“Some are unable to get past that insecurity – no matter how many times you talk to them – where in order to make themselves feel better, they have to make someone else feel worse. That’s something very common in people who have been traumatised. We work very hard to address these issues.”Dickson and her co-facilitator Anna Samant, who accompanies the women on the piano, aim to create a culture of respect by asking the women to sign a contract that they help to write when they join. “They understand that everyone has the right to their own religion and sexuality, and no one has the right to undermine that,” Dickson says.Samant and Dickson also try to foster a spirit of cultural awareness by putting together songs that incorporate musical traditions from the women’s countries of origin, such as Souallé, which blends a Guyanese folk song with one popular in Chad and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.For Olawaniotogun, the ersity of the choir is a strength. “There are different people, new faces. You adjust and it’s really amazing.”Her favourite song to sing is Osprey, which begins with the lyrics: “Flying high, flying free, osprey on the wind you ride”.“Whenever you’re singing a song, it’s like you’re telling a story”, she explains. “Sometimes when I’m singing and the song attaches a meaning to me, it makes me cry because it’s so emotional."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1bde93a24ec4bbd0eba4e8edc574be7042243952/0_0_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=51d57e5741888ef01ec2e696440b168c","title":"corporate jargon ruining friendships template texts","story":"Instead of spending time with a friend, now you can send them a template text – a generic response explaining that you’re too busy.

I’m not getting the same buy-in as I did the first time around.’” Inevitably, Mr Buy-In became a legend in Rowe’s friendship group.How have we got to the point where we describe our personal relationships in language more befitting a corporate boardroom? It is not enough to hang out with friends: we schedule our meet-ups with the precision of a world leader at Davos, and even less joie de vivre. I’m at capacity right now, we intone solemnly to someone asking if we fancy a drink. How about we touch base in a few weeks, when I have more bandwidth?The most extreme example of how corporate jargon has infected our personal relationships is the emerging trend of friendship template texts. First seen in a now viral and much-maligned Twitter thread from the American writer and activist Melissa A Fabello, template texts are generic responses you can send to that friend in crisis you don’t want to talk to. “Hey!” reads Fabello’s suggested response to a friend asking for support. “I’m so glad you reached out. I’m actually at capacity  helping someone else who’s in crisis  dealing with some personal stuff right now, and I don’t think I can hold appropriate space for you.”“It’s about self-optimisation,” explains Prof André Spicer of the Cass Business School, the co-author of Desperately Seeking Wellness, an exploration of the wellness industry. He situates template texts within the broader rise of wellness culture, and with it the drive towards a better, optimised self. “How can you become perfect in your relationships? By going with canned scripts, you come up with what you think is a perfect response to something.”This fashionably optimised self also attends therapy regularly – therapy attendance rates rocketed in the late 90s and 00s – and is unabashed about applying its terminology to everyday life. By using pseudo-therapeutic language such as “holding space”, template text-writers signal that they are emotionally intelligent, savvy and respectful of other people’s boundaries. Ironically, such texts may have unintended negative effects.To someone in crisis, being on the receiving end of a template text could feel devastating. “If someone had sent me that message, I would have felt completely rejected,” says 27-year-old Anwen Hayward, a student from Cardiff. She suffered four bereavements earlier this year, and there have been many moments where she has reached out for support. “Often a fumbling response to a friend in need is far better,” Spicer explains, “because humans don’t always know how to respond a lot of the time.”There is also a performative element to template texts, which are usually shared online by right-thinking activists. “We look to social media and these canned messages to see what being a good friend looks like,” says Spicer. As such, they feed into the broader performance of online selfhood that Jia Tolentino wrote persuasively about in Trick Mirror. “The internet is defined by a built-in performance incentive … the main purpose of this communication is to make yourself look good.”Template texts represent the convergence of two forces – the drive towards optimisation and corporate culture. “The boundaries between work and life have become blurred,” says Spicer. “We’re encouraged to think about growing our human capital and see our personal relationships as if they are an economic enterprise to be carefully managed.” Hence the liberal use of corporate and therapy buzzwords such as “capacity”, “connecting”, and “emotional labour” in template texts.Emotional labour as a concept has been hugely distorted – when coined by the sociologist Arlie Hochschild in 1983, it referred to the onerous burden placed on service workers to appear happy at all times. In general, being a friend to someone is not emotional labour. If you think it is, you’re probably the one who is really hard work. “Twitter is a cesspool for this,” says Hayward. “One person misuses a term and it gets misused over and over again.” She chafes at the idea that friendship is a form of work. “Emotional labour isn’t having to text a friend. The term has been devalued. You could argue that every interaction is emotional labour because it expends work on your behalf. But that’s not what it is.”Why do we view friendships as if they are businesses to be maintained? Because as work has swelled to impinge on every aspect of our lives, each hour is a tiny unit of productivity to be carefully allocated. “These texts are the product of the increasing neoliberalisation of our world, where market metrics have colonised every dimension of our lives,” explains Dr Catherine Rottenberg, an expert in neoliberalism at the University of Nottingham. “Human beings are remade as specks of capital so that our relationship to ourselves and others becomes one of capital appreciation. Our relationships are perceived as forms of capital that need to be invested wisely in order to enhance the self’s overall value.”As our relationships with other people become transactional, dating is reconfigured as a business venture – hence Mr Buy-In. Capitalism has loosened the ties that once bound people to an unprecedented extent. Communities are ripped apart by gentrification deregulation and the erosion of workplace rights mean that we work longer hours in insecure employment for lower pay. “Neoliberalism has created a careless reality,” Rottenberg says. As people become estranged from each other, we reach for template texts to instruct us how to be empathetic, understanding human beings. “Our world – digitally mediated, utterly consumed by capitalism – makes communication about morality very easy but makes actual moral living very hard,” writes Tolentino in Trick Mirror.While it is easy to sneer at template messages, or view them as uncaring, we use scripts in our daily lives without even realising. “Much of everyday interaction is scripted anyway,” says Spicer. “These texts are an example of the informal scripts we learn over time becoming formalised and manufactured.” He emphasises that scripts can be helpful when people are in anxiety-provoking situations, and don’t know what to say.“I was irritated when I saw people mocking scripts,” says 24-year-old Kal Walters, from Idaho. In addition to working with autistic people as a care worker, Walters is on the spectrum herself, and her brother is also autistic. “Scripts help me navigate social situations where other people would intuitively pick up cues from other people and know how to respond,” Walters says. “Whereas I have to rely on a cheat sheet.” For someone with autism, scripts are a helpful way to navigate the bewildering maze of social interaction. “I don’t understand why people think it’s uncaring to use a script,” Walters adds.“For me, it shows that I do care, and I’m trying to accomodate someone else’s expectations and do the right thing.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eaffb02cd3a86b446da838242de24959b2b57958/0_141_3704_2222/master/3704.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4334d3bf17cdfb85692f7a8569911dfd","title":"my mother was dying but my best friend brought happiness to a brutally sad day","story":"The year 2012 had been a long and difficult one. One of three, in fact. It had been three years since my mum was diagnosed with terminal cancer and, ever since, I, my dad and older brother had been living in the hospital-filled limbo so familiar to families of cancer patients – life dictated by chemo cycles, the endless bedside waiting, the guilty mental preparation for the inevitable.Christmas in the Kalia household had always been a major occasion, though, and something to look forward to. Even though we are Hindus – our roots are in India – we had embraced the festival’s feasting and gift-giving. My mum would usually invite her two siblings and their ever-expanding families for turkey with all the trimmings, a meal she would spend days preparing while my kitchen-inept dad would look on in awe, faithfully laying the table and clearing dishes. That table would hold at least 15 others, all laughing and stuffing themselves – the usual disagreements that characterised family gatherings strangely absent. Since she had fallen ill, though, Christmas had morphed from a day of celebration of our big immigrant family’s resilient togetherness to a day fearful of absence. Which Christmas would be Mum’s last, I would wonder, and how could I make that one count more than the others?Her last Christmas was December 2012. The cancer had gone into remission in 2011, only to come back nine months later – and this time much worse, requiring major surgery that would keep her in hospital over the Christmas period. I was struggling to come to terms with the news, having just moved out of home to university, where I should have been drinking myself into new friendships, but instead was only thinking about whether she would make it to the end of the year. I was spending my life on trains, coming home every weekend to make the most of the time we had together.December came, and with it the usual stresses of Christmas parties and present-buying. I, for a reason I will never understand, decided to get my mum a copy of Raymond Carver’s What We Talk About When We Talk About Love – an emotionally punishing read at the best of times, never mind after five-hour surgery. It was obvious that we wouldn’t be hosting on Christmas Day this year. Instead, I awoke that morning with fizzing butterflies in my stomach – not the usual excitement, but a rising dread for the day to come, one that I knew I would have to grit my teeth to get through. We went straight to the hospital, where through a tangle of tubes and beneath a wheezing oxygen mask my mum lay, uncomfortable, but happy to see us.I gave her her present – immediately realising it was a useless choice – and then the three of us sat beside her for what felt like hours. There were no decorations in the intensive care ward, no Christmas music, just other families quietly keeping vigil and the heroic staff working through their routines. This was just another day the tantalising magic of Christmas had disappeared.“What are you all looking so sad for?” my mum asked us. She was adamant that we had some semblance of a Christmas Day, so my brother and I were sent off to our auntie’s for a sombre meal, avoiding talk of our mum lest it ruin the charade of turkey, gravy and torn tissue paper hats. My dad wouldn’t leave her side, though, and stayed until the nurses sent him home.It was heart-crushing stuff. “Is this what all Christmases will be like now?” I remember thinking. Yet, as we were leaving my auntie’s to face a night alone in a house that was feeling increasingly cold and empty, my phone rang. It was my best friend, Keerut, whom I have known since I was four, when we bonded in the playground over a shared love of Michael Jackson and Linkin Park. He invited us all over to his family’s place for a second Christmas meal, as they were eating late.That call was the faintest glimmer of hope in that bitterly cold day. I told my brother, and we set off in the car, arriving 30 minutes later to a warm house, places set for us and glasses thrust into our hands. Again, we didn’t speak much of my mum – we all knew her absence was the reason for us being there – but, instead, we got drunk and played games and were force-fed another Christmas dinner. I can’t remember what we ate or what games we played, but I remember laughing until I cried and feeling relieved that was something I could still do that it was possible to feel some happiness even in the most brutally sad times. We stayed over and when we woke up the next day, for a moment it felt as if things were OK again.I realised that in the more than 20 years Keerut and I had been friends, I had taken that friendship for granted. In Indian culture, there is a huge emphasis placed on the importance of family, the assumption that blood is a bond that will never be broken. But as any human being will tell you, friendships can also be for life. Your best friends will be there for you unreservedly and unconditionally, and that was something I didn’t realise I’d had all along.That was the last Christmas I spent with Mum but it was also the beginning of a new tradition. This year will be the seventh Christmas without her, and no doubt it will be a day full of the sadness, dread and possible happiness that anyone bereaved will experience, but it will also be another year when we have Christmas lunch with my auntie and then head to Keerut’s for the evening. It may be a difficult time of year, but that makes it all the more important to acknowledge the support – the friends – that I do have and whom I would like to thank for bringing some excitement back to my life. Theirs is a presence I will not forget, just as I will remember my mum."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5f84b43ed4d469d9bd5e29d6747fc5ab75c8b33f/0_0_3164_1898/master/3164.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b7510504aba93aa4dd403bc75bb763aa","title":"david brett rick lloyd how we made the flying pickets only you","story":"‘Getting the Christmas No 1 was a big deal.

In Birmingham, a screening of Blue Story, a gritty depiction of a fond boyhood friendship between two young black British men tragically sundered by gang-related postcode wars, sparked a mass brawl in the cinema foyer, unacceptably making girls queuing for a singalong to Frozen 2 run away in fear.In London in October last year, a production of Siegfried, an opera about a tooled-up psychopath, similarly provoked fisticuffs. But which one got withdrawn from view? Was it Rapman’s directorial debut about Britain in crisis with a grime soundtrack for an audience of ordinary millennials and Gen Zedsters, or the Victorian opera promoting knife crime set in a ludicrous fairyland by an antisemitic megalomaniac, and served up for a demographic of hedge fund lawyers and couturiers to the royal family? Oh, have a guess. It’s not far down the motorway from the Star City multiplex in Nechells to the Royal Opera House at Covent Garden, but in social terms there is an unbridgeable chasm between the two. It’s one rule for ordinary Britons and another for opera-going stiffs. Such is the madness of broken Britain in 2019.Oh come off it, you say. Wagner’s Siegfried, the third in his 15-hour cycle Der Ring des Niebelungen, isn’t about knife crime. You can’t use that to explain why Oxford-educated Matthew Feargrieve, 43, was convicted earlier this week for punching Düsseldorf-born fashion designer Ulrich Engler, 56, during a performance. City of London magistrates heard that Feargrieve had taken exception to Engler climbing into the front row and into a seat occupied by his partner Catherine Chandler’s tweed coat. Engler told the court he placed the coat in Ms Chandler’s lap after ascertaining she had not paid for the seat, while Feargrieve said that the couturier hurled the garment to the floor. Unless it was a particularly horrible coat, that sounds out of character for Engler, whose motto on his website is “Elegance is unchanging and timeless” and who has designed dresses for the Countess of Derby.But the fact is that Siegfried does promote knife crime. It opens with a character called Mime forging a sword at an anvil in his underground lair, to make it sharp enough for the eponymous hero to slay a dragon and steal its golden hoard. Later in Act One, Siegfried actually sings a song to his sword, namely Notung! Notung! Neidliches Schwert! (What kind of freak names his sword? That’s right: a Wagnerian one.)According to Engler’s testimony, when he was assaulted the conductor had already begun and the opera was about 10 minutes into its six-hour running time. No one in court, not even the beguilingly named Judge Zani, thought to listen to their Karajan recording of Siegfried to get a sense of the mood in the posh seats that afternoon. But I have. And the music is so febrile from the get-go, with Mime beating out a metallic tattoo at about 120 beats per minute, that it astounds me that the brawl only embroiled two people. Everybody’s nerves must have been a-jangle even before Siegfried entered like a proto-football hooligan with his demented preverbal chant: “Hoiho! Hoiho! Hau ’ein! Hau ’ein!”“I had never seen someone looking with so much anger and terror at me,” Engler said of the attack. “While Mr Feargrieve was hitting me, he said: ‘How dare you talk to my wife like this?’ The only three things I said to this woman was, would you mind if I sat next to you again, have you paid for the seat, and that I was sorry.” Another case of Wagner-related madness? If so, it’s amazing the courts aren’t teeming with them.I’m not trying to exonerate Mr Feargrieve for the crime for which he was convicted on Monday and will be sentenced in January. Indeed, if the testimony of former physiotherapist Elaine McMaster, who was in the Covent Garden audience that afternoon is right – namely that Feargrieve and Chandler were swaying side to side to the music, and that Chandler was flicking her hair and being noisy – then hanging is too good for them. “People don’t behave like that in their local cinema, let alone in the Royal Opera House,” McMaster said sensibly.What I am saying is that Covent Garden should immediately commission an opera called The Coat about the night in question, to explore how classical music rather than video games causes mindless violence. Possibly with a score by Harrison Birtwistle so unlistenable you’d climb over your own granny to get out of the auditorium.That said, what’s important to note is that fights at the opera are wrong, not least because they encourage headline writers to reference old Marx brothers movies they’ve probably never seen. As Roger Scruton argues in the The Ring of Truth: The Wisdom of Wagner’s Ring of the Nibelung, the takeaway from those many hours of Wagner is that, in the bleak Viking world of the Ring, despite its cast of crazily violent hammer-throwing and skull-smashing gods, is the reality of love and compassion made manifest by Brünnhilde’s sacrifice to her nutty spouse, Siegfried.Strangely, that is very similar to the message of Blue Story, though the machete-wielding toughs who injured police officers at Star City and terrified the Frozen 2 demographic clearly failed to appreciate it. Blue Story’s writer and director Andrew Onwubolu, AKA Rapman, said his film is “about love, not violence”, adding: “I pray that we can all learn to live with love and treat each other with tolerance and respect.” That message can be taken in more cheaply at screenings of Blue Story than at the opera – and, despite last month’s controversy, the film can, and indeed must, still be seen.Rapman makes an excellent point. This is, after all, the season of goodwill to all men. But not necessarily to small girls. In fact, the message I take from this tale of two cities is that it’s not Blue Story or Siegfried that should be banned, but Frozen 2. Surely that is something that most of us in broken Britain can get behind. As Boris Johnson so wisely said after last week’s general election, it is time to let the healing begin."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cdea6c50d94b7c445a978dbc7804ad4a93216ee9/239_26_3021_1813/master/3021.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eef17b898aaa39a26216fc16fc444404","title":"election 2019 what just happened","story":"Anushka Asthana is joined by  reporters and columnists to tell the story of election night.

Less conspicuous were those quietly packing their offices and saying goodbye to the building that, in some cases, they had worked in for decades.Of the 73 sitting MPs to lose seats in this election, 46 were Labour, seven were Conservative and six were Liberal Democrat. After the blow of being turfed out by constituents, former members of parliament are given a week to pack up their belongings before their security passes stop working on 19 December.For Tom Brake, the longest-serving Lib Dem MP ahead of Thursday’s vote, his first task after losing his seat of Carshalton and Wallington after 22 years was to talk to his staff about the terms of their redundancy. “Two of them have worked for me for more than 10 years,” he said. “In many ways this is potentially more traumatic for them than it is for me.”Following the announcement that he had lost his constituency to the Tories by 629 votes, Brake went home to sleep for two hours before getting up to attend a constituency surgery on Friday afternoon. “I explained to people that I wasn’t their MP but that I would take up the issue and pass it on to my successor,” he said. “On Saturday I had the prizes to present to the winner and runner-up of my Christmas card competitions, so I had to go and do that.”He added: “I guess for the first time in more than 30 years, when I wake up at the weekend, I won’t be thinking about what I need to be doing that day. I’ve been involved in politics since 1983 and it’s quite a demanding and relentless vocation and having a bit of time to think and relax will be exciting.”While Anna Soubry – the former Conservative who stood for the pro-EU Independent Group for Change in her Nottinghamshire seat of Broxtowe – said she hadn’t expected to be re-elected (she’d even cleared out her office ahead of polling day), she was clear that the blow of losing would come very hard to others. “When you leave a job – even when you’re sacked or made redundant – you get some period of notice and, you know, you have a farewell party and a card and everybody wishes you well, but in this game you are absolutely out on your ear,” she said. Citing the former Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson – who lost her seat of East Dunbartonshire to the SNP – as an example on the brutality of the system, Soubry said: “Her declaration was around 4am or something. She’s in Scotland, obviously … It is a real shock to her … You’ve got all that stuff to cope with, your profound feeling of loss and failure.“And then first thing on Friday morning, the parliamentary authority send an email saying ‘you have lost your seat and you can come and see us today, Saturday or Sunday’. You have just lost your job at 4am in the fucking morning and you’re in Scotland! I mean what world are people living in?”Labour’s Emma Dent Coad – who took Kensington from the Tories in 2017, only to lose the seat to them in this election – is still a local councillor in the constituency and plans to continue campaigning for justice for Grenfell residents. She also plans to see if the University of Liverpool will take her back to finish a PhD on ‘Constructing Modern Spain: politics and architecture under Franco 1939-1975’. “The earning a living bit is something I still need to resolve,” she said.Dent Coad says she lost her seat because of claims by remain-supporting advocates of tactical voting, published by publications including the  and Observer, that her Lib Dem rival – the former Conservative Sam Gyimah – was the most likely candidate to beat the Tories. In the end she lost to the Conservative candidate by 150 votes.“Obviously I’m gutted and I’ve had complete strangers bursting into tears on the bus when they see me, seriously. I’m not exaggerating – every time I go out, people shake me by the hand, wave, hug me or burst into tears.”As a qualified GP, Labour’s Paul Williams, who lost his seat of Stockton South, is slightly better equipped than most to find new employment. He continued to work as a doctor for two mornings a month as an MP, meaning he has kept his licence to practise. As well as continuing with medicine – and continuing to campaign for children with autism and veterans – his immediate priority will be spending time with his family.“My family has hardly seen me over the past six weeks and prior to that I was working away in London loads of the time,” he said. “I’ve got two young kids, a five-year-old and a seven-year-old, and I got to take them to school this morning.”Very few of the former MPs, almost all from opposition parties, say they will miss the opportunity to see Boris Johnson and his new majority government gloating from the green benches, nor the experience of working in the palace of Westminster. “It’s a horrible place to work actually,” says Dent Coad. “It’s really brutal, misogynistic and unkind … I’ve worked in very male-dominated environments before but that was the most horrible place I’ve ever worked as a woman.”For Soubry, the election result is the definitive end of a frantic period campaigning for a second referendum on the UK’s membership of the EU, and she’s looking forward to a break before figuring out the next step.“I’ve been working since I was 22 or 23 and – even though I’ve had two children – I’ve barely had more than a month off in 40 years,” she said. “I am actually looking forward to having a little time off, to work out what’s next and see what comes up. I’m open to offers. I want to work. I am only 63 and I want to earn my own living.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6d16fa3bcb9803e05b7784f9510ce5df772999b4/524_807_4402_2641/master/4402.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f9e877d5901b6766e72b5a33f8c16d87","title":"female scientists use less positive language about their work study finds","story":"Tendency of men to use words such as ‘excellent’ has effect on future citations of researchMale scientists are more likely than female ones to publish work that describes itself as “excellent”, “unique” or “novel”, experts have found – a swagger that appears to reap idends in respect of how often others reference the research.The team say this matters as citations have an impact on salary, whether a researcher secures grants and whether they receive promotions – areas where there is a well-known gender gap in favour of men.“A paper that is cited more often is going to be viewed by a promotions committee within a university as being more important than an article that is cited less often,” said Prof Anupam Jena, a co-author of the research from Harvard Medical School.Writing in the BMJ, Jena and colleagues report that they analysed the titles and abstracts of 101,720 articles in the field of clinical research – such as drug trials or health studies – published between 2002 and 2017. The gender of the first and last author was determined using a name-based algorithm.The team then searched these for 25 positive words, such as “robust”, “novel”, “remarkable” and “promising”.The analysis took into account factors that could have affected the findings, such as the journal, field of research and year of publication. Further analysis revealed that the finding was driven by differences in language among papers published in the most prestigious journals. The same trend was seen when the team looked at more than 6m papers in the life science field.For both fields, the team found positive words were associated with a higher rate of subsequent citations.Jena said there are probably many other examples of self-promotion that may differ between men and women, affecting careers. “This is just one lens into that phenomenon,” he said. In a linked editorial, Prof Reshma Jagsi from the University of Michigan and Dr Julie Silver of Harvard Medical School called on journals to tackle bias, saying the system should be changed rather than expecting women to simply boast more. One suggestion is a set of standards on the use of positive terms.They also call for research looking at whether positive terms are more likely to be removed in the editing process from studies by women. Heavy copyediting, they note, is more common in high-impact journals, where the new findings were most striking.Helen Wollaston, the chief executive of Wise, a campaign for women in science and engineering, welcomed the study. “It just shows the power of language – these subtle things that can make a big impact,” she said, adding that training of scientists in the power of language whatever their gender could be important. She said editors should be aware of subtle gender differences in how scientists described their work.Prof Athene Donald, of the University of Cambridge, said there was a growing body of research showing editorial processes could be biased when it comes to gender. “Here is another example when gender differences, probably imposed by unconscious cultural norms on both authors and editors, lead to ergent outcomes,” she said. “Because publishing itself has so much impact on career progression, this finding has significant implications. Academic processes and institutions need to pay much more attention to what gets published where, why and by whom.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/760d63f6e981e1c72ae15702fa726a3ac597f91a/0_0_3771_2263/master/3771.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7e89c41cefa894534f96ce0d25c6a86e","title":"community spirit helped turn coach house haven refugee family","story":"It took almost two years to arrange, but the kindness of local people has made a young Syrian family feel welcome“What days do you have water?” asks *Munira politely, as though it is as normal as wondering when to put out the bins. Meanwhile, through the translators, her husband worries whether the front door is sturdy enough, apparently concerned that it could easily be broken down.Munira, her husband and their two young children are here in the kitchen of their new home – a converted coach house owned by my husband and me. Almost two years ago, we decided to offer accommodation to a refugee family from Syria. You see the news, and you think how can this be happening? We can’t be the only couple with spare space who want to help, but we had no idea where to start.I thought we’d just put our hand in the air and let someone know we had suitable accommodation for a refugee family. But we’ve learned the hard way that the UK has no easily visible process for us to do that. Instead we’ve worked with volunteers, charities and local councils to welcome a refugee family via community sponsorship. It’s been really rewarding. We’ve made new friends, but above all the family now living in our coach house has been supported by the generosity and sheer kindness of local people giving their time and support.My first step was to call Tim Finch, founding director of Sponsor Refugees, whose work I’d read about in the . Tim explained that we needed to create a community sponsorship group in Leicestershire and would need to raise £9,000. We set up a public meeting to see if we could drum up support, helped by a fabulous bunch of people including local church groups and The Salvation Army, which acted as the lead sponsor and fundkeeper. Their experience from having been involved in community sponsorship elsewhere smoothed out a lot of wrinkles and they also provided safeguarding training.And so the South Leicestershire refugee housing committee was born, with more than a dozen volunteers all bringing different skills. It’s a very erse group and we’ve been able to ide up what turned out to be a huge amount of work to be done both before Munira and her family arrived and now they are here.It took us a year to raise the money – a year in which we publicised our cause and received much more than just cash donations, including clothes, shoes, hats and scarves. We’d been warned that there might be some comments from those who feel charity should begin at home, but no one we spoke to ever said anything negative. Indeed, it was a bonus to see just how many people felt the same way as us about this humanitarian crisis and wanted to contribute.Reset, the charity leading community sponsorship in the UK, is an amazing outfit, full of useful information, including what the family may have experienced, as well as practical details. They also talked us through examples where things had gone wrong with refugees, making us think very hard about our plans.We had to set up a bank account for Munira’s family, register them at the local job centre, sort out medical and dental treatment (that was my job as a practising dentist), get school places organised for the children, and much more.The children have been enthusiastically accepted by their local primary school – and have also been given free uniforms, an unexpected kindness. The jobcentre and benefits staff at our local council performed well the local GP practice slightly less so, insisting that the family could only be registered when they could go in, in person, with ID. But our local walk-in centre gave a five-star service when each of the children picked up this year’s seasonal vomiting bug. All of us on the committee have been allocated roles to help the family with mosque visits, English lessons, budgeting, benefits, bus timetables (and a free year-long bus pass – another kindness), food shopping, and how to cook on an Aga.Now the real work begins, to support the family towards independence, in employment, into schools, and settled in housing. Then perhaps we can help another family.More than 140 community sponsorship groups have now been formed in the UK and have helped to resettle hundreds of refugees. For us, community sponsorship has been very rewarding. A local council isn’t geared up to do things the way we can. And of course our time is freely given, whereas council staff have to work on tight budgets.I have a dozen new friends, and discovered shops even I didn’t know existed in Leicester. Munira had heard scare stories that refugee houses weren’t very nice. She and her husband were thrilled to find that was wrong. And the children are thrilled with the new toys in their new bedrooms.We’re fresh out of empty coach houses – but if you have anything similar, Reset will be delighted to hear from you.*Names have been changed. Anyone interested in supporting a refugee family should contact Reset."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d5d84c6e633e1378704d49b5c31c5514856f3d76/0_317_5207_3125/master/5207.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=61e6bca63361b015a7d9dc2b002f479e","title":"tories promise invest northern england why trust them","story":"The Tories’ audacious election gamble may have paid off with the acquiring of several new, formerly rock-solid Labour seats in the north of England for the voters of these so called “left-behind” towns, however, the dice is still rolling. They staked their votes on Brexit getting “done” and a renewal of their local economies and public services. The prime minister has promised investment in new rail projects and the NHS to reward that trust. But can he be trusted to deliver?Boris Johnson humbly thanked northern voters last week for “loaning” him those votes, but he may decide a five-year loan is all he needs to enact the wider economic and societal changes he desires. As we know, his word is not his bond, and erstwhile friends are ruthlessly dispensed with when no longer useful. Amid the triumphalism, Ben Bradley, Tory MP for Mansfield, signalled a note of caution: “We may be saying the right things but we are not trusted. The proof will be in the delivery in showing whose side we are on.”Even if Johnson intends to keep his promises, how will he show whose side he is on? Grand multibillion-pound capital infrastructure projects are undoubtedly needed in the north of England. But they take years to implement. There remains – and not just in the north of England – the messy, human, day-to-day crises of poverty, social care and universal credit collapsing local government unaffordable housing pitiful public transport, financially stressed schools and spiralling homelessness. There is little to suggest so far that, on these, the new government has the capacity, imagination or desire to offer anything new.Delivery is hard for governments at the best of times. It is arguably easier when ministers are fulfilling long-cherished plans. Record NHS investment under Labour, for example, or rolling out Sure Start, felt like the natural reflex of a government largely in agreement about what to do, not a pragmatic obligation. In contrast, focusing the energies of the state on the neglected Midlands and north will not come easy to a Tory party that has spent much of its time in power over many decades doing the opposite.Every new Tory leader declares themselves to be of the “one-nation” variety. The truth is that in recent years they have made an art form of ensuring austerity cuts fell far harder in the deprived north, and in Labour-voting cities, than they did in their south-eastern heartlands. The government is carrying out a so-called “fair funding” review of local government grants that – by watering down the significance of deprivation in the grant distribution formula – potentially has the effect of erting cash from “red wall” metropolitan boroughs to the Tory shires. It was a policy dreamed up when Tories had minimal political interest in the 50 most deprived constituencies of England it now represents 10 of them.These policies are the product of the ingrained small-state, free-market, southern-centric instincts of a generation of Tory politicians still very much in the driving seat. Will Tory MPs in Redcar, Sedgefield and the rest, really change anything for the better? We shouldn’t be surprised if they don’t.• Patrick Butler is the ’s social policy editor"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7387f1975117fec1aba5dd4353d14190bb607cc3/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6f86cc17b48c6f2aa2e315431de92a01","title":"top 10 theatre shows of 2019","story":"Katori Hall gave us a miracle, Caryl Churchill delivered a dark quartet and Tom Hiddleston astounded in Betrayal. But the year’s highlight was a breathtaking Ibsen with Hayley AtwellThis was the kind of show you want to see at an international festival: something that experiments with both form and content. Conceived and directed by Milo Rau and presented by NTGent, it was about the theatrical process while also inquiring into a notorious homophobic murder outside Liège in 2012. No definitive explanation of the motive was offered. What was shocking was the realisation that, at the eventual trial, the victim was viewed as the guilty party because he was gay. Read the full review.This was no mere reheating of Richard Eyre’s original 2004 production. Instead, it acquired new drive and heart. Zizi Strallen, as the flying nanny, was an intriguing mix of bullying briskness and heavenly solicitude. You’d also have to be a pretty hardened soul not to be astonished by the sight of Charlie Stemp airily tapdancing while suspended upside down from the proscenium arch. Read the full review.Caryl Churchill, ever experimental, put together four short plays dealing with myths, murder and our need for stories. I found Glass strangely opaque, but I loved the longest piece, Imp, about a couple of non-kissing cousins bound together for life by a long-buried secret. Both Deborah Findlay, given to sudden murderous rages, and Toby Jones, a depressive with a taste for running, were memorable, and the whole evening was a danse macabre tinged with dark comedy. Read the full review.Caroline Steinbeis’s revival of this 1912 play by Githa Sowerby outstripped a later one at the National. There was no fancy directorial footwork: simply a rapt attention to a riveting text that shows a Tyneside glassworks owner confronting the fact that his day is done. Owen Teale was excellent as the crumbling patriarch and Laura Elphinstone left one gutted by the scene where she realises that her lover’s ultimate loyalty lies not with her but with her father. Read the full review.How does one find a new angle on Pinter’s study of the corrosive nature of betrayal? Jamie Lloyd stripped the action to the bone. The focus was on the play’s psychological intricacy and on the performers. Tom Hiddleston, stricken by the revelation of his wife’s affair, Zawe Ashton as the free-spirited Emma and Charlie Cox as the blithely sensual Jerry all left an indelible impression. Read the full review.Robert Icke took a little-known play by Arthur Schnitzler about Viennese antisemitism, Professor Bernhardi, and turned it into a parable for our times. Juliet Stevenson played, unforgettably, a secular Jew who runs a prestigious clinic and attracts toxic publicity when she prevents a Catholic priest ministering the last rites to a dying girl. Icke’s version, which cast actors irrespective of gender or colour, was about both medical ethics and identity politics, and was the highlight of his Almeida career. Read the full review.Royal and Derngate, NorthamptonReligious faith is rarely explored on the modern stage. Katori Hall’s fine play, however, dealt both with the apparent visitation of the Virgin Mary to a trio of Rwandan schoolgirls in 1981 and the political tension between Tutsi and Hutu that led to genocide in 1994. Balancing the miraculous and the material, James Dacre’s production put a whole world on stage and Gabrielle Brooks, Yasmin Mwanza and Pepter Lunkuse showed the isions among the supposed visionaries. Read the full review.John Kani encompassed a large slice of South African history in his play about a testy encounter between two men. Antony Sher played a cantankerous old actor dreaming of playing King Lear and riddled with racial prejudice. Kani himself played his carer, angry at the inequalities of a post-apartheid society. Both actors were magnificent in a production directed by Janice Honeyman that suggested a love of Shakespeare was the one unifying factor. Read the full review.Helen Edmundson’s adaptation of Andrea Levy’s novel was a big event: an account of how aspiring Jamaicans left one small island in 1948 to arrive in another with great expectations tragically unfulfilled. The play coincided with revelations about Britain’s treatment of the Windrush generation but its strength lay in its portrait of iniduals: Leah Harvey and Gershwyn Eustache Jnr caught perfectly the trials of a couple struggling with postwar reality and Rufus Norris’s production combined the intimate and the epic. Read the full review.Duke of York’s, LondonI’d rate this one of the best Ibsen productions I’ve ever seen, along with Katie Mitchell’s Ghosts, Ingmar Bergman’s The Wild Duck and Peter Hall’s John Gabriel Borkman. Ian Rickson turned a complex, tantalising play into a more political Tristan and Isolde with John Rosmer and Rebecca West seen as heartbroken romantics driven inexorably to suicide by an oppressive past and an imperfect present. It helped that there was palpable erotic tension between Tom Burke as a Rosmer floundering through loss of faith and Hayley Atwell as a radical Rebecca imprisoned by her memories. But everything about this production felt right. Duncan Macmillan’s adaptation was sharp without being intrusive, Rae Smith’s design reminded us of the ever-present mill wheel, Neil Austin’s lighting showed the gloom-shrouded Rosmer mansion being fitfully illumined. There was a host of strong supporting performances from Giles Terera, Jake Fairbrother, Peter Wight and Lucy Briers. You were constantly aware of servants longing for the freedom that Rosmer and Rebecca earnestly talk about. A dark, difficult play was given abundant life.

Whether your priority is two-day battery life, fantastic camera performance or a spectacular screen, there’s plenty to choose from.This  buyer’s guide to top-end smartphones was last updated on 17 December 2019, and represents the best available models at the time. As new models are released and tested, this guide will be updated to help you choose the right flagship phone for you.Welcome to one of the ’s new buyer’s guides. This article represents hundreds of hours of testing by the author to bring together a succinct list of recommended products or services so you can pick from the best and ignore the rest without having to do hours of your own research.While the  may earn a small commission from items bought through affiliate links, the items featured in this buyer\u0027s guide have been tested and included without influence from any advertiser or commercial initiative.The follow-up to the best smartphone of the first half of 2019 is, unsurprisingly, the best phone to end 2019. The OnePlus 7T Pro is a minor update to the stellar OnePlus 7 Pro that keeps all the good bits, improves the camera, and speeds up the fingerprint scanner.The monster 6.67in QHD+ AMOLED screen runs at 90Hz – compared with 60Hz for most of the competition – is arguably the best in the business. It’s bright, crisp and super smooth, plus it’s free of holes or camera notches. The selfie camera pops up from the top on command – a consistent crowd-pleaser.The 7T Pro is the fastest-feeling phone – everything zips along. It has Qualcomm’s top chip, the Snapdragon 855+, 8GB of RAM and 256GB of fast UFS3.0 storage – plenty for practically everything. The optical in-display fingerprint scanner is even faster than before continuing to put the competition to shame.The latest OxygenOS 10, the firm’s super-slick version of Android 10, is arguably the best in the business too, and you’ll get prompt updates for three years.The triple camera system on the back is good too, combining a 48MP main, a 16MP ultra-wide angle and an 8MP telephoto camera. New for the 7T Pro is a super-macro mode, which is surprisingly good, producing crisp images up to just 2.5cm from the lens – great fun. The 7T Pro can’t quite beat the iPhone 11 Pro or Pixel 4XL, but it matches or beats the rest on detail and utility.Dual-sim support is handy for work or travelling. It’s water resistant to some extent, but has no IP rating. There’s a McLaren limited edition and a 5G version in the US, but not UK where the OnePlus 7 Pro 5G is still the current model.The unrivalled screen, sheer speed and in-display fingerprint scanner, combined with the slick OxygenOS 10 make even mundane tasks a joy. The massive OnePlus 7T Pro is a stretch worth making.Buy if: you want the best and fastest superphone experienceDon’t buy if: you don’t want to stretch to such a big phoneGood things come in smaller packages. The iPhone 11 Pro isn’t the biggest or the most expensive of Apple’s 2019 smartphones, but it is the best and very nearly the best phone of the year.The iPhone 11 Pro combines a stunning, big-enough 5.8in screen, svelte, luxurious-feeling body, top-notch performance and battery life to keep up with most of the competition.Truth be told, the design is basically uncharged since the mould-breaking iPhone X from 2017. The back is now frosted glass, which looks particularly good in silver, and has a triple camera lump in the top left. The rest stays pretty much unchanged.Apple’s Face ID is still the best, most widely-supported face recognition system in the business. The new A13 Bionic chip continues to lead the pack. The gesture navigation system continues to be one of the best, and you’re in line for around five years of iOS software updates from release - at least two more than any other manufacturer will provide.This year the iPhone 11 Pro introduces a significantly improved triple camera with ultra-wide, wide and telephoto lenses, which matches the best rivals in photography and beats them in video. It even has an effective night mode now.It’s not all gravy – starting with just 64GB of storage is poor. The old Lightning connector still persists, rather than the newer standard of USB-C. There’s no 5G option and it is exceedingly expensive – you don’t buy the iPhone 11 Pro looking for value for money. Plus iOS 13 has been a mixed bag since its introduction, with a lot of bugs that needed fixing.But as a whole, no other phone can match the iPhone 11 Pro in power, capability and size. The iPhone 11 Pro is the smaller phone to buy and the best running iOS.You want the best smaller phone, or simply the best Apple phone, then the iPhone 11 Pro is fantastic, but comes at a considerable costBuy if: you want the best iPhoneDon’t buy if: you don’t want to spend £1,049 or want to use AndroidIf you want the Android sweet-spot between a big, stunning screen and smaller phone size that’s easier to handle and fit in a pocket, that’s the Galaxy S10.The 6.1in QHD+ AMOLED screen with a small hole-punch notch in the top right is one of the best on the market and is big enough to make the most of apps and movies look great.Small bezels all round make the phone pretty compact compared with rivals, and it’s light too. It’s still a glass and metal sandwich, which means you might need a case to protect against falls.The Galaxy S10 was recently updated with Samsung’s new One UI 2 software, based on the latest Android 10 including much-improved navigation gestures. You should get about three years of software support from release from Samsung, although the company is usually slower than Google and OnePlus to deliver big Android version updates.The rear triple camera is good allowing you to zoom from 0.5 through 2x, and on to a 10x hybrid zoom. It won’t beat the Pixel 4 XL or iPhone 11 Pro, but gets the job done. The selfie camera pokes straight though the screen and is one of the better ones on the market.Performance is good but battery life is a bit weak, lasting a day of usage but not much more. The ultrasonic fingerprint sensor mounted under the display has proved to be a bit slow and finickity over time, which can be annoying.A big screen Android experience in a relatively small phone is the main selling point, but the good camera, performance and looks help too.Buy if: you want a good balance of screen and phone size without breaking the bankDon’t buy if: you want brilliant battery lifeThe best camera on a phone is the Huawei P30 Pro by some margin. Even at the end of 2019, no other phone provides as comprehensive a combination as Huawei’s new Leica quad camera.The 20MP 0.6x ultra-wide angle camera is fun, the main 40MP camera is terrific and it’s joined by a new periscopic 5x optical zoom camera that gets you closer than any other smartphone. If five times magnification wasn’t enough, there’s an excellent 10x hybrid zoom on top and then a digital zoom all the way up to 50x. A 3D depth-sensing time-of-flight sensor rounds out the modules on the back.Remarkable levels of zoom aside, the P30 Pro also has low-light performance that instantly turns night into day without having to wait for a couple of seconds of capture. The P30 Pro might not have the best Night Sight rival, but most of the time it simply doesn’t need it.The rest of the phone is excellent, too, with stunning colour options. The large 6.47in FHD+ OLED is great, with a small notch in the top containing the selfie camera and slim bezels all round. The curved edges keep the width of the phone to a narrow 73.4mm wide, meaning it’s still relatively manageable and easier to wield day-to-day particularly compared with the OnePlus 7T Pro or iPhone 11 Pro Max.The in-screen optical fingerprint sensor is second only to the OnePlus 7T Pro’s. Huawei’s Kirin 980 processor, 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, provides great performance and a battery that will last about two days. Plus the battery charges super fast and has wireless charging and power sharing.Huawei’s modified Android 10, EMUI 10, is highly customisable and has plenty of features but may not be to everyone’s tastes. Huawei is still facing sanctions from the US as part of the US-China trade war, which makes its future uncertain. The P30 Pro’s recent Android 10 update showed that it should continue to receive updates as normal, however.The camera is game-changing in meaningful, not gimmick-filled ways, while the rest of the phone is excellentBuy if: you want the best camera on a great phoneDon’t buy if: you want a smaller phone or are worried about US blockade of HuaweiPound for pound the OnePlus 7T offers the best performance, design and experience than any other smartphone.It’s got the big, good-looking 6.41in full HD OLED screen, with a small, widow’s-peak-like notch at the top for a selfie camera. New for the 7T is a 90Hz refresh rate, which like its bigger sibling the 7T Pro, makes even the mundane silky smooth.It’s got 2019’s top-of-the-line Snapdragon 855+ processor, 8GB of RAM and 128GB of fast UFS3.0 storage. It also lasts a good 31 hours on a charge, and its OxygenOS 10 Android software is fast and slick. OnePlus guarantees two years of software updates and an additional year of bi-monthly security updates from the release date of the phone too.It even has the fastest and best in-display fingerprint scanner currently available, which is as good as the best dedicated capacitive sensors, good haptics and dual-sim support for having two mobile phone network connections at the same time.The triple camera is good too, with ultra-wide, wide and 2x telephoto lenses, plus a dedicated macro mode, but it can’t beat the very best in the market. There’s no formal water resistance rating and no wireless charging, but WarpCharge sees it hit full charge in 60 minutes flat.A great 90Hz screen, excellent software and the best performance, in-display fingerprint scanner and a good camera mean you have to spend significantly more to get a better phone than thisBuy if: you want a top-notch phone but don’t want to spend more than £549Don’t buy if: you want a really good cameraSmartphones are rated by screen size measured on the diagonal in inches. The bigger the number the larger the phone, but different phones use different ratios of height to width.How easy it is to handle comes down to the width of the phone and its weight. The narrower and lighter it is, the easier it is to hold in one hand and the less likely you are to drop it.What is commonly called the processor in a phone is actually a system-on-a-chip combining the processor, graphics and other essential systems into one.Generally the newer the processor the more powerful and battery efficient it will be. Samsung, Huawei and Apple make their own, while Qualcomm is the largest supplier to other brands at the high end, with its Snapdragon 8-series range at the top.The RAM (memory) is where your apps and processes are stored when in use, so the you more your phone has the better, up to a point.Android requires more RAM than iOS, so it\u0027s difficult to directly compare them. But with Android at least 4GB of RAM is currently recommended.Different from memory, storage is where everything is stored on the phone, including apps and media. While a few phones can have their storage expanded with microSD cards, most cannot.That means you should aim for 64GB of storage at a minimum, but more if you want to store lots of photos. Cloud services such as Spotify or Google\u0027s Photos can help offload your music, photos or videos to the internet.Keeping your phone secure from hackers is essential, which makes software updates critical to patch bugs and security holes, as well as adding new features and improving things such as battery life and the camera.Not all phones receive regular updates. Apple\u0027s support of older phones is the best in the business of around 5 years, followed by Samsung and Google\u0027s three years, both from when the phone was released - not when you buy it.Battery life varies drastically between devices, and all-day battery often doesn\u0027t mean 24 hours between charges. Some may not last long enough, particularly if you\u0027re out in the evening.Battery life gets worse as the battery ages too, so a two-day battery will likely make sure the phone lasts at least a day two years later.Cameras are the current battleground between the big players, but the margins between them are slimming.Most use computational photography that combines hardware with advanced software algorithms, typically allowing multiple cameras to combine to make one image.As such the camera software makes as much difference as the hardware, and is one of the few areas that actually improves over time with updates.Multi-camera systems often offer more, such as useful zooms, portrait modes and better low-light performance, but they are not all created equally. There are also 3D cameras, which can detect facial expressions and other fun tricks.The number of megapixels (MP) also makes a difference. Having more MP doesn\u0027t necessarily equal a better image, but modern smartphone cameras combine multiple pixels to improve image quality producing 12MP shots from 48MP sensors, for example.Wireless charging:\u0026nbspconvenient, but slower than via cable and normally a charging pad doesn\u0027t come in the boxDurability:\u0026nbspgenerally glass on the front and back of the phone makes it more fragileResale value:\u0026nbspiPhones hold their value better than most othersOLED versus LCD: OLED screens emit their own light so have much deeper blacks and more vibrant colours, while LCD screens are cheaperThese are good phones still worth buying if none of the top smartphones fit the bill.Apple’s cheaper iPhone 11 is the follow-up to last year’s iPhone XR and offers most of the features of the iPhone 11 Pro. It has slightly battery life too, but is missing the excellent ultra-wide angle camera, has a slightly larger, but worse screen. It is made of aluminium and glass, instead of stainless steel, losing its luxurious feel and the knowledge that it’s the best Apple can make.The iPhone 11 looks great in red or white, but it’s not cheap by any stretch of the imagination, costing as much or more as true flagship phones from competitors. The iPhone 11 certainly holds its own for the money, but the iPhone 11 Pro still the one to buy if you want the best iPhone. If you want a cheaper phone, switch to Android or buy last year’s iPhone XR.If you must have an iPhone and it must have a massive screen or epic battery life then the iPhone 11 Pro Max is your only option. But it has really poor ergonomics, is big, expensive and heavy, making the smaller iPhone 11 Pro or iPhone 11 are better options.The smallest, cheapest variant of Samsung’s current S10 line is still good, but falls slightly short of the high bar set by the regular Galaxy S10. The Galaxy S10e loses the optical zoom with only two cameras on the back, has a flat, slightly smaller screen and a lower capacity battery. It also ditches in the in-screen fingerprint scanner for one embedded in the power button – great for right-handed users but not so for the left handed.It doesn’t feel any smaller in the hand, but can be had for less if you must have a top-end Samsung for the lowest possible cost or dislike curved screens.The bigger version of the Galaxy S10 with a 6.4in QHD+ display has the best screen available on any device. The oval-shaped hole-punch notch is novel, containing two good selfie cameras. The triple rear camera is good, but not a patch on the Huawei P30 Pro. Performance is good, so is the software, but the battery life is slightly disappointing compared with the best. The fingerprint scanner is a bit slow and can be frustrating to use.The Galaxy Note 10+ is a Samsung super-fan’s dream. It has the biggest screen on a Samsung with a monstrous 6.8in on the diagonal, new faster UFS3.0 storage, reasonable battery life and plenty of party tricks. The stylus can now be used as a magic wand for gestures, there are three cameras on the back and is available in a 5G version too. The fingerprint scanner is a bit slow and can be a bit frustrating to use.The biggest, most powerful version of Samsung’s S-line is the S10 5G and it’s huge with a 6.7in QHD+ AMOLED screen, long oval-shaped hole-punch notch for the selfie cameras, and four cameras on the back. Performance, software and battery are good, but it’s not as slick or ergonomic as the OnePlus 7 Pro 5G. The fingerprint scanner is a bit slow and can be frustrating to use.The Mate 20 Pro has the big, attractive 6.39in QHD+ screen, svelte body, long battery life and great performance that made it the top phone of 2018. However, its excellent triple camera system with 3x optical zoom has been outdone by Huawei’s newer P30 Pro, which has a Leica quad camera with 5x optical zoom. It recently received EMUI 10 (Android 10) and is worth looking out for deals, particularly if you want the 3D face unlock option.The Google Pixel 4 XL is a mixed bag. On the one hand you have a good-looking 6.3in QHD+ AMOLED display running at 90Hz, a stellar camera, new Soli radar gesture system, amazing new on-device AI and super-fast 3D Face Unlock. But on the other you have no fingerprint scanner, meaning until apps are updated to use the Face Unlock you’re forced back to using the old pin or password, the battery life is fairly short and there have been quite a few bugs that have needed fixing since launch. One day it might be great.Xiaomi’s first slider phone offers more than most for the money, with top-flight specs for 2018 competing directly with the OnePlus 6T and Honor View20. It takes a different approach to the problem of where to put the selfie camera in an all-screen design, hiding it behind the screen on slide-out section.Good, but quite as great as its competition, this huge phone is held back by a heavy weight and a software experience that just isn’t as good, despite solid gesture navigation options.Google Pixel 4 - Great phone utterly ruined by terrible battery life - £669Razer Phone 2 - Gaming phone beast that falls down on camera performance – £500Sony Xperia XZ3 – Good, but not great phone that misses the mark – £699 This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

Bannon left the administration in 2017 after playing a key role in the US president’s equivocation over a deadly white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, which was widely condemned, but remains influential.“We’ve turned the Republican party into a working-class party,” said Bannon, relaxing at a table with an autographed photo of Trump behind him. “Now, interestingly, we don’t have any elected representatives who believe that, but that’s a legacy issue. We’ll get over that. We’ve got to find our AOCs.”Ocasio-Cortez, a 30-year-old former bartender from New York, was elected to Congress last year and has built a huge social media following as a member of “the Squad”, a group of four progressive women of colour. Her eagerly sought presidential endorsement went to fellow progressive senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.The Democrats and their supporters have “better casting”, Bannon admitted. “They did an amazing job in 18. I keep saying I admire AOC. I think her ideology’s all fucked up, but I want her. I want to recruit bartenders. I don’t want to recruit any more lawyers. I want bartenders.”Congressional Republicans are dominated by ageing white men from comfortable backgrounds. Among Democrats, Bannon also pointed to military veterans such as Max Rose of New York and Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey, both elected as the party swept the House of Representatives in 2018. “That’s perfect casting. That’s why we got smoked.”Democrats were boosted in the midterms by Mike Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York, who spent $110m through his own political action committee. An impressive 21 of the 24 candidates he supported won their races. Bloomberg is now also running for the Democratic nomination for president in the 2020 US election.“People are missing the point about Bloomberg,” said Bannon, who co-hosts a radio programme about Trump’s impeachment called War Room. “Trump wouldn’t be impeached if it were not for Bloomberg. It’s Bloomberg’s hundred million dollars that won the seats … The Democrat party is just like Republicans: a pass through. There’s no actual people to do anything. They’re not out in any state ringing doorbells. Those activist groups are. That’s where Bloomberg put his hundred million dollars.”In a second interview by phone last week, Bannon drew parallels with the British general election, in which Conservative Boris Johnson trounced Labour’s Jeremy Corbyn, accused of failing to stamp out antisemitism in the party. Johnson took a wrecking ball to a “red wall” in traditional working-class areas, just as Trump broke through the “blue wall” in midwestern states in the 2016 election.“I think it’s a victory for populism,” Bannon said, “Obviously radical economic ideas and socialism and more government involvement, coupled with virulent antisemitism, is not a winning ticket. I believe the Democratic party here, particularly on the far left – the Squad, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders – should embrace the lessons because I don’t believe it was just Corbyn’s personality.”He added: “Obviously Corbyn had issues, a personality that seemed to rub people the wrong way, particularly some of his core voters, but this is much deeper than that and you just can’t just turn it off to ‘one guy was more popular than the other’. This was, I think, a very serious vote and people paid a lot of attention to this and wanted to get Brexit done.”Bannon said he was fascinated by focus groups he saw on British TV during the election campaign. “These were Labour voters and they were not going to vote for Labour and the reason was they kept asking, ‘How are these programmes going to be paid for?’ What I was most impressed with was the specificity and the granularity of the questions.“People don’t want to be spun any more. They don’t want to be BS’d any more. They want to know what you’re laying out and how you’re going to effectuate it and, most importantly, how you’re going to pay for it and ‘if paying for it means more increased taxes or less opportunities for me, you’re not going to get my vote no matter how good it sounds’.”He added: “I think the Democrats, on whether it’s Green New Deal or healthcare for illegal aliens or whatever, ought to take the lessons of the working class. These are lifetime Labour members that voted for a Tory.”Bannon regards Johnson as neither a nationalist nor a populist and likens the prime minister’s vision of Brexit to “Singapore-on-the-Thames” – very different from the version hoped for by those who voted for him. Even so, Bannon argues that both the Conservatives and Republicans should aim to seize their traditional rivals’ territory by appealing to the working class.Critics say Bannon is an ardent nationalist, nihilist and attention seeker hellbent on disrupting and destroying the political establishment. He suggests his desire to transform the Republican party as a working-class force stems from a worldview that pitches the elites against the so-called “deplorables”, a term based on a comment by Hillary Clinton that was widely seen as an insult to long-disparaged and forgotten people.“My whole theory on the right is that we if we want capitalism to survive, we need to make people capitalist. The problem is they’re not capitalists. We have oligarchs and serfs. That system is not going to survive. I tell the donors, you may hate me, but all your Paul Ryan bullshit at the Heritage Foundation can’t win national elections. He can’t win Wisconsin, OK? Donald Trump can.”The White House adviser Stephen Miller, a white nationalist, told Bannon in a 2016 radio interview that America could be “decimated” by immigration and lose its sovereignty. Bannon, who has worked with openly racist far-right leaders across Europe, denies that racial resentment is central to the resurgent populism – even though the FBI reported last month that personal attacks motivated by bias or prejudice have reached a 16-year high, with a sharp increase in violence against Latino people.The Trump administration has notoriously attacked workers’ rights, cutting the number of workplace safety inspectors, tightening qualifications for who must be paid the minimum wage or overtime and pushing trade unions to the margins.Bannon appears untroubled by having helped put a man endorsed by white nationalists in the Oval Office. “Look, this is what drives me nuts about the left. All immigration is to flood the zone with cheap labour, and the reason is because the elites don’t give a fuck about African Americans and the Hiic working class. They don’t care about the white working class either. You’re just a commodity.“So they have unlimited labour and they’re paying you nine bucks an hour. ‘Let more guys in and, by the way, it’s bigger markets.’ It destroys the working class. That’s what we’ve got to protect. Once we show working-class people of every ethnicity and race that you being a citizen you get a special deal, you get that realignment.”A former naval officer and Goldman Sachs investment banker, Bannon’s emphasis on citizenship would be unlikely to satisfy current US citizens who endure immense class, gender and race inequalities. The gap between the haves and have-nots grew last year to its highest level in more than half a century of tracking income inequality, according to US Census Bureau figures released in September. The independent not-for-profit CDC Foundation says black women are three to four times as likely to die from pregnancy-related causes as their white counterparts."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c3df093759b10d1d0f167dabc1e082aa2c82505e/0_200_2344_1407/master/2344.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=292d0f92de1577fc230e642996187a9b","title":"board games books and brand new clothes a guide to christmas shopping in your local charity shop","story":"They’re the cornerstone of every high street – guaranteed to have an eclectic mix of everything from clothes to homeware. Here are the top Christmas gifts to look out for when you next pop in to a thrift shopAs shopping, and living, sustainably becomes a focus for more and more people, this Christmas is the perfect time to turn to your local charity shops for your festive shopping. Not only will you give what you buy a new lease of life, you’ll support your local economy and share the benefits of shopping secondhand. To give you some inspiration, we’ve rounded up the best gifts you can expect to find in your local charity shop.Winter warmersFrom oversized turtlenecks in fun primary colours to neat cardigans and always-appropriate V-necks, charity shops are a goldmine for knitwear, particularly around the time wardrobes are being cleared to make way for (carefully pre-specified) Christmas gifts. Let their castoffs become your festive finds. You’ll save pounds compared with what you would spend on a new item and you’re more likely to find something unique, so your giftee won’t have to worry about running into someone else wearing the same thing.Board gamesChristmas wouldn’t be Christmas without a good board game to bring everyone together or, indeed, ide them … Monopoly and Scrabble are mainstays in most charity shops but there’s plenty others to suit everyone. Take your pick from the likes of Risk, Trivial Pursuit and Cluedo, as well as a plethora of TV- and film-themed games and the latest releases.Bestselling booksAlongside some wonderfully weird 1970s recipe books, you’ll find scores of bestselling titles on charity shop bookshelves. Zadie Smith, Margaret Atwood, Philip Pullman and John Grisham are all regulars, and you’ll find plenty of new authors such as Sally Rooney and David Chariandy too. While some titles may be a few years old, it’s not unusual to find the latest must-read on the shelves, and keep your eyes peeled for signed editions for an extra-special touch.Chintzy chinaFrom cocktails served in teacups to unusual teapots becoming a major home decor trend, the popularity of chintzy, vintage china is on the rise. You’ll discover shelves worth of it in almost any charity shop you walk into. It’s the perfect gift for someone who likes their homeware kitsch. Why not use a floral teacup as a holder for a homemade candle?Classic recordsWith vinyl records increasing in popularity, why not make a beeline for your nearest charity shop as they have plenty on offer. As digital formats took over, people turned to charity shops to free up their once-straining shelves and, because vinyl was donated in such abundance, many charity shops sell records for as little as 25p. You can expect to find everything from classical and krautrock to electronica and soul.Brand-new clothesWe all know someone who’s a little squeamish about the idea of secondhand clothes. But luckily for thrifty gift-givers, charity shops are not only stocked with vintage finds and pre-loved pieces, they’re also home to a huge amount of brand-new, unworn clothes. A quick rifle through the rails of your local charity shop will reveal a whole host of clothes with the original tags still attached. You’ll find everything from bold, printed T-shirts and floaty maxi dresses to jeans and shirts. There’s an abundance of high street labels waiting to be found and, if you’re lucky, you might just stumble across a designer piece.Vintage sewing patternsMore than a million people have taken up sewing over the past few years, with sales of sewing patterns soaring. However, with some patterns costing as much as we’re used to paying for a fully finished garment, the prices involved can be off-putting. To keep the crafty person in your life stitching, have a rifle through the baskets of vintage sewing patterns you often find tucked away underneath shelves. Selling for as little as 50p, you could buy enough to keep them busy until next Christmas.Statement jewelleryYou don’t have to go to an expensive boutique to find the perfect piece of jewellery – there’s plenty to be found in charity shops and they won’t break the bank. Take your pick from delicate vintage brooches, strings of pearls (likely faux, but you never know), oversized earrings, watches and cufflinks. The shelves are full to bursting with an assortment of jewellery that will suit everyone from your best friend to your grandma.Toiletry gift setsOnce a reasonably priced option for a secret Santa, toiletry gift sets seem to get more and more expensive each year. Rather than splashing out, see what’s on offer in your local charity shop. While some people may be worried about buying lotions and potions secondhand, charity shops are very savvy with their stock. Anything opened doesn’t make the shelves and many branches keep high street gift guides from the last couple of years in stock so they can cross-check whether a set is in date or not.Show your high street some loveWhy not seek out the personal touch with your Christmas shopping this year and join Visa in supporting local independent businesses across the country because #WhereYouShopMatters"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b08e67d45c554e1416a0d05e20f37399801fb0de/2810_672_2638_1583/master/2638.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=641c6a1f2409434d9c09472aa8a21693","title":"weve become like a little family of shops we look out for one another","story":"For Karen Harvey, her shop Hoos is fulfilling a lifelong passion for Scandi design while also breathing welcome new life into her local area, writes  Malcolm Jack “I often get people coming in and asking me what the name of the shop means,” smiles Karen Harvey, founder and owner of Hoos. “Everyone thinks it’s Danish or something. It’s actually just how you say ‘house’ in Scotland,” she laughs, “it’s just a bit of fun.”Be that as it may, it’s a name that captures a lot about what makes Glasgow’s haven of gorgeous Nordic homeware such a unique delight to visit. Both in terms of its synergy of fine Scandi and Scottish design (“hus”, pronounced the same way as Hoos, happens to be the word for “house” in the three main Scandinavian languages), and also its welcoming sense of warmth and character. Never more so than in the run-up to Christmas, when Harvey and her staff embrace the rich northern European tradition of bringing cosy light and comfort to long, dark winter nights, with their twinkling decorations and friendly, personalised approach to helping customers pick just the right presents for family and friends.Home has been at the heart of 63-year-old Harvey’s entire working life, in different ways. For 30 years she lived in Suffolk, leading two charities that did revolutionary things in improving the lives, living circumstances and futures of vulnerable young people (she received an MBE for her services). A mixture of professional and personal circumstances led her back to her native Glasgow a few years ago, where she decided to take an entirely new career direction.“I’ve always had an interest in interiors and design, even though that’s not my background at all,” Harvey explains. “Scandinavian design has always been my sort of personal aesthetic, so when I was thinking: ‘OK, what brands do I want to do?’ they were the only ones for me.” She leased small premises on, at that time, a dilapidated stretch of Great Western Road, just off the west end of Glasgow’s central artery Byres Road, and with the support of her architect partner Bill, cleverly transformed the compact space into an immaculately laid out, bright and inviting oasis of select hard and soft furnishings, cool kitchen and tableware, lush green house plants, stylish rainwear, handmade fashion accessories and other assorted pretty things.Starting a new business in a new sector would be a daunting challenge for anyone, but Harvey took it in her stride. “I had to go to Copenhagen and be interviewed by some of the brands, because they’re very particular about what kind of shops they’re going in to,” Harvey reveals. She evidently impressed, because Hoos has become one of the few stockists in the UK for a host of hip makers such as Hay, Normann Copenhagen and Skagerak, to name just a few. “Most of my jewellery is by Glasgow School of Art graduates,” Harvey explains. “We also do textiles by Scottish makers. You’re not going to find these kinds of things in any other store either.”Business is going strong for Hoos, as it helps lead a local high street revival. Harvey is passionate about fostering a thriving community along Great Western Road, which has seen a host of great vintners, victuallers, boutiques, bookshops, bakers and cafes breathe new life into a historic strip of retail premises. She’s involved with Love Great Western Road, a Business Improvement District (BID) proposal encouraging local businesses to work collectively for a brighter, more prosperous commercial future. “It’s helped us to get to know one another,” Harvey says of BID. “We’ve become like a little family of shops – we look out for one another.”As well as local retailers pulling together to support each other, they all rely on their customers doing the same. By reminding people #WhereYouShopMatters, Visa is championing local, independent retailers to help restore richly deserved focus and footfall to our high streets. Not only because our high streets are at the heart of our communities, but also because great independent traders can offer unique and enriching retail experiences, where staff take a hands-on approach to helping you select special things for yourself and for the important people in your life. Shops like Hoos are working hard to not only redefine what it means to be a small, independent trader in the digital age, but also help revitalise our high streets for a new generation, and they deserve to be shouted about for it.“I’m really encouraged by Visa’s #WhereYouShopMatters initiative,” says Hoos’s Karen Harvey, “because it brings businesses like ours to people’s attention. Particularly among younger people, who I think are the ones who increasingly do most of their shopping online. If it brings Hoos to their attention for maybe the first time, obviously that’s fab. And then they’ll come to Great Western Road more often and see all the other fabulous shops too.”Here are some of Harvey’s top tips for great Christmas shopping experiences in her local area:Love and Squalor“A small shop just past Kelvinbridge. Rebecca is the owner and she sells clothes that she handmakes herself. So it’s like going back to how it used to be many years ago. She also buys in things such as wonderful socks and lovely Irish scarves, blankets and candles. It’s just a really nice experience going in there.”427 Great Western Road, Kelvinbridge, G4 9JACottonrake Bakery“A fabulous independent bakery, doing wonderful bread, cakes and bakes. In the run-up to Christmas they do all kinds of special things such as Christmas jams and other nice little presents. We feel extremely lucky to have them nearby.”497 Great Western Road, G12 8HLPaulin Watches“Everyone loves a watch – particularly a handmade one. Paulin’s designs are beautiful. They’re a young, independent company and they sell lots of other handmade things such as risograph prints by local artists.”407 Great Western Road, G4 9JAShow your high street some loveWhy not seek out the personal touch with your Christmas shopping this year and join Visa in supporting local independent businesses across the country because #WhereYouShopMatters"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/71f2c9a26f832b9957df0f178b0e25d1a45f8cdd/418_2114_3422_2053/master/3422.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=09930e09e9b7d6674f8445610cfea1b4","title":"the more festive the better how the high street becomes a special place at christmas","story":"Shopping takes on a new life at Christmas as the high street is transformed – as shoppers profess to having a little more goodwill than on your average Saturday and independent stores become the top destinationsAt the risk of sounding incredibly basic, I’ll confess: after the Christmas music, the decor is my favourite part of the festive season. While I’m next to useless when it comes to putting up my own decorations, I’m drawn like a moth to the flame to any household, restaurant, market or shop that has put in the extra effort. The more fake snow, twinkling lights and jingling bells, the better.In the car-centric Toronto suburb where I grew up, most of my youthful Christmas shopping was confined to the local mega-malls, which were unfailingly packed with overheated shoppers from Black Friday through to Boxing Day, so moving to the UK has been something of a revelation. No mall Santa, however rosy-cheeked, can really compete with the quaint holiday market in my boyfriend’s Lancashire hometown, or Kew Gardens’ festive trail of lights.That’s why you’re likely to find me gawping at the garlands over Regent Street when they’re illuminated later this month. The first major high street in London to adopt the practice of street-long decoration, Regent Street has been doing its Christmas light display since 1954, after a reporter described London as “drab” during the holiday season. Oxford Street followed suit soon after, in 1959, and by the end of the 1960s, high streets across Britain were invested in the new tradition. In fact, many cities now make an event of the day the lights are switched on, complete with fair rides, pantos and celebrities of varying degrees of fame.These spectacles aren’t just about dazzling onlookers. In Christmas and the British: A Modern History, historian Martin Johnes explains that light displays “gave 20th-century Christmas shopping a sense of occasion that differentiated it from the wider shopping experience that had become so embedded in everyday life”. More than just setting a mood, high street Christmas decorations make shopping less of a chore. If we have to endure the hordes each season, why not do it somewhere we don’t only tolerate, but enjoy?It’s not only the busy high streets following this logic. The coloured lights strung by volunteers in the tiny Cornish fishing village of Mousehole, all funded by donations, attract some 30,000 tourists a year to the benefit of local businesses. And for the last three years, Broadway Road in the Cotswolds has hosted late-night shopping evenings in December, with local stores staying open until 8:30pm so shoppers can stock up on gifts and take in a mix of performances in a cheerful environment. A friend of mine who worked at a Broadway Road hair salon recalls the time her team dolled up Three Wise Women and had them ride down the street on camels.Partial to a late-night browse myself, I usually venture to Mount Street in Mayfair to watch the lights get switched on, and spend the rest of the night wandering through the boutiques, sipping complimentary champagne and stuffing my face with mince pies to a medley of choristers and fashionable DJs. You can get the same buzz on many high streets in December, when independent shops stay open late and a holly wreath (or cup of mulled wine) is always close by.For all my talk about the high street at Christmas, I’m not one of those people who sorts out their list early. I pick up inspiration over the course of the year, and then do most of my shopping in the two weeks before the big day. That period, when the excitement around Christmas is reaching its peak, is when I feel most energised and most excited to take part in any Christmas-related activity, whether it’s ice-skating, eating Serrano ham at a friend’s flat or having one final night out before everyone goes home for the holidays.

He will now be able to explain himself,” an official in the French presidency said, adding that Emmanuel Macron would name a new commissioner “as soon as possible”.Laurent Berger, the head of France’s largest union, the CFDT, called Delevoye’s omissions “shocking”, telling France Info radio that “they obviously damage his credibility”.The unions are demanding that Macron drop his plan to forge a single pensions system out of the existing 42 schemes – arguing that millions of people would have to delay their retirement to get a full pension.A day of road blockades by truckers demanding higher pay added to traffic jams on Monday as most metro lines in the capital were again closed or operating only a handful of trains. Across France, only one in three high-speed TGV trains and one in four regional trains were running.Fresh demonstrations are planned for Tuesday, with several universities, including the Sorbonne in Paris, said they had cancelled or postponed year-end exams because students would not be able to show up.The rail operator SNCF has already warned that unless the strike ends in a few days it will not have time to get services back to normal by Christmas.Delevoye has said he will pay back the money, totalling more than €120,000 (£100,000) since September 2017."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e3887ebd1da7e8037ecb2085f7d643ff2fc41cc3/0_263_4828_2897/master/4828.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0b7da2fdeb1d9f9df85cc4790e891e9d","title":"israeli military law stifles palestinian rights watchdog says","story":"Many of the restrictions were announced in early days of occupation of West BankPalestinians in the West Bank are still being prosecuted under military orders that were designed to keep the peace in the early days of an occupation and that have stifled civil rights in the territory for more than 50 years, a watchdog group says.The report was the last to be researched by the group’s Israel director, Omar Shakir, before he was deported from the country in November for his alleged support of a boycott campaign.It says sites of protests are often suddenly declared to be “closed military zones”, meaning anyone who fails to immediately disperse can be arrested. The Israeli army convicted 4,519 people for failing to obey this order in the five years to June 2019.Many of the laws are broadly worded, the paper says, such as military order 101, which prohibits any gathering of more than 10 people “in which a speech is made on a political subject, or which may be construed as political, or to discuss such a subject,” unless permission is granted by a military commander. An Israeli lawyer told HRW that she knew of no case where such permission had been sought or granted.“Israeli military law in place for 52 years bars Palestinians in the West Bank from such basic freedoms as waving flags, peacefully protesting the occupation, joining all major political movements and publishing political material,” said Sarah Leah Whitson, the group’s executive director for the region.“These orders give the army carte blanche to prosecute anyone who organises politically, speaks out or even reports the news in ways that displease the army.”Many of the restrictions were announced in the early days of Israel’s occupation of the West Bank from June 1967, a period in which jurists generally argue that international law permits certain rights to be suspended for the preservation of public order.But HRW cites the Red Cross and the arguments of the Israeli government to argue the law holds that these rights must be expanded over time. “Suspending these rights for a week or month interrupts public life, but suspension for decades fundamentally distorts it,” the report says.In contrast to Palestinians, Jewish settlers in the West Bank are governed by Israel’s more robust civil liberties regime, meaning people can live in the same neighbourhood but have entirely different rights to protest or express their opinions.“Nothing can justify today’s reality where in some places people on one side of the street enjoy civil rights while those on the other side do not,” Whitson said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/400002a7f94d838ec9f6d1a9e1dbee7dcc2a6da8/300_350_2564_1538/master/2564.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2d8158ee306c48196046bf6a6d49b847","title":"jacques chirac remembered by francois hollande","story":"29 November 1932 – 26 September 2019The former French president was a fierce opponent who never gave up on his beliefs, says one of his successors at the Elysée• Magenta Devine remembered by Tony James• Read the Observer’s obituaries of 2019 in fullHow could I forget our first meeting? It was in June 1981, and Mitterrand had just been elected to the Elysée. I was running against Jacques Chirac in the parliamentary elections in his fief of Ussel, in the Corrèze. I was only 27 years old, and he had already been prime minister of France. I challenged him in one of his meetings, from the back of the room. He looked at me with a mixture of condescension and curiosity. We did not know that we would both have a presidential destiny.Ten years later, we were both members of parliament for the department of Corrèze. He had just lost the presidential election, having been challenged within his own party. To my great surprise, I found him at peace, convinced that his time would come again. He spoke of our home region where life was good. Even as mayor of Paris, he never failed to recall his rural roots, which played an important role in his presidential victory of May 1995.In 1997, as the first secretary of the Socialist party, I was the leader of the opposition. I didn’t spare him. During a ceremony at the Elysée, Chirac took me to one side and, almost affectionately, said quietly: “You are hard on me, but I did not spare François Mitterrand. I know what has to be done in the political battle, but I appreciate that you respect me, as I always did with my predecessor.”In 2002, I appealed for people to vote for Chirac to beat Jean-Marie Le Pen. Never before had a victory hurt him so much. He was president, but he knew that he had only been chosen by default.In January 2005, before the referendum on the European Constitutional treaty, he confided in me. “You convinced the Socialists to vote in favour. I know it was not easy for you. You should know that for the Maastricht treaty, when I supported the ‘yes’, I was booed for the first time by the party I had founded. That day, however, I knew that I would become president because I had chosen the interest of my country over that of my party.”This is a lesson that does not just apply to France.During the 12 years he led France, Jacques always had a good word for a friend, a pat on the back for an ordinary citizen, a hug for a child. I saw him more often after he left the Elysée, when I had the opportunity to discover his scholarship and curiosity for the tribal arts, Asian civilisations and Africa. He would talk of America, a country with which he had forged an affectionate bond but not one that allowed him to follow it into the war in Iraq.After 2012, he looked at political life with a combination of amusement and sadness. I saw him decline physically and slow down, he who had always been a man of action.Chirac was a fighter he could be tough with his friends, fierce with his opponents, unwavering in his convictions. What was important to him was that things should move, change rather than the direction that change took. He had faced confrontation so many times. In the storms he had held firm. He wanted to see out a destiny he had not necessarily imagined for himself, right to the end. He had dreamed of being an officer in the merchant navy before politics took hold of him. He succeeded in becoming president, at the very time when many of his friends had abandoned him. What the young hussar had not been able to conquer, the wise republican had snatched with both hands. He was less interested in power than in its conquest.Jacques sacrificed much of his personal life to devote himself to others that is the hardness and greatness of politics. I did not share his ideas or his choices, but we always agreed on what was essential: the rejection of intolerance and respect for human dignity. Jacques was like the French he embraced their contradictions and moods he was bold in speech and prudent in his actions, promising more than he could give, but not giving up on the causes that were close to his heart. He had panache. What the British think of as pride, we French consider to be character.He succeeded in being unpopular when in power and loved as soon as he gave it up, because when the statesman leaves his palace, he becomes a man once again. And in the end, it is the man who is judged."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/11fad7b135c811da795affd06f452afd012de01b/0_266_1312_787/master/1312.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=550fafe65b33cf69351f09ebd6d4e4c6","title":"stephen cottrell appointed archbishop of york","story":"Bishop of Chelmsford, who will take over from John Sentamu, popular for straight talkingThe Church of England must be “more joyful and less anxious”, Stephen Cottrell, who has been named the 98th archbishop of York, the second most senior figure in the Church of England, has said.Cottrell, 61, the bishop of Chelmsford, will replace John Sentamu, who is retiring next year. Popular within the church for his down-to-earth persona and straight-talking, Cottrell was brought up in Essex, attended a state school and studied at the Polytechnic of Central London.He told a press conference in Church House, Westminster: “I’m a boy from a very ordinary family, from a secondary modern school in Essex, who is now called to be the archbishop of York.” There “wasn’t much church in my growing up”, he said, but watching the film Jesus of Nazareth at the age of 12 “changed my life”. Sentamu’s retirement means the loss of the C of E’s most high-profile figure from a black or minority ethnic background. In the past, Cottrell has publicly criticised the church for its shortcomings in promoting BAME clergy into senior positions.On Tuesday, he said: “Our record is not good, there’s no point in pretending otherwise. This is something that matters hugely to me. I hope that when I do hang up my mitre, the church will look different and more erse.”He said he anticipated that “one day” the church would have a female archbishop of Canterbury.Reflecting on last week’s election results, Cottrell said the UK was standing “on the edge of great change as we leave the European Union” and there were “many challenges ahead”.He added: “Learning how to live sustainably on this earth is the greatest challenge of all … We must be one nation but also one world, one humanity.”The scale of Conservative victory had taken the country by surprise. The church had a “particular responsibility to speak for the poorest and most marginalised. That is not always easy or comfortable,” he added. “There is a north-south ide that is shockingly real.”Asked about the issue of same-sex relationships, which has ided the church for more than 20 years, he said there was “absolutely no place for homophobia in our church, and absolutely everyone, regardless of their sexuality, is welcome in our church”.Among the issues on which Cottrell has spoken out is nuclear weapons. In 2016, he told a rally in London the renewal of Trident was “an affront to God”, and last year, he told the synod there were “no circumstances” in which Trident’s use could be justified given the destruction the weapons would cause.In April, he was among 25 priests and bishops who opposed a service at Westminster Abbey marking 50 years of constant patrols by the UK’s nuclear deterrent. “It is impossible not to view this service as appearing also to celebrate the weapons themselves,” he said.He has also called on the church to make land available for Gypsies and travelling communities who face institutional racism and ostracisation. The Christian imperative was to combat racism in all its forms, he said. “Therefore it is incumbent upon the church to take a lead on this issue, providing a voice for those who are so marginalised and discriminated against.”Describing himself as an optimist and a “preacherman”, Cottrell said he was “humbled and excited” by his appointment. Justin Welby, the archbishop of Canterbury, said at the press conference Cottrell was “one of the most inspiring leaders in the church. He preaches, he writes beautifully, he writes poetry, he thinks very deeply, he communicates superbly, he is not hierarchical, he’s got a huge heart that is open to the needy and poor and vulnerable. He’s a pastor.”Sentamu said Cottrell had “the gospel in his belly and a tiger in the tank. His nomination as my successor has gladdened my heart and he can rely on my prayers.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1468ec32e2df3020a758c848b949b7b79d1e8c9/0_170_2464_1478/master/2464.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5e17659e75fbf93477b97459f4c4c5d6","title":"help us locate benin bronze statues in the uk","story":"We would like to start locating these objects and mapping their journeys to Britain – and we need your helpJesus College Cambridge has agreed to return a Benin bronze statue to Nigeria, after it was taken by British colonial forces from the country in the late nineteenth century.The artefact is set to be one of the first Benin bronzes returned to Nigeria, after thousands were stolen from Benin City in a punitive 1897 expedition by British forces.The decision to return the artefact comes after increasing scrutiny of the origins of our museum collections, and a growing movement to repatriate objects taken from former British colonies.Objects in national collections including the British Museum and the V\u0026ampA cannot be returned to their countries of origin because they are protected by the Heritage Act.

Those are the lucky ones and those who shop around. There are others who have been penalised by their insurers by even more than that.Glenna Gallagher from Dublin 24 assiduously shops around for car insurance every year, and keeps track of what she pays on an excel spread sheet. The cars she drives are always modest and have never cost more than €5,000. Her mileage is low. “My car insurance was at its lowest in 2008-9 and been rising ever since,” she says. In that year she paid €306.47 for a fully comprehensive policy. Her most recent policy cost her €551. “It seems very random, and it’s very hard to know what is behind the price increases. I don’t know if it’s the insurance companies who have money or if there is something like a cartel operating in places. I do know there is definitely a lack of transparency. “It’s an absolute shocker, though. I am being asked to pay more than €500 for car insurance when I don’t know if my car is even worth that any more.” Christine Mulrooney paid €220 for her comprehensive car insurance 10 years ago and last January she paid €572.89. “I’m 41 and have a full licence since I was 19. I have never made a claim, never had any penalty points. Never had a speeding fine. No accidents. I have never even been stopped by the guards.She describes it as “just mad”, and says she can find “no explanation for it”. She could have ended up paying out even more than €572.“Every year I shop around, and last year I switched provider and saved almost €200. I am convinced we are being ripped off.

The figures were contained in a recent report “Urban and Rural Life in Ireland 2019” published by the CSO on Monday.The report compared various measures such as income, education, health and age between six different areas: Cities, satellite urban towns, independent urban towns, rural areas with high urban influence, rural areas with moderate urban influence, and remote rural areas.The report found the areas with the highest average age (41) were remote rural areas, and the youngest areas were satellite urban towns with an average age of 34.More than a third of people living in cities had a third level degree compared to 18 per cent of those in remote rural areas.Over half of the population of Kildare and Wicklow lived in satellite urban towns, which were defined as towns of less than 50,000 people where a fifth of residents worked in a nearby city.Leitrim had the most people living in areas classed as remote at 69 per cent, followed by Donegal at 41 per cent.Independent urban towns, where less than 20 per cent of inhabitants worked in a city, had the highest unemployment rate at 6.3 per cent.

File photograph: GettyThe Cabinet will on Tuesday be asked to approve an unprecedented redundancy scheme for senior gardaí that aims to remove 30 senior officers in order to pave the way for a restructuring of the force’s senior ranks. Restructuring of the Garda Síochána will see the abolition of 30 senior posts at superintendent, chief superintendent and assistant commissioner levels and the scheme will allow senior officers at these ranks to retire before the maximum retirement age of 60. They will receive six months’ salary in addition to normal pension and lump-sum entitlements. Gardaí are generally entitled to a pension of half of final salary plus a lump sum of 150 per cent final salary after 30 years of service. The scheme is expected to be rolled out quickly, with a closing date at the end of January. Departures will take effect beginning April 2020 and it is expected to cost €6.5 million next year. However it is unclear how many senior gardaí will take up the package. The plan was originally to seek 50 early retirements but a decision was taken in recent months to put forward a more modest plan. Garda sources say a small number of superintendents and chief superintendents in high-pressure posts, such as urban areas with high crime rates, are likely to eagerly take up the package. Other senior gardaí who have recently made it known they are unhappy with Garda Commissioner Drew Harris’s management style – which is more formal than his predecessors – may also be likely targets. However many of the gardaí, especially those at chief superintendent rank and above, are likely to remain on in the hope of future promotion. Sensitive timeThe initiative comes at a sensitive time for Mr Harris who is currently dealing with a backlash from chief superintendents unhappy with the fast pace of Garda reform, especially in the area of civilianisation of the force. Ministers will meet at Government Buildings for a Cabinet meeting with a packed agenda, sources say. It is understood that among the agenda items are requests for extra money for a variety of spending programmes to be included in the revised spending estimates for next year.

Photograph: Alan BetsonThe Central Bank has revealed insurance companies are making large profits from rising premiums while the cost of claims is falling, contradicting insurance industry claims and sparking fresh demands for Government action.The cost of motor insurance claims fell by 2.5 per cent in the last decade but premiums rose by 42 per cent, according to a Central Bank report which also revealed that insurers made an average of 9 per cent profit last year.Minister for Justice Charlie Flanagan said he was “disappointed but not surprised” at the findings, and added that a “large part of the insurance problem is due to excessive profit-taking” by the industry.Sinn Féin finance spokesman Pearse Doherty described the findings as a shocking indictment of the insurance industry, and criticised the Government for peddling the misinformation campaign of the insurance industry.Fianna Fáil’s finance spokesman Michael McGrath said the Government’s reform efforts were moving at “a snail’s pace”.The report, published on Monday, is the Central Bank’s first comprehensive study of premiums and cost claims and it appears to cast doubt on long-standing industry claims that the higher cost of car insurance is the result of spiralling payouts and increased claims, resulting in low profitability.It found the average cost of claims per policy fell by 2.5 per cent from €437 to €426 between 2009 and 2018 while average premiums jumped by 42 per cent from €498 to €706.DisparityThe disparity is even starker when looking at the last five years. The report found that while the average cost of claims per policy rose by 14 per cent between 2013 and 2018 average premiums rose by 62 per cent.The report also revealed that the industry here generated an average operating profit of 9 per cent last year, nearly twice the level of profitability seen in the UK.“It appears that insurers engaged in underpricing in the early part of this decade and then increased premiums beyond levels that were needed to cover losses over parts of the period, particularly between 2014 and 2017, and are now making significant profits as a result,” he said.Responding to the findings, Insurance Ireland, the umbrella group for insurers, said the 10 years of motor claims data published today shows personal injury and damage inflation is the main challenge for the sector.“The 10 years of data shows falling costs for motorists up to 2013 but the industry became loss-making and this peaked in 2014,” Insurance Ireland chief executive Gerry Hassett said.“The industry was loss-making at this time and was impacted by increasing injury and damage claims costs, lower interest rate returns and the disruptive effects of failures like Setanta Insurance,” he said.“As these trends increased from 2013 onwards, insurers had to provision for the inflation in injury and damage claims evident in the market and settlement times for claims of up to 4½ years,” Mr Hassett said."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4117899.1576586024!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"proposed uk law to prevent brexit extension strange says coveney","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tLegislation proposed by British prime minister Boris Johnson to outlaw any extension of the next phase of Brexit negotiations past 2020 has been described as “strange” by Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney. File Photograph: David YoungPA Wire Legislation proposed by British prime minister Boris Johnson to outlaw any extension of the next phase of Brexit negotiations past 2020 has been described as “strange” by Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney. The upcoming phase of Brexit transition negotiations will focus on Britain’s future relationship with the European Union, dealing with issues such as the trade relationship, security issues and fishing rights. It was agreed Britain would remain in the EU for a transition period while these issues were worked out. The Withdrawal Agreement, the name given to the Brexit deal agreed in October, allows for an option to extend the transition period for a further two years if required. Downing Street sources recently briefed British media on plans to outlaw extending the negotiations and to fully exit the EU in 2020, as one of the Conservative Party’s first actions under the new Commons majority it commands following the UK election last week. ScepticismHowever key EU figures – including chief negotiator Michel Barnier – have expressed scepticism a deal can be agreed in time, raising the fresh prospect of a no-deal break unless there is an extension.The European Union will have to limit talks on its future relationship with the United Kingdom to avoiding another cliff-edge, a senior EU official said on Tuesday, after Britain confirmed it would definitely leave the bloc by the end of 2020. “Given all the signals . . . we are well advised to take seriously that the UK does not intend to go for an extension of the transition and we need to be prepared for that,” said Sabine Weyand, director-general of the EU’s trade department. “That means in the negotiations we have to look at those issues where failing to reach an agreement by 2020 would lead to another cliff-edge situation,” she told a European Policy Centre think tank seminar. Ms Weyand said the European Commission was ready to start negotiations very quickly after Britain formally left the EU on January 31st and was very clear about its priorities. Any duty-free, quota-free deal would need to be accompanied with guarantees of a level playing field in areas such as state aid and competition, environmental and labour law and taxation. A No 10 source said: “Last week the public voted for a government that would get Brexit done and move this country forward – and that’s exactly what we intend to do starting this week.“Our manifesto made clear that we will not extend the implementation period and the new Withdrawal Agreement Bill will legally prohibit the government agreeing to any extension.”Speaking on Tuesday, Mr Coveney described the move as a “strange decision” and one that would see the “UK deciding to tie itself in terms of options”.“Nobody is forcing the UK to apply for an extended transition period but they have the option to do it if they want to up until the middle of next summer, and what Boris Johnson is doing is essentially ruling out an option that was put into the Withdrawal Agreement for Britain,” he said. Brexit logjamThe previous Brexit logjam was resolved in October following concessions by the British side to agree to an effective border down the Irish Sea in the exit deal, a previous red line fiercely opposed by the Democratic Unionist Party. Mr Coveney said the EU will approach the next phase of talks on the future relationship to “try to move as quickly as we can,” he told reporters. “We all know that the negotiations post a British exit from the EU is going to be very complicated, it’s going to deal with multiple areas, not just a free trade agreement, it has also got to deal with security, data, fishing. There are multiple sectors which will require detailed negotiations,” he said. Elsewhere, a Seanad report on the UK’s withdrawal from the EU has urged the EU to show patience and flexibility with the UK in the next phase of the Brexit process.The Seanad Select Committee expects negotiations on a future EU-UK relationship to be “long and complicated”, despite the ambitious timetable of the British government to conclude talks in 10 months. It has been recommended to the committee that UK domestic legislation be amended to transpose the Belfast Agreement into law.Although the committee concedes its cannot force the UK’s hand, members hope upon reading the report, the Taoiseach and the EU Commission could make the suggestion to Mr Johnson’s government.The law change would remedy what is seen as “unequal citizenship” due to lack of clarification on retained EU legal rights, which may only apply to those who identify as Irish, which is contrary to the Belfast Agreement. Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches. See more here.

Photograph: Francisco SecoAP PhotoEstonia apologised to Finland on Monday after Estonia’s interior minister mocked Finland’s new prime minister – the world’s youngest-serving government leader – as ‘a sales girl’ and questioned her ability to run the Nordic country.Mart Helme (70) Estonian interior minister and leader of the populist far-right party Ekre, on Sunday ridiculed Finnish prime minister Sanna Marin, 34, and her government, in which four out of five coalition leaders are women under 35.“Now we see how one sales girl has become a prime minister and how some other street activists and non-educated people have also joined the cabinet,” Mr Helme said on his party’s radio talk show.His comments prompted the opposition to call for his resignation, while Estonian president Kersti Kaljulaid asked Finland’s president Sauli Niinisto to pass on her apologies to Ms Marin and her government.Social Democrat Marin, who has spoken about growing up in a disadvantaged family, worked as a cashier before studying at university and embarking on a political career.“I’m extremely proud of Finland. Here a poor family’s child can educate themselves and achieve their goals in life. A cashier can become even a prime minister,” Ms Marin wrote on Twitter.Mr Helme, a former Estonian ambassador to Russia, is known for outspoken statements that regularly embarrass Estonian prime minister Juri Ratas and his Centre Party, Ekre’s coalition partner.Ekre was accepted for the first time into a government coalition in April, after Mr Ratas lost parliamentary elections but clinched a deal with Ekre to stay in power.Estonian opposition leader Kaja Kallas said on Monday the opposition would organise a no-confidence vote in parliament if Mr Helme does not resign after his comments about Finland’s new leaders. Previous such attempts have failed.“The interior minister has offended the Finnish government and personally attacked the newly-appointed Finnish prime minister,” she said in a statement. –Reuters"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons december 2019","story":"To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2018 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178.Brexit latest news: Boris Johnson tells his \u0026#39People\u0026#39s Cabinet\u0026#39 they must work 24 hours a day to deliver election promisesGideon Saar launches bid to unseat Netanyahu as leader of Likud PartyTeenager who stabbed lawyer outside a Greggs with screwdriver he had just stolen jailed for 15 yearsFrom the Russian Concorde to the Christmas Bullet – the groundbreaking aircraft models that failedComment: Boris Johnson\u0026#39s 2020 deadline shows he is laying down the law on BrexitPope Francis scraps \u0026#39pontifical secret\u0026#39 rule used in clergy sex abuse casesScott Morrison criticised for taking \u0026#39holiday\u0026#39 while over 100 fires blaze across New South WalesSuspected killer of British businessman arrested in ArgentinaWho is new Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle - and how did he vote on Brexit?What next after the election?

Wetherspoon\u0026nbsphas doubled in value since then,\u0026nbspadding more than £250m\u0026nbspto Mr Martin’s personal wealth.Earlier this week, Wetherspoon\u0026nbspalso announced plans to invest more than £200m in pubs and hotels over the next four years, creating around 10,000 jobs.New pubs and hotels will be opened, and existing pubs across the UK and Republic of Ireland will be enlarged.Most of the investment will be channelled into developments in small and medium-sized towns, but will also include larger towns and cities.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Among applicants holding five offers of places from universities, including one “conditional unconditional” offer, just 20.6 per cent chose to accept the “conditional unconditional” place, compared to 25.6 per cent in 2014.University ditches unconditional offers in bid to ‘maintain standards’‘Unconditional offers could lead to drop in top A-level grades’Unconditional offers may mean A-level students take ‘foot off the gas’Clare Marchant, chief executive of Ucas, said: “Students are considering their offers more carefully than ever, with the type of offer they receive having less of an impact than before.”She added: “Unconditional offers remain a complex issue and our new insight will further inform the dialogue, forming a crucial contribution to the current admissions practice reviews.“Their impact on attainment needs to be highlighted, though this must be seen alongside their role in widening participation activities and benefits to students’ mental health.”Alistair Jarvis, chief executive of Universities UK (UUK), said: “While there are clear benefits in universities being able to use a variety of offer making practices to reflect an inidual student’s circumstances, potential and the context of their application, it is important they are used appropriately and proportionately.“An important principle of the UK system is that universities decide independently which students they accept but with this comes a responsibility to ensure that the admissions system continues to work in the best interests of students.”He added that the evidence and views of applicants towards predicted grades, unconditional offers and post-qualification admissions will be looked at as part of the admissions review by UUK.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Whether it’s Alexandre Desplat’s music, the eye-popping colours or the mannered but brilliant performances, all the elements here are perfectly judged. A film that could easily have seemed flimsy and conceited is instead utterly enrapturing. GMSteve McQueen’s harrowing period drama confronts audiences with the reality of slavery. Racist white owners treat their slaves as if they’re livestock, not human beings. Chiwetel Ejiofor excels as Solomon Northup, the free man sold into slavery.

Son of SaulIn \u0027Son of Saul\u0027 Geza Rohrig plays a Hungarian-Jewish prisoner tasked with the extermination of his fellow JewsLady Bird – and its story of a frustrated teen (Saoirse Ronan)AWWes Anderson’s kitsch yarn, largely set in a luxurious spa hotel just before the Second World War, is an elegy for a lost world. Whether it’s Alexandre Desplat’s music, the eye-popping colours or the mannered but brilliant performances, all the elements here are perfectly judged. A film that could easily have seemed flimsy and conceited is instead utterly enrapturing. GMSteve McQueen’s harrowing period drama confronts audiences with the reality of slavery. Racist white owners treat their slaves as if they’re livestock, not human beings. Chiwetel Ejiofor excels as Solomon Northup, the free man sold into slavery. The film has a furious polemical charge but also works as a terrifying Kafkaesque drama about a man who falls off the face of the world. GM3141 11.

But the focus of the imags is the bright blue centre of the image, which was taken by the Hubble Space Telescope as it tracked the comet through space.The picture shows the comet on its way through our solar system as it makes its way back into the interstellar space where it once flew.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines2IBorisov was first spotted in August by a Crimean amateur astronomer who would give it its name, and caused a flurry of excitement across the world. Scientists quickly determined that it was the second interstellar object known to have visited our solar system, after the famous \u0027Oumuamua, and the first comet.Since then, scientists have been taking images of the comet as it moves nearer to the Earth and can be seen in better detail. The first observations from Hubble came in October, and the new images come from November and December, offering a better look at the size and other details of the visitor.When this image was taken, the object was 326 million kilometres from Earth. Scientists can now use it and other observations to learn more about the comet.Scientists finally decide on real identity of OumuamuaHubble gives us the best measure of the size of comet Borisov\u0027s nucleus, which is the really important part of the comet, said David Jewitt, a professor of planetary science and astronomy at the University of California Los Angeles, whose team has captured the best and sharpest images of this first interstellar comet.Surprisingly, our Hubble images show that its nucleus is more than 15 times smaller than earlier investigations suggested it might be. The radius is smaller than half a kilometre. This is important because knowing the size helps us to determine the total number, and mass, of such objects in the Solar System, and in the Milky Way. Borisov is the first known interstellar comet, and we would like to know how many others there are.Scientists now expect to see other interstellar objects, and compare those with the two mysterious objects they have already been able to see.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Its stars were not formed in one continuous process, they say – but instead in a bright flash that lit up the galaxy.Our unprecedented survey of a large part of the Galactic centre has given us detailed insights into the formation process of stars in this region of the Milky Way, says\u0026nbspRainer\u0026nbspSchödel\u0026nbspfrom the Institute of Astrophysics of Andalusia in Granada, Spain, who led the observations.Contrary to what had been accepted up to now, we found that the formation of stars has not been continuous, adds Francisco\u0026nbspNogueras-Lara, who led two new studies of the Milky Way central region while at the same institute in Granada.In the study, researchers found that roughly 80 per cent of the stars in our Milky Way were formed during its earliest years, between about eight and 13.5 billion years ago. After that came about six billions years during which very few stars were born.Nasa announces first results from spacecraft sent to \u0027touch the sun\u0027But that quiet period was brought to a dramatic close with a crescendo of star formation, roughly a billion years ago, when stars with a mass of up to a few tens of million Suns formed in its centre over the course of just 100 million years.That area is now relatively quiet, birthing stars at a rate of one or two of our own Suns each year. But the new observations from the European Southern Observatory\u0027s Very Large Telescope (VLT) allowed to look at it and peer into its path, and how it would have looked in its past.The conditions in the studied region during this burst of activity must have resembled those in \u0027starburst\u0027 galaxies, which form stars at rates of more than 100 solar masses per year, said\u0026nbspNogueras-Lara, who is now based at the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Heidelberg, Germany, in a statement.This burst of activity, which must have resulted in the explosion of more than a hundred thousand supernovae, was probably one of the most energetic events in the whole history of the Milky Way.This newly understood period was not simply a flurry of births but of deaths, too. The massive stars that are born in a starburst live for less time than lower-mass stars, dying much sooner in spectacular supernova explosions.The new discoveries were accompanied by a spectacular picture of the Milky Way\u0027s central region, and both relied on new capabilities of the ESO\u0027s\u0026nbspmost famous telescope. New instruments allowed the researchers to look through the dust and gas that surrounds the region, and pick up new details that had never been seen before.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But they can’t make up s*** about me – and if they do, I have to take it to the courts.”Created with Sketch.Big beasts lose their seats: Prominent MPs gone in election Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.310 Anna Soubry - The Independent Group for ChangeLeader of The Independent Group for Change, formerly Conservative MP, Anna Soubry lost her Broxtowe seat, coming third behind the winning Conservatives and LabourProminent Remain-backing MP Grieve lost the contest for Beaconsfield, coming second to the Conservatives, his former partyLuciana Berger lost the contest for Finchley and Golders Green, coming second to Conservative Mike FreerProminent Corbyn ally Laura Pidcock lost her Durham North West seat to Conservative Richard HoldenProminent anti-Brexit MP Chukka Umunna lost the contest for the Cities of London \u0026amp Westminster, coming second to Conservative Nickie AikenFormer candidate for Mayor of London Zac Goldsmith lost his Richmond Park seat to Liberal Democrat Sarah OlneyFormer leader of the DUP Nigel Dodds lost his Belfast North seat to Sinn FeinLabour MP Gareth Snell lost his Stoke-on-Trent central seat to the Conservatives310 Anna Soubry - The Independent Group for ChangeLeader of The Independent Group for Change, formerly Conservative MP, Anna Soubry lost her Broxtowe seat, coming third behind the winning Conservatives and LabourProminent Remain-backing MP Grieve lost the contest for Beaconsfield, coming second to the Conservatives, his former partyLuciana Berger lost the contest for Finchley and Golders Green, coming second to Conservative Mike FreerProminent Corbyn ally Laura Pidcock lost her Durham North West seat to Conservative Richard HoldenProminent anti-Brexit MP Chukka Umunna lost the contest for the Cities of London \u0026amp Westminster, coming second to Conservative Nickie AikenFormer candidate for Mayor of London Zac Goldsmith lost his Richmond Park seat to Liberal Democrat Sarah OlneyFormer leader of the DUP Nigel Dodds lost his Belfast North seat to Sinn FeinLabour MP Gareth Snell lost his Stoke-on-Trent central seat to the ConservativesMs Flint said that Putney and Canterbury – two Labour seats in the south – were not a fair exchange for the dozens of northern seats that had been lost to Boris Johnson.The party had “gone too much towards the metropolitan cities and university towns and away from these core areas and it breaks my heart”, she warned.And she said: “I don’t believe anybody who has been the architects of our European policy in the last few years is credible to be leader.

After returning to her home having witnessed the destruction of her husband (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II), who was revealed to be the blue god Dr Manhattan in episode seven, Angela Abar\u0026nbsp(Regina King) begins to clean up a broken pack of eggs on her kitchen floor.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesRemembering a line Dr Manhattan said to her in the previous episode – “Watch the eggs” – she opens the box to find one intact and remembers\u0026nbspthe very first conversation they had, 10 years previous.In that chat, Dr Manhattan matter-of-factly told an unconvinced Angela that he could transfer his powers to another via, for example, an egg. He says that if somebody swallowed that egg whole, they would theoretically be able to “walk on water”.Created with Sketch.The 30 best TV shows of the decade Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Few dead horses have been more flogged, but if you stretch your mind back enough, it is possible to remember a series with a fantastic premise that kept us guessing for 12 whole episodes. The question: had returning war hero Sgt Brody (Damian Lewis) been radicalised in a foreign jail cell? CIA officer Carrie Mathison (Claire Danes) thought so, but she had plenty of problems of her own. I still think it would have been better if he\u0027d detonated at the denouement. Twisty, compelling, briefly essential. (EC)The slow-burning relationship between Cathy (Lesley Manville), a widow and mother of superhuman forbearance, and her late husband’s best pal Michael (Peter Mullan) elevated what could have been a run-of-the-mill suburban comedy into a beautifully composed portrait of friendship, grief and mid-life romance. (FS)Hulu’s adaptation of Margaret Atwood’s 1985 novel, set in a pious patriarchal state, lost its way in the second series, but the first, which arrived a few months after Trump entered the White House, was a triumph. As Offred, Elisabeth Moss seethed under her mask of impassivity, while the rich palette gave us a dystopian nightmare as imagined by the 17th-century Dutch school. (FS)Perhaps the trashiest show on this list, but trash of the highest grade, Money Heist is Netflix\u0027s most popular non-English series, a hit across Europe and South America, with 34m accounts watching this year\u0027s Part 3 in its first week of release. A mysterious mastermind known as The Professor gathers together a crew of misfit criminals to execute a robbery on the Royal Mint in Spain. Tense, funny, clever and often completely preposterous, La Casa del Papel has only been held back by its off-putting English title. (EC)530 26. Rick and Morty (2013- ) It unfortunately inspired some of the worst fans on the internet, but that shouldn\u0027t detract from Rick and Morty\u0027s inventiveness. Ostensibly a parody of Back to the Future, about the adventures of a young boy and his alcoholic, mad scientist grandfather, the cartoon uses its set-up to put its heroes in an endless number of frenetic, frequently insane situations. Blink and you miss a gag and two pop-culture references. (EC)This exquisite French series is about the dead trying to return to their old lives in a secluded mountain town dispensed with the usual gory zombie tropes, instead dwelling on the human instincts of these confused beings – specifically their desire to love and be loved ­– and the grief experienced by those they left behind. (FS)Sharon Horgan and Rob Delaney were a masterful double act in this sitcom about a holiday fling resulting in an unplanned pregnancy. The pair’s attempts to build a life together yielded scabrous gags about sex and post-partum leakage, a cameo from the late Carrie Fisher and an underlying tenderness that resisted spilling into sentimentality. (FS)A wicked cocktail of comedy and humanity, shock and gore, the first series of Killing Eve, written by Phoebe Waller-Bridge, was a subversive joy. Sandra Oh and Jodie Comer played, respectively, a spy and an assassin whose continental game of cat-and-mouse was a blood-spattered love story for the ages. Sadly, when Waller-Bridge handed off writing duties in the second series, the magic wasn\u0027t quite the same. (FS)The Killing may have started the Scandi craze, but it aired in Denmark in 2007, so it doesn\u0027t count for these purposes. Borgen was everything The West Wing wasn\u0027t: a cliché-resistant drama that showed politics in grating reality, with plenty of plausible schemers in slick outfits and a wonderful central performance by Sidse Babett Knudsen as Birgitte Nyborg, the Prime Minister trying to balance principles with power. (EC)Following the exploits of Lance (Toby Jones) and Andy (Mackenzie Crook), dedicated treasure hunters and members of the Danebury Metal Detecting Club, Detectorists was about people and their passions, community and camaraderie. It’s a wonderfully tranquil meditation on male companionship. (FS)Where other series burn brightly and fade after a couple of years, FX\u0027s Cold War spy drama took its time. Matthew Rhys and Kerri Russell, married in real life, shone as the Russian couple working as spies in suburban Washington DC. The tension built over six seasons to a magnificent finale, rewarding those who stuck with it. (EC)The premise is one of the most intriguing in television: people struggling to come to terms with something called the Sudden Departure, a mysterious event in whichtwo per cent of the world\u0027s population simply disappeared. Damon Lindelof and Tom Perrotta\u0027s drama received iffy reviews at first, but its reputation grew through its second and final outings, with writing and performances that explored the full depth of the setup without losing the pervasive air of mystery. (EC)The third series is a noticeable drop-off in quality, but for two series The Crown achieved a number of unexpected feats. It made viewers genuinely interested in the Royal Family, and not in a Prince Andrew should they go to prison? kind of way. With sumptuous sets and costumes and some excellent performances, especially Claire Foy as the young monarch, this remains the high-water mark of Netflix polish – proof that money can, sometimes, buy you love. (EC)Reports of the death of TV’s baking behemoth have been greatly exaggerated: despite host departures, a channel move and the off-screen antics of a certain perma-tanned judge, this big-hearted competition in which friendships are forged and adults weep over sagging soufflés remains the ultimate feel-good reality show. (FS)Two men bicker over bottles of fine wine. Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon’s low-key, semi-improvised and implausibly funny tours of high-end European restaurants saw the pair’s insecurities deliciously laid bare as they discussed sex, ageing and ambition. Michael Winterbottom directed. (FS)This Yorkshire-set, Bafta-festooned series gave us Catherine Cawood (Sarah Lancashire), a pleasingly complex, no-nonsense police sergeant up to her neck in rapists, murderers, addicts and the odd ailing sheep, together with some superbly earthy dialogue courtesy of writer Sally Wainwright. (FS)Without Girls there is no Fleabag or Adam Driver, and it would probably merit inclusion on those two facts alone. But Lena Dunham now attracts as much opprobrium as praise, and it\u0027s easy to forget how new her breakthrough comedy felt in its naturalistic depiction of young women in New York. This was Sex and the City for people who spent more time on Instagram than at work, created by people the same age as those they were portraying. Its look and feel have cast a long shadow. (EC)Witty, inventive and dazzling to look at, Steven Moffatt and Mark Gatiss’s relocation of the Arthur Conan Doyle stories to the present day worked beautifully, as did the casting of Benedict Cumberbatch as the “high-functioning sociopath” Holmes and Martin Freeman as the put-upon army veteran Watson. While later series would drift, the first three were unbeatable. (FS)A five-part drama about a nuclear disaster in 1986 is not the most promising prospect for a night in with a bottle of wine. It is a tribute to the writer, Craig Mazin, and director, Johan Renck, as well as its cast, especially Jared Harris, that Chernobyl managed to be totally gripping, with frequent moments of stark, horrendous beauty. (EC)At first, the musician and comedian Donald Glover\u0027s series about struggling rappers in Atlanta looked like a familiar, safe kind of sitcom about loveable losers. But it quickly evolved into something fresh: a smart, occasionally surreal examination of life at the margins of America, whose angry heart never spilled into preachiness or got in the way of the jokes. (EC)Who could have anticipated a dating show in which twenty-somethings sit around in microscopic swimwear would tell us so much about the human condition? Gaslighting, bromances, the complexities of “girl code” – Love Island delved beneath the spray tans and schooled the nation on modern manners. (FS)An electrifying study of addiction, trauma and the corrupting power of privilege, based on the autobiographical books by Edward St Aubyn. Benedict Cumberbatch played the feckless antihero grappling with his past and trying (and mostly failing) to be better than the wretched aristos that raised him. (FS)Ken Burns\u0027s epic 10-part documentary followed up his other conflict opuses, on The Civil War and The War, with a detailed story about Vietnam. Using new interviews from both sides as well as archive footage, the documentary shows in unrelenting detail a catastrophe that unfolded in slow motion. Some critics accused it of underserving the experience of the Vietnamese civilians. But it left viewers in no doubt that not only did the US leadership pursue it long after it was a lost cause, but they knew from the start it was unwinnable. (EC)Charlie Brooker sent every other TV critic, or at least one of them, into a spiral of envy by proving not only that it was possible to cross over into creation, but to do so in style. Black Mirror\u0027s taut near-future tales of techno-dystopia are almost always interesting, even if they sometimes fall short of their ambitions, as with the high-concept recent film, Bandersnatch. The best episodes, like 2016\u0027s tour de force, San Junipero, are gripping examinations of human connection in a world where interactions are increasingly by screens. (EC)The first of the Attenborough documentaries to speak directly of the human impact on the natural world, this kaleidoscopic ocean odyssey provided a visual feast of clam-cracking tuskfish, alien-looking pyrosomes and anthropomorphic ­dolphins, while reminding us how it could all be lost. (FS)Only in a world of Netflix budgets can you imagine a concept as wild as BoJack Horseman’s getting off the ground. It\u0027s a cartoon set in LA, ostensibly a comedy about celebrity, except half the characters, including its lead, are anthropomorphised animals. Halfway through its final season, which has been split into two, its initial zaniness has given way to something darker and more interesting. Lurid colours and visual wit dress one of the most humane explorations of depression, addiction and cycles of abuse. (EC) What began, in its first series, as an enjoyably acid-tongued portrait of modern womanhood became a fully fledged masterpiece in the second. Written by and starring Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Fleabag gave us perfectly calibrated scenes of familial dysfunction and sexual longing – the latter memorably culminating in the Priest’s simple, thrilling instruction: “Kneel.” (FS)The first spin-off series from Shane Meadows’ 2007 film, about a gang of ex-skinheads from the Midlands, was set during the 1986 World Cup, and remains one of the great British dramas, depicting working class lives with humanity and humour. This is England ’88 and ’90 followed, both of them similarly infused with heart and soul. (FS)Said to have been a decade in the making, Succession is worth every minute spent on it. Brian Cox enjoys a dream of a late-career role as Logan Roy, the ageing media tycoon unwilling to relinquish control of his company to any of his ungrateful and talentless children. There\u0027s oblivious eldest son Connor (Alan Ruck), troubled addict Kendall (Jeremy Strong), scheming daughter Shiv (Sarah Snook) and abrasive youngest Roman (Kieran Culkin), along with a host of hangers-on, partners and support staff. None of them seem to have the right stuff. It\u0027s an intriguing set-up, but Succession is lifted by its script, performances, locations, costumes, music and direction, which place it firmly in a tradition of laughing at our rulers, where the mirth comes tempered with the knowledge that these are really the people in charge. (EC)3030 1. Game of Thrones (2011-2019)Yes, the final series went a bit weird. Maybe the final two series. A case could be made that the TV adaptation was never as emotionally resonant when it went beyond George RR Martin\u0027s novels. The final series were only disappointing compared to what had come before, which was a fantasy on an unprecedented scale that managed to be grandiose without slipping into melodrama. An invented universe with necromancers, dragons, magic swords and ice zombies was notable for its plausible realpolitik. At a time when viewing tastes were meant to be becoming more atomised, Game of Thrones was global event TV, which made household names of the Starks, Lannisters and Greyjoys and provided a whole generation of English character actors with a regular income.

While later series would drift, the first three were unbeatable. (FS)A five-part drama about a nuclear disaster in 1986 is not the most promising prospect for a night in with a bottle of wine. It is a tribute to the writer, Craig Mazin, and director, Johan Renck, as well as its cast, especially Jared Harris, that Chernobyl managed to be totally gripping, with frequent moments of stark, horrendous beauty. (EC)At first, the musician and comedian Donald Glover\u0027s series about struggling rappers in Atlanta looked like a familiar, safe kind of sitcom about loveable losers. But it quickly evolved into something fresh: a smart, occasionally surreal examination of life at the margins of America, whose angry heart never spilled into preachiness or got in the way of the jokes. (EC)Who could have anticipated a dating show in which twenty-somethings sit around in microscopic swimwear would tell us so much about the human condition? Gaslighting, bromances, the complexities of “girl code” – Love Island delved beneath the spray tans and schooled the nation on modern manners. (FS)An electrifying study of addiction, trauma and the corrupting power of privilege, based on the autobiographical books by Edward St Aubyn. Benedict Cumberbatch played the feckless antihero grappling with his past and trying (and mostly failing) to be better than the wretched aristos that raised him. (FS)Ken Burns\u0027s epic 10-part documentary followed up his other conflict opuses, on The Civil War and The War, with a detailed story about Vietnam. Using new interviews from both sides as well as archive footage, the documentary shows in unrelenting detail a catastrophe that unfolded in slow motion. Some critics accused it of underserving the experience of the Vietnamese civilians. But it left viewers in no doubt that not only did the US leadership pursue it long after it was a lost cause, but they knew from the start it was unwinnable. (EC)Charlie Brooker sent every other TV critic, or at least one of them, into a spiral of envy by proving not only that it was possible to cross over into creation, but to do so in style. Black Mirror\u0027s taut near-future tales of techno-dystopia are almost always interesting, even if they sometimes fall short of their ambitions, as with the high-concept recent film, Bandersnatch. The best episodes, like 2016\u0027s tour de force, San Junipero, are gripping examinations of human connection in a world where interactions are increasingly by screens. (EC)The first of the Attenborough documentaries to speak directly of the human impact on the natural world, this kaleidoscopic ocean odyssey provided a visual feast of clam-cracking tuskfish, alien-looking pyrosomes and anthropomorphic ­dolphins, while reminding us how it could all be lost. (FS)Only in a world of Netflix budgets can you imagine a concept as wild as BoJack Horseman’s getting off the ground. It\u0027s a cartoon set in LA, ostensibly a comedy about celebrity, except half the characters, including its lead, are anthropomorphised animals. Halfway through its final season, which has been split into two, its initial zaniness has given way to something darker and more interesting. Lurid colours and visual wit dress one of the most humane explorations of depression, addiction and cycles of abuse. (EC) What began, in its first series, as an enjoyably acid-tongued portrait of modern womanhood became a fully fledged masterpiece in the second. Written by and starring Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Fleabag gave us perfectly calibrated scenes of familial dysfunction and sexual longing – the latter memorably culminating in the Priest’s simple, thrilling instruction: “Kneel.” (FS)The first spin-off series from Shane Meadows’ 2007 film, about a gang of ex-skinheads from the Midlands, was set during the 1986 World Cup, and remains one of the great British dramas, depicting working class lives with humanity and humour. This is England ’88 and ’90 followed, both of them similarly infused with heart and soul. (FS)Said to have been a decade in the making, Succession is worth every minute spent on it. Brian Cox enjoys a dream of a late-career role as Logan Roy, the ageing media tycoon unwilling to relinquish control of his company to any of his ungrateful and talentless children. There\u0027s oblivious eldest son Connor (Alan Ruck), troubled addict Kendall (Jeremy Strong), scheming daughter Shiv (Sarah Snook) and abrasive youngest Roman (Kieran Culkin), along with a host of hangers-on, partners and support staff. None of them seem to have the right stuff. It\u0027s an intriguing set-up, but Succession is lifted by its script, performances, locations, costumes, music and direction, which place it firmly in a tradition of laughing at our rulers, where the mirth comes tempered with the knowledge that these are really the people in charge. (EC)3030 1. Game of Thrones (2011-2019)Yes, the final series went a bit weird. Maybe the final two series. A case could be made that the TV adaptation was never as emotionally resonant when it went beyond George RR Martin\u0027s novels. The final series were only disappointing compared to what had come before, which was a fantasy on an unprecedented scale that managed to be grandiose without slipping into melodrama. An invented universe with necromancers, dragons, magic swords and ice zombies was notable for its plausible realpolitik. At a time when viewing tastes were meant to be becoming more atomised, Game of Thrones was global event TV, which made household names of the Starks, Lannisters and Greyjoys and provided a whole generation of English character actors with a regular income. (EC)Angela, grieving the loss of her love, heads to her back garden swimming pool, swallows the egg and, as she lowers her foot to the water, the show ends.When asked whether he intended the final moment to be an open-ended mystery about whether or not Angela had acquired Dr Manhattan\u0027s powers, Lindelof told The Hollywood Reporter: “There are certainly two possible outcomes. But if you watch the entire season again, or if you look at the poster for Watchmen that existed 15 weeks ago, our intention is clear. That’s what I’ll say.”Following these comments, many fans began posting the artwork for Watchmen, which shows King’s character Angela covered in a blue light.\u0026nbspIt seems the clues were there the entire time.Speaking about a potential second season, Lindelof told Vanity Fair: “These nine episodes were planned to stand alone and that doesn’t exclude the possibility that there will be more\u0026nbspWatchmen.”“Whether or not I’ll be involved will be driven almost entirely by whether or not I come up with an idea that I feel is worthy of telling another story.”Watchmen is available to watch on NOW TV.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Wetherspoon\u0026nbsphas doubled in value since then,\u0026nbspadding more than £250m\u0026nbspto Mr Martin’s personal wealth.Earlier this week, Wetherspoon\u0026nbspalso announced plans to invest more than £200m in pubs and hotels over the next four years, creating around 10,000 jobs.New pubs and hotels will be opened, and existing pubs across the UK and Republic of Ireland will be enlarged.Most of the investment will be channelled into developments in small and medium-sized towns, but will also include larger towns and cities.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

A majority of children in Tanzania do not attend school due to informal fees or voluntary parental contributions required for enrolment. This includes among other things, the compulsory purchase of shoes. Foundations like TOMS have given 95 million pairs of shoes to people across 82 countries.Chacha, 12, was born and raised in a small village in northwestern Tanzania, where he lives with his mother and two siblings. He has never set foot in a classroom and is one of a reported 1.89 million out-of-school children in the country today. Chacha works seven days per week scavenging gold mining sites, digging up rocks containing gold-residue. To avoid being captured or shot by mining and government police for trespass, he works under the cover of darkness, 6pm to 6am. The rocks he finds, he sells to middle men, for approximately £1.50 per shift, who crush them to extract the gold. He explained: “I have no choice, I know the work is dangerous but I feel I have to help provide for my family. It makes me sad not being able to go to school.” The money Chacha earns he uses to purchase clothes for himself and his siblings, the remainder he gives to his mother to contribute to food costs. When he returns home from his 12-hour shift, he tends to the family cattle.Evaline, 11, was enrolled in grade three at Remagwe primary school, when at the age of eight, her father passed away suddenly. In 2018, she returned to school with the help of her teenage sister, who had told her about the EAA-GMT education programme. She lives with her mother, who is a farmer, and her four siblings in a grass thatch house with no mattress. Evaline helps her mother with farming and domestic work. The family survive on two meals per day, usually one meal of soft porridge and another of stiff porridge. She walks about 1.5 hours each way to school, something not uncommon to these children in the hardest to reach areas of northwestern Tanzania. Evaline dreams of becoming a nurse and understands she can achieve her dreams through education. Her role model is Maria, a nurse in the city of Mwanza who originates from her village. Evaline’s message to the world is that they should support all the children to receive education.Often shoes that adhere to a specific dress code are required for students to attend school. In addition to uniforms, books, transportation, other informal fees or the cost of shoes can be a roadblock to enrolment. TOMS Giving Shoes help to reduce families’ financial burden.Jonas, 12, was born in a village situated on the shores of Lake Victoria. He now lives with his father, a fisherman, and his step-mother a farmer. Jonas enrolled into an Educate A Child (EAC) and Graca Machel Trust (GMT) partnership in 2017. GMT conducted a survey reaching out to the community to help identify out-of-school children in the region. The survey identified more than 20,000. Jonas was one of those and set foot into a classroom for the first time at the age of 10. The mandatory age for school enrolment is seven, however his family’s lack of available funds meant he could not enrol into school. Also childhood illnesses, easily treated by relatively inexpensive medicines, meant he spent a huge part of his childhood unwell as his father could not afford treatment. When asked what it was like to take his first steps into a classroom, he replied: “It was incredibly exciting, and now it is even more exciting as there is a good chance I will go to secondary school.”Afya, 14, was enrolled into primary school through the EAC and GMT partnership in 2017, after being identified in the out-of-school children survey. Despite being enrolled in school, poverty still remains her greatest challenge. Her  refuses to contribute to the informal fees or voluntary parental contributions required to continue enrolment.Matteus, nine, in the office of the principal at Remagwe school, looks down while he nervously scratches at the torn and faded zebra-print fabric sofa. One of the pre-requisites for children attending school in Tanzania is that parents must contribute to scholastic materials like school uniform and shoes, of which he has neither. His parents, both farmers, are unable to earn more than £375 a year in wages. They are sustaining a family of five. Matteus was identified through the partnership as being from an incredibly poor background, which would prevent his enrolment. He wakes early to ensure all the farm chores are complete by 11am. When he returns from school at 6pm he collects the cattle from the pastures and then helps his mother in the house with any jobs. Matteus and his siblings have two meals a day of porridge and bananas. They cannot afford any protein in their diet.Elizabeth, now 16, was enrolled at school aged 13 with the partnership, which helps the hardest to reach children struggling with things like poverty, early marriage and female genital mutilation. At age six, her father passed away, followed by her mother when she was 12. She was placed under ship of her uncle, who was arranging her marriage, with her unaware. The incentive for parents looking to marry their daughters is to benefit from sizeable dowry payments, more often livestock or land. Elizabeth’s second uncle heard the news of the marriage arrangements and spoke to the new education programme. Elizabeth wanted to enjoy her right to education and her second uncle helped void the pending marriage arrangements. She explained how extremely grateful she is to the foundation that gave her the opportunity to enrol and avoid the marriage she never wanted.Mamoke, 10, has never been to school. Abandoned by her biological parents along with her eight siblings, she now lives with her grandmother in the village of Kuriyah. She grazes cattle six hours a day for her grandmother in return for her keep. She was registered for school but never enrolled. Her grandmother and  is unable to afford the voluntary parental contribution fees. Mamoke describes her household as poor, her grandmother unable to provide more than one meal per day for her. Mamoke added, “There are many days where we do not eat at all.” She dreams of becoming a teacher, if she was able to go to school, so she can help others in her current situation.Josephine, 14, is an orphan and now lives with her aunt. She lost her parents and youngest sister to Aids, however, her blood-work is clear and negative. She was enrolled into the joint education partnership in 2017. Living far from school, she is forced to travel 4km to get there. Poverty remains a constant worry for Josephine as her aunt will not contribute to the additional costs. When asked what it meant to her to have access to education she replied, “Being in school means I will face less hardship and have a less fragile future. I would much prefer to be in class than live at home with my aunt who tries to prevent my going to school. She often beats me. She wants me to get married.” She was identified by the partnership as being vulnerable and teachers would buy her exercise books to ensure she doesn’t go without. Despite being three years behind she is catching up extremely quickly and ranking in the top five students out of 168 pupils.A young girl nervously clasps her hands as she explained how she was beaten repeatedly and threatened with being married off at the age of 13. In remote rural parts of Tanzania, the average age of marriage is between 12-13, from which point they are invited to leave the family home and fend for themselves. This makes them extremely vulnerable.A young boy seated in a dark classroom. In 2001, Tanzania implemented the Primary Education Development Programme (PEDP) and eliminated public school fees to increase access to primary education. But the programme has faced many challenges.A young girl enrolled at Remagwe school in northwestern Tanzania. The school allows her to attend without uniform, which is a rarity. Uniform, shoes and scholastic materials are expected to be funded by parents under voluntary parental contributions, which are around £10 per year. The fees are an enormous barrier to enrolment, typically parents working as farmers will collectively earn no more than £375 a year in wages that must support and sustain a family.Maryam, 12, has been enrolled in primary school since 2014. She lives with her mother and six siblings, who have all become domestic servants in houses. Education up to the age of 16 is free in Tanzania, except for the parental voluntary contributions. Her mother, a farmer, only earns £380 per year and has been paying £69 towards “informal” school fees for her daughters. Maryam has ambitions of becoming a nurse. She wants to help women, explaining: “Women are very vulnerable in Tanzania, friends my age have been married or propositioned for early marriage”. And she added, “Young girls in primary transitioning to secondary schooling take risks walking to school of being kidnapped.”1518 A classroom blackboard used to provide lessons at Remagwe Primary SchoolToday challenges to establishing an effective and stable education system persist. Assistance from international donors and partnerships helps the Tanzanian government achieve universal primary education and refurbish classrooms to improve the learning experience for children.As challenging as it is to see past the barriers to providing a quality education for children, small changes such as repainting blackboards for teachers and students can have enormous and direct benefits.Alex, 13, explained: “I can no longer wash my clothes any more as they will fall apart”. He has no school uniform, unlike many schools in Tanzania, his school still allow him to attend class. His sandals are torn and one held together by a bit of wire twisted at the sole. Alex enrolled into the first grade of his school in 2017 at the beginning of the EACGraca Machel Trust partnership. He lost his father when he was very young to a simple case of diarrhoea. He now lives with his mother and five siblings. She supports the family by working the fields as a peasant farm hand. For him, poverty remains the greatest barrier to his education, having to walk four hours each way to school, meaning he is constantly tired at school. Challenging geographies is a major barrier to education in remote Africa.A typical classroom in rural Tanzania, often without any electricity. Classroom furniture is in need of repair and broken floors leave a surface of sand or mud. In 2001, Tanzania eliminated public school fees to increase access to primary education. This bold move by the government saw a rapid increase in enrolment overnight but abolishing school fees has left schools trying to deliver education on a shoestring budget. Tanzania has the desire to make the change to education but it needs help from the international community to continue the process.Today poverty remains one of the greatest barriers to enrolment in education and no better example of this can be illustrated than in rural and remote parts of Tanzania. A majority of children in Tanzania do not attend school due to informal fees or voluntary parental contributions required for enrolment. This includes among other things, the compulsory purchase of shoes. Foundations like TOMS have given 95 million pairs of shoes to people across 82 countries.Chacha, 12, was born and raised in a small village in northwestern Tanzania, where he lives with his mother and two siblings.

To avoid being captured or shot by mining and government police for trespass, he works under the cover of darkness, 6pm to 6am. The rocks he finds, he sells to middle men, for approximately £1.50 per shift, who crush them to extract the gold. He explained: “I have no choice, I know the work is dangerous but I feel I have to help provide for my family. It makes me sad not being able to go to school.” The money Chacha earns he uses to purchase clothes for himself and his siblings, the remainder he gives to his mother to contribute to food costs. When he returns home from his 12-hour shift, he tends to the family cattle.Evaline, 11, was enrolled in grade three at Remagwe primary school, when at the age of eight, her father passed away suddenly. In 2018, she returned to school with the help of her teenage sister, who had told her about the EAA-GMT education programme. She lives with her mother, who is a farmer, and her four siblings in a grass thatch house with no mattress. Evaline helps her mother with farming and domestic work. The family survive on two meals per day, usually one meal of soft porridge and another of stiff porridge. She walks about 1.5 hours each way to school, something not uncommon to these children in the hardest to reach areas of northwestern Tanzania. Evaline dreams of becoming a nurse and understands she can achieve her dreams through education. Her role model is Maria, a nurse in the city of Mwanza who originates from her village. Evaline’s message to the world is that they should support all the children to receive education.Often shoes that adhere to a specific dress code are required for students to attend school. In addition to uniforms, books, transportation, other informal fees or the cost of shoes can be a roadblock to enrolment. TOMS Giving Shoes help to reduce families’ financial burden.Jonas, 12, was born in a village situated on the shores of Lake Victoria. He now lives with his father, a fisherman, and his step-mother a farmer. Jonas enrolled into an Educate A Child (EAC) and Graca Machel Trust (GMT) partnership in 2017. GMT conducted a survey reaching out to the community to help identify out-of-school children in the region. The survey identified more than 20,000. Jonas was one of those and set foot into a classroom for the first time at the age of 10. The mandatory age for school enrolment is seven, however his family’s lack of available funds meant he could not enrol into school. Also childhood illnesses, easily treated by relatively inexpensive medicines, meant he spent a huge part of his childhood unwell as his father could not afford treatment. When asked what it was like to take his first steps into a classroom, he replied: “It was incredibly exciting, and now it is even more exciting as there is a good chance I will go to secondary school.”Afya, 14, was enrolled into primary school through the EAC and GMT partnership in 2017, after being identified in the out-of-school children survey. Despite being enrolled in school, poverty still remains her greatest challenge. Her  refuses to contribute to the informal fees or voluntary parental contributions required to continue enrolment.Matteus, nine, in the office of the principal at Remagwe school, looks down while he nervously scratches at the torn and faded zebra-print fabric sofa. One of the pre-requisites for children attending school in Tanzania is that parents must contribute to scholastic materials like school uniform and shoes, of which he has neither. His parents, both farmers, are unable to earn more than £375 a year in wages. They are sustaining a family of five. Matteus was identified through the partnership as being from an incredibly poor background, which would prevent his enrolment. He wakes early to ensure all the farm chores are complete by 11am. When he returns from school at 6pm he collects the cattle from the pastures and then helps his mother in the house with any jobs. Matteus and his siblings have two meals a day of porridge and bananas. They cannot afford any protein in their diet.Elizabeth, now 16, was enrolled at school aged 13 with the partnership, which helps the hardest to reach children struggling with things like poverty, early marriage and female genital mutilation. At age six, her father passed away, followed by her mother when she was 12. She was placed under ship of her uncle, who was arranging her marriage, with her unaware. The incentive for parents looking to marry their daughters is to benefit from sizeable dowry payments, more often livestock or land. Elizabeth’s second uncle heard the news of the marriage arrangements and spoke to the new education programme. Elizabeth wanted to enjoy her right to education and her second uncle helped void the pending marriage arrangements. She explained how extremely grateful she is to the foundation that gave her the opportunity to enrol and avoid the marriage she never wanted.Mamoke, 10, has never been to school. Abandoned by her biological parents along with her eight siblings, she now lives with her grandmother in the village of Kuriyah. She grazes cattle six hours a day for her grandmother in return for her keep. She was registered for school but never enrolled. Her grandmother and  is unable to afford the voluntary parental contribution fees. Mamoke describes her household as poor, her grandmother unable to provide more than one meal per day for her. Mamoke added, “There are many days where we do not eat at all.” She dreams of becoming a teacher, if she was able to go to school, so she can help others in her current situation.Josephine, 14, is an orphan and now lives with her aunt. She lost her parents and youngest sister to Aids, however, her blood-work is clear and negative. She was enrolled into the joint education partnership in 2017. Living far from school, she is forced to travel 4km to get there. Poverty remains a constant worry for Josephine as her aunt will not contribute to the additional costs. When asked what it meant to her to have access to education she replied, “Being in school means I will face less hardship and have a less fragile future. I would much prefer to be in class than live at home with my aunt who tries to prevent my going to school. She often beats me. She wants me to get married.” She was identified by the partnership as being vulnerable and teachers would buy her exercise books to ensure she doesn’t go without. Despite being three years behind she is catching up extremely quickly and ranking in the top five students out of 168 pupils.A young girl nervously clasps her hands as she explained how she was beaten repeatedly and threatened with being married off at the age of 13. In remote rural parts of Tanzania, the average age of marriage is between 12-13, from which point they are invited to leave the family home and fend for themselves. This makes them extremely vulnerable.A young boy seated in a dark classroom. In 2001, Tanzania implemented the Primary Education Development Programme (PEDP) and eliminated public school fees to increase access to primary education. But the programme has faced many challenges.A young girl enrolled at Remagwe school in northwestern Tanzania. The school allows her to attend without uniform, which is a rarity. Uniform, shoes and scholastic materials are expected to be funded by parents under voluntary parental contributions, which are around £10 per year. The fees are an enormous barrier to enrolment, typically parents working as farmers will collectively earn no more than £375 a year in wages that must support and sustain a family.Maryam, 12, has been enrolled in primary school since 2014. She lives with her mother and six siblings, who have all become domestic servants in houses. Education up to the age of 16 is free in Tanzania, except for the parental voluntary contributions. Her mother, a farmer, only earns £380 per year and has been paying £69 towards “informal” school fees for her daughters. Maryam has ambitions of becoming a nurse. She wants to help women, explaining: “Women are very vulnerable in Tanzania, friends my age have been married or propositioned for early marriage”. And she added, “Young girls in primary transitioning to secondary schooling take risks walking to school of being kidnapped.”1518 A classroom blackboard used to provide lessons at Remagwe Primary SchoolToday challenges to establishing an effective and stable education system persist. Assistance from international donors and partnerships helps the Tanzanian government achieve universal primary education and refurbish classrooms to improve the learning experience for children.As challenging as it is to see past the barriers to providing a quality education for children, small changes such as repainting blackboards for teachers and students can have enormous and direct benefits.Alex, 13, explained: “I can no longer wash my clothes any more as they will fall apart”. He has no school uniform, unlike many schools in Tanzania, his school still allow him to attend class. His sandals are torn and one held together by a bit of wire twisted at the sole. Alex enrolled into the first grade of his school in 2017 at the beginning of the EACGraca Machel Trust partnership. He lost his father when he was very young to a simple case of diarrhoea. He now lives with his mother and five siblings. She supports the family by working the fields as a peasant farm hand. For him, poverty remains the greatest barrier to his education, having to walk four hours each way to school, meaning he is constantly tired at school. Challenging geographies is a major barrier to education in remote Africa.A typical classroom in rural Tanzania, often without any electricity. Classroom furniture is in need of repair and broken floors leave a surface of sand or mud. In 2001, Tanzania eliminated public school fees to increase access to primary education. This bold move by the government saw a rapid increase in enrolment overnight but abolishing school fees has left schools trying to deliver education on a shoestring budget. Tanzania has the desire to make the change to education but it needs help from the international community to continue the process.There are 258 million children and young people around the world with no access to education\u0026nbsp– 59 million at the primary level alone, according to Unesco’s Institute for Statistics.Today, poverty remains one of the greatest barriers to enrolment in education programmes. No better example of this can be illustrated than in rural and remote parts of Tanzania, where a 12-year-old boy, out of school, forced\u0026nbspinto a life of work, trapped in a dead-end cycle of danger and despair so he can provide for his family, provides perspective. He says: “I have no choice, I know the work is dangerous but I feel I have to help provide for my brothers and sisters. It makes me sad not being able to go to school.”Chacha works 12-hour shifts, seven days a week, under the cover of darkness to avoid detection, on one of the many small-scale gold mining sites in the northwest of the country. Illegally, he scavenges the mines for residue-bearing rock which he digs up and sells to middle-men who crush and extract the gold. Chacha’s cut of £1.50 a day is used to contribute to household bills. The work is exhausting and dangerous. Trespassers are shot on sight – even children.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesTanzania\u0026nbsphas strong laws governing child labour,\u0026nbspreinforced by the national action plan to eliminate the practice. The plan prohibits under-18s from engaging in hazardous work, including mining, but children are still lured into mines with the hope of changing their fortunes and those of their families.Chacha has never set foot in a classroom, perhaps he never will. He is one of the estimated 1.895 million children out-of-school children\u0026nbspin Tanzania today.New hope for Cambodia after the Khmer Rouge’s brutal war on educationHis only possible salvation may come through partnerships such as those between the Education Above All\u0026nbspFoundation (EAA) and Graca Machel Trust (GMT). These collaborations place a strong emphasis on capacity building – boosting schools in all areas to help them run efficiently and sustainably – as well as community engagement and service support. The EAA-GMT partnership has successfully enrolled 23,479 out-of-school children\u0026nbspin\u0026nbspquality primary education over\u0026nbsptwo years in the Mara region – comprising the most challenging and hardest to reach districts of Tanzania.GMT brought in the Complementary Basic Education in Tanzania (COBET) accelerated learning programme, to give a second chance to over-age learners who had never been to school – and to those who had dropped out.In 2001, Tanzania implemented the Primary Education Development Programme\u0026nbspand eliminated public school fees\u0026nbspto increase access to primary education. But\u0026nbspmany challenges have arisen. Schooling is now mandatory for children aged seven to 15, and although enrolment has dramatically increased, Tanzania has not yet achieved universal primary education. A majority of children in Tanzania do not attend school due to informal fees or voluntary\u0026nbspparental contributions required for enrolment. This includes, among other things, the compulsory purchase of shoes.All children should be able to attend primary school regardless of whether their parents can or can’t afford to pay or see the value, perhaps never having received\u0026nbspan education themselves. At its core, if a child fails to gain the basic skills required to contribute as a functioning member of\u0026nbspsociety, the loss is vast, not just to the child or society but the nation as a whole. For those sceptical, education can ultimately reduce poverty for future generations. Studies show the cost of educating children is far outweighed by the cost of not educating them.Their schools lie in ruins – but is there hope for Mosul’s children?Women of Gaza: Empowered and resilientThe global challenge to ensure all children can go to schoolSheikha Moza bint Nasser, chair\u0026nbspand founder of EAA, has dedicated much of her life to ensuring the most marginalised children can go to school, when there was no duty or expectation for her to do so. At\u0026nbspUnesco’s headquarters in Paris last year, she said: “Statistics cannot catalogue the impact of\u0026nbspchildren’s broken dreams. So we must not allow ourselves to be ‘numbed’\u0026nbspby the numbers, and we cannot accept apathy as a response. Because history, as we know, will judge us, by both what we do, and what we choose not to do.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He made sure lines of communication were kept open and regularly hopped on his motorbike and visited his grandparents and other members of his extended family.I suspect that being caught up in this nightmare, which has seen them appear on network TV both here and in the US, as well as an utterly surreal meeting with Donald Trump at the White House, has made it almost impossible for Harry’s parents to grieve properly for their son.They are still in shock, dazed and barely sleeping, and it is only their resolve to achieve justice for their son that is driving them on. Harry’s death made global headlines.Sadly, the spotlight shts all too quickly, and the world forgets about such tragedies and moves on. But Charlotte, Tim and Niall, and everyone who knew and loved Harry, lives with the pain every single minute of every single day.Charlotte told me that Niall, always the quieter and less out-going twin, is finding it extremely hard to come to terms with the death of his brother.He cannot bear to talk about what happened and is haunted because he doesn’t know exactly how Harry died.Tim has spoken about seeing his son’s poor shattered bloody body at the crash scene and how he tried to reassure him that all would be well, but his boy died shortly afterwards.Frankly, I don’t know how Anne Sacoolas can live with herself.If she had only stayed to help the police piece together what had happened, she would have had the chance to express her sorrow, and more than likely been given a suspended sentence.That would at least have given Harry’s family some peace of mind.Instead, Charlotte and Tim are trying to get US officials to listen to them and hoping Donald Trump will make good on his promise of getting something done.If the President thought he could steamroller this “ordinary” British couple during that encounter, he was soon put right.They turned down his clumsy attempt at setting up a meeting with Sacoolas, who was waiting in a White House side room. They didn’t want to be bounced into a Trump photo opportunity, and they also said they rejected an offer of compensation.Charlotte and Tim are also ready to file a civil lawsuit against Sacoolas in the state of Virginia, in an attempt to have her hand herself in to UK authorities.I spoke to them about how the family would face Christmas, and they simply shook their heads in sorrow. Fighting tears, Charlotte told me it was going to be horrendous, especially as Harry loved this time of year so much.I can’t get out of my head the image of them at home, surrounded by sadness, while neighbours in houses around them are making merry.Charlotte said it was made worse by the fact that Sacoolas will be able to celebrate Christmas with her children.It seems the Sacoolas family and the authorities are hoping thatthey stall long enough Charlotte and Tim are just going to go away.I can assure them that they will never give up.I sincerely hope this courageous couple, who are going through the torments of hell, somehow manage to shame officials here and in the US into doing what’s right.Sacoolas should be sent back to the UK to explain herself, apologise and face her punishment.New PM Boris Johnson has a bloody long to-do list, but justice for Harry must be one of his priorities.WILL he fall at the final hurdle Saturday night or will Anton du Beke go all the way and win his first ever Strictly Glitterball after  years of trying.If I was ever to do the showthen you can bet your le it would be poor old Anton who would have to shove me around the dancefloor like an overstuffed wardrobe.He tends to get the plucky no-hopers of a certain age, but this year was given a real contender in the shape of firecracker Emma Barton, from EastEnders.It’s too close to call with the other two finalists, Karim Zeroual and Amy Dowden, and Kelvin Fletcher and Oti Mabuse at the top of their game, but no one would begrudge Anton his moment of glory.JENNIFER Lopez celebrated her Screen Actors Guild Award nomination with an online message to her fans – while on a treadmill in the gym.Being J-Lo, her make-up was flawless, she was wearing a gorgeous tracksuit and she completed the look with fabulous hoop earrings.Despite working out, she wasn’t even glowing, never mind perspiring.What a contrast to the rest of us.I’m a sweaty, red-faced mess after my exercise class and look as though I’ve been dragged through every hedge in the land not just backwards, but forwards too.J-Lo has been nominated for a SAG for her role as Ramona in Hustlers, and during the message she even got a little teary, but of course without the red nose and puffy eyes of us mere mortals.She makes the world a more beautul place.She’s the powerhouse behind the insane Kardashian phenomenon and expert at making very little talent go a bloody long way. Now we are told that the scariest stepmother since Cinderella’s has decided to buy her long-suffering family, including her -year-old mum, Botox vouchers for Christmas.Obviously there’s a money-making opportunity here, as Kris has signed up to promote a Botox company offering  gt tokens as seasonal presents.And I suppose eventhey are insulted or unhappy about her gt, they won’t be able to show those emotions on their newly frozen faces.So Kris wins again.I’M deeply concerned and extremely angry about the current mumps epidemic among hundreds of university students.Since this summer, more than , cases of this dangerous and infectious disease have been reported. If untreated it can lead to deafness, meningitis, and can reduce male fertility.It’s a direct result of parents refusing to let their kids be given the MMR jab when the recent crop of sufferers were babies at the turn of the century.Scare stories about MMR being linked with autism led to parents opting out of immunisation and now we are reaping the whirlwind.Health officials have urged anyone who hasn’t had the jab to do so immediately and have warned of a “public health time bomb”.There’s also been a surge in the cases of measles, a disease that can kill.It is outrageous that we are fortunate enough to have the science to eradicate these diseases completely, and save millions of lives in the process, but through misinformation, stubbornness and, even in a few cases sheer laziness, measles and mumps are being allowed to flourish once more.We need to get a grip and protect our babies, children and young people from harm that is easily preventable.WELL done to Great British Bake Off runner-up Steph Blackwell for being so refreshingly honest about her struggles with ious eating disorders.The -year-old, who was a joy to watch on the show, wants to help other people struggling with anorexia, bulimia and depression and to reassure them that things can get better.When she was , and in the grip of the illness, she would never have imagined one day she would be enjoying baking in front of the nation.Steph is proof that debilitating and often le-threatening eating disorders can be brought under control with understanding and the right kind of help.More power to her.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It is now vital, economically and politically, the Tories pump money into those regions and transform them.The gap between them and London has been too wide too long.And our re-elected PM was dead right to make that his priority in his first speech at No since winning his thumping majority.We must “unite and level up”, he said. Exactly.Remainers may take a while to “unite”, to “heal”. But the levelling-up can start now, by spending on infrastructure, including big transport improvements.That, admittedly, takes years. In the short-term, low-tax zones and other tax breaks can revive High Streets and lure job-creating firms out of big cities and into regions which need the boost.More money for public services is key too. The NHS, social care and crime are priorities across the country. So are many more affordable homes.Visible improvements can be made rapidly, such as with a new determination to end rough sleeping, as the Blair Government almost did.For years The Sun backed the Tories as they cut spending to fix the chaos Labour left in .That work is largely done — and, let’s face it, public patience for penny-pinching is at an end.We will trust a Tory Chancellor infinitely more than a Marxist one to spend prudently without bankrupting us.Equally exciting is the power Boris now has both to reinvent the civil service to deliver on national priorities and to reshape our politics.The Tories have a golden chance to rebrand and recast themselves as the party of working people, of Sun readers — and end the lefties’ tired mantra that they serve only the rich.It is also time to fix the anti-Tory bias in our election system.It is incredible their big win came even despite constituency boundaries favouring Labour. These must be redrawn.Two years ago we said Britain needed a strong Tory majority to improve lives and take big decisions to reform public services. It has finally come true.We heartily congratulate the many new Tory MPs. Chiefly, though, we congratulate three men.One is Isaac Levido, the party’s talented and driven Aussie elections guru.The other two, Dominic Cummings and Boris himself, have genuinely made history twice, against staggering odds.They took on the Remainer establishment and won the Brexit vote in . Now they have crushed the Remainers’ long refusal to deliver on it.In one momentous instant, as the exit poll dropped at pm on Thursday, these men ended three and a half years of ­political purgatory and paralysis.All the trickery and plots of duplicitous Remainer MPs and their rogue Speaker Bercow to reverse the referendum came to nothing.All the expensive legal cases, the collusion with EU officials, the long PR campaign of hatred towards Leavers and Boris . . . all were for nothing.In that one moment Boris won his mandate, Brexit was secured and the “People’s Vote” charade destroyed.Corbynism — which had terried millions, not least Britain’s Jews — was instantly over too and the nation liberated from the shadow of hard-left extremism.Then one Brexit-blocking MP after another was dumped by voters.Cummings’s and Boris’s achievements cannot be overstated. They are victories on a dferent scale even from Tony Blair’s against an exhausted Tory Party.As for what remains of Blair’s party we say this: It is staggering to see Corbyn cling on, plainly hoping to stitch up the leadership for some hard-left successor.That will just guarantee ­perpetual irrelevance.He, McDonnell, Seumas Milne, their Momentum social justice warriors and their repugnant media foghorns must be driven out NOW.With a few honourable exceptions, Labour’s “moderate” MPs and voters have shown a repugnant lack of spine by failing to do so already.Indeed the hypocrisy of politicians like Jess Phillips and Stella Creasy has never been plainer, begging Britain to hand power to Corbyn and his anti-Semitic, terrorist-supporting mob, then denouncing them the instant they lost.These unprincipled charlatans backed a Marxist manesto, only to turn on it once voters recoiled. Shame on them. It may be too late anyway. Labour looks irredeemably in the grip of hard-left cranks. Do Phillips and Wes Streeting really need five more years of this  We look forward to a bloodletting like this once-great party has never seen.“Change is coming”, Corbynistas used to say, with no little menace.It sure is.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Wrong.There are simply not that many avocado-munching Marxists in the country, comrade.Labour has spent years calling the .million people who voted to leave the European Union stupid, ­racist, pig-ignorant peasants.This is just in — calling people stupid is not a vote-winner.And now, this sorry excuse for a Labour Party has been given the apocalyptic kicking it so richly deserved.Under the extremist stewardship of Jeremy Corbyn, John McDonnell and the brain-dead thugs of Momentum, Labour happily abandoned the working class. And now the working class has abandoned Labour. My guess — for ever.The North is blue. The Red Wall has fallen. Great Grimsby. Scunthorpe. Even Bolsover — home of Dennis Skinner, the erstwhile “Beast of Bolsover” — is Tory today.And Stoke-on-Trent, Wolverhampton North East and Sedgefield — Tony Blair’s safe Labour seat for so many years — are sending Conservative MPs to Westminster.The great mystery is how Labour ever deluded itself that this country could embrace a party leader who has licked the grimy toenails of Hamas, Hezbollah, the IRA and indeed, it seems, any Brit-hating terrorist that would cheerfully do a jig on all our graves.This country will never elect a leader who openly despises the nation he seeks to represent. Why would we Labour — this jaw-droppingly out-of-touch Labour Party, this North London protest group masquerading as a serious political party — forgot why it was founded more than a century ago.And no, it wasn’t to represent a bunch of privately educated revolutionaries in Islington. It was to stand up for the working man and woman.Labour spat on the very people it was meant to represent. And now watch Labour choking on its own spit.Brexit — and the endless sneering at Brexit, and the thwarting of Brexit, and the endless attempts to abort Brexit — was just the start of Labour’s spectacular fall.Corbyn’s Labour never understood the working class.Hear this, comrade — the working class do not want handouts. They are not victims. They can’t be bought with glass beads, shiny trinkets and promises of free broadband.And they do not think they should apologise for being British and for loving this country and its history.All across our nation, working-class communities decided that the Conservatives were the true party of the working class.And let’s be honest, those Labour-voting heartlands have always had plenty of reasons to NOT vote Tory.Although Boris’s spectacular victory is being compared to Mrs Thatcher’s glory years, Maggie was always heartily despised in the regions where they built ships and mined for coal and did jobs where you got your hands dirty.For when these hard-working communities were tossed on the scrapheap of changing times, there seemed scant sympathy or understanding in Maggie Thatcher’s Conservative Party about the human cost of deindustrialisation.Analysis by the Financial Times shows that the more low-paid, low-skilled workers living in a constituency, the better the Tories did.Think about it — the Tories are the party fighting for struggling families now.And their victory is so complete that the leaders of the two opposition parties, Jo Swinson and Jeremy Corbyn, have either resigned or are about to resign.These men and women in those post-industrial communities saw their families suffer dreadfully when the old industries died.They were never going to vote for Jeremy Corbyn and his Communist clowns.But getting them to actually break the habit of a letime and vote Tory signals an historic change in our politics.After this week, the old tribal party loyalties have gone for ever.It no longer matters a damn how your parents and your grandparents voted.Boris Johnson has been swept to power by millions who never voted Tory in their lives. Now he has to keep them.And he has to show he is a Prime Minister who understands that there is a country beyond the M.Brexit is just the start.The Prime Minister’s in-tray is piled high with the housing crisis, rising crime and communities across our nation that feel totally forgotten by Westminster. Brexit should have been done and dusted years ago.And the only reason it is not is because the establishment cynically thwarted the result of the  EU referendum.But all the yakking about revoking Article , and a second referendum, and arcane Parliamentary procedures, and cobblers about a “People’s Vote” is suddenly in the past.If Remainers want us to be members of the EU then they must now be prepared to campaign for decades.The Brexit debate is over and Boris Johnson has a mandate to reshape our country as a global nation that is open to trade with the world.Frankly, Boris’s election campaign was uninspired.Boris beat Corbyn the way that boxer Anthony Joshua beat roly-poly Andy Ruiz Jr in Saudi Arabi — safety first, nothing fancy, just stay on the end of your jab and, above all, WIN. Because the consequences of losing were just too bloody awful to contemplate.Butthe campaign was uninspiring, Boris remains an inspirational politician.People like him. He gives them optimism and hope. He puts a smile on faces.His enemies paint him as a racist, right-wing bigot but the man is exactly the opposite.Boris is a tolerant, big-hearted, one-nation Tory with a razor-sharp mind and an endlessly generous spirit.The newspaper article that is always cited as evidence of his racism — the one where he compared women in full-body burkas to a letter box — was actually advocating their right to dress any way they choose, no matter how ridiculous it looks.There is no hatred in Boris Johnson. There is no poison. And God knows there has been a poisonous atmosphere in our politics for years.I live in an inner-city, safe Labour seat, and usually there would be the leaflets of three or four parties represented in the windows of our neighbourhood.But there were no leaflets in windows at this election. Because there is too much hatred abroad, too much toxic ision, too many idiots willing to stick a brick through the window of someone who dares to disagree with them.Whatever our beliefs, the great hope now must be that we can start coming together as a country, and begin to heal, and start building some kind of national unity.A Tory Prime Minister elected by the working class seems a good place to start.My parents — a Labour-voting mum and a Liberal-voting dad — despised the Tories as the party of the rich, the privileged, the out-of-touch toffs.That sentiment has been shared by millions of ­working-class men and women since the end of World War Two. Until now.From the Black Country to Blyth Valley, we are all Tories now.It is ironic that it took an Old Etonian Oxford graduateto make the Tories the natural party of the working class.And now Prime Minister Johnson and his new Tories must prove they are worthy of all those working-class votes.And let us hope that the Labour Party can find its soul again.Let us hope that this formerly great party of compassion, social justice and equality can kick out all the bigots, middle-class Reds, IRA groupies, friends of Hamas and Hezbollah and the anti-Semites who would rather wave the Palestinian flag than the Union Jack.But it is likely that ­Labour has already been dumped in the recycling bin of history.Because this doesn’t feel like a defeat for the Labour Party. It feels more like a death.It is hard to see how Labour can crawl out from under this landslide.These last years have not really been about party politics. They have been about the will of the people coming into direct conflict with the will of the establishment.The combined forces of the House of Commons and House of Lords, the BBC and Channel , the Supreme Court and expensive lawyers, RADA revolutionaries like Hugh Grant, Steve Coogan and Emma Thompson, all placed themselves above people.All of the political paralysis, and the national humiliation of never getting Brexit done, and the endless frustration of seeing democracy being cheated stems from an arrogant establishment that refused to accept the largest vote for anything in our history.What a shameful, anti-democratic place this country would bethey had won. But they lost. Now let us move forward at last.Millions of working-class men and women just placed their faith in a decent, ­brilliant, chubby-cheeked, shaggy-haired, dog-loving toff to deliver a better tomorrow for ALL of our people.As unlikely as it seems, you are a working-class hero now, Boris.Andyou make your supporters proud to be working-class Tories, then you, Carrie and your dog Dilyn will be in No for the next ten years. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But there was a moment when I knew we’d absolutely had it.The BBC’s Nick Robinson was questioning Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell. “The Conservative message, ‘Get Brexit Done’, is very clear. What’s yours ”There was an audible gulp from Mr McDonnell, a pause, followed by patter so inconsequential that I now can’t recall it word for word. And that’s the point. If you are asking people to lend you the most precious thing they have in a democracy — their vote — you have to be able to say why.On Brexit, was Labour’s leader Jeremy Corbyn in favour of leaving the EU with his “sensible deal”, or of staying in it  He didn’t seem to know — orhe did he was keeping it from the electorate.There has not been a more abject failure of leadership by the head of any British political party since the war.Mr Corbyn, Mr McDonnell and their puppet-master, Len McCluskey, now blame not themselves but Brexit for Labour’s night of shame. But our Brexit dficulties were largely brought about by Mr Corbyn. They started with the  EU referendum.For most of that campaign, he was invisible. Only reluctantly was he persuaded to say something. When he did, it was without enthusiasm.There’s a reason for Mr Corbyn’s indecision on Brexit. The Jeremy Corbyn I knew in  years in the Commons was the man who voted against every EU treaty change — and left the strong impression he couldn’t stand the institution. But scared to fight for it, he put his party into the worst position, of having no position at all.But Brexit was just a symptom of Labour’s problems. Their cause was Mr Corbyn, what he stood for. He and those who have propped him up can body-swerve as much as they want.They have to face up to this unpalatable truth. Mr Corbyn was convincedthat the more left-wing Labour’s manesto, the more votes we would get.He didn’t disappoint. It was even more left-wing that our last effort like that — Labour’s  manesto, tagged “the longest suicide note in history”.I back far greater public spending than are the Conservatives. It’s one reason why I have been in Labour for  years.I want a fairer society, with greater equality, better opportunities and no discrimination. But you have to take people with you on this journey, and remember that it’s their money that will be paying for it.Mr McDonnell and Mr Corbyn forgot this. They tried to promise everything at once, in a single incontinent splurge. The result was inevitable. The party fell flat on its face.Last was the terrible scourge of anti-Semitism Mr Corbyn allowed to gain hold in the party until it was too late. We were indelibly stained.After Labour’s  election defeat, Neil Kinnock did the honourable thing and announced he was going.He didn’t hang around in a transparent attempt to organise the election of a successor, which is what it appears Mr Corbyn is doing — asmore of the same toxic mixture is going to work. It can’t.I love the Labour Party and all the decent things it stands for, and has done for our society. We can have a future, but onlywe break with the dismal Corbyn agenda and have a leader and organisation that can take us on that long journey.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

His disastrous leadership was cited as the most popular reason for not voting Labour, followed by HIS nonsensical Brexit policy, then HIS barmy plans for the economy.He and his crackpot advisers are entirely to blame for Labour’s worst electoral performance in  years.Sadly for millions of decent Labour voters, that’s not how Corbynistas see it.As Emily Thornberry has apparently made clear, in their eyes the electorate was too uneducated and bigoted to grasp the wonders of “real change”.Well, we’ve got news for the Marxist clowns.It doesn’t take a fancy degree from a top university to know an IRA-supporting, Britain-hating anti-Semite when you see one.Or to understand that a politician who promises endless freebies is clueless about economics.Corbyn and his comrades have proved that they simply don’t get this country.They must quietly slip into obscurity.THE SUN is delighted that Boris Johnson plans to decriminalise non-payment of the BBC licence fee.When we all depended on the Beeb for entertainment, forcing viewers to cough up was just about defensible.But in , when many Brits are getting their dramas from Netflix and their sport from Sky, it emphatically is not.It’s downright shocking that good citizens from poor households are getting criminal records for such a trivial non-offence. And ludicrous that courts are wasting precious time prosecuting them.The pompous and patronising BBC is losing relevance by the day.A system that locks up those who don’t pump their hard-earned cash into its bloated coffers is clearly broken.BORIS Johnson has hit the nail on the head: rotten Whitehall is ripe for reform.In almost any other line of work,you do a bad job, you’re out on your ear.But because it’s practically impossible to sack civil servants, hundreds of sub-par paper-pushers are retiring with a £,-a-year pension — an eye-popping  per cent higher than the national average.The four core values of the civil service are honesty, impartiality, integrity and objectivity — all noble principles that have been unceremoniously cast aside by the scaremongering Remoaners currently roaming Whitehall.The Prime Minister’s bold plan to give them the chop is an excellent sign that this Government means business. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Last week, nearly eight in ten backed Boris Johnson. Just  per cent of Workington Men voted for Jeremy Corbyn, and nine in ten believed Boris would make a better Prime Minister.In backing Boris and Brexit, these voters have made the Conservative Party far more representative of working Britain. More than a third of Conservative voters are now manual or skilled workers, and more than two thirds did not go to university.Geographically, the Tories now hold three times as many seats in the North East as they did historically, as well as three quarters of constituencies in the West Midlands, up from just one in four in . So much for the party of the South, the rich and the privileged.But this new electoral coalition will demand a new kind of politics. The common ground of public opinion is now marginally to the left on the economy and right on culture.By a ratio of two to one, voters want a society focused on giving people more security rather than freedom, and investment in public services rather than income tax cuts.If Boris wants to keep Workington Man blue he must break free of the traditional conservative economic playbook of trickle-down growth and bring purpose back to towns in the North and Midlands.It is telling that the walls of Workington train station are adorned with posters of the local British Steel factory that closed in , after  years of continuous production. This is a town proud of its history.The Conservatives must help Workington identy its economic future.New infrastructure, including better roads, reliable trains and faster broadband, will help. But on their own they will not be enough. For towns such as these to flourish, they need skilled jobs, dynamic companies and lasting private-sector investment.Margaret Thatcher bent over backwards to bring Nissan to Sunderland, revitalising the region and jump-starting a lagging national industry.Boris Johnson should do the same, using science, research  development and skills spending to tempt world-class companies in emerging sectors such as renewable energy and advanced manufacturing to cluster in his party’s new heartlands.High-skill jobs need skilled workers to do them — making a retraining revolution essential.More than a third of Workington Man voters have an apprenticeship and another third are educated to GCSE level. They are highly vulnerable to automation and globalisation.The Conservative manesto included £million a year to retrain disadvantaged people, but Onward’s analysis suggests more than £billion is needed each year to retrain Britain’s .million low-skilled workers before automation hits.The Tories must also reflect on the social fabric of the places it now represents.In many regional towns, the high street is emptying, libraries, pubs and social clubs are closing and crime is a rising concern.Places such as Wrexham, Blyth Valley and Bishop Auckland, all of which voted Conservative for the first time last week, are not in the lowest ranks of deprivation but they are united by a shared loss of belonging. The Conservatives need an answer to this fraying public realm.There is a limit to how much Whitehall can ever repair a sense of community itself, so a good start would be putting people and places back in control.The success of city mayors shows the value of local accountability for local services — as Boris Johnson, a former Mayor of London, knows well.Every place should be able to take the local leadership that the capital enjoyed during his tenure.Local groups should be given powers to take over shops, post offices and pubs when they close, with funding to match. More people should be encouraged to live and work near to where they grow up, rather than moving to the city to make their way.For too long, social success has been defined by how far you move from your parents.The realignment witnessed last week was profound, but it is not yet permanent.More than a fth of voters engaged in contract voting, lending their support to a party other than the one that represents their values — and contract voting was strongest in Leave seats and former Labour strongholds that fell to the Conservatives.Workington Man lent his vote.

Well, he won’t be.“He will be remembered as a sexual predator and an unrepentant abuser who took everything and deserves nothing.“He will be remembered by the collective will of countless women who stood up and said enough.“We refuse to let this predator rewrite his legacy of abuse, the women said in a statement to Page Six.”Speaking to Page Six from his flashy hospital room, Weinstein insisted he was only going ahead with the unprecedented interview to prove he wasnt exaggerating his back pain.The -year-old, who is awaiting trial for rape, says he sustained a back injury in August for which he has recently undergone a three hour surgery.Recent court appearances have seen the mogul using a walking frame with some suggesting that he was exaggerating his injuries to garner sympathy - which he vehemently denies, adding: I think they wanted to embarrass me.The alleged sex-pest used the interview to launch a bizarre pity-party, insisting: I want this city to recognize who I was instead of what I’ve become.He continued: It all got eviscerated because of what happened...My work has been forgotten.Weinstein refused to discuss his criminal charges - including rape, predatory sexual assault and criminal sex acts - all of which he denies - throughout the unprecedented chat.According to the interviewer, he snapped: Ill move on when asked uncomfortable questions.Wientstein also moaned that he had made more movies directed by women and about women than any filmmaker, bizarrely insisting that he pioneered women in film despite the slew of allegations against him.He said: I’m talking about  years ago.

More than  fresh-faced new Tories are among those coming to Parliament for the first time thanks to Boris Johnsonaposs resounding victory. Many have long and storied careers ahead of them. But some of them have a few skeletons in their past too. Weaposve looked at some of the new MPs who landed themselves in controversy before they even arrived in their new offices in Westminster. Brendan Clarke-SmithThe Tory who ousted Labour in Bassetlaw told a hustings food banks were being used too often as a top up and a political weapon.Explaining the huge rise in foodbanks he said: If you keep saying to people that you’re going to give stuff away, then you’re going to have an increase I’m afraid. He said food banks should only be a short-term solution and it was simply not true that Britain is some kind of country in crisis and in absolute poverty. He later told the Mirror the reaction to his comments was staged outrage. He added: I stand by the fact itaposs been weaponised. I donapost obviously believe that everybody who uses a food bank is just taking advantage, I think thataposs actually very rare. Ian LevyThe Tory who took Blyth Valley, Labour since , was accused of misleading the public after a Facebook post that described him as an NHS nurse was quietly edited.The post dated November  originally said: As an NHS nurse myself, I am immensely proud of the investment by our Conservative government. This post was edited  days later to describe him as an NHS mental health nursing assistant.  A local NHS worker told the Mirror that despite sounding similar, the two roles were very dferent and colleagues were angry that he would lie about being a nurse to win votes. Mr Levy did notrequests for comment. Karl McCartney The MP who seized Lincoln back from Labour apologised during the campaign for retweeting a post claiming Tommy Robinson had been imprisoned for aposreporting on Muslim paedophilesapos. Mr McCartney also shared a letter from Tommy Robinson with his followers in which the extreme right-winger claimed his murder by Islamic prison gangs would spark a revolution It read: “I’ve always said I’d sacrice my le tomorrowit would end the Islamic takeover of our beautul land.”  Nick Lowles, chief executive of HOPE not Hate, said the activity showed he was utterly unfit to be an MP. In a statement, Mr McCartney said: I apologise unreservedly. In no way do I endorse the tweets or the accounts behind them. I accept retweeting them was ill judged and could cause offence. This isive figure [Mr Robinson] has no place in our politics or public le. Anthony BrowneAnthony Browne, an ex-aide to Boris Johnson , blamed migrants for bringing germs to UK and for the spread of HIV. Labour called on Tories to boot out Mr Browne after the articles were unearthed by.Writing for the Spectator, he said: “It is not through letting in terrorists that the governmentaposs policy of mass migration – especially from the third world – will claim the most lives. It is through letting in too many germs.” Mr Browne, who worked for the PM when he was Mayor of London, has apologised for the comments in the past.  Speaking when appointed Mr Johnsonaposs policy chief at City Hall he said: “I do very much regret any offence caused by any past newspaper articles. It really never was my intention to cause offence but to provoke debate. The articles, which I deeply regret writing, also don’t give a fair reflection of my views. I want to make clear that I am emphatically not anti-immigration.” During the campaign, a Conservative party spokesperson said: “These comments were made over  years ago, Anthony Browne has apologised for these comments and sincerely regrets them.” Lee Anderson Tory Lee Anderson said nuisance council house tenants should live in tents and work in fields In a shocking video rant on Facebook, the Tory MP for Ashfield said he thinks they should be plucked from their homes and made to pick potatoes for  hours a day. During the campaign, he was caught getting his friend to act as a aposswing voterapos in another disinformation scandal to hit the Conservative party.  In the video posted during the campaign, he said: These people who have to live somewhere, letaposs have them in a tent, in the middle of a field. Six oaposclock every morning, letaposs have them up, letaposs have them in the field, picking potatoes or any other seasonal vegetables, back in the tent, cold shower, lights out, six oaposclock, same again the next day. That would be my solution. Mr Anderson took the constituency of Ashfield in Nottinghamshire from Labour with , votes. Sally-Ann Hart Sally-Ann Hart sparked outrage when she appeared to suggest people with learning dficulties could work for less than the minimum wage. Ms Hartaposs opinion, which comes from a piece she wrote for the Spectator in , was branded outdated and inexcusable by disability campaigners, The Tory, who replaced Amber Rudd Hastings and Rye, is also facing two-party investigations over alleged Islamophobia and anti-Semitism - but Prime Minister Boris Johnson opted not to suspend her.

Itaposs understood the Shadow Education Secretary is preparing a bid to become Labouraposs deputy leader - not the top job. That would allow her flatmate, shadow business secretary and left-wingersapos favourite Ms Long-Bailey, a clearer run to move for the crown. It comes as Mr Corbyn indicated he would quit as Labour leader in the early part of next year after the party suffered its worst General Election defeat since . Tom Watson stepped down as deputy leader shortly before the election was called. The Mirror understands Ashton-under-Lyne MP Ms Rayner has not made a final decision, but is exploring a deputy leadership bid. In a tweet on Monday evening , Ms Rayner said she will work day and night to restore the party to its rightful place.

It is understood Mr Corbyn will address his much diminished parliamentary Labour party in Westminster on Tuesday, where he will likely face disgruntled MPs.

Official figures - slipped out hours after the election result on Friday - show % of all those who have moved from old system DLA to Personal Independence Paymentslost out financially. Some , former DLA claimants had payments stopped altogether since PIP launched in . A further , had payments decreased. Meanwhile , people had their award unchanged and , saw it rise after moving from DLA to PIP. It comes after years of complaints about the privatised assessment system - which is overruled in almost three quarters of appeals. The figures were highlighted by journalist and campaigner Alex Tfin yesterday and prompted a storm from charities today. Geoff Firmister of the Disability Benefits Consortium, which represents more than  groups, said: These figures are very worrying and we suspect many of the decisions are wrong. We would urge the new Government both to commission research to determine the extent of incorrect decisions and step up its efforts to get things right in the first place. The criteria for PIP should also be reviewed, in full consultation with disabled people. These are often le-changing amounts of money being withdrawn from people with disabilities and long-term health conditions. MS Society spokeswoman Georgina Carr said , people live with multiple sclerosis and the PIP process is failing many of them at every stage. She added: “Over the course of the election more than , of us called on the new PM to fix PIP once and for all.  The fact nearly half of those relying on the benefit have had their award reduced or stopped when moving from DLA to PIP shows just how desperately this needs to happen. We need a system that recognises what le with a fluctuating condition is like, without arbitrary and unfair measures like the PIP m rule, and we need it soon. People with MS can’t wait any longer.” James Taylor of disability equality charity Scope said the figures were extremely worrying. He added: “Consistently high levels of PIP decisions are being overturned, which demonstrates the assessment is not fit for purpose. The change from DLA to PIP has hit hundreds of thousands of people with physical and mental disabilities across the UK. The worst-hit were people with psychosis, , of whom either failed a PIP assessment entirely or had their money cut since . By comparison, , saw their payment rise. Some , arthritis sufferers had their PIP cut or stopped when they moved from DLA - while , saw it go up. Epilepsy sufferers were also badly hit, with , losing some or all of their benefits compared to , who received more. And , people with MS, , with AIDS and  with cystic fibrosis saw their money either cut or stopped. Since , even  double amputees have had their money cut when moving from DLA to PIP - while  saw their award go up. Some groups were better off on average. , blind people saw payments cut or stopped but , saw them rise. Likewise , people with learning dficulties lost out but , were better off. These figures only relate to claimants who were already on the old DLA system when they claimed PIP. And they do not include people who lost their benefits before an assessment, failed to attend an appointment, or withdrew their claim. In total, of the .million DLA claimants reassessed by October , ,had their benefit cut, ,had it stopped after an assessment, ,had it stopped before assessment and ,withdrew their claim. ,saw their award rise and ,had it unchanged. “The new government urgently needs to set out how it will overhaul the PIP assessment to make sure it works for disabled people, not against them.” Marc Francis of the welfare advice charity ZK Trust added: These statistics lay bare the devastating impact of aposwelfare reformapos on hundreds of thousands of disabled people. The new Government must make it an absolute priority to reform the discredited assessment processes for both PIP and ESA.

They probably have their own stocking from Santa, get their name on Christmas cards and maybe even wear a festive jumper. A slap-up turkey dinner is traditionally the centrepiece of the season and of course your four-legged friend will want in on that too. But itaposs really important that owners follow the rules when it comes to what they let their dog eat because serving up the wrong grub could be fatal. Weaposve spoken to the experts at Purina to find out whataposs the naughty and nice list when it comes to foods for dogs at Christmas.Purinaaposs pet nutrition experts warned: The Christmas season is a fun and festive time and there’s no reason that you can’t make your dog Christmas dinner ! Butyou want to prepare your pup a special Christmas meal, it’s important to know that there are certain foods that should be avoided as they could cause problems that y in severity from digestive issues, to possible death.So read on to find out what you can put on the menu... Can dogs eat turkey   Yes, dogs can eat turkey as long as it’s boneless and skinless. The skin is much too fatty for your dog, while the bones can cause internal damage, so ensure that you’ve taken the time to remove these from the meat before offering it to them. Can dogs eat gravy  It’s better not to. While your dog may love the taste of the gravy that humans enjoy, it’s far too salty and fatty for them and should be avoided as it could cause stomach upset, and digestive problems like sickness and diarrhoea. You can try giving your dog a similar experience with dog food containing gravy, which has been  designed for canine consumption instead. Can dogs eat stuffing  No, stuffing contains onions, spices and herbs. Onions can be toxic for your dog, while some spices and herbs can cause stomach upset. How about Christmas pudding and mince pies   Both of these tasty Christmas treats contain lots of currants, sultanas and raisins which are all highly toxic for your dog, and in some casesdigested they can even cause severe kidney failure. What about chocolate  Definitely not. Chocolate is highly toxic to dogs and even small amounts can be fatal. Chocolate contains a chemical called theobromine and when small amounts are consumed it can cause serious reactions such as agitation, tremors, convulsions, hyperexcitability and even heart problems. If you think your dog has eaten more than .g of plain or dark chocolate or g of milk chocolate, they should be taken to the vet as soon as possible. Onions, garlic and bulb vegetables  All of these vegetables are from the Allium species of plants and are highly toxic to dogs. Digestion of these can cause damage to red blood cells which could even result in anaemia. Can dogs eat pigs in blankets   Even though your dog will find bacon wrapped sausages simply delicious, pigs in blankets are too high in salt and fat for them. Pork products should only be fedit’s a lean cut and always ensure that it’s properly cooked. Macadamia nuts and walnuts  These types of nuts are common around Christmas time, but make sure that your dog doesnapost get their paws on them!  Are milk and dairy ok  Cream and cheese are a Christmas staple, but they shouldn’t be added to your dog’s Christmas dinner! Dogs find it dficult to digest lactose and large amounts of dairy can cause stomach upsets and sickness and diarrhoea. Can dogs eat cranberry sauce   Cranberry sauce is fine for your dog to eat, just make sure that it’s unsweetened and with no added nuts. Avoid giving too much but a dash over a slice of Turkey will be a tasty treat that your dog will love. Can I dish up a few potatoes  Only mashed or boiled potatoes are safe for your dog to eat and ensure that you haven’t added lots of butter or salt before offering them to your dog. Only feed these in small portions as they’re high in starch which dogs may find dficult to digest. Which vegetables are best for my dog   Green beans, Brussel sprouts, parsnips, peas and swede can all be fed as a tasty and healthy snack. However, be sure to feed vegetables in moderation asyour dog eats too many, they may get wind or even diarrhoea problems. Click here for more information on harmful substances and foods for dogs.

Maria Duncan told the court she had called Peter to say she had bought their children’s school unorms and that she was heading home. He replied: “Great, I’m leaving work now so will see you soon.” But that was the last thing he ever said to her. Mariaaposs victim impact statement has been read to Newcastle Crown Court as Ewan Ireland was sentenced to  years for the senseless murder of the popular solicitor at Eldon Square shopping centre in August. Mr Duncan, , was heading for the bus home from work when he bumped into the angry teenager, who was armed with a stolen screwdriver, Chronicle Live reports.  Ireland plunged a screwdriver into Mr Duncanaposs chest, piercing his heart and fatally wounding him. Maria, who was joined by around  family members for the hearing, listened as her words were read to the court by the crown. Richard Wright QC said: “On August  my le was ruined and my sons’ lives were ruined by a senseless and unprovoked act of a stranger. She had gone to the bus stop to pick him up but he didn’t get off. “I called him and texted him but got no reply,” she said. Soon afterwards she got a phone call from the police asking her to go to the RVI because her husband had been assaulted.  “I thought he had been injured but when I got to the RVI the doctor said there was nothing they could do to save him. ”He had been stabbed straight through the heart and nothing could be done to save him. ”Those words haunt me every single day.

They have gone back to school but are struggling. “We are all scarred by this and will be for the rest of our lives.” “Peter was always here supporting and guiding his boys through le and this has been snatched away from us. ”Our lives will never be the same now and we miss him every day.”  She added: The future now is painful. Birthdays, Christmas and holidays without Peter are just unbearable. “Peter was the perfect husband and my best friend. ”He was such a loving and caring man. ”Everyone keeps telling me Peter was always smiling and they are right. He was always smiling, he was happy, we were happy. “That’s ended, my le has ended.” A statement was also read from Peter’s eldest son, who we have agreed not to name at the request of the family. He was in the city centre, with friends at the cinema, when his dad died.  It read: As I got off the bus at the Haymarket I noticed a lot of police in the area. “I assumed something must have happened but had no idea it had anything to do with my dad.” ”When I got home my mum and brother were waiting for me and they were very upset. ”They said there had been an incident in town and dad was not coming home.” He added: It’s been very upsetting, it was so dficult seeing my dad in the viewing room at hospital and going to his funeral. ”I’m concerned for my grandparents because they are in their s.  ”This has been dficult for me, I’ve had dficulty eating and sleeping and find it hard to concentrate on my studies. ”I’ve thought about how I will miss him during key stages in our lives such as marriage andwe have children. ”I’m concerned about my mum being alone without him.” Speaking about his dadaposs killer he added: “I’ve read articles in the press about Ewan Ireland and how he had been released under investigation in relation to another incident. “I’m angry he was out and free and can’t understand why he was not locked up.

I was using at least three or four packs a week so I never even thought it was the wipes until I noticed that five to six wipes wipes started pulling out at the same time when they never used to. I read the packet that says less ingredients ingredients, so I knew they had changed them. I stopped using the wipes and got in touch with Aldi, who said on the phone they still go through the same testing. Since Iaposve stopped using them itaposs gone a lot better, not a hundred percent, still slightly scarred like marked blight, but Iaposm hoping they go soon.  Iaposm not trying to cause trouble, I just want the awareness that the wipes have changed. Chloe also added: About  weeks ago, Cleo started getting really bad nappy rash.I often use the wipes to wipe around her mouth after she’s eaten and she had a bad rash there too, I put it down to the weather and maybe an eczema flare up, but it just kept getting worse.It wasn’t until I realised the dference in the wipes seeming more wet than usual and all coming out stuck together. I mentioned to my sister about thinking they’d changed something in it as the rash on her bum looked more like a chemical burn.

Jesse Gardner didnapost padlock her food while staying in Ronald McDonald House near Evelina Childrenaposs Hospital in London because she thought aposno one could be so lowapos. Daughter Luna Webster was born with hypoplastic left heart syndrome, leaving the six-week-old with just one half of her heart and forcing her to go under the kne twice within just three days of her birth. But Jesse, , was livid to discover their food repeatedly swiped during her stay to remain nearby seriously ill Luna. Jess claim she was aposheartbrokenapos when the cruel thief knocked bottles of her frozen breast milk onto the floor during the raid, where they defrosted and more than ml had to be binned last week. Taking matters into her own hands, the enraged mum-of-one left three angry notes telling the food thief to aposf*** offapos and aposhope you enjoyed MY sausagesapos. Jesse claims she first noticed her food being swiped when her milk from the communal fridge had been used, but decided to let it slide as aposeveryone has been caught short beforeapos. But the mum was horried when she realised someone had been helping themselves to a ready meal from her freezer on Sunday [December ] and sausages the following day. On both occasions, Jesseaposs breastmilk had been scattered across the freezer-cupboard with bottles carelessly tossed aside and strewn across the floor to defrost. Jesse, from Ashford in Kent, said: It was absolutely heartbreaking for me to throw away more than mls of my milk. More than anything I feel really disappointed that this would happen in a place like Ronald McDonald. I had noticed milk go missing from our fridge but weaposve all been caught short when you need a coffee in the morning so I decided to let it slide. On Sunday evening I came back to the house and went straight to the freezer to put some more bottles of expressed breast milk in. But I noticed that there were a couple of my bottles on the floor and they had defrosted. I opened my compartment to find what had been neatly stacked bottles were all over the place and one of my ready meals was missing.  I stacked the bottles back up neatly but sadly I had to throw the bottles of milk that had been left on the floor away. This is what upset me the most. Any mother who has expressed or even breastfed their baby knows how valuable this milk is, especially to a premature baby. The next night I ed again to the same disheartening sight. Again my milk was knocked over and this time a whole bag of sausages had also disappeared. Jesse claims she and her partner Adam Webster, , had been shown the communal kitchen when they arrived and allocated lockers in the fridge and freezer - but the couple had to provide their own padlocks. The mum claims she had decided against ordering padlocks after noticing that most of the other compartments hadnapost been locked shut and thinking that no one would be aposlow enoughapos to steal their food.  Jesse, who works as a debt management consultant, said: When we first arrived the staff showed us the communal kitchen and the allocated lockers in the fridge and freezer. They said that we can lock themwe wanted but would have to provide the locks ourselves. Looking at the other compartments I only saw one that had been locked and made the decision not to buy locks. I thought, every family staying there was in the same boat as us, nobody would be low enough to steal from other families in their situation. I decided to write the notes because I was really frustrated - this was the second time it had happened. I donapost knowthere has been a reaction to my notes or not, but I have reported these incidents to the staff and they said they were very sorry to hear that this was happening. But unfortunately because there is no CCTV in the kitchen area so it would be impossible to find out who it is doing this. I have now ordered some padlocks so I can be sure this will not happen again. Luna, who was born weighing just lb oz and had since lost weight due to infections after birth, relies on her mumaposs expressed breast milk to stay strong during her treatment.  The newborn is not eligible to have open heart surgery until she is at least lbs, putting the pressure on Jesse to help her gain weight to continue her treatment. Jesse said: Luna was born with a very serious heart defect which basically means she is missing the left side of her heart. She was born prematurely five weeks early too, due to me having severe pre-eclampsia. Luna weighed just lb oz when she was born and she had complications with infections in the following weeks meant she was finding it very dficult to gain weight. My breast milk is so important to give her the nutrition she needs. Gaining weight is vital to her development, and not only for the obvious reasons but because she needs to be at least lbs to be eligible for her first big open heart surgery. Normally this surgery would be done within four days of birth.  At the moment, Luna is being kept alive with medication to support her heart and smaller procedures until she is big enough. She has only just got back up to her birth weight after losing loads of weight from being so poorly. Luckily I have a good supply and lots in the freezer in the hospital as well. Weaposre expecting that she will be in hospital until she is around six to seven months at least. Her treatment is going alright so far, but she has already had two heart surgeries within  hours of her birth. She has at least three more in the near future. Having the Ronald McDonald House is literally a le-saver for us. Itaposs a fantastic charity and the staff who work there are so helpful and kind.

Edita Butkeviciut, , was knocked out and left trapped under the three-seater for  minutes. She was only discovered after bosses at Nailco Nail Bar in Aberdeen, northeast Scotland, were unable to contact her when her lunch break was over. Doctors said she was lucky to survive the horror on December . Editaaposs partner James Ferreira, a barman, said: Itaposs been a crazy few days. The doctors have been unbelievably good to her. They said Edita is lucky to be alive. I am so grateful for the support everyone has given us in the last few days.  Two men have been charged in connection with the incident. Edita, who lives in Aberdeen, needed surgery for multiple broken bones, including a fractured spine, broken thigh and broken ankle. The nail salon employee is expected to remain at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary for seven weeks over Christmas. The former chef, originally from Lithuania, went out to Nailco Nail Baraposs yard to put some rubbish out, and then call -year-old Daniel. The horror happened during her phone call and the line went dead.  But one man who came to her aid said: I heard a wee lass screaming so called . I had to tell them three times that a sofa had fallen on top of her because they found it so hard to believe. People were bringing her blankets and we moved the bins from the rear yard so the ambulance could get in easily. Staff from Pure clothes shop - next door to Nailco - also helped Edita. I was off when it happened but as soon as I found out I drove from where I was in Cove straight to the hospital. Edita is such a strong person. Sheaposs mentally tough and has been saying aposnow I can get betterapos, Nailcoaposs manager Gemma Ritchie said.  She has managed to take a few steps since it happened. Her mother passed away a couple of years ago and her dad is in Lithuania - he is going to come and see her in January. Myself and her colleagues have all been to see her in hospital and brought her heaps of goodies. We just want to do anything we can to help. Daniel, who has been dating Edita for  years , added: Iaposve barely been away from the hospital since it happened. She had an operation to treat her ankle and another to treat her back. Edita has had pins put into her back. She has been sleeping a lot due to the pain in her shoulder and the impact of the injuries. The medical care she has had has been amazing. She means the world to me.

Elizabeth Watkins, , struggled to walk or stand when she weighed st lb at her heaviest and cut herself off from the outside world to avoid strangersapos stares and pity. The internal recruitment consultant, from Princes Risborough, Buckinghamshire, has since lost an incredible st.She had struggled with her weight since she was a child, growing up in a mixed Turkish and Armenian family which meant that many traditions and celebrations were marked with food.Elizabeth realised she couldnapost carry on as she was and knew she had to change her habits to lose weight to become healthier, so in May  she decided to have a gastric bypass. After surgery, with determination she ate just  calories every single day for an entire year to bring down her weight. This helped her to lose an impressive one stone a month and after a year she continued at just , calories to lose the rest of the weight. Within just  months she lost an incredible st and Elizabeth now weighs a much healthier st lb and wears a slim UK size . She also found the love of her le and the two love birds have just got engaged.  Elizabeth said: Iaposve been large all my le including throughout my childhood. A lot of factors for this were due to eating food for comfort during both bad times and in celebration at good times. Also, food was very important culturally. When my parents orced, I was indulged in even more foods. I used to hide away from others, and I built myself a safe world where I interacted only with people who knew me. I abstained from anything that would put me in new surroundings. As I grew, I found it hard to work, stand or sit unsupported for anything more than an hour.  I found it hard to get out of bed or off sofas without an effort on my part. As I grew, I just stayed in denial telling myself that I didnapost want to do any of those things anyway. I never really had a meaningful relationship. I didnapost have enough confidence in myself to find someone and I believed no one would find me attractive. Although I was lucky to not hear negative remarks from people, I did receive stares and it felt awful when strangers gave me looks of pity. She added: I was skipping breakfast and then eating two sandwiches, a big bag of crisps and chocolate bar for lunch. In the afternoon I ate cake and biscuits with a cup of tea with three sugars.  Then for dinner I had two large adult portions of home cooked food, ready meals or takeaway. I would fill in lots of gaps with more sweets, chocolates or ice cream. I knew I couldnapost keep going on as I had before. Iaposd seen a friend who successfully lost weight following a gastric bypass. I weighed st lb and I decided to have the same operation myself on th May . I didnapost rely on the surgery to be a magic cure. I overhauled my entire relationship with food. In my first year I religiously stuck to only  calories a day with g of protein. I managed to lose one stone every month with this approach. I relaxed a bit to , calories a day to lose the last three stone.  By January this year, she brought her weight to st lb. Elizabeth said: Iaposm a UK dress size   and Iaposm happy to also say that Iaposve since fallen in love and we just got engaged. Now I stick to eating at the same times each day. At .am Iaposll have coffee without sugar, Activia yoghurt, a plum, a clementine and handful of grapes. At  I have a bowl of MS Golden Syrup Porridge with semi-skimmed milk, a handful of blueberries and a cup of tea with sweetener.  At .pm Iaposll have a mixed salad with lemon dressing, a pack of quavers, a pear and a diet Coke. At . I have a cup of tea with sweetener with one light digestive biscuit. At . I have an apple. Then at pm I have a normal dinner with very little oil and a smaller bowl. At . I have a small bag of Haribo or one Lindt chocolate ball. She added: This might not seem the healthiest diet to have but denying myself of the things I craved meant I only lasted a week then binged. My way, I donapost deny myself anything but everything is in moderation.  Elizabeth said that since she lost the weight she is totally unrecognisable and she has also managed to reconnect with two lost friends. She adds that losing weight has completely transformed her le to being healthier and more mobile, to finally having the confidence to make new friends that will last a le time. She said: People just donapost recognise me anymore. Even my own mother doesnapost, she walked right past me. Also, itaposs been really great to reconnect with two old lost friends. It took me a long time to realise that the breakdown in our friendship was due to me. I watched them move forward in their own lives, they got married, had children and I wasnapost the supportive friend they deserved.

It was really hard because you didnapost have any strength in your legs. I kept falling down. In that moment, that was where I thought aposokay, now Iaposm going to dieapos. Then I saw the man. Thank God for that. When I saw him I was screaming so loud. But her classmate Casper wasnapost able to swim to the shore and his heart stopped while he was still in the water.He said: It was hard weather , it was very windy. The boat flipped in the middle of the sea then all the people fell out.I couldnapost swim. One of my friends came over to me and tried to help me but after some time I was clinically dead because of the temperature of the water.  After two hours in the water they were finally rescued by paramedics. Dr Steen Barnung was part of the air ambulance crew who arrived at the scene. This man comes running towards us and he repeats the same words. Theyaposre all dead. Theyaposre all dead. Theyaposre all dead. As well as stopping their hearts, the hypothermia slowed their metabolism which meant their organs had a chance of restarting as they warmed up. Dr Michael Jaeger Wansche, who was part of the team desperately fighting to save them, said: They felt cold. They were ice cold. Theyaposre clinically dead young teenagers. He said: When you are as cold as they were, we know that we can resuscitate. They are dead but not really dead. We still have a chance. When they arrived at the hospital doctors set to work warming the teenagersapos blood at one degree every  minutes.  Six hours later, they heard a heart beat. But their work was far from over and they then turned their attention to the teenagersapos brains, as two million of its cells die every minute when deprived of oxygen. The teens were all in comas so they had to wait a few days to learn the extent of the damage. Recalling the moment Casper woke up, his girlfriend said: I could see a hint of a smile and I knew he recognised me. I was so happy. I canapost describe the feeling. Everyone was so happy because everybody awoke that day. Every parent was in the waiting room and we just got out of there and screamed and jumped.

When you are full of confidence you try things you wouldn’t do when it’s low.“The only way it is going to come back is by picking up results and grafting in training.“Hopefully, we can turn things soon.”Dundee head back to Dens Park aiming to rebuild their relationship with the home faithful after some very disappointing displays.However, Byrne says the Pars are a perfect example of how quickly things can turn around after three straight wins has seen Stevie Crawford’s side shoot up the ision.Byrne said: “We’ve got to win the fans round but we have to do it for ourselves as well.“It’s down to us to get results. We know it hasn’t been good enough as a team and inidually, so we need to get results. Only those will get fans back onside.”He added: “You could see when we got our three wins in a row it pushed us right up the table and you can see that now with Dunfermline.“I think they were down in mid-table and now they are up in third. One result can change a lot in this league and we need that.“Dunfermline will come here confident after a few good results but we are at home and we need to use that advantage.“We had a decent home record up until the last few. We need to get wins here and make this a hard place to come.”Byrne began his career with Dunfermline in the old First Division before moving on to Livingston after three years.There are still one or two old faces around the club he remembers but the midfielder insists his only focus is on his own, and the team’s, performance.“It’s a club I know really well and they gave me a chance to play in the first team,” he added.“I have a lot of good memories there but it was a long time ago now. I want to concentrate on doing well for Dundee, though.“I know myself I’ve not been good enough. I’ve had some good games but I’ve not played well consistently enough week to week.“When we got those three wins in October I was starting to feel good. Inidually, I know I can be a lot better.“I’m not going to say I’m going to do this and that. I can only work as hard as possible and I’m sure it will come together again and I can get back to how I was playing last season and enjoying things again.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/12/Teddy-Bear-Toss-07-12-19-02.jpg ","title":"dundee stars shine for sick children with generous donation","story":"Hockey players made a n-ice gesture with a visit to Ninewells Hospital’s children’s ward.The Kitmart Dundee Stars took nearly  cuddly toys to the city hospital which had been hurled on to the ice at their annual teddy toss match.More than  bears hurtled on to the surface and smashed last year’s record total of  which were then given out to city charities.Dundee Stars captain, Matt Marquardt, was one of the players who handed out the toys to children at Ninewells and explained the touching ice hockey tradition. vw, px\"  He said: “It was a great afternoon delivering the teddy bears to the kids.“It’s always wonderful to help put smiles on the children’s faces during these dficult times for them and their families.“Also, we want to thank all the fans who contributed to the teddy bear toss.”Play specialist Una Paton added: “The children had great fun and were very excited to meet the team.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/12/2.49009901-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/12/2.49009901-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/12/2.49009901-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/12/2.49009901-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"man to stand trial over claims he shared intimate pictures of woman on social media","story":"A man is to stand trial over claims he shared intimate photographs of a woman on social media.Adam Gierak, , allegedly committed the offence on April  this year.Prosecutors allege that he shared photographs of the woman in intimate positions that were not previously disclosed in the public domain.Gierak allegedly posted the intimate pictures of the woman with the intent to cause her to suffer fear and alarm as a result.Appearing from custody, Gierak, of Farington Street, pleaded not guilty to the charge.Sherf Tom Hughes fixed a trial for April with an intermediate diet in March."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/10/5d95b6be541739.36658825-767x564.jpg ","title":"mcpake set to welcome back key players for dunfermline clash","story":"James McPake is set to welcome back some “key” players tomorrow against Dunfermline.The Dundee boss admits his side has been hit by absences during their bad run of form lately.With one of the league’s in-form teams checking in at Dens Park tomorrow, James is hopeful his side will get a boost from some added competition.A big miss has been left-back Jordan Marshall with a hamstring injury while striker Andrew Nelson may also be fit toto the squad.Centre-back Josh Meekings just fell short of fitness for the clash away to Arbroath last weekend and should be OK tomorrow.James said: “It was a really young bench at Arbroath.

Argyll and Bute Council will receive a total of £. million to fund their services in - which, taken alongside the council tax increase they have decided to implement, will give the council an additional £. million this year compared to last – a rise of . per cent.They will also receive their fair share of the extra funding that has already been announced during the current financial year including £ million for teacher’s pay and £. million for increased teacher’s pension contributions.The council could do a number of things to improve its own prospects.You and your administration could work hard to influence the COSLA formula which does not favour rural authorities with falling populations. The Scottish Government Cabinet Secretary for Finance has confirmed to us that he is always willing to consider suggestions, through COSLA, from inidual local authorities.You and your administration could be more imaginative in streamlining central management and devolving delivery and local decision-making closer to local people.You and your administration could maximise income whilst remembering that local businesses are the leblood of recovery. The recent massive hike in inspection charges for food products is an example of the wrong decision being likely to damage the economy rather than enhance it.You and your administration could maximise your assets by working with communities. The council has been slow to undertake any signicant asset transfer which could lead to useful and productive partnerships.You and your administration could be more responsive to, and careful with, communities. The waste of money and time on things like the abortive Traffic Regulating Order for Mull and Iona indicates where you are not using resource wisely and storing up dficulties for the future.You and your administration could ensure that any cuts do not fall on essential services needed for future success. The proposed reduction in educational support staff is an example of where a choice is being made that will not only be counterproductive in terms of our collective future and wellbeing, but will also lose the council local sympathy and support.And you and your administration could prepare to use the already agreed additional £ million for the rural growth deal – coming jointly from the Scottish and UK Governments # to make a long term dference in your performance by instituting a step change in the local economy.As your local constituency parliamentarians we are committed to ensuring the maximum resource comes from central government to Argyll and Bute.We are always happy to work alongside, and in support of, the council and we would be keen to meet to help you develop a detailed plan for the future of the area we are all elected to serve. But we must all be straight with local people and explain that responsibility for the dficulties that the council is experiencing do not all lie at the door of the Scottish Government, and therefore nor do all the possible solutions.Michael Russell MSP and Brendan O’Hara MP"},{"url":null,"title":"negotiating the modern world","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhy is it so hard to negotiate the modern world That is the question asked by Dame Helen Mirren in the Radio Times.

Last year the SNP councillors supported the administration’s budget, this year there were only slight dferences between the administration’s budget and the SNP’s one.It would be great to see our MP and MSP work with the council to make the case to the Scottish Government for more money for Argyll and Bute. COSLA has made a very clear request of the Scottish Government in terms of funding for local councils next year – three per cent plus inflation. The choices facing the council would be substantially dferentthis was delivered and of course it’s the Scottish Cabinet, including our MSP, who actually make the decisions.The fact is that over the past  years, the council has had to make savings of over £million. That means real hardship for many local people – many jobs lost, many services withdrawn. That is the sad reality.Like all councillors I#m sure, I would be happy to work with the local MP and MSP to make the case for more funding for Argyll and Bute.Councillor Aileen Morton, Argyll and Bute Council leaderSir,Regarding council leader Aileen Morton’s comments in the edition of the Advertiser dated October  # why should the public tolerate more cuts to their services year on yearthey are consistently paying their council tax and other taxes This seems unfair and should be challenged. Surely council leader Morton should be saying to the Scottish Government that the funding provided is not enough and we can’t make any more cuts.Instead of a reduced budget, the council should be asking for an increased budget to operate services when you consider all the cutbacks to their budget over the past few years.Perhapsthe situation was made clear to the Scottish Government by local councils that annual cuts to local authority services cannot be sustained, this situation will stop.It is unfair on council staff too, with threats of cutbacks having a negative effect on their own jobs through no fault of their own. Adding more work to an employee already struggling with their workload causes more stress which is not good for staff or their employer.Instead of accepting a reduced budget, please therefore can the budget be challenged and not accepted Peter Laing, LochgilpheadSir,Being non-funded, Mojo Festival of Original Music relies on my own initial outlay and the kindly volunteering of the team to help achieve at least a small bonus for all the hard working and talented acts who put on a really good night at the event.This year, even though we had more expenses, we had an even bigger attendance which meant we made roughly the same profit as last yearto share out, giving the bands £ each. Also the bands sold tickets along with their merchandise to give an extra £ approx to the cause. We had a total of  people in attendancewhich is our best ever turnout.The best part though was how much everyone enjoyed what was a night of some of the best original music Argyll has to offer # and you can#t put a price on that. Well done to all who were there and supported the whole event.Dan and crew, Mojo organisersSir,Among the many concerns caused by you-know-what is the very real fear that hospitals and high street pharmacies will run out of vital medical supplies which would normally arrive from factories in Malta, Hungary and Poland.So why are generic medicines not made in Lochgilphead, in Campbeltown and in Rothesay  After all, calcium supplement tablets are made in Galashiels by a Japanese brewery company.Glasgow Health Board built a brand new wee factory on the Western Infirmary Glasgow University campus  years to manufacture some but not all of their requirements. Not only did this save a great deal of money but the board  also earned considerable extra income by selling their products to other health boards, including Dumbarton and Argyll.All in all, the costs of building and equipping the Hillhead factory proved to be a very sound investment indeed.Duncan I Macdougall, TarbertSir,I write following last week#s open letter by SNP politicians Mike Russell and Brendan O#Hara in which they attempted to evade responsibility for the budget problems facing Argyll and Bute Council.These comments display extraordinary hypocrisy, revealing how out-of-touch these SNP politicians are with the realities of the challenges facing Argyll and Bute Council.The financial pressures on this council are a direct consequence of the repeated unfair financial settlements imposed on the council by the SNP government over the last  years.Brendan O#Hara should get on the phone to Nicola Sturgeon and demand a fair deal for Argyll and Bute instead of blaming everyone .Donald Cameron MSP, Highlands and Islands"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters human impact on climate change then and now","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowHuman activity from the industrial revolution onwards is causing global warming which,not halted, will have catastrophic consequences.Now scientists suggest that human activity several centuries earlier also caused climate change*.

Those of us familiar with it know full well to treat it with respect and to be particularly careful when coming away from Cairnbaan towards Lochgilphead.Like Rev Mackenzie, I am aware of a number of accidents there over the last  months. I would estimate at least five,not more. This is a hugely disproportionate amount compared with other junctions on this road. That fact alone should ring alarm bells with the roads authority.This, however, is not the be-all-and-end-all. I have personally witnessed more near misses at the junction than I would care to mention. The problem comes particularly, but not exclusively, during the height of the tourist season with drivers who are not familiar with the area.Rev Mackenzie quite rightly points out there is a deceptive vista that appears to make the road look like a long straight one and despite the presence of warning signs, for some reason, these are ignored.I thought it rather a trite response from Argyll and Bute Council, which is effectively saying the junction meets all legal requirements sign wise and motorists need to be more aware. It is effectively shrugging its shoulders about the reality of the situation and refusing to take the constant presence of risk seriously.It really does need someone to come up with a genuine solution that will eliminate these risks as far as humanly possible and hopefully curtail the number of incidents that will inevitably occur in futurenothing positive is done.Peter J Garrett, Ardrishaig.Sir,We are now into gloomier weather conditions and on occasions a low sun casts long shadows on our roads.I have advice for cyclists who venture on to the highways wearing black hats, black jackets, black trousers, black shoes, carrying black bags and riding their black bikes.Wear clothes that enhance your visibility, please.Earlier this year, in such conditions, I passed such a cyclist on my way into Oban. He was just starting on the incline out of Kilmore so the black tarmac was his background.It was his moving right foot on the pedal I noticed.

The games were well contested, and the Argyll boys could have won both games. Two lapses of concentration against Lomond let them in for easy tries and only two points separated the teams in the Shawlands game at the end, when SAS had been in the lead for large parts of the match.The whole team thought it was important to finish the group with a good home win.The boys set out their stall early at MacRae Park when a contested ruck ended with a good turnover from SAS number seven McLean and a great pass out to winger Gritten from number eight McColl-Smith, who then released MacKay. The full back ran  yards to score under the posts and then convert his own try.SAS were next on the score sheet when Captain Donald Self went over the whitewash. MacKay converted and SAS were  –  up.Some good play from both teams was making for a great game, enjoyed by a large home crowd. Pupils were given the chance to watch the game and they made their voices heard and, spurred on by the crowd, Euan MacArthur was next on the score sheet and once again MacKay converted the try.The first half finished - to the home team.The second half started with Boclair coming back at SAS and, after some good running, they pulled a try back.SAS found themselves under sustained pressure and soon Boclair had a second try. Only one try was converted, and the score was -. Another try, this one converted, for Boclair and the pressure was really on.South Argyll thought they had secured the game when Ellis went over and grounded the ball only to realise he had gone over the dead ball line. No try and the pressure was on again. Minutes later, after some great forward work to turn the ball over, McArthur again went over for South Argyll#s fourth try. Another two points from MacKay made the score -.After the restart Boclair went all out to get another score. Great defensive work from the SA backs kept Boclair out for a sustained period of attack until, with only seconds to go, the scored their fourth try.As the conversion attempt fell short the final whistle blew and South Argyll celebrated a hard-fought win.While South Argyll didn not get out of the group stages they can be very pleased with third place,only one point behind second spot."},{"url":null,"title":"a garden of festive delight","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowNot your common or garden evening of entertainment, a special festive concert will be held next week near Minard.Friends of Crarae will present their annual carol concert at Crarae Garden on Thursday December .The evening will feature Cumlodden choir and guests and the audience is welcome to sing along.Festive refreshments and a raffle will be available at the concert, which opens at .pm for a .pm start.Tickets will cost £ on the door, and the National Trust for Scotland shop will be open for those last-minute gts."},{"url":null,"title":"an ardrishaig piano recital to remember","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSaturday November  was a cold and frosty day and, whilst the audience had the luxury of warm hats and coats to fend off the chill of a  degrees centigrade hall, this was not afforded to soloist of the day, the -year-old Ukrainian Russian pianist Vitaly Pisarenko.When many would, however, have struggled with the cold, from his first entry he appeared unphased by it and indeed gave us a memorable exhibition of astonishing virtuosity and musicianship.Each half of his well-balanced programme started with early Beethoven sonatas, beginning with his first, Op. No. . Dedicated to his hero, Haydn, this was delivered with the reverence it deserved and the clarity and drive of the final Prestissimo would have pleased the dedicatee no end.The first half ended with two Chopin Polonaises # Op.  Nos.  and  # and his third Ballade. The second Polonaise was particularly impressive with its menacing opening figure and Vitaly#s judicious use of the sustaining pedal lent great clarity to all three pieces and indeed to all his recital.After the intermission came Beethoven#s Sonata Op.  No. . By this time Beethoven had developed his own inidual persona and the three contrasting movements of this work were beautully executed, particularly the Adagio with its slow melody and stuttering accompaniment and the contrasting fluidity of the final Allegretto.Next we heard Bela Bartok#s Suite Op. . This was typical Bartok from beginning to end, spikey, angular and generally very speedy and played with incredible precision. When I said to Vitaly that it sounded fiendishly dficult he retorted: # It#s actually quite easy I learned it in three days.#While not normal fare for our audience this, hopefully, was an interestingFirebird is probably Stravinsky#s best known work apart from, maybe, his #Rite of Spring#, and both were originally written as ballet scores. However, due to their popularity, over time these and other works of his have been transcribed by ious people for all sorts of instrumental combinations, and the Agosti transcription of Firebird for piano solo that Vitaly played as his finale is probably the most well known.

Halftime - for Star.The second half was again dominated by the Lochgilphead boys. The fourth goal was an excellent solo effort from Caskie and effectively killed the game as a contest.Aitken added goal number five when his fierce strike from wide zipped into the net. The sixth and final goal came in the final minutes when the Cathcart keeper parried a long range effort which was pounced on by West who placed the rebound beyond the unlucky goalie.A great result against second placed Cathcart which hopefully sets Star up nicely for the rest of the season."},{"url":null,"title":"peebles-galashiels-students-meet-teaching-begins","story":"SENIOR students from Peebles and Galashiels met up last week in order to get to know each other before todays classes begin.On Friday, December , students met at Galashiels Academy to familiarise themselves with their new schoolmates.William Adams, a Head Prefect at Peebles High School, said: \"Being taken from our normal environment so abruptly was a shock to the system so were all grateful to get back into it.

This output is expected to increase next week, when they will employ an additional three workers.At present  bags of the #queenie# scallops are being processed daily. By the beginning of December it is hoped that  bags will be handled.Mr George McMillan said that it is hoped eventually to employ from  to  people. He stressed that meantime Davaar Seafoods was occupying only part of the slaughterhouse building on a temporary basis. He mentioned that the firm was #hoping to get the whole building#.Samples of Davaar Seafoods produce were sent to consumers in Chicago and Paris and opinions passed on the quality of the samples were favourable.The scallop processing method employed is a simple one. The shellfish are dipped into hot water, and the shells open. The insides of the creatures are removed and scraped clean. Then the meat is thoroughly washed.Shellfish factories are operating successfully in Tarbert and Port Ellen.Harmony Hour guests of R.A.F. on thThe th of November,  will long be remembered by the members of Campbeltown Harmony Hour Club who were guests at an excellent fireworks display at R.A.F.

Burnley Campbell, and others also extended a cordial welcome, the men being cheered as they marched with the colours to headquarters.The cadre was entertained at a civic luncheon in McColl#s Hotel in the afternoon.Those present said they were delighted to welcome home the local battalion. Throughout the war they had watched with pride the heroic work performed by the battalion, and they would remember with gratitude the sacrices that had been made.Maclachlan of Maclachlan mentioned that the total casualties of the  th Argylls during the war were  officers and  other ranks.The honours of the regiment received were one V.C., two D.S.O.#s, many M.C.#s and M.M.#s, and other lesser honours.Major Lockie, who commanded the cadre, acknowledged the cordial welcome they had received.A day of remembranceThe King#s desire that the first anniversary of the Armistice should be observed by a two minutes silence in reverent remembrance of the glorious dead was fulfilled all over the country on Tuesday.In London wreaths were laid on the Cenotaph in Whitehall. These included one from the King and Queen, one from President Poincaré and one from the Prime Minister.The scenes in the streets of Glasgow were full of solemnity, when all traffic stopped and the crowds stood in reverent silence as the clocks stuck eleven. Work ceased in the Clyde shipyards and on the shipping in the river.In Campbeltown the signal was given by the sounding of three long syren blasts from H.M.S. Thames, and the fallen were honoured by the uncovering of heads.Of course in a comparatively quiet country town the tribute lacked the impressiveness that characterised it in busy cities.In the Grammar School the scholars assembled in the large room at .a.m., when the rector gave a short address on the meaning of the celebration, read the King#s message, and explained shortly the aims of the League of Nations Union.A hymn as then sung, the two minutes# silence observed, and after the National Anthem had been sung, the pupils were dismissed for the day.In Dalintober School the period of silence was similarly observed and the scholars were afterwards dismissed."},{"url":null,"title":"leader november 15 2019","story":"Remembrance is one of the main topics in this week#s Courier.We increasingly rely on our youngsters to keep the memory of the First and Second World Wars alive as those who experienced them first-hand # and second-hand # fade away.Renowned First World War poet Wilfred Owen, who was himself killed in action in , wrote of #the old lie# # #Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori#, which translates from Latin as #It is sweet and proper to die for one#s country#.Remembrance should not be about glorying war, but remembering the horric atrocities which are committed in its name so that in future they may be avoided.The four young people who took part in the service at Glenbarr War Memorial are direct descendants of men from the area who fell in battle.

With a few patches of articial snow here and there it could well have been in Siberia. There were great hoots and laughter at the showing whenever those in the audience recognised their pals in unorm with rles at the ready or being carried in on stretchers.

Social care, mental health and primary care services are all crying out for more support, and better resourcing them would take the pressure off the accident and emergency service.The SNP government have failed to meet the AE target time every month for over two years. They need to take swt action to properly prepare AE departments before winter sets in. A good place to start would be publishing the integrated workforce plan that staff were told would be out last year. Another broken SNP promise.Yours,Alan Reid, Liberal Democrat candidate for Argyll  Bute.Connected nationSir,Before I address Alan Reid’s comments on superfast broadband , it ought to be remembered that this is the same ex Liberal Democrat MP who propped up the Tories and imposed years of toxic austerity measures on Scotland, shrinking the UK economy by £ billion, imposing Dickensian social policies # like the Bedroom Tax # on the poorest in society, and voluntarily choosing to make Tory cuts possible.The Liberal Democrats are deeply stained by austerity and they will remain, rightly, untrusted as the Tories little helpers.Mr Reid berates the SNP government for alleged failure to deliver superfast broadband. Yet, inspite of the unique dficulties in delivering superfast broadband in rural Scotland, which BT described as the ‘most signicant geographic challenge in the UK, and arguably Europe’, the latest Ofcom ‘Connected Nations’  report shows that Scotland outperforms the UK as a whole when it comes to new broadband deployment.There remains work to be done and the Scottish government is committed to delivering the best possible value and completing the roll out by  .Mr Reid is right to say that contracts have not been finalised yet, but with telecommunications and broadband reserved to Westminster, the changes in contracts imposed by UK ministers mean that bidders require additional time to recalibrate their bids.It is up to Mr Reid to carp from the sidelines, but readers can be confident that this SNP Scottish government will deliver a future proof network that will make Scotland one of the best connected places in Europe.Yours,Ron Wilson,Secretary Kintyre SNP.Coffee thanksSir,This year our World’s Biggest Coffee Morning fundraiser entered its th year.In community centres, schools and workplaces, thousands of coffee mornings were held across Scotland to raise money and help us support people affected by cancer.I would like to offer a huge and heartfelt thanks to every single one of your readers who held or attended a coffee morning – your energy and generosity never ceases to amaze us.Whether it’s specialist cancer nurses, support workers or benefit advisors, we can only offer the support that people with cancer need thanks to the tireless fundraising efforts of our supporters.The number of people who need our help is growing, and we want to offer support to everyone who needs it.

But she asked why the young woman was so determined to climb the stairs, even though she was clearly very ill and finding it dficult.This led to me mentioning who Anne Frank was and that people visit the attic because itrsquos the place where she hid.ldquoWhy was she hiding  was the inevitable question, just as bedtime arrived.I was suddenly presented with a dilemma, not so much that bedtime was now delayed, but how to explain to a six-year-old the depth of evil and hatred that was the reason for Anne Frank having to hide in an attic with her family. And then whether to explain what happened to her after she was discovered.I knew that I couldnrsquot just ignore her question. So we searched for images of Anne Frank, which meant she became a real person for my daughter.Skye studied her and said she looked nice and kind, and asked again why she was hiding.I explained that people who didnrsquot even know her hated her just because she was a bit dferent to them. I couldnrsquot explain the horrors of genocide and concentration camps, but she understood that Anne Frank and her family must have been really scared to hide in an attic.ldquoWhat happened to her  asked Skye as she dressed for bed.This was not a bedtime story I wanted to tell. Indeed, for a child so young, it was not a story I wanted to tell at all. She knows there are bad people and staying safe is important, but we feel the need to protect our children from the evil and hatred that is sadly so deep-seated.But it is at this young age that the seeds of intolerance and hatred can be plantedthey are not encouraged and helped to feel empathy to others, including those who are dferent in fact, especially those who are dferent.So I told her a lsquochild-friendlyrsquo version of Anne Frankrsquos story,there can be such a thing. I gave no details of the horror of the Holocaust but we imagined how she must have missed her family when they were split up, and how sad it was that she died not long before the war ended.She wanted to look at Anne Frankrsquos photo again and say goodnight to her.ldquoThank goodness that could never happen to us here, could it dad ldquoNo, that is not going to happen, and we have to make sure it doesnrsquot happen to anyone  either, I reassured her.I felt quite emotional as I went downstairs with my kids sleeping safely in their cosy beds. I thought of the families in Syria who cannot keep their children safe from hatred and violence. I knew that such horrors could happen anywhere, at any time yes, even here yes, maybe even to us or our neighbours or friends. In fact, hatred of dference is indeed amongst us.A friend of mine was on a bus heading from East Lothian into Edinburgh last week and witnessed a horrible racist verbal assault on a Polish family. The horric murders in London are also part of the same hatred of dference ndash a man so full of hatred for people who think dferently that he randomly killed two amazing young people.Hatred is a virus that can infect any society and any inidual in it. History has taught us that fanning its flames can be an easy way for politicians to win power. But like real fire, once itrsquos released it can spread and destroy uncontrollably.People say fight fire with fire, but here the comparison ends, for we cannot fight hatred with hatred. Hatred only spawns more of it.And so I searched for words of that remarkable young woman Anne Frank, who left her diary behind, unknowing that it would be her gt to the world. Words I could share with my daughter, from one young thinking child to another. Despite writing at a time of unimaginable fear and horror, in her diary she has left us a timeless message of hope that comes from her rejection of hate:ldquoItrsquos dficult in times like these ideals, dreams and cherished hopes rise within us, only to be crushed by grim reality. Itrsquos a wonder I havenrsquot abandoned all my ideals, they seem so absurd and impractical. Yet I cling to them because I still believe, in spite of everything, that people are truly good at heart.It is our responsibility to live up to that inspiring message from a young woman who was a victim of the hate she rejected utterly to show our children, our family and friends, our colleagues and those we meet on a bus, that love, tolerance, empathy and respect of dference is the counter to hate.And we should expect no less from all our politicians."},{"url":null,"title":"bid-replace-old-boxing-gym-housing","story":"REM Associates have lodged planning applications seeking to replace the th century former Tranent Methodist Church building on Bridge Street with four two-bedroom flats.They submitted the applications on behalf of businessman and premises owner Alex Brown, who founded Bronx Boxing Gym, which was based at the old church, a decade ago.In recent years, Mr Brown had no involvement in the running of the boxing club but still let its boxers use the building.However, costly repairs were needed to make the former church safe, which led to the boxing club vacating the premises.Earlier this year, the club moved to the newly established Fit-in Fitness Gym on High Street, Musselburgh.A planning application has been submitted for the former church building and the east wall which faces the car park on Coal Neuk to be demolished.Drawings included within a second planning application show designs for erecting four two-bedroom flats with a basement car park with space for four cars."},{"url":null,"title":"familys-spectacular-christmas-lights-display","story":"The Woods family open their very own Santarsquos grotto and decorate their home each year to raise money for Mission Christmas and Cash for Kids.This year, there are more than , lights at their family home and in their garden.Dad Stevie Woods said the family ldquojust love Christmas and hope the stream of visitors theyrsquore expecting will leave donations for charity, either cash or a toy.They raised pound on their opening night.The lights were switched on for visitors on Sunday at pm and will be on from .pm to pm daily until Christmas.The grotto is open for visitors, who can enjoy the Disney characters painted on the inside and the Christmas films playing.There is also a Santa Sleigh where children can get their photograph taken, and this year there will be the addition of a Santa train, which Stevie made himself out of whisky barrels.He said: ldquoLast year we raised about pound so wersquore hoping to beat that.

Age, of course, is just a number and state of mind and I have much to keep me youthful.What did help was meeting up with an old friend last week. As we sat together sharing memories of our youth and the shenanigans we got up to  years ago, I had a disorientating sense of time. It seemed impossible that so many years had passed since the moments we remembered had taken place. Those moments were so present for us. As another clicheacute says, it was asit was yesterday.We both complimented each other on how young we looked but I think this was because we both saw the younger person underneath the wrapping made by time. Society judges so much by appearance, we all do. But when we meet an old friend, even when we have not been in touch for many years, we see the person we knew, eventhe exterior has changed. As the philosopher Henry David Thoreau once said: ldquoItrsquos not what you look at that matters, itrsquos what you see.Who can say honestly they have not judged someone because of what they look like  I am as guilty as anyone . As I said, we all do it on the bus, in the queue at the supermarket while we wait our turn, everywhere. We glimpse at people, avoiding eye contact, but making immediate judgement on the way they look. Sometimes itrsquos negative, sometimes envious, sometimes positive and admiring but always superficial. And I know, like everyone , I too am likewise judged.Itrsquos a human habit, perhaps a primeval instinct in which we must quickly judge people for our safety. But of course outward appearance gives no clue to someonersquos character and real qualities. We must know something of that person first before we can judge on that.And this means seeing beyond what we look at. And to do this we need eye contact, a smile, a friendly gesture and the exchange of some words. We need to connect to the person inside. And the irony is, while there are more of us than ever sharing ever-bigger spaces, we are ever more disconnected from each other.The truth Irsquove come to realise is that you donrsquot have to be an old friend with someone to see their inner self, you just need to see beyond what appears to you. We have another primeval instinct and that is to detect the warmth of a character. But we cannot do thatwe only see what we look at and make no attempt to connect.My resolution, even before New Year, is to do this more often. To smile, say some friendly words and not judge or assume things. I think we actually all need more of this, with people we donrsquot know as much as those we do.As someone once said, a stranger is a friend you havenrsquot met yet.

to the potential for accidents with youngsters playing next to the car park.The transport hub, which would include a car park with somewhere between  and  spaces, could also include ldquobus

it easier for people to access local businesses, essential services and tourist attractions.However, business owners were among those raising concerns about the proposals.George James, who runs the East Lothian TV and Video Repair Centre on High Street, felt that the last-minute changes were an attempt by the council to ide people.He said: ldquoIt is clearly isive and an effort to stop people

everyone that the time has changed ndash again.Project consultants WYG will be in attendance on Monday and will have a number of display boards showing the extent of proposals.Council transport officers will also be in the Town House and people will have the opportunity to ask questions.A council spokesperson said: ldquoThe public lsquodrop-inrsquo part is now -.pm and it has been extended due to securing availability of key members of the project team being available to answer public questions.ldquoInvitations to the stakeholdersrsquo meeting are for two representatives from a range of

It was a massive punch in the gut for Labourrsquos youthful idealists in their Twitter bubble, who canrsquot understand why working-class people would vote for anEton-educated Tory.In Scotland, they didnrsquot. The SNP surprised itself by almost repeating the tsunami SNP surge of . An astonishing achievement for Nicola Sturgeon and confirmation that Scotland and England are growing further apart faster.When Boris Johnson hailed a victory for ldquoone nation Conservatism, he inadvertently spoke the truth. It did apply in only one nation: England. Scotland is now, in a very real sense, another country. There may not be a referendum next year ndash Boris Johnsonrsquos crushing majority in Westminster will see to that. But something will have to give.Resurgent Scottish nationalism, and the most unionist Prime Minister in Westminster since Margaret Thatcher, is an unstable and potentially explosive combination. Everything and anything is now possible, including a court battle over a Scottish referendum. Nicola Sturgeon is demanding that Holyrood gets the power to call referendums. That wonrsquot happen.But donrsquot be surprisedBoris Johnson makes a blue-sky offer of federalism hersquos supported it in the past. As the UK leaves the European Union ndash the one certainty after Thursday ndash Johnson will try to do a side deal with Scotland, as he did with the DUP. Just donrsquot expect it to be all that it seems.Hopes that a hung parliament would deliver a Scottish independence referendum, with the SNP striking a deal with Labour, died on Thursday night. It was curtains too for the Corbyn project. Though there will likely be a continuing civil war in the Labour Party over the succession. Shades again of the s.The first General Election I covered was , so there was a distinct sense of having been through this movie before. Indeed, I wrote in this paper only three weeks ago that Labourrsquos manesto might end up as another ldquolongest suicide note in history. That was how Labourrsquos  effort was famously described by the Labour MP Gerald Kaufman.Some left-wing folk said it was somehow morally wrong to criticise that document, with its intergalactic spending plans improbably financed by a % tax hike on people earning over pound,. Imperviousness to constructive criticism has been one of the hallmarks of Corbynism. Labour chose to listen to the hyperventilating keyboard warriors on Twitter who attack anyone deviating from the line as a ldquoTory shill.Yet, it should have been clear to everyone that there was something deeply suspect about Labourrsquos multiple manesto giveaways. The % pay hike for public-sector workers, free broadband, cheap rail fares, the four-day week, the belated bung of pound billion to the Waspi women. This wasnrsquot social democracy, it was retail politics gone mad. It culminated in Labourrsquos promise that every family would be pound, better off. People just arenrsquot that stupid.If Labour had confined itself to a few well-defined and credible offers on health spending, tuition fees and rail nationalisation, it might have worked. Thatrsquos what the Tories did, with their simple message of new hospitals and more nurses. However, the manesto was only part of Labourrsquos problem. Corbyn was also sunk by his policy, or lack of it, on Brexit.How Labour thought that they could win with their leader pretending to have no view on the biggest issue facing the country in half a century defies belief. Again, s of the galaxy on social media insisted that ldquohersquos just being an honest broker ... keeping options open ... uniting the country. Nonsense. It was an irresponsible abdication of leadership. Labourrsquos policy on Brexit was as dishonest as it was cynical. Dishonest: because everyone knew that Jeremy Corbyn was a lelong opponent of the European Union. Cynical: because Labourrsquos metropolitan Remainers hoped ldquoconstructive ambiguity would fool provincial Brexit voters into believing that Corbyn really would renegotiate a better Brexit deal in three months.No-one bought it. The Labour leaderrsquos inability to say who would actually lead his Brexit negotiation, still less campaign for it, was one of the many face-palm moments in a campaign that left my face and palm red raw. Blaming BBC bias only made it worse.Of course, Corbynrsquos personality and style of politics was also aturn-off, and the press made a lot of his past associations with IRA supporters and Hamas. But theyrsquod tried that unsuccessfully in . This time, the Labour leader somehow managed to be even more unpopular in Scotland than his bumptious Etonian Tory rival. How could that possibly be  Hadnrsquot John McDonnell all but promised a second independence referendum  Arenrsquot Scottish voters supposed to be more left-wing The aversion to Corbyn was mostly down to the national question. But I suspect many Scots shared with Labour voters in England an aversion to Corbynrsquos particular brand of London Labour politics. His sympathy, however justied, with the Palestinian cause, obscure LGBTQIA+ demands and, of course, his views on immigration and defence. It left many patriotic provincial voters uncomfortable.This doesnrsquot mean that socially conservative Labour voters are all homophobes and racists. Polls repeatedly confirm that the vast majority of English, and Scots, voters harbour no ill will towards gay people or racial minorities. But they arenrsquot exactly passionate about transgender toilet arrangements or uncontrolled immigration. And millions voted for BrexitThinly-disguised contempt for working-class Brexit voters was evident throughout the campaign. Labour-friendly comedians like Steve Coogan and Nish Kumar condemned them as ldquoignorant and racist. Did they think they werenrsquot listening Labour activists on Twitter talked about the ldquowhite working class astheyrsquore a lumpen mass of unaddressed bigotry. The Corbynite intellectual, Paul Mason, called the election ldquoa victory of the old over the young, racists over people of colour, selfishness over the planet. Not perhaps the best way to attract back core Labour voters in Blyth, Bolsover, Sedgefield.What middle-class intellectuals failed to understand is that, in post-crash Britain, the politics of nation has largely eclipsed the politics of class. The election results north and south of the Border may appear wildly dferent, but they are both expressions of populist nationalism.Brexit is essentially English nationalism. It is a revolt by people the writer David Goodhart calls the ldquosomewheres, in the provinces, against the remain-voting elites, or ldquoanywheres, in urban centres. ldquoSomewheres feel left out by globalisation, as their jobs have gone abroad and mass immigration has altered their communities.Tories since Disraeli have understood the potency of national identity as a unying force. People who lack the mobility conferred by a university education tend to love their country. They have little  to hold on to in an age of insecurity and rapid change. Get Brexit Done was an English version of Make America Great Again.And though the politics are dferent, Brexit is not so far removed from what happened in Scotland during and after the financial crash. In , the Scottish working classes in the housing estates and inner cities entered politics in unprecedented numbers to vote for independence. The Yes campaign was inspired by feelings of national identity, community and Scotsrsquo love of their country. Plus the hope that an independent Scottish Government would look after them better than remote Westminster.It may be naiumlve, it may be nationalistic, it certainly is populist. But identity is a powerful political mobiliser in an age of insecurity and mistrust. People want to belong, to feel that they are part of something bigger than themselves. National identity gives them that.But the problem with nationalism is that tends to be exclusive. Scotland and England are expressing identity in dferent and contradictory ways ndash the former in a spirit of pro-European internationalism the latter in a more inward-looking, nativist anti-Europeanism. These are irreconcilable opposites.Nicola Sturgeon has often said that she would like to drop the word ldquonational from the SNPrsquos name. She clearly feels uncomfortable with the politics of nationalism, despite having been an SNP supporter all her le. And she has good reason to be wary, given the behaviour of some European nationalist parties.Her task now will be to contain the fervour of her triumphant party and constructively channel their hatred of English conservatism. It wonrsquot be easy. Boris Johnson has provoked the Scots by ruling out any referendum for at least five years. Scotland is about to be dragged kicking and screaming out of Europe.Sturgeon is a cautious politician, unlike her predecessor Alex Salmond, and will not tolerate civil disobedience or unconstitutional behaviour.But like it or not, she has a fight on her hands. A national reckoning is coming."},{"url":null,"title":"Marianne Taylor  Seven things we learned from the 2019 election","story":"What we do know for sure, however, is that many folk down south were persuaded that they really, really want Brexit. A fundamental sht has taken place, not only in Englandrsquos mindset, but the manner in which its voters were induced to back Mr Johnson.What  have we learned from this extraordinary election  Well, herersquos my initial take. I look forward to hearing yours.. The ruthless, despicable tactics used by Dominic Cummings and Vote Leave to win the EU referendum campaign were not an aberration. As Mr Johnsonrsquos victory highlights, they are the new norm. Wersquore going to have to get used to digital s and elements of the media spreading misinformation like wildfire, possible foreign interventions, bamboozling distraction techniques, blatant dishonesty during broadcast interviews. How the Conservativesrsquo opponents respond will be crucial. Play it clean and be crushed, or get dirty, too, and join in them in the moral sell-out  You decide.. Simple slogans ndash especially those created by the aforementioned Cummings ndash really do work. By the end of the campaign just about every voter vox-popped in England seemed to be parroting the ldquowe just need to get Brexit done line. This undoubtedly helped consolidate the pro-Brexit vote around the Tories.. Labourrsquos claim to be the party of working people no longer stands up. Jeremy Corbyn and his disciples can blame media bias for his partyrsquos disastrous result till the cows come home but it wonrsquot change the fact that their man and his policies were a monumental turn-off across the partyrsquos traditional heartlands. Labourrsquos disastrous stance on Brexit didnrsquot help, but the rejection goes deeper. The fact that people living in poverty believed Boris Johnson would look after their interests better than a lelong socialist is both grim and fascinating. Sadly for the poor, we canrsquot bet on Labour facing up to these harsh truths any time soon.. Speaking of Labour claims that donrsquot stand up, we can surely all now agree that a Labour government is not going to ldquosave Scotland, either from the Tories or independence. This ridiculous and out-dated argument was still being peddled on doorsteps, not only by London-based Labour but many in the Scottish party, too. It really would be in the partyrsquos interests to accept that comparing independence ndash which for the vast majority of supporters is based on a simple desire for self-determination ndash to Farage-style nationalism is not only highly insulting, but as wersquove seen for years, electoral suicide. There have been signs over the weekend that at least some in Scottish Labour are waking up. Too little, too late  Quite possibly.. The evisceration of the Lib Dems tells us that Jo Swinson ran a flawed campaign based on a fatal overestimation of her own popularity. It also suggests England doesnrsquot like three-party politics.Or hung parliaments. You can kiss goodbye to any thoughts of electoral reform.. The SNP-Tory stand-off over Indyref cannot go on forever. Both sides are already upping the ante, with Mr Johnson and Michael Gove categorically ruling out another referendum, and Nicola Sturgeon intensying the narrative with talk of Scotland being ldquoheld prisoner. Such shadow boxing plays well to both partiesrsquo core support, of course, but eventually one side will have to go for the knockout blow. Itrsquos hard to see what more Ms Sturgeon can do in the face of such denials and hypocrisyfrom a tin-eared PM buoyed by a right-wing majority, at least until the Holyrood elections of . However Mr Johnson, who purports to be a classical scholar, would do well to learn lessons from more recent events, not least the unstoppable push for devolution that resulted from Mrs Thatcherrsquos condescending and contemptuous attitude towards Scotland during her - year stint as PM. The unpredictable nature of the Johnson-Cummings premiership means you never know what will happen, of course. Will they fancy calling the SNPrsquos bluff  Time will tell..

Nevertheless, the future of Scotland must be decided by the people of Scotland.\"Former Scottish Labour MP Ged Killen, who lost the Rutherglen and Hamilton West seat to the SNP, signalled his agreement on Twitter.He said: \"I campaigned on a promise to vote against indyref, but I lost. The SNP made massive gains on a promise to hold another referendum and, as democrats, we must accept it evenwe dont like it.\"His colleague, Neil Findlay MSP, argued: ldquoWe cannot deny the people of Scotland a second referendum where the majority is calling for it.The MSP for Lothian stressed how he believed that independence would be bad for Scotland for many reasons, noting how there would be big issues at stake such as the currency, borders, EU membership and falling oil revenues.He added: ldquoHowever,the people accept a new prospectus for independence, so be it. That is democracy and,it happens, Labour should offer its own prospectus for a progressive, socialist, outward-looking and egalitarian independent country.The Labour politiciansrsquo comments came after Labour councillor Alison Evison, the President of the local authority group Cosla, said democracy could be strengthened \"by enabling the voice of Scotland to be heard through its formal processes\", adding: \"That must mean a referendum on independence.Meanwhile, Kezia Dugdale argued opponents of independence needed to find a new argument for keeping Scotland in the UK.The former Scottish Labour leader, who stood down as an MSP earlier this year, told No campaigners: \"Youre wasting precious time arguing about mandates.ldquoLast referendum won by persuading centre-left voters  EU membership only safe in UK  A progressive Labour gov was on the horizon  Currency and Economic security.\"Reasons  and  have melted away and the Yes movement have been working on  since .:Nicola Sturgeon: Scotland cant be imprisoned within UK against its will - Michael Gove: no indyref under Tories\"You need a new argument for the Union which isnt rooted in Queen and country Unionism.

It is welcome that senior figures within Labour are recognising that mandate.ldquoWhile we will not all agree on independence, we can surely find common ground that this decision must be in Scotlandrsquos hands not Boris Johnsons, added the MP for Ross, Skye and Lochaber."},{"url":null,"title":"andy-maciver-tories-cant-keep-saying-no-scotland","story":"In Scotland, we would be well-served by dialling it down, for the focus is, once again, about to sht north. Brexit,not lsquodonersquo, is certainly now decided. The government will do what the people asked it to do nearly four years ago, and leave the EU. Thatrsquos good: I voted Remain, but I lost, and in a democracy, you must allow the winners to win.How do we relate that concept of the mandate, of democracy, to Scotland and to independence  That is the question which we will now wrestle with as Scots over the next  months, and quite probably for years thereafter, with the attention of the UK and the world on us.:Mark Smith: Inside the minds of the unionists who voted SNP ndash and what it means for The discussion has begun it began at .pm on Thursday night after the exit poll predicted another surge towards the SNP. Inevitably, the SNP claimed a mandate for indyref. It was the fourth time such a mandate had been claimed since the  independence referendum. The first was in , after the SNPrsquos -seat landslide the second was in June , after the UKrsquos Brexit vote fulfilled the SNPrsquos manesto criteria of Scotland being taken out of the EU against its will the third was after the party won the  General Election, and this was the fourth.Opposing, the Tories, of course, claimed that no such mandate exists. They cite ious reasons, principally that in this election many SNP candidates expressly said a vote for them was not a vote for indyref and that the SNPrsquos campaign slogan was lsquoStop Brexitrsquo, as well as the old favourite, that the  independence referendum was claimed by the SNP at the time to be lsquoonce in a generationrsquo.The reality, political and democratic, lies somewhere in between these competing claims. The strongest of all the SNPrsquos claimed mandates is, in fact, the one which emanated from the combination of the  Holyrood election and the Brexit referendum. The manesto called for a second referendum in the event of certain circumstances and specically cited the circumstance of the UK voting to leave the EU with Scotland voting to remain.I take the view that this qualies as a mandate, but I accept that it is not so clear as to be inarguable. It was by definition caveated, and its electoral endorsement is partly tied to a contorted pledge in the Green manesto which, as far as it is understandable, has probably not been met.The Tories, too, have a point. Whilst their lsquoonce in a generation argumentrsquo is bogusthe argument that last Thursdayrsquos election does not constitute a specic mandate is solid.The voting patterns in Scotland were quite clear - the Tory vote stayed relatively solid and the collapsing Labour vote went primarily to the SNP, and to a degree to the Lib Dems, both on the basis of Brexit. This was a Brexit election in Scotland just as it was in England, and that was the key driver for voters with pencil in hand.A sensible discussion between Boris Johnson and Nicola Sturgeon could bring common ground and common sense to the frenzy. Sturgeon should find it easy to accept that there will be no referendum in , mainly because it is an open secret that she and her team do not actually want a referendum next year, with their pro-independence polling numbers looking far weaker than they had expected them to, given the perfect storm of Boris and Brexit.:Nicola Sturgeon takes constitutional fight to Boris Johnson with SNP pledge to do absolutely everything to secure  voteSimilarly, Johnson, fresh off a campaign which was based on upholding democracy by lsquogetting Brexit donersquo as the people had asked, should be able to relate to a clear indyref mandate emerging from an election in which it will be the main issue.This all points to the  Scottish Parliament election - the most important there has ever been. That election will be fought on very clear ground, with very likely no room for debate on anything other than indyref. If the SNP wins that election with a clear manesto commitment for a second vote, a full two parliamentary terms after their first win, there can be no serious grounds to oppose it.You canrsquot be a fair-weather democrat. You canrsquot demand to get Brexit done because voters asked for it whilst demanding that indyref is continually rejected despite voters asking for it.For Johnson to concede this point, the Scottish Tories will need to play a key role, and their position over the coming months will be worth analysing. Although under the circumstances, they ed a creditable result last Thursday, they should not allow it to paper over the cracks which are clearly there.The Tory strategy ndash no to indyref ndash was designed to expand its vote by encouraging Labour unionists to lend their vote to the Tories. That strategy crashed and burned on Thursday. Are the Tories, who have become institutionally obsessed with indyref, nimble enough to reflect upon the fact that they may have maximised that ultra-Unionist vote  I am not so sure.A subtle change in position could help them, whilst also providing them with a more credible, democratic position on indyref to match the credible, democratic position they have held on Brexit.Their position has been lsquovote for us and we will stop indyrefrsquo they should alter it ahead of  to lsquovote for us or we will not be able to stop indyrefrsquo. In other words, the party should acknowledge that a mandate in  will have to be respected, and there will have to be another independence referendum, soyou donrsquot want one then you had better vote Tory.This change in strategy would serve three purposes. Firstly, it would incentivise the core vote in just as compelling a way as the current strategy - frankly, itrsquos not as though they are going to vote for anyone . Secondly, it would respect democracy, and in times such as these, that would be a noble act. Thirdly, and most importantly, it would be a departure of the tired, old, failed Tory strategy of the last  years, which in the final analysis has always been: say no to Scotland.Not for the first time in Scottish Tory history, they are struggling to see that this is failing, and is simply pushing people away from the Union and towards independence.The irony of all of this is that the Nationalistsrsquo strength is over-estimated by Unionists, who have become so paranoid about indyref that they seem blind to the fundamentals which are in place, and which may allow the unionists to record a larger win than last time, closing the book on independence just like they closed the book on Brexit.All they have to do is smarten up.

Admittedly, the First Minister did say that not everyone who voted SNP supported independence, but she also said her partyrsquos success provided a renewed, refreshed and strengthened mandate for a new Scottish referendum.This did not please the SNP-voting unionists I spoke to, even though they knew it was likely to happen. One said to me that Ms Sturgeonrsquos use of the election result was cynical and had made her less likely to vote SNP a second time. It might also have helpedthe First Minister had acknowledged the subtleties, nuances and conflicting emotions that led Scottish voters to act in ways they never had before, rather than rushing to claim a mandate for a second referendum.Weirdly ndash because hersquos anything but subtle ndash Boris Johnson actually did a better job of talking about this phenomenon of ldquolent votes. He could have sounded triumphalist he could have clenched his fists and cheered at the defeat of Labour candidates in traditionally Labour areas.But instead he said that he recognised some votersrsquo hands might have ldquoquivered before they put their cross in the Conservative box. He also said he knew that many of those voters probably intended to vote Labour next time round. Rather than claiming the voters as Tories, it was an acknowledgement of what was actually going on with some people, and Nicola Sturgeon should have done something similar in a lot more detail and with a lot more humility.:Nicola Sturgeon takes constitutional fight to Boris Johnson with SNP pledge to do absolutely everything to secure  voteMs Sturgeon and her advisors should also be cautious about what they take from this for the future. As my SNP-voting unionists explained, they voted the way they did in the general election mostly because they felt they had no choice. They were in constituencies where, because of the first-past-the-post system, voting SNP was the only way to maximise the chances of thwarting the Tory and voting against Brexit. Truthfully, they would rather have voted Labour or LibDem and in a proportional system, they would have done. But instead, because of the system we have and with Brexit as the main concern, reluctantly, fretfully, and with a heavy heart, they voted SNP.Obviously, the same rules will not apply when the  Scottish general election comes round: under proportional representation, voters will be free to vote for a party they believe in. This means many of those who voted SNP in  because of Brexit and Boris will revert to their previous choices in , not only because Brexit will presumably no longer be the issue it once was but because voters will understand that independence really will be on the ballot in  and therersquoll be no question about how their vote will be used by the SNP.Not everyone will behave in the same way of course. One of the voters I spoke to, a man who voted No in  and SNP this year, said he wouldnrsquot rule out supporting a future independence referendumit was the lesser of two evils.However, for other unionists who have just voted SNP, the  Scottish election will be a chance to vote against independence just as the  UK election was their chance to vote against Brexit. What this means is that, far from being the beginning of a surge for the SNP, the election wersquove just been through could be a high tide. Maybe the First Minister gets this. Maybe she realises some of the votes she won last week are only on loan. And maybe she should think about it a bit more before she clenches her fists in triumph."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/10426393.jpg?type=article-full","title":"another-3m-needed-275-requests-free-use-atms-scotland","story":"LINK has admitted it is going to seek a further poundm from banks and building societies early next year after receiving demands for free to use ATMs in the space of two months covering  areas of Scotland.It comes two weeks after it emerged that  free-to-use ATMs have continued to shut down every week in Scotland in the last year.In August the ATM overseers said that should a high street be threatened with the loss of an ATM or Post Office, it would step in to ensure that a cash machine is made available and paid for with funding from all the UKrsquos main banks and building societies.And in October, it invited consumers and community groups to put in requests for an ATM through the Community Access to Cash Delivery Fund.:Poorest Scots hit hardest by cash machine exodusAn initial sum poundm was set aside to support and it has been confirmed this is enough to put in  machines.But the network operator says that while an unquantiable number of requests may be impractical to action, they will need to secure a further poundm from banks and building societies early next year to deal with demand.Gareth Shaw, head of money with Which , said problems dealing with a huge number of requests for free to use ATMs shows that the government has to intervene to ensure the publics free access to cash.\"The flood of requests for free cashpoints across Scotland shows the huge demand for cash and exposes worrying gaps in Scotlands cash machine network,\" he said.\"Many communities face real uncertainty as to whether a voluntary piecemeal approach will provide the vital free cashpoints many people need just to go about their daily lives.\"Its clear that industry alone cannot fix Scotlands cash crisis, which has left the system on the verge of collapse.

Seabed surveys in these areas may confirm the model predictions.Horse Mussels are similar to the blue mussels found on seashores but grow much larger, and can reach more than cm inand live for over  years.They live inidually or in clumps, or may form raised beds with several hundreds of mussels per square metre.Horse mussels live below the low water mark, with beds found at depths from  to  metres, although most known beds are between - metres.:Revealing the secrets of mussels as big as size nine shoes#The beds provide a foundation for soft corals, tubeworms, barnacles, sea firs, sea mats and seaweeds, as well as shelter for brittlestars, crustaceans, worms, molluscs and many other small animals.Flame shells, bivalve molluscs with a fringe of orange tentacles, live hidden on the seabed in nests which they build from shells, stones and other materials. Hundreds of nests can combine to form a dense bed, which stabilises the seabed and provides substrate for sea firs, sea mats, sea squirts and seaweed, as well as shelter for many other creatures, such as crabs, scallops and brittle stars.The habitat is found mainly on the west coast of Scotland, often in tidal narrows and the entrances to sea lochs, with the largest known flame shell bed in Loch Carron. There is also a flame shell bed in Scapa Flow on Orkney.In recent years both have come under threat due to dredging that scours the seabed in the search for fresh mussels.In July Marine Scotland said it was looking into claims an industrial vessel was last week scraping the bottom of Loch Broom near the Summer Isles.A er inspects damage to the mussel beds in Loch Carron.

For some, Brexit represents a lsquomaterial change in circumstancersquo. For others, lsquoonce in generationrsquo still holds.ldquoMany of the economic debates will be similar to those in . But there are likely to be important dferences.ldquoFirstly, back in  there was a clear choice between a relatively stable lsquostatus quorsquo ndash albeit with the promise of more devolved powers ndash and independence.ldquoBut with Brexit, the debate will be set against the backdrop of economic change and uncertainty whatever the people of Scotland decide.ldquoVoters will also want to be much more mindful about what both sides can credibly say about their so-called Plan B than was the case in either  or the EU Referendum in .ldquoThe wider economic context has undoubtedly changed. Some aspects ndash such as the sharp fall in oil prices and weakening of Scotlandrsquos relative fiscal position ndash pose a challenge to those arguing in favour of independence.ldquoAgainst that, Brexit throws up economic challenges for those in favour of the Union.ldquoScotland may face a stark choice between aligning to the EU trading bloc or the UK bloc, with implications for trade and migration.ldquoPerhaps most signicantly, many of those on the Yes side in  argued that there would be a degree of continuity between the then status quo and independence. The plan was to retain sterling, share financial regulation and keep an open border.ldquoButthe case for a second referendum is now framed around Scotland pro-actively taking a dferent path to the UK, then it necessarily follows that the economic proposition for independence will need to be more radical on issues such as currency, customs and fiscal policy than in .In October, Ms Sturgeon refused to rule out infrastructure and customs checksBrexit was combined with Scottish independence in Europe.Her Brexit Secretary Michael Russell also admitted the EU could impose a hard border, saying it would be ldquogoverned by our membership of the EU, not settled domestically.:Boris Johnsonrsquos Brexit deal to be brought before Commons this weekThe Institutersquos commentary also warned of continued weak Scottish economic growth, with forecasts of . per cent for  and .% for  and , although these assumed Ms Johnson could deliver on his promise of a trade deal with the EU by the endof .Speaking ahead of her parliamentary statement, the First Minister said: ldquoThis election result is a watershed moment for Scotland. People were faced with a clear and distinct choice, and they made their verdict clear - they have rejected a Tory government, said no to Brexit and endorsed the proposition that they should be given a say on their own future.ldquoThat position is increasingly winning support from across the political spectrum, including from senior and prominent members of the Scottish Labour Party, who may not yet back independence but who recognise the fundamental democratic principle which is now at stake.ldquoIn  when we were also facing the prospect of a fourth Tory government with no mandate in Scotland there was a coming together of parties, communities and civic Scotland.ldquoThat resulted in the establishment of this Parliament, which has achieved much. But this new wave of Brexiteer Tories with a mission to reshape Scotland and the UK in their right-wing image presents a new danger ndash one that very few would have predicted at the dawn of devolution.

But the demographic ides are one of the most striking. According to Lord Ashcroftrsquos post-election poll, Labour beat the Tories in all the under- year old voting groups. Labour got more than  per cent of the vote in the - group while the Tories got an absolute majorityin the over- group. The idea, promoted by many Corbynistas, that Labour would have done better to fish with the Tories in the Leave half of the UKrsquos population looks bizarre indeed.And though both the election results and polls for the last two years suggest a small Remain majority across the UK, Brexit will now happen. The debate is over but the ide remains.We know too in Scotland that young people are both the most pro-EU and the most pro-independence. And polls, in the last year, have found majorities for independenceBrexit happens. New polls in the coming weeks will be closely watched to seethat sht on the independence question now does show up. If it does, that will add fuel to the Scottish Governmentrsquos current demand for a second independence referendum.But in the weeks, months and years ahead, Britainnow faces a Tory hard Brexit, driven by the combined forces of a populist Tory majority in England, by an English and Welsh Leave vote in , and by an English identity crisis. Yet England, like the UK, will remain bitterly ided too, with fragmentation likely only to increase in the years ahead.A Tory Brexit led by Boris Johnson has no chance of healing such a UK. Divisions over the EU, deep dferences between young and old, profound changes in the Britain-Northern Ireland relationship, and more deep isions between England and Wales, and between England and Scotland, are a recipe for an unsettled, unstable politics ahead. The UK will leave the EU.

Brexit is coming, and Boris Johnson is in Number . The triumph of English nationalism at the General Election is a great threat to Scotland, and will cost us dearwe do not resist it with every democratic means at our disposal.Not only does Scotland have to face being ripped from the European Union against the will of the nation, but we also have the injustice of Westminster silencing the democratic voice of the Scottish people.The SNP won an astonishing majority of seats at the election. It fought a campaign which hammered home that the nation was lied to at the last independence referendum ndash that we were misled when we were told a No vote was the only way to preserve EU membership. After the EU referendum, circumstances obviously changed and a second independence vote was morally justied. The SNP won on this premise ndash yet wersquore told by Johnson therersquoll be no second independence referendum.Brexit alone is grounds enough for a second independence referendum. The SNPrsquos electoral mandate makes the argument unassailable.An election which confirms the democratic will of the English people is being used to deny the democratic will of the Scottish people. Would the English tolerate such abuse  Itrsquos not hyperbole to say the treatment of Scotland in the first few days of the new Johnson administration smells of tyranny and bodes ill for the future. Itrsquos a clear-cut case of political injustice.This treatment is designed to provoke anger. The Yes movement needs to resist being needled into intemperate behaviour. Already, some voices on the fringes of the Yes movement, or within the SNPrsquos more hysterical base, have began talking of action like a unilateral declaration of independence.Such language is not welcome. The reason the SNP did so well in this election is that the broader Yes movement followed a policy of moderation over the last four years. The leadership wisely avoided the flag-waving, old-school nationalist marches of outfits like All Under One Banner, which seems to attract more than its fair share of cranks and zealots.:Yes vote would be more disruptive after Brexit than in \"@context\": \"https:schema.org\",\"@type\": \"VideoObject\",\"name\": \"Ian Blackford: Not a good look for Boris Johnson to ignore second Scottish independence referendum calls\",\"description\": \"Ian Blackford: Not a good look for Boris Johnson to ignore second Scottish independence referendum calls\",\"thumbnailUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer v media ncqRYhbm poster.jpg width\",\"uploadDate\": \"--T::+:\",\"duration\": \"PDTHMS\",\"contentUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer manests ncqRYhbm.mu\",\"embedUrl\": \"https:www.heraldscotland video  \",\"publisher\": \"@type\": \"Organization\",\"name\": \"HeraldScotland\",\"logo\": \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\"url\": \"https:www.heraldscotland sitelogo \",\"width\": ,\"height\": Leaders of the SNP and the Yes movement chose to focus on a policy of wooing undecided Scottish voters and soft No voters. It was emollient, open, nuanced, intelligent and unaggressive.The tactic seemed to represent the split in the SNP and the Yes movement mirrored by the personalities of Alex Salmond and Nicola Sturgeon. Those of a populist persuasion still pine for the bluster of a man like Salmond. This is the brittle SNP base, represented by the online, angry fringe. They achieved nothing in this election. They won over not a single voter. Itrsquos likely thatthey didnrsquot exist at all, the SNPrsquos majority would be even higher than it is today.What secured the SNP electoral victory was the careful, modulated, well-mannered message put out by the leadership. Nicola Sturgeon may have briefly lost her usual dignied composure when she jumped for joy at the sight of Jo Swinsonrsquos defeat on election night politics is played to be won after all but the consistent message throughout the campaign was measured, unthreatening and reassuring.As a result, soft unionists and undecided voters have leant their support to the SNP in order to register opposition to Brexit and Johnsonrsquos hard-right politics. Thatrsquos an act of great trust and they should be applauded for their political bravery. They mustnrsquot be betrayed. Theyrsquove taken the first step on a new journey and must be encouraged towards full support of independence.The policy of moderation has also left the Scottish Labour Party seemingly on the verge of rethinking its entire position on the constitution. Along with continually pressing for moderation among the Yes movement, Irsquove also spoken in this column of the need for Labour to moderate its position on Scottish independence. Today, senior Labour figures are now in favour of a second referendum.The SNP and the Yes movement now sit securely atop the moral high ground. The battle was fought with decency and it paid off. Meanwhile, Johnson and his government treat Scotland with contempt yet we cannot allow understandable anger to undermine that moral high ground.My first emotional reaction to Johnsonrsquos denial of a second referendum was anger. Not only did I feel Scotland was now a hostage to his government ndash hijacked and taken in the boot of his car to Brexitland ndash but the hypocrisy was astonishing. England can get its way, but not Scotland ndash that was the message. Democracy for England do as yoursquore told for Scotland.Nicola Sturgeon at the Glasgow count during the General Election  :Mark Smith: Inside the minds of the unionists who voted SNP ndash and what it means for For a few hours I felt the only answer was to call another referendum whether Westminster liked it or not. But some calm reflection proved just what folly that would be. All the hard work of moderation and measure would be for nothingwe allow ourselves to be riled and act emotionally. Letrsquos avoid the road to Catalonia.The Yes movement must continue the policy of moderation here at home ndash in order to maintain momentum and trust ndash but when Scotland directs its face to Johnson in London there must be only implacable resistance and demand. If Johnson intends to harm Scotland by preventing our voice being heard, then harm him back. Obstruct his government in any way possible. Take his government to courtneeds be to secure a second referendum.Conservative hostility, however, means itrsquos highly unlikely that wersquoll see another referendum until after the next Holyrood election ndash theyrsquoll ly deny any mandate exists until success in  makes such fiction no longer sustainable.What matters most is sustaining that intelligent and dignied composure at home, while never relenting when it comes to fighting the hypocrisy and abuse of democracy emanating from London.

It also removes the need to chemically treat the effluent, increasing the protection of the rivers Don and Urie, and provides the capacity to support the local community as it continues to grow and flourish. The project was delivered by Scottish Water alliance partner ESD and included building new sewer pipework, improving the resilience of the site to flooding and upgrading existing equipment. Ms Gougeon said: “While treating waste water isn’t something people probably like to think about too often, it is something that is absolutely vital to protect not only our health and sanitation, but also the environment. “Developing new, more efficient ways of treating waste water through the deployment of new technology, is hugely important as Scotland takes decisive steps towards tackling the climate emergency we are facing around the world.” Chief Executive of Scottish Water Douglas Millican said: “We are always looking for ways to innovate and protect the environment both locally and globally, so it is very exciting to see this new state-of-the-art treatment works officially opened here in Inverurie – the first of its kind in Scotland. “Not only does it mean we can continue to treat waste water effectively and protect the environment for years to come, it also underlines our commitment to pursue new ways to lower our energy requirements, towards reaching our ambitious goal of achieving net zero emissions by .” Most construction work on site was completed in the Spring and the new treatment process has since been closely monitored during commissioning and beyond.While most of the work took place within the established Scottish Water site, installation of new pipework beneath the railway line involved a closure to Keithhall Road which was completed ahead of schedule in April .data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"A group of Logie Durno Primary School pupils taking part in the Wee Sleep Out\"  Wee Sleep Out at Logie Durno School viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"ESD Chief Operating Officer Wendy Cooper said: “We are very proud of what has been achieved at Inverurie, successfully delivering a cutting edge new wastewater treatment technology in Scotland for the first time. “Success in this project has involved close collaboration between Scottish Water, ESD, Royal HaskoningDHV and our wider supply chain.

Those talks are critical to the future of our industry.“It is these negotiations that will be the real bread and butter of Brexit for NFU Scotland members. That is where the terms of the trade deal between the UK and the EU will be agreed.“For NFUS, ensuring as free and as frictionless trade in agri-food goods with the EU, which remains our principal market outside of the UK, has been our priority from the start of this process.“Whether negotiating with the EU, or establishing new trade deals with other countries worldwide, a red line for us is that Scotland’s high standards must be recognised and protected.“Our members can be reassured that their union has begun engagement with this new parliament today and we will make tracks to Westminster at the earliest opportunity as we enter a new era for Scottish farming and crofting.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Indeed, Ministers have stopped even referring to the deadline,” Mr McArthur said.“It is all the more important, therefore, that priority is given to connecting those communities who have been waiting longest for any sort of service. Good quality, affordable broadband is increasingly critical in accessing services, allowing businesses to compete and enable people to go about their daily lives.#The Orkney MSP added: #Mr Matheson seems happy that Orkney continues to languish signicantly behind the level of coverage achieved nationally. As an MSP representing a central belt constituency, perhaps Mr Matheson believes this is just the ‘price you pay’ for living in an island or rural area.“Whatever the reason, it is unacceptable, the Scottish Government needs to re-commit to prioritising future broadband investment in Orkney and other communities who continue to lag behind when it comes to coverage.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Meanwhile in Scotland, the SNP’s result was arguably even more remarkable with the party securing  out of  seats. Not quite , but still that means  per cent of Scotland’s MPs are Nationalists.However, their result was achieved on the basis of  per cent of the vote in Scotland and the Tories won . across the UK, so both these ‘majorities’ are actually based on ‘minorities’ and a product of the first-past-the-post system.Amid their understandably triumphant celebrations, Johnson and Nicola Sturgeon now appear to be on a political collision course over a second independence referendum, a bitter and isive constitutional clash of epic proportions.: Jackson Carlaw promises Scottish unionists: We can still stop indyref: Nicola Sturgeon: Indyref is ‘democratic right of the Scottish people’However, they could attempt to take a dferent course, one of humility and respect for the dferent viewpoints of these two political tribes.As he ed to  Downing Street, Boris Johnson said the UK “deserves a break from wrangling, a break from politics”, adding: “I urge everyone to find closure and to let the healing begin.”And he is right about the need for healing. The UK is still ided along Leave Remain lines while, for all Johnson and fellow unionists might wish it to be so, the large number of people who support Scottish independence are unlikely to simply give up. And there are other signicant ides in the UK – between left and right, with newly enthused activists on both sides of the spectrum young and old urban and rural areas north and south – that are problems for our society.Rule by London diktatThe key questions are whether Johnson is serious about trying to heal the country or whether this is rhetoric in preparation for the looming fight with the SNP andSturgeon actually has an interest in joining in such a process, rather than stoking ision as part of efforts to secure independence.ButScotland does ever leave the UK, it is most assuredly in its interests to maintain good relations with its nearest and dearest neighbour, just as it is in the UK’s interests to maintain good relations with the EU. Indeed, this would almost certainly be vital to making a success of an independent Scotland. So it would be a mistake for the SNP to dismiss Johnson’s victory and his pledge to stop a second referendum. Political promises should be hard to break, particularly for a Prime Minister with a reputation for being, perhaps, too ‘economical with the actualité’.And, likewise, it would be a mistake for Johnson to add to the sense of nationalist grievance by acting in a high-handed way that could be portrayed as rule by London diktat.They may not like it, in fact, they may absolutely hate it, but they might be better advised to seek some form of compromise, to find an acceptable middle ground.Quite what that would be is hard to say. But it could be more powers for Scotland or perhaps an agreement to allow a second indyrefthe SNP wins the next Holyrood election. Some commentators believe it would be politically untenable to deny a second voteSturgeon wins in that is the case, it might make more sense for Johnson to allow it and focus on ensuring an SNP defeat, rather than rail against it, only to later concede.Smart politics is not always about being tough. There are powerful forces that could easily push them into an increasingly bitter conflict but, surely, in the long run, that would be in no one’s interest.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"gary rhodes a pioneer who inspired so many young cooks tributes pour in for tv chef","story":"Described as a pioneer who \"inpsired many young cooks\" and the man who \"almost single handedly put British food on the world stage\", Rhodes was one of the best known ambassadors for British cuisine and inspired a generation of Brits to enjoy cooking. window.twttr The top chef, who received five Michelin stars during his career, he is best known for his work on MasterChef, Ready Steady Cook and Hells Kitchen.

He asserts a mandate to take the whole of the UK, including Scotland, out of the EU, on a lower share of seats and votes then the SNP won in Scotland.“We are facing a Conservative government which Scotland did not vote for and which presents a real danger to our country.“The Scottish Parliament has a duty to protect the values that people in Scotland voted for.  I believe we can only fully do that with independence, and that is why later this week, I will take the next steps to secure Scotland’s right to choose.”Ms Sturgeon’s reference to the  result is calculated to reach older Labour supporters who will recall an election that Neil Kinnock’s party was widely expected to win - only to see John Major’s Conservatives ed with a majority. Labour won  of  possible seats, with many of its MPs actively supporting an on-going campaign for the creation of a Scottish parliament.It was far removed from the catastrophic defeat Jeremy Corbyn’s party endured at last week’s election, where it was reduced to a single MP in Scotland.Writing in The Scotsman today, Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard said the result had “sent a strong message to Labour and it would be a grave mistake not to listen”.He continued: “It is my view that instead of expecting the people of Scotland to come home to Labour, Scottish Labour must instead come home to them. “On the doorstep, it was clear that many voters liked and supported our manesto, which is in line with what opinion polling has consistently suggested, but frankly doubted whether we could be trusted to implement it.”He added: “It is clear that  years on from devolution the British state is too centralised and there are real imbalances of power in the economy too. In our manesto, we promised to set up a Constitutional Convention to decentralise power. “Learning the lessons from the Scottish Constitutional Convention, we now should establish a Constitution Convention in opposition. This could develop a blueprint which will be ready to legislate for and implement in Government. And we should be prepared to work on this with other parties and organisationsand where this is possible.”Pamela Nash, chief executive of Scotland in Union, said: “Scotland already has the right to choose and we chose to remain in the UK.“The majority of people of Scotland also chose pro-UK parties at last week’s General Election.“And barely a quarter of Scots would choose to hold a isive second independence referendum next year, according to polls.“Scotland deserves better than a government obsessed with creating ision between families and friends.”©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"first look at the jarls squad ","story":"Plenty of onlookers were already on the streets as the squad made its first procession of the day from Islesburgh Community Centre, past the galley shed on St Sunniva Street and on to the Toll Clock Shopping Centre.In the gloom, the ranks of the Jarl#s Squad looked the part wearing emerald green kirtles with dragon mots underneath simple brown leather breastplates embossed with the same mot.

Good, reliable and accessible transport links are of vital importance to our communities,# said Ms Wishart.“From the delivery of the air discount scheme to securing funding in the Scottish Government budget for internal ferry services and leading the campaign for cheaper ferry fares, I am proud of the Liberal Democrat record. In stark contrast, the SNP have failed to deliver on their promises and introduced parking charges at Sumburgh.“It is totally unacceptable for SNP ministers to hold our leline services at ransom. We need a change, and my five-point plan sets out a positive alternative for Shetland that would make the real dference that local people deserve.“As a matter of good faith, SNP ministers should listen to local demands and take all the money they have failed to spend on cheaper ferry fares over the last  months and recycle it into Shetland services.

The money SIC receives to run these services has historically been determined by the local government distribution formula # this was the case when the Lib Dems were in office. For each of the last two years the SNP has provided an extra £m of funding for internal services.“The Scottish Government is also committed to implementing an RET-equivalent that includes cabin costs on the Aberdeen route but we have been prevented from doing so by the Pentland Ferries complaint.“Baseless accusations that the SNP has held Shetland to ransom are part and parcel of the Lib Dems negative narrative that only holds us back.

She followed Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn#s position, stating she would like to see a new Brexit deal negotiated with the EU and put to the British people in a referendum, with no Brexit the other option.Jenner Fairbairn, the Conservative candidate, said her priority was to #uphold democracy# and to see Brexit through #as soon as possible#.The SNP#s Robert Leslie said that Orkney and Shetland had not voted for Brexit yet #we could suffer most# from the country leaving the EU. He added he would like to remain in the EU and help reform it from within as part of an independent Scotland.The Brexit Party#s Robert Smith did not attend, but his stance of a #clean-break Brexit# with a free trade deal with the EU was announced to the room.Unsurprisingly, Brexit proved the hottest topic of the evening with several questions based around that subject.Ms Fairbairn, the Conservative candidate, surprised most in attendance by repeatedly going against party policy # firstly by saying she supported the actions of Gina Miller, who took the Conservative government to court over Brexit, because she was #upholding democracy# and secondly by saying that the government#s #settled status# scheme for EU citizens needed a #total overhaul#.So it would seem the only candidate willing to represent the more than nine and a half thousand brexit voters in Orkney and Shetland is working fisherman Robert Smith of the Brexit party. It would seem Boris promise that all tories elected in this election would back his brexit plan was a bit of the mark. Or maybe it shows that his brexit plan is not brexit at alltheir candidate For the isles is willing to back it.Good to see that the Brexit Party is not drawn into this level of debate. I am sure Robert Smith was absent because he was busy getting Brexit Done. Too right that a clean-break Brexit is what we need. Like was said before, a free trade deal will be the #easiest in human history#. Wise words from Liam Fox, and still yet to be disproved by the #facts#.Robert Leslie, SNP, is obviously unaware ofthe impact of independence. The EU has stated repeatedly that , wewill be automatically out of the EU on Independence Day # with #No Deal#.#When part of the territory of a Member State ceases to be a part of that State, e.g. because that territory becomes an independent state, the treaties will no longer apply #Westminster will no longer fund our #notional budget deficit#. It will become real. Nicola Sturgeon#s Scottish Growth Commission proposed a multi-year plan to reduce it to EU-acceptable levels. We must also have our own, independent central bank and therefore, our own currency. That will take nine yearsand will require tens of billions in foreign reserves.If Britain #remains# there would be a #hard UK border# with EU tarfs .

It will even take place within the SNP itself, once the phoney pre-independence “party of national unity” approach falls apart.During these debates, the left will highlight support for Corbyn’s radical policies as evidence that these are still relevant and can still win votes.Meanwhile, the right will highlight the lack of support for Labour as evidence that strong unions and public ownership are no longer winning policies and should be abandoned forever.If you can’t use your vote to get your candidate elected tomorrow, at lease use it to make a statement.The ideas behind Labour’s bold policies need to be kept alive.They will be as relevant in an independent Scotland as they will anywhere .Absolutely.Absolutely not, Johan.

We meed balance.Combining the two is all very fine for those who, like me, benefited from working in the public sector however it leads to a two-tier workforce, with those in the private sector footing the bill, in taxes or high product prices, for the privileged ones in the public sector. That also hits private sector pay as employers must maintain viability with their increased costs.Having said that, re-nationalisation of electricity would be hilariously apt because government would become directly accountable totaxpayers and or bill-payers for the soaring costs of energy arising from “decarbonisation”, associated with the lunacy of unilateral “declarations of climate emergency” and policies like Labour’s “net zero ”.The IPCC does not call for that and condemns unilateral action as being unhelpful in achieving international agreement.I voted for Blair when sanity prevailed,now Corbyn takes us all back, well he is trying to, but the result empowers Boris!!!

Hope remains for a fairer society in which the economy works for the good of the people as well as the environment they depend on.The LibDems on the other hand remain forever compromised between the freedom of business to exploit people and the freedom of people not to be exploited.

The recreational society also employed the services of an independent surveyor who # using the drawings developed by the council for the school # drew up three dferent locations all of which were away from the pitch but within the existing school boundary.In a letter to council leader Margaret Davidson this week, Mr Blackford # a former chair of the recreational society # said that the alternative plans which would have allowed the new development while preserving the playing field seem to have been #rejected out of hand without adequate explanation#.He added that there was considerable concern that the council was going ahead with the proposals without #seeking to achieve a consensus of the parents and the wider community#.Mr Blackford invited Ms Davidson to host a meeting with him in Dunvegan at her earliest convenience so they could #listen to the voices of the community and give careful consideration as to how we can proceed with the school development whilst securing the playing field for this and future generations#., Mr Blackford said that the investment in the school was welcome but added that the plans #cannot come at the cost of the football pitch with no clear replacement plan in place#.He said that as the playing field in Dunvegan was the only one in the north-west of Skye, it would be #a disaster for Dunvegan and the surrounding areas# to see it go.At a meeting held in Dunvegan village hall last week, Highland Council estate strategy manager Robert Campbell said that the decision on the council#s preferred option had not #been taken lightly#.

The facilities will include a nursery, kitchen, dining hall, games hall and ancillary accommodation.Skye councillor John Finlayson sought to impress on those present at the meeting that with a review of capital spending due to take place within the council in the next few months the money earmarked for the first phase could not be guaranteed unless the development became active.At the public meeting, local youngsters Lewis MacLeodand Sam Maclellandpresented a petition to the council in opposition to the local authority plans which had more than  signatures."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2485-Kylerhea-landslip.jpg","title":"skye visitors cooking class on the back burner following kylerhea","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineDaniela Celant left her holiday home in Kylerhea to drive to Kinloch Lodge earlier this afternoon to take part in a cooking class with top chef Marcello Tully.

Other includes the  seats for Northern Ireland. Dear England... yee clearly couldnt give a fiddlers... we do... how about we have it back \" he wrote.Mr Donnelly yesterday stood by his remarks. \"Detailed planning to look at further integration should be considered. Particularly in the context of Brexit and the obvious advantages to the people of Northern Ireland of closer integration with Ireland and the EU,\" he said.\"There is a highly detailed plan for Scottish independence. A similar exercise for Northern Ireland to Ireland and EU linkages makes sense.\"Meanwhile, the Irish government has ruled out a discussion on a border poll.

There’s a massive issue with pay inequality and staffing shortages and other issues,” Ms O’Reilly said.I thinkwe examine the work done by Section  and  agencies, that work is incredibly valuable and without pay restoration we know that those services are under quite a lot of stressLouise OReilly, Sinn Fein health spokeswomanA lot of the agencies had their pay cut under The Financial Emergency Measures in Public Interestslegislation, however Ms O’Reilly says there is now a disparity between the two sections.The Section  agencies have received pay restoration along with all other public service personnel. However, those employed in Section  bodies had not, due to being part grant-aided organisations.Section  organisations and their staff are not seen as public bodies and their workers are not seen as public sector employees by the government.“I’m in the unique position as I was the union official representing them at the time, and back then the government said the very opposite, that they did have a link,” Ms O’Reilly added.“It’s really not fair to say, ‘you only have a link when we’re cutting your pay, but you don’t have a link when you’re looking for pay restoration’.“I thinkwe examine the work done by Section  and  agencies, that work is incredibly valuable and without pay restoration we know that those services are under quite a lot of stress.“There is a shortage of healthcare professionals. We’re losing a lot of staff to the private sector and abroad, and something needs to be done.“I think this enjoys broad support. There isn’t a TD who doesn’t have one of these agencies in their constituencies, who wouldn’t be willing to laud the work done by these men and women every single day of the week.”The motion “calls for adequate engagement with, and resourcing of, the not-for-profit care sector, in addition to calling for pay restoration for workers in Section  organisations”.The party is also calling for a forum to be established so that stakeholders and service users can have an opportunity to have their say.An Oireachtas health committee heard from the HSE in , that it had not received money from government to allow organisations which it funds to restore pay cuts imposed after the economic crash."},{"url":null,"title":"animals enjoy christmas treats at london zoo","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Particularly in the dark winter mornings and evenings where visibility from oncoming traffic makes it crucial that school children have adequate, safe areas for boarding and enlightening from their school buses”“DfI and Translink have agreed to provide additional ‘Bus Stop’ safety signs and to create a hard standing area on a verge embankment at the junction of Rocktown and Hillhead Road for children to use when embarking off buses. Additional safety signage warning motorists off the bus stop and children on the carriageway will also be installed at the Carnaman Mayogall Road junction. In addition to these measures I also wish to thank Mid-Ulster District Council for agreeing to my request to have a school bus shelter installed at Ballymcpeake Mayogall Road junction. All of these measures will enhance the conditions our schoolchildren endure when going to and from their schools” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

But in terms of other issues facing the city, Mr Eastwood said he will argue for “properly directed investment” in the city that will require a Stormont government.“We have been failed by people who have run the government here for too long and it’s time to get that fixed,” he said.Voters in the North, and in Scotland, rejected Boris Johnson but he did express disappointment at the overall result which secured a large majority for the Conservative party.“In politics you have to play the ball where it lies, we did our bit, others didn’t, but we have to find a way of protecting ourselves.”Talks are set to resume at Stormont and the Derry man suggested he is prepared to go into oppositionthe city’s interests are cast aside.“After the last Assembly election there was a change because of the Fresh Start Agreement which meant you had to have a negotiation and a programme for government. We went into that negotiation determined to get Magee expanded, more social houses built and a few other things, and they weren’t asks that should’ve been hard to deliver.“The DUP and Sinn Feacutein refused to even negotiate with us on that basis so we said well see you we’ll go into opposition to try to argue for those things from that position.“They know thatthey want an all-inclusive government then they have to look after the people of Derry first.” googletag.cmd.push ‘Fight’ The SDLP leader said he knew the party was doing well during canvassing but didn’t think he would win by such a large margin, billed as a “tight fight”, that’s the way they treated it.On Friday Mr Eastwood entered a room above the Pickled Duck cafeacute along with his we, Rachael, and daughters to applause from his party members and supporters.He began by thanking his team. “A couple of years ago when we lost this seat, we didn’t fold up the tent, we didn’t walk away quietly. We became very determined that this city’s representation, not just for us, not at all for us in fact, but for the people of Derry.“I think we’ve been starved over the last couple of years of representation, I wish we had MPs when they were very tight votes on Brexit. But we have a fight on our hands now and we have to fight against Boris Johnson who now has a Tory majority, he will do all sorts of negative things for the people of this city and we have to be there, not just speaking but voting against him and taking the fight to this new Tory government. “And I pledge on behalf of the people in this room and the people of Derry to take that fight right to the heart of Westminster.He continued: “We heard very loudly on the doors what people wanted, they wanted representation at Westminster and their voice heard but they also wanted government in Stormont and people to deal with the crisis in our health service. They don’t think it’s good enough for people to stand on picket lines and then not go to work the next day to try to sort out the problems faced by our low-paid health workers.”He also highlighted teachers who are having to bring the most basic resources to school because there is no education budget.“People in this city know the old story of Derry, that generations of our people leave here and don’t come home because there aren’t enough jobs, because previous Executives haven’t invested in our university to attract and keep those jobs. That’s the work that we have to be engaged in now, we don’t take one vote we got for granted, we know the work that we have to be about and that work starts on Monday morning.“This party is very grateful for the huge endorsement that we’ve got, but we know it’s not about us, we know it’s about the people of Derry roaring a message to politicians that ‘it’s time to get on with the job’. And we’re very grateful for people from right across the political ide for coming and rallying behind us and I just want to say to them, we won’t let you down.” googletag.cmd.push Stormont Mr Eastwood will attend Westminster tomorrow. Making reference to other results across the North, he said it is about people “raising their voices against Brexit and for a sensible accommodation to bring people back together again.”The Secretary of State for NI Julian Smith knows “we have to get back around the table urgently…we heard it loudly and clearly, let’s get back to work,” he added.“Everybody in this room either is on a waiting list or knows someone who’s on one. It’s a terrible inditement of our politics and it’s time we fixed it. Everybody in this room has had a member of their family, or many members, leave this city because they just can’t make ends meet being here, that’s a terrible inditement of our politics. “Everybody in this room knows what has to happen, we have to take responsibility, we have to take power in our hands to deal with the problems faced by our voters. No longer is it good enough to stand on the side lines, no longer is it good enough to look in the window, we have to be in there, that’s what people want us to do, that doesn’t just mean Westminster that means Stormont as well so let’s get on with it.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It is open to the public. The full motion successfully moved at the October full Council meeting by People Before Profit Cllr Shaun Harkin appears below. Cllr Harkin proposed a representative of the Fire Brigades Union also be invited to the December full Council meeting. The meeting will hear from health, nurses, civil servant, teacher, lecturer, postal and fire service union representatives. People Before Profit Cllr Shaun Harkin said: In October the full Derry and Strabane Council agreed to a People Before Profit motion to give its full backing to workers taking strike action and to invite trade union representatives to a special meeting of the Council. googletag.cmd.push Workers representatives will now have the opportunity to speak directly to the full Council. Nurses, health service workers and manyothers have been forced to take action for pay justice and to stand up for public services. Its right that our Council support their action and stand in solidarity with them. People deserve respect, justice and dignity for the essential work they do. Our Council should be loudly amplying demands for workers rights and in defence of our public services. Strike action is most often a last resort but its one of the most powerful weapons ordinary people have to press their demands. Picket lines across the North are sending a clear message to Westminster and Stormont that years of cuts must end. Strike action has become necessary because standing up for ordinary people hasnt been a priority. googletag.cmd.push The Tories will now believe they have a greenlight to continue their assault on ordinary people and public services. People power, like we are seeing now from nurses, civil servants and others, will be necessary to stop them. Ordinary people are going to need to stick together to resist what Boris Johnson and the political establishment has in store. Well need to fight very hard to end the decade of cuts that have left many with poverty pay and our public services under severe strain. Motion to Derry and Strabane Council in October from Cllr Shaun Harkin: Councilsupports our Postal Workers who overwhelmingly voted to take strike action in defence of their jobs, conditions and public service ethos. Councilstands in solidarity with our Nurses and all Health Service workers in their vote to take strike action for pay equality. Our postal workers, nurses, health service workers, civil servants and teachers provide essential services, care and amenities that every community depends on.Councilopposes attacks on workers rights and our public services. Councilwill invite representatives from the postal workers, civil servants, health care and education unions to make presentations to a Special meeting ofCouncil.

The neighbourly gathering bringing together the Cromore Beatles, Gerry Cassidy, Barry Donaghy and Didi Semple- who both played their own set and backed golden-voiced Anne Tracey all to warm applause.

Damian Gorman is a quietly compelling performance poet and his rendering of his poignant autobiographical poem ”The Giant Basket” touched hearts in An Cro Mor.

An event held in An Cro Mor was like one of those “big nights” that flourished in people’s homes years before wall to wall football on pub tv’s and late night drinking distracted people. The neighbourly gathering bringing together the Cromore Beatles, Gerry Cassidy, Barry Donaghy and Didi Semple- who both played their own set and backed golden-voiced Anne Tracey all to warm applause.  Local writers Ben Dillon and Liam Diver took their spot in the limelight reading a few of their own poems that reflect the challenges le can bring. This reading may be a stepping stone to further writing and more performances from both Liam and Ben. googletag.cmd.push Julieann Campbellread from her Guildhall Press publication “Milk teeth” and graced us too with a number of new poems she is currently working on. Damian Gorman is a quietly compelling performance poet and his rendering of his poignant autobiographical poem ”The Giant Basket” touched hearts in An Cro Mor. Undoubtedly though the evening’s youngest performer Caitlin Browne was the star of the night. The audience hollered their appreciation after her lively reading. Her father Jim in the audience was a proud and delighted man. An audience member from Linsfort Drive offered this feedback Why can’t we have nights like this more often ” We just have to organise them! googletag.cmd.push Creggan Community Collective deserve both thanks and praise for opening their doors to this “Christmas Cracker”.

He attended St. Peters from  - and left with one O Level in English. This week he was awarded a PhD for a thesis assessing the readiness of domestically violent men to engage in domestic violence rehabilitation programmes. In the midst of the Troubles it was a dficult time for young people to focus on their studies.Maurice said: “For me, leaving school with one O Level and thinking I was stupid, to get into such a prestigious course and successfully completing it is a proud moment.”The Derry man is proof that le is about learning as despite leaving school with few qualications he immersed himself in study and has used it to help others through decades of social and community work.After spending some time on the dole, at -years-old Maurice began voluntary work as a youth worker and enrolled in an Addiction Studies course at Ulster University Magee.This coincided with work at Northlands Addiction Treatment Centre. Maurice believes alcohol was, and still is, the single biggest issue facing Derry. “The problem is that people don’t even view it as a drug, but it’s more powerful than most and one of the few drugs that actually damages the body just by taking it.”The heavy binge drinking culture that exists in Ireland is the source of many social ills, he said. “The main reason children are taken into care, neglect, is often down to parents having a drink problem.” googletag.cmd.push Treatment projects In January  he moved to London to work in a residential alcohol treatment project where he attained a diploma in alcohol counselling at the University of Kent. The following year he got a job as manager at the alcohol treatment centre, a post he held for four years.When planning toto live in Derry he believed that with a social work qualication he could secure a steady job and therefore applied for the professional social work training course at the University of Ulster.“The best thing about it was that it gave me an academic qualication and also a professional qualication which would allow me to be employed.“I graduated in  and started working right away with the Foyle Health and Social Services Trust in the Leaving and After Care Team, supporting young people who are leaving care and preparing to live independently in the community.”In  he, and local community worker, Frankie McMenamin, established the local charity, Zest, an organisation providing supportive care and counselling to young people struggling with suicidal ideation and self-harm. Maurice managed Zest for  years before leaving to pursue other interests.At the turn of the millennium until  he was part of the first Drug Arrest Referral scheme in Northern Ireland. The scheme was managed by the Western Health and Social Care TrustAlcohol and Dug Service and required daily attendance at the Strand Road Police Station. It was an innovative project through which all persons detained at the police station were offered support to address alcohol and drug problems. googletag.cmd.push PhD studies  In  he was grant aided by the Public Health Agency to undertake a fellowship at Queens University Belfast.His PhD involved “assessing the readiness of domestically violent men to engage in domestic violence rehabilitation programmes” in Northern Ireland. “A lot of men drop out of these rehabilitation programmes and what research has found is that when these men drop out they actually present as a greater risk to victims compared tothey had never been referred. “Amongst other things, the research established the men who completed the programme stopped drinking before or at the start of the programme, whereas the men who dropped out of the programme had continued to drink alcohol.“Because of the way alcohol affects the brain,you’re not drinking you’re far more alert and your brain can make connections and you can develop insight to understand yourself.“Butyou’re drinking during the week then it slows the brain’s ability to make sense of things.”He is now working to rehabilitate men who have been domestically violent. “We know prison doesn’t work and most of the men never receive the help that they need,” Maurice said. ‘Compassion’ When he ed to the WHSCT from his secondment at Queens University Belfast, Maurice began working as part of the Domestic Violence Team. Here he set up the first group-based and inidualised domestic violence treatment programmes run by the WHSCT. The demands entailed in establishing the new programme meant that it took longer than initially anticipated to finish the PhD.However, this year he successfully completed the PhD which is the culmination of eight and a half years of hard work.Sadly, his parents aren’t alive to share what is a high point on le’s journey but his children and other family members attended the graduation ceremony. “I’m really looking forward to the event, my daughter and son are going with me,” he said.Asked about the lessons he’s learned through his studies and decades of paid and voluntary work, he said: “No matter what sort of problems a person has, human beings have a massive capacity to change but you have to have the right support and help, which has to be provided in a non-judgemental and compassionate manner.“You can condemn behaviour, but not the person. You have to believe in the persons inherent worth and in their ability to bring about the change they need. Change is possible but people need the right support network in place.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

I knew him from gigs and as a customer of Cool Discs when I worked there. More than that though I felt I knew him more through other people’s recollections of him and to deliver the eulogy I give you me and Mickey’s friends.Joe Brown said: “Derry sadly lost a man you don’t meet every day. There was nothing lying beneath, no agendas, no jagged edges. “A rock solid partner to Breige and an inspirational man of music, art and literature. I saw his band Idol Threat with The Undertones a number of times and became friends with him in the early s, going to gigs. “People were drawn to him and the inspirational effect he had on them. I heard so many bands for the first time through his record collection. I’ll always remember Mickey as a man who embraced le and had an incredible gt of bringing people together, loved a party and kept me from going sane Derry feels like a dferent place without him, every now and then nature conjures up someone very unique and special, who so many had barrels of affection for and who’ll be sadly missed by us all”.Mickey Rooney said: “His flat was always open to the outsiders, his heart was open to all no matter what creed or colour and his mind was always open to whatever experiences came his way”.Raymond Gorman said: “There was definitely no one like him, it took real guts to dress as a punk back in the day, it was a very violent time, Mickey was fearless and hated bullies. The last time I spoke to him he was enthusing about his latest music pourchases and gigs he’d been to. I think he’d be annoyed with everyone being too sad about his passing, remember him with the smile he put on your face when you met him”.Louise McIntyre said: “I first knew Mickey as a teenager growing up in the Brandywell, he was in my older brother’s class in school, I never actually got to talk to him back then as he was a quiet sort. “My earliest memory is looking across at Mickey’s backyard flat roof extension roof and seeing him lying up there with a small radio to his ear listening to his music, even then I knew he was dferent   cool. Several years later we crossed paths again and became a true friend he was doing best man at our wedding. He always remembered birthdays and special occasions. “Mickey stood head and shoulders above everyone  in more ways than one. He was an inspiration and a Derry legend. I somehow hope that he knew this, and that Derry will be an emptier place without him. Thanks for the memories Mickey xx”.Liz Brown said: “One of lasting memories Ill carry of Mickey was his genuine love and kindness towards his friends and loved ones. Like gravity, Mickey had an unseen force that pulled people together and kept their feet on the ground”.Paul McCartney paid a touching tribute in the Journal the day of Mickey’s funeral. “As the s began, you’d usually touch base with Mickey in the town centre on a Saturday. He had a band called The Idol Threats and soon the band I played in, Graffiti, ended up regularly supporting them. I don’t think I saw a local group as musically adventurous until That Petrol Emotion came along. It was a million miles apart from The Undertones and The Moondogs and Mickey was crucial to this process. He wasn’t just the drummer - he was the lyricist also. Just as the music was very involving and mysterious, so, too, were the words and song titles - ‘Lonely Beach Now, ‘Postcard from Abroad’ and the legendary ‘Little Green Men on The Moon.Mickey was a kind and generous guy, but also grateful and reciprocal for everything he received. He remembered everyone’s birthday and was always there with a card or gt. He constantly exuded a spirit of fun and that amazing sense of humour of his was just non-stop and incredible - you simply didn’t know what would come next.“Politics  He didn’t do them, and they did not happen in the many get-togethers in his legendary Abercorn Place flat. I think I can genuinely describe him as an “Enemy of Sectarianism”. When Mickey was cruelly affected by ill health in recent years, this sense of civility never eroded. So lucky are many of us for having this wonderful and inspirational human being around for many years”. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The money raised from the concert will help the service provide a vital leline for young people who are dealing with a number of issues, including struggles with their mental health and emotional wellbeing.

The news has had an huge impact on players and clubs across the Irish League and beyond and Cltonville manager McLaughlin admitted Thompsons death is a huge loss to everyone in football.  The recent death of Jerry Thompson has shocked fotoball. googletag.cmd.push “I only knew him as an opponent but he was one of those players you would always be looking out for in the other team because he had that bit of quality that youd be worried about,” he said. “Its sad for his family and its sad for football and my thoughts and prayers go out to his family, his team mates and also his friends. Its devastating to have this to deal with but sadly its all too common in Northern Ireland at the minute.”The nature of Thompsons death, particularly for someone so young, has resumed the conversation about the importance of mental health and McLaughlin agreed that todays youth are often fighting battles that few realise.“Its a stark reminder of young players and what they have to deal with these days in terms of social media and the pressures of le,” he continued.“Some of them take on the pressures of the world and it doesnt have to be like that because there are people out there who can help. Theres probably not enough help on hand for young people in general, not just footballers so I think we should all be looking into that a lot more. I dont think theres enough done about it in general, but at club level I think every club should be looking into it. I think every club should have someone on board who young players can come and speak to about anything at all.“To be fair to Cltonville and I know a lot of clubs are the same, they have a club chaplain on board and ours is there every training session and there every game. Hes there to speak to anyone about anything at all, good and bad, and its good to have that about. “Maybe clubs should be looking to have professional help on site at all times for young players because the pressures of le do get to them a lot and they have so much to deal with so perhaps clubs should look into that.”The loss of Thompson will be keenly felt in footballing circles for some time to come and McLaughlin emphasised the importance of remembering his legacy.“It would scare you,” he admitted. “It would scare you thinking about how the mind works and how young people think. Jerry had a young family, and he was a hard-working young man and he was playing in the Irish League and people would probably look and say he has everything he needs, but people dont know what goes on in others minds and what theyre dealing with behind closed doors. “This would probably scare a lot of players into seeking help andthere is any good to come from it, hopefully it does encourage people to seek professional help and be more open with their problems.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The gig will take place on Saturday December .  ‘Christmas with The Swingtime Starlets’ in the hotel’s Corinthian Ballroom invites the public to enjoy a four course meal and boogie the night away as OrlaMullan, Rosie Barry and Colette Lennon Dougal add a festive twist to their popular vintage repertoire.  Inspired mainly by s swing and boogie woogie specialists The Andrews Sisters, the girls also move up the eras and pay homage to the girl groups and as who followed such as Ella Fitzgerald, the McGuire Sisters, The Ronettes, The Chfons and Etta James. googletag.cmd.push  “It’s our first time bringing our Christmas show to Derry and we really just want people to come and enjoy a delicious meal and great music with family and friends,” explained founder member Orla.  “Our primary aim with each performance is to put a smile on people’s faces and provide an evening of entertainment that brings pure joy to our audience.  “The main piece of feedback we get most often, outside of our music, is how much fun we are having on stage and that it’s infectious  “We literally have people aged between  to  at our gigs and always,we are having fun, that transports through to the audience and onto the dance floor.” googletag.cmd.push  Formed in , the Starlets were already friends through their professional careers as actors and singers.  Highlights to date include selling out the Empire Music Hall and Black Box stages in Belfast and performing with a live brass band at the Walled City Tattoo in the Millennium Forum.  “We wanted to create something that was firstly, a lot of fun to be part of and secondly, something that was a little bit dferent, both musically and aesthetically,” Orla continued.  “I had always been a huge fan of the wartime, swing and big band eras and having performed a similar set of music a few years ago, it inspired me and the group developed from there.  “For me, trying to recreate that vintage sound and bring it back to le is the biggest joy - to get to do it with your friends as The Swingtime Starlets, is the added bonus.  “We are all currently involved in acting projects - Rosie is currently playing Pablo’s Mum on the CBeebies series ‘Pablo’, Colette is performing at the Lyric in ‘Peter Pan’ and I have just completed filming for the third season of ‘Marcella’ starring Anna Friel for ITV Netflix.   “So for us, it is the perfect outlet to utilise our vocal skills and love of music alongside our other acting work - and we absolutely love it!”  Christmas with the Swingtime Starlets takes place in the City Hotel on Saturday December  at .pm.

An economist is also helping compile the document.City deals are packages of funding and decision making powers which allow councils to boost the economy through the development of large projects in their respective areas.The deals are designed to allow councils to take charge and responsibility of decisions that affect their area, do what they think is best to help businesses grow, create economic growth and decide how public money should be spent.Newry, Mourne and Down is one of five local authorities paired with Belfast City Council, universities and theprivate sector who have

the councilrsquos Enterprise, Tourism and Regeneration Committee, politicians were told that officials have been working on the detailed outline business case since last May, with a consultancy team helping prepare the document.Council officials say that when work on the business case is completed next spring, it will provide a detailed analysis and assessment of the projectrsquos strategic fit within the City Deal.In addition, the document will also outline detailed project costs, the benefits, risks and funding requirements.Politicians were told this week that the documentrsquos analysis will recommend a particular procurement route in order to deliver the scheme.It has also been confirmed that the ongoing development of the business case involves planning considerations and the development of exemplar design and output specications, prior to any formal procurement exercise being undertaken.Politicians were informed on Monday night that the outline business case will provide detail on the technical expertise in terms of the design, construction and maintenance of similar international attractions and also provide detailed analysis of commercial operations of a visitor attraction of this scale.It is understood that council officials are working alongside Tourism NI to secure financial backing for other aspects of the tourism investment and support to move the projects through a series of key stages, including the preparation of business cases and planning approval.Other aspects of the Mournes Gateway scheme include an elevated tree top walk in Tollymore Forest Park, a new visitor centre and bird hide at the Murlough Nature Reserve and a new bridge constructed under the main Kilkeel Road at the Bloody Bridge on the outskirts of the town.Consultants appointed by the local authority to look at developing the resortrsquos visitor infrastructure have also come up with proposals for the Islands Park, with upgrades planned for existing car parks, alongside new public toilet provision.There are also proposals to reduce the the tree line in Donard Forest on the slopes of the Mournes, with a so-called green travel network which would allow visitors to hire bicycles and electric bikes to make their way round ious attractions is also suggested.The ious proposals form the core of the so-called Mourne Mountains Gateway Study and have

Someone came forward and this was welcomed by elderly people who would not be forced to travel outside the town to access services.Cllr Walker says it is vital that Ballynahinch retains its dedicated postal office and appealed to someone the townrsquos business community to consider taking over the service.ldquoBallynahinch is Down Districtrsquos third largest town and it would be a body blowthe planned temporary closure became permanent, he said.ldquoThe bottom lines appears to be thatno one comes forward to offer to run the service it will close and that will impact on people across the community.ldquoThe role of local post offices has changed considerably over recent years, with many transferring to large supermarkets which ensured that they were open for much longer, including weekends.ldquoMany elderly people prefer to conduct their business at post offices, not banks. That is one of the many reasons why this vitally important service is not lost to Ballynahinch. A number of local post offices, which provide a much broader range of services including banking facilities, are now housed in retail premises.Cllr Walker added: ldquoIt is my hope that one of the major retailers in Ballynahinch will come forward to ensure that the service is not lost to the town.

And while there is a signicant financial benefit for securing geopark status, council officials insist the benefits are not just economic.They have previously argued that geoparks have a ldquosignicant role to play in empowering local communities and giving them the opportunities to develop cohesive partnerships with the common goal of promoting the arearsquos signicant geological and other heritage.There are currently  geoparks found in  countries across the world, all of which have been developed using a bottom-up approach with local communities playing a signicant role in this process.Currently, there are three designated geoparks in Ireland. In addition to the Marble Arch Caves in Fermanagh, they include The Burren and Clfs of Moher in Co Clare and the Copper Coast geopark in Co Waterford.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council spokeswoman confirmed on Monday afternoon that the local authorityrsquos bid for geopark was formally submitted last month..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/11th December 2019 Publication.jpg","title":"Book delves into the history around Strangford  ","story":"INVERBRENA Local History Group has launched the latest edition of its annual magazine mdash just in time for Christmas.Memories From Inverbrena: Strangford  features a selection of memories, stories, histories and photographs of people and places within the Strangford area, preserved for future generations.The magazine includes an article by Michael McConville in which he chronicles the history of the the local parish drama club during the s and s, including a selection of photographs of local amateur actors and actresses who participated in some of the popular well received productions.In his second article in this yearrsquos publication, Michael remembers happy days potato picking, recalling how everyone worked together as a team, both boys and girls, and all getting the same pay at the end of the day.Melanie Hamill puts pen to paper to provide an invaluable record of her splendid conversion of Strangford Presbyterian Church, earning it the prestigious  Heritage Angel award for Best Rescue of a Historic Building Or Place for projects under pound million.

These included the non-replacement of clerical staff who resign and y delays in the supply of equipment necessary for class use.Mr Ellis also slammed a proposal to impose a charge for school transport and labelled it as ldquoclearly unfair.He stressed that he was not taking the negative attitude that all cuts are bad.

He was very young and had been badly neglected. He had been kept in a confined space or a very small pen. Sony was very loving. All he wanted was to be loved and he thrived on attention.ldquoHe was a huge dog but very dirty. When we gave him a bath his coat came up lovely and white. We got him started with his first round of vaccinations and our followers stood by us financially.Monica works closely with Corran Kennels, on the Tobercorran Road outside Downpatrick, who come to her for helpthey need a puppy or dog re-homed, and Animal Connexions, based at Nutts Corner outside Belfast.Monica said: ldquoRecently a litter of  kittens were about to be euthanised and we managed to be able to find homes for all of them within a short period of time.Monica added that she has her own account with the two branches of Castle Vets in Downpatrick and Castlewellan and pays for any necessary medical attention abandoned pets may need out of her own pocket.ldquoMembers of the public are so good. When we put up an appeal on the page that an animal requires surgery or medicine they phone the vets and give money and it comes off the bill.ldquoI am so grateful to everyone. It can be tough going and running something like this takes a big chunk out of your le, but our team of volunteers are thankfully very enthusiastic.ldquoAnyone can follow the page. Just ask to join the group through the socialmedia network and followers will be able to keep up-to-date with what we are doing.Lana King, from Burrenreagh, is a volunteer with the not-for-profit organisation.She said: ldquoWhile the main aim of the page back in  originally was to reunite owners with their pets, there are times when nobody comes looking for a little lost one and thatrsquos when Monica goes beyond the call of duty and ensures they have a second chance with a new family.ldquoShe gets to know the potential owner, carries out a home check and follows it up. There is nothing she loves more than to hear how the pets she has helped to re-home or re-habilitate are doing.Lana added: ldquoMonica really is the back bone of Lost Found Pets South Down and has gained the admiration and respect from anyone who comes into contact with her.ldquoNothing is ever too much bother for her.ldquoShe has devoted her le to animals and makes sure every pet that comes to her receives the very best of care.ldquoEven though Monica suffers with a debilitating disease called lupus, she just gets up every morning and gets on with it.ldquoHer sharp wit, sense of humour and contagious laugh lts the spirits of people who are going through the heartbreak of having their pet go missing and reassures them because they know Monica will do everything she can to reunite them with their beloved pet.Lana added: ldquoMonica helps those pets who have found themselves either lost, abandoned, abused or simply not having a loving home to call their own..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/11th December 2019 Health.jpg","title":"Health workers take  industrial strike action  ","story":"HEALTH workers in Downpatrick took strike action last Friday ahead of a series of protests calling for pay parity and adequate nursing numbers.Nurses were working to rule yesterday and today at the Downshire and Downe Hospitals while a joint strike planned between their union, the Royal College of Nursing , and Unison, will be held next Wednesday.Hospital and outlying district services will be impacted as the strike will run from am until pm mdash unless a deal is done before that.Unison and the RCN are demanding equal pay for its members in line with UK counterparts and for increased nurse recruitment to protect patients in a failing health service.Domestics, porters, catering staff, administrative staff, dental nurses from all wards and departments in the Downe and Downshire Hospitals and outlying facilities will join nurses who have voted to strike for the first time in their -year history.Public support was high for health workers, including nurses from the Down Outpatients Department, who took part in Fridayrsquos strike.Hundreds of Unison members joined the picket in the morning and afternoon at Downshire Hospitalrsquos entrance with local drivers sounding support as they passed.The impact of the action closed the Outpatients department at the Downe Hospital, along with the Ulster Hospital, Lagan Valley, Ards and Bangor Hospitals.The Community Dental Service was impacted with the cancellation of the Ballynahinch clinic and two clinics at Downe Hospital on Friday afternoon.The impact was widespread for patients as day case surgery, ENT and gynaecology at Lagan Valley Hospital was cancelled along with the closure of the Medical Day Case Unit, Dermatology Laser Unit, Cath Lab and Ambulatory Hubs at the Ulster Hospital.The South Eastern Health and Social Care Trust said that that all affected patients had been contacted and would be rescheduled for appointments at a future date.Staff from the Downshire Hospital were strengthened by colleagues from the nearby Downe, who joined the picket.Unison members who work in the transport and domiciliary care went out on strike from am- noon while the rest of the workers came out from pm-pm.South Down MP Chris Hazzard and SDLP election candidate Michael Savage showed their support as did SDLP MLA Colin McGrath and Downpatrick councillors Oonagh Hanlon and John Trainor.Unison branch secretary Marian Ritchie called on all the elected representatives present to give members more than a show of support.She told cheering strikers: ldquoWe want every politician here now to give a commitment to say, as iniduals and as a group, that every single one of the the health service staff will get a pay rise and pay parity.The call was met with shouts of ldquoGet back to work by the strikers.Ms Ritchie also told her colleagues: ldquoThe Permanent Secretary says that he has the money but not the authority and the only ones that have the authority are the politicians.

McIlhone won the ball off a Ballynagross defender and without even looking up let one fly from  yards out.Goalkeeper Ross Preece was stranded in no manrsquos land and his despairing outstretched attempt to tip the ball over the crossbar failed as the ball nestled in the back of the net.Two minutes later, man of the match Ross Armstrong made it -. He chased a lost cause of a ball into the box where Marron and Preece were favourites to win the race, but Armstrongrsquos sheer desire helped to get him to the ball first and he was able to dink it into an empty net.With  minutes gone Armstrong pounced again to make it - after McIlhone had carved out the opening.Killough continued to bombard Ballynagross with everything and anything, but Ballynagross bravely weathered the storm and gradually started to create chances of their own.With  minutes gone they patiently worked an opening for Ryan McKinney, but he was denied a goal when the impressive Sean Og Burns got back to hack the ball off the line.That was as good as it got for Ballynagross as Killough made it - three minutes later. Gareth George picked the ball up from a Ben McLaughlin throw and immediately set off on one of his trademark, penetrating runs.George had only one thing on his mind after leaving three players for dead and his unerring finish into the bottom corner had Preece clutching at thin air.Six minutes later it was - when Armstrong headed a free back across the box and McIlhone had all the time in the world to send Killough into delirium.With  minutes gone a delightful cross from Adam George was met perfectly by Armstrong and the big striker powered an unstoppable header to the net to make it -.Some of Killoughrsquos play in the first half was breathtaking and few teams could have lived with them and as the players trooped off at half-time, everyone feared for Ballynagross.However, the break gave Campbell the chance to reorganise his troops and the were a dferent proposition in the second half.Marron pulled one back from the spot after Sean Og Burns took down Philip Doran in the box, but despite creating several other chances, that was it for Ballynagross.Eoin Rooney and Conor McCarron had shots well saved by Killough lsquokeeper Eddie Hinc, while Liam Graham headed over at the other end and Preece saved from Gareth George.Killough were a pale shadow of the side that lit up Binnian Park in the first  minutes, but they can be forgiven for taking their foot off the pedal after taking a - lead.Ballynagross can only reflect on what might have been, had they been able to field at full strength, but football can be a cruel game as they found out on Friday night.Killough: Eddie Hinc, Matthew Burns, Ben McLaughlin, Colm Stranney, Sean Og Burns, Matt McKiernan, Gareth George, Adam George, Tony McIlhone, Ross Armstrong, Riain Burns: Subs: Liam Graham, Seamas Tumelty, Ryan McIlhone, Robbie Hagan, Ruairi Sharvin.Ballynagross: Ross Preece, Deaglan Craig, Tom McNeill, Aaron Beattie, Conor Marron, Conor McCarron, Karl Johnston, Mark Magill, Daniel Taggart, Declan Dowie, Ryan McKinney.

Over the past year, the level of recycled waste has increased by %.Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran hopes the work to provide mains power to the new Flying Horse Road facility is completed as soon as possible.ldquoI do not know why there is no mains power but it is a little embarrassing that the CCTV cameras at a poundm centre cannot be operated and we have had to hire in a private security firm, he said.ldquoThis represents an additional cost to already hard-pressed ratepayers and I hope that we are talking about days, not weeks, for the mains power to be supplied. It is an issue council officers need to be on top of.Cllr Curran said that many people were keen to see the new centre opened, given that its predecessor at nearby Cloonagh Road was struggling to cope with the huge demand being placed upon it.He continued: ldquoIt is great to have such a modern recycling facility on our doorstep to meet the needs of people who are clearly recycling their waste in increasing numbers. The new centre is being well used and the council deserves credit for this major investment but, in my opinion, the mains power issue should have been sorted before it opened for business.Cllr Curran said that given the increased emphasis on recycling, the council is behind innovative plans to allow groups and charities across the district to reuse ious items dumped at household recycling centres in Downpatrick, Castlewellan and Ballynahinch.He added: ldquoA number of groups have expressed an interest in taking part and I have no doubt that this scheme will be a success with ious items destined for the scrapheap given a new lease of le.A council spokeswoman confirmed that the recycling centre was operating without mains power.ldquoIt has taken longer than anticipated to connect the mains power supply at the new site, said the spokeswoman.ldquoAs a temporary measure, a generator and security firm are being used to cover requirements. Newry, Mourne and Down Council is working to have the mains power installed as soon as possible.The Recorder asked the local authority how much it is paying the security firm to police the new civic amenity site outside its normal operating hours but was not provided with an answer..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/11th December 2019 Leitrim.jpg","title":"Sr Bartholomew’s centenary celebrations  ","story":"THE family of a Leitrim nun, who has lived in Africa for  years, flew thousands of miles to help her celebrate her  birthday.Sr Mary Bartholomew was joined by five nieces, including Dympna Kelly and Eileen Ramsey from her home village, who arrived in Port Elizabeth, South Africa, to mark her milestone birthday last week.Another niece, Mary McAleenan, from Slievnaboley, near Leitrim, who wasnrsquot able to make the journey, says her aunt had been on an adventure since she left home in  on board the Warwick Castle to care for ldquothe poorest of the poor amid the soaring heat of South Africa.Sr Bartholmew, was born Philomena Cunningham on December , , and enjoyed growing up with her four sisters and three brothers on what is now known as Kilnhill Road in Leitrim.She and her older sister, Mary Bernadette, who also became a nun, were among the first girls to play camogie in Leitrim before an official team had even been set up by the local Fontenoys GAA club.She was educated at Sacred Heart Grammar School in Newry and with her heart set on a religious vocation she entered the Assumption Convent in Ballynahinch just as World War II began.Her niece, Mary, said that being a nun in those days brought honour to a family and having two daughters as nuns set the Cunninghams apart within their small rural village.ldquoThere were nine other postulants accompanying Sr Bartholomew on the long voyage across to Africa. Her ship was the last passenger ship to sail to the continent for many years, as most ships were then commissioned for the war effort, Mary explained.The young nun swapped the green fields and rain of home for the blistering heat and bustle of Grahamstown in the Eastern Cape, which must have been quite an experience.She completed her religious formation and academic teacher training before taking her vows in . Over the following decades she taught in several schools. Eventually, on retiring, she was assigned a new mission, opening a clinic and a pre-school within an encampment that catered for over , refugees fleeing the horrors of the Mozambique war.In Sr Bartholomewrsquos own words of this period in her le, recorded in a book written over  years ago, Drumgooland ndash A Parish Divided, she recalls: ldquoWith missionary zeal we did our utmost over the following years to render whatever assistance we could to the many thousands of refugees, I taught including adults.ldquoThese poor people had a minimum of education and were eager to learn English. After class we would sit around and read the bible in Shangaan, the local language, and gave help when it was needed.Niece Mary takes up the story again. She added: ldquoNuns donrsquot retire and while Sr Bartholomew found the intense heat too much after several years, she made for the cooler environment of an office and spent time in general admin.Sr Bartholomew would often make the trip back home to Leitrim after Vatican II came to pass when the rigours and discipline of a pious le became more relaxed in the s. However, she was always looked forward to going back to Port Elizabeth.Her last trip home was some years ago when her older sister, Eileen, was seriously ill.ldquoShe had managed to hold her hand and chat briefly before she passed away, Mary recalled. She stayed until Eileenrsquos months mind,and left shortly after. This was the last time she was home..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/11th December 2019 Sophie.jpg","title":"Teenager Sophie fundraising for blind charity  ","story":"A BALLYNAHINCH teenager has embarked upon a fundraising initiative on behalf of the Guide Dogs for the Blind Association.Sophie Millswill be selling raffle tickets for a host of prizes over the coming weeks ahead of a a key fundraising event in Ballynahinch Masonic Hall on February  next year.The Year  Ballynahinch High School student mdash who has been diagnosed with Albinism mdash is on the waiting list for a guide dog and has already been cane-trained by representatives from the charity.The teenager, who relies on the aid of her cane, is hoping that she will get her guide dog sometime next year, but is conscious that there is a long waiting list.Sophie, who recently finished in the top six of a SuperValu Superstars competition and was presented with a certicate during a glittering awards night at Belfastrsquos Titanic Hotel, is keen to help the Guide Dogs charity by raising money on its behalf.Her mum Marina said the estimated cost of training a guide dog is pound,.She explained: ldquoSophie wants to raise as much money as she can to help the charity which does not receive any government funding.

It boasts a unique approach to teaching vocational skills, as well as academic and sports facilities.In particular, one alleyway on the school site had seen sheds transformed into small businesses, which the pupils ran - earning qualications and gathering valuable work experience, with staff and students hoping to open it up to the public soon.ldquoItrsquos a bit like Diagon Alley, isnrsquot it  said Ms Wood. Here the school hosts its own bike repair shop, in the form of Spokes, a cafe, its own radio station - The Voice - and plans for a zero-waste food shop are well under way.Robin Hackett, head of KS, showed me around some of the buildings.ldquoThe cafe opened to our students around July time, and was fully operational and officially in September, for the new academic year, he said.ldquoIt opened at the same time as our radio station, with money generously donated from the Postcode Community Trust.ldquoNext on the agenda is our plan to open a fully zero-waste food shop. Wersquove been having talks with other similar shops around Cardf and here in Penarth, like Foxyrsquos, about how to do it.ldquoThe idea is that, because wersquore a residential school, it will give our pupils a place to shop for things like cereal, fruit, biscuits and so on without plastic wrappers or other waste.ldquoOur initial, short-term plan is to reduce our own, internal impact on the environment, butwe can get it up and running to the extent we want, we may as well open it to the local community. Imagine - popping over to the school, grab a tea or a coffee, do your food shop and get your bike serviced, all by our pupils.The pupils I spoke to were enthusiastic about opening their school to the community, and plenty of them had applied for shts in the shop and cafe.One proudly told me he had secured shts in the cafe, and while we peered through the window into the future site of the zero-waste shop, he made sure I noticed the poster for the Lego club. He was the president of it.ldquoWersquore hoping to open the shop in January, said Mr Hackett. ldquoWersquore just waiting on the builders now.ldquoA lot of kids here struggle in academic settings, so this is all building good skills for the future. Our philosophy is, one percent change at a time adds up to a lot.We moved across the alleyway to the schoolrsquos music room.It was well-stocked with plenty of high-tech equipment, from first-class ampliers to cutting-edge keyboards. Excitingly, the school also has a state-of-the-art soundbooth on the way from Germany.ldquoWersquore looking to rent it out to local bands and others as a rehearsal and recording space, once wersquove built it up to the second floor, said Mr Hackett. ldquoWersquore investing in better equipment, and wersquoll be holding radio production workshops with the local primaries, like Victoria Road.The school doesnrsquot just offer vocational opportunities, either.ldquoRecently a lot of pupils went to Belgium, to Ypres, said principal Matthew Burns. ldquoThe best part is they cycled most of the way there!ldquoOver five days, they would cycle a huge distance, and then ride a coach or the Eurostar partway. That way, they got all the way to Ypres, to hear the Last Post and lay a wreath.ldquoWe also put a lot of emphasis on sport, with a state of the art Astroturf we rent out to the community, and a great football team - we recently attended a tournament at Heronsbridge and only narrowly lost to the overall winners.ldquoOutside of that, our KS group are putting together a foodbox raiser for Christmas for those in need, and wersquove just had our drama and music department invited to put on a production for the Senedd.With IT suites, science labs and gymnasiums, this barely scratched the surface of what the school had to offer. Itrsquos no surprise the school has been so successful, with such close attention from its staff. As a school focussing on children with learning dficulties, the pupil number is kept low, with around  pupils attending at any one time. The largest class has eight pupils, with most having fewer.ldquoWe have around  day pupils and  at the moment in residential, staying in one of our four homes on and off the site, said Ms Wood. ldquoFor those children, we offer a  week-a-year provision.ldquoThe houses are lovely - we really want it to feel like their own home, their own bedroom, with their belongings.ldquoIt forms part of our relational approach - how we talk to our children and how we talk to each other. If we have a new pupil arrive here, the first thing to focus on is building a positive relationship with them.ldquoThe conversations are all about recognising whatrsquos going on and supporting them, in their own time.Judging by the smiles on the faces of staff and students alike, itrsquos an approach to be emulated the world over. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This is not unique to Wales but an issue across the UK.Itrsquos important we act to ensure that our health service is sustainable in the long term.Recent figures show excellent progress has been made again this year.I increased the number of GP training places from  to  this year.However we actually filled  places.This is an increase of  per cent on last year and is great news for us locally.In order to ensure that we can recruit the medical workforce our health service needs now and in the future we also need to look outside Wales. That is why I recently visited India.The British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin have led the Medical Training Initiativescheme to bring medical professionals from India to work in NHS Wales for up to two years.This partnership with NHS Wales has led to over  doctors a year for the last three years being offered positions in NHS Wales through the scheme.During my visit I had the pleasure of meeting with some of the candidates who have applied to train work and live in Wales for two years together with the NHS Wales recruitment team.Our message that Wales is an excellent place to Train, Work and Live is clearly having an effect at home and abroad.As ever, I would be interested on hearing your views on this, please do get in touch. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

More than , people signed a petition to save the Victorian lamp posts, fearing a ldquoloss of valuable historic character from the streetscape in Penarth.A Vale council spokesman said: \"ldquoThe council has recently approved a more suitable replacement column for the old Victorian lampposts which will be painted black and feature embellishments to match the Victorian period style as well as having a swan neck arrangement that will accommodate a suspended LED lantern to meet its energy reduction strategy. It is intended to roll out this replacement column by replacing the previously installed steel columns along Cwrt y Vil Road before the end of this calendar year.\"Penarth Civic Society alleged the posts were safe in a letter sent last week to the Vale councilrsquos head of visible services and council leader Neil Moore.David Noble of the Penarth Civic Society said: ldquoWe would like to ask that the programme of removal and replacement of Victorian lampposts in Penarth is suspended with immediate effect.ldquoWe are completely in favour of the councilrsquos policy to replace old inefficient street lighting with modern more energy efficient LED lighting units. However, we are firmly of the opinion that not enough effort has gone into the decision.ldquoIt seems that the council is spending over pound, on replacing each lamppost. When two posts in Kymin Terrace and Beach Lane were converted, the contractor expressed concern that the spigot on the column was not strong enough to support the new unit. We believe this remains the sole justication for the claim the units are unsound.ldquoWe have been in contact with several street lighting contractors. They have all confirmed as long as the posts are structurally sound at their base there is no reason they cannot be upgraded.ldquoWe feel the decision to scrap the old columns was taken prematurely, without proper consideration and is motivated by a desire for expedience rather than sensibility and care.A Vale council spokesman said: ldquoThe council has a duty to ensure that the street lighting is in a safe condition and does not pose a hazard to the general public. As a result, a number of the older Victorian lampposts in Penarth were recently replaced because they were considered electrically and structurally unsafe with holes evident in some columns. Given the many safety concerns with these old columns it was not practical or cost-effective to attempt repairs and maintain appropriate level of public safety.ldquoThe council is confident the new replacement columns will address many of the concerns previously raised and enable the remaining unsafe Victorian cast iron columns throughout Penarth to be sympathetically replaced in , preserving the character and nature of the roads and streets which currently benefit from the visual appearance of the old Victorina cast iron columns.ldquoWhile the new replacement columns with embellishments and swan neck are more expensive than standard columns the cost will be offset by conversion to LED lanterns with signicant environment benefits as they produce less Co and will be more economical to operate over the letime of the new units. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ulster Business sat down for a chat with chief executive Kevin Kingston and his new deputy CEOs “The three of us make a very good team,” Danske Bank chief executive Kevin Kingston says, warmly, over an early morning coffee at Panama Cafe, close to its Belfast headquarters.The bank boss was speaking of the appointment of his colleagues, Vicky Davies and Stephen Matchett, to the role of joint deputy chief executives .It’s a bold move, and Danske is the only bank in Northern Ireland which boasts the senior roles. The pair have already helped shape the burgeoning performance of Danske Bank in their respective roles over the last few years, and will continue to do so alongside their new additional responsibilities.“We are the biggest bank in Northern Ireland and we play a crucial role in fuelling the economy in Northern Ireland – at a time of increased economic and political uncertainty it seems like the right thing to do, to be investing in our management structures,” Kevin tells Ulster Business.“We want to make sure that whatever the opportunities and challenges that NI and the bank may face in the next year or so, that we have the capacity to do what we need to do to continue to support our customers.”It’s been another busy year for Danske Bank. It posted an operating profit of £.m in the first six months of , up % year-on-year.“Vicky and Stephen have been instrumental in the progress we have made over the last few years. Vicky in terms of her strategic insight and support to me in terms of our organisational development, and Stephen in terms of his commercial and financial insights,” Kevin says.“The three of us make a very good team. We play to each other’s strengths. A lot of the progress we have made in the last few years is down to, in no small part, these two people sitting beside me.”Vicky is managing director of strategy and corporate development within the bank, while Stephen has been Danske’s chief financial officer for the last five years.For Kevin, the two new deputy chief executive roles comes at a key time of increased uncertainty around Brexit, and the future economic landscape – so creating the front-facing positions will help develop and grow engagement with customers and a large range of stakeholders.“We will continue to support Northern Ireland, as we have done for the last  years – it’s a role we must fulfil, especially in the event that the economy is more challenging in the months ahead.”Kevin says the bank is putting a renewed and sharp focus on helping and supporting customers in the event of a dficult economic environment, post-Brexit.And aside from the business metrics, Danske Bank was also named as Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community. That’s something which Kevin and his team place considerable pride and value in.“The thing I’m most proud of is the work we have done to be named Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community,” Kevin says.“We want the bank to be a force for good in the community. We are serious about that and we have four strategic pillars around our customers, stakeholders, society and our colleagues.” For Kevin, it’s about getting behind initiatives and “creating a legacy”. PROFILE: VICKY DAVIES Vicky Davies has settled in to her deputy chief executive role quickly – representing Danske Bank at the single largest delegation of Northern Ireland businesses to take their message to the heart of Westminster this summer.“The new deputy chief executive roles are a sign of the commitment the bank has to Northern Ireland,” Vicky says. “It’s a reflection of that and an outwards statement of intent to our customers and competitors. It’s also an opportunity for Stephen and I to expand our remits and our contribution to the bank.”A Cambridge University graduate, Vicky joined Danske Bank from Ulster Bank in  as Head of Business Development, before progressing to become managing director of strategy and corporate development. In  she became the bank’s first ever female executive board member.“My current core role is to devise and guide the strategy of the bank, plotting the course of its development over not just the next year, but the next five years and beyond” she said.With the new role that will also include spending more time with customers, industry bodies, and putting a face to the name amongst key stakeholders, as well as a sharpened internal focus – for example getting closer to the risk management aspects of the bank.Vicky and her fellow deputy chief executive Stephen Matchett have already been undertaking important executive roles, but the new posts will bring their roles and responsibilities to the fore.For years Vicky has been heavily involved in the burgeoning digital end of the bank, being close to the introduction of a number of mobile s and channels. On this, she says, “In the digital space, this year we have seen more than four million digital logons from customers each month and a % increase in digital transactions year-on-year.”Then there’s the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub on the ground floor of Danske HQ – a modern incubator and hub which in the space of little over a year now boasts around  members.“We wanted to help these businesses and also benefit from having their entrepreneurial spirit to rub off on our own colleagues,” she says. Vicky personally mentors some of these companies, hands on.She also chairs numerous committees within the bank and has a strong interest in its equality, ersity and inclusion agenda – having formed Danske’s Gender Diversity Network in .Vicky lives in Holywood with husband Bill and four young sons. On Brexit, she’s optimistic, given the strength of the bank’s position heading into the UK’s exit from the EU. “We hope there will be a good outcome. We are leading our competitors on a number of metrics, and that gives us a great springboard going forward.” PROFILE: STEPHEN MATCHETT Danske Bank’s other new deputy chief executive, Stephen Matchett, has held his core role as chief financial officerfor the last five years, and is a familiar face to journalists when it comes to discussing the minutiae of its results each year.“Danske Bank’s role in society is key, and we have an integral role in the economy here. The new leadership positions will see Vicky and I become more present and visible when it comes to customers, stakeholders and partners across the community” he says.A former Bank of Ireland executive, who began his career working for professional services giants PwC and Deloitte, at Danske Bank Stephen oversees a finance unit that also includes the treasury, economics, data intelligence and legal departments.Like Vicky, Stephen is also involved in leading in the Bank’s equality, ersity and inclusion agenda, and he is the senior management sponsor of ‘Enable’ – the Danske Disability Network.“My core role as CFO is traditionally slightly in the background – the changes now bring a public aspect to that, both within the wider Danske Bank Group and Northern Ireland.”It’s been a busy year for Stephen, and the rest of the bank, including being named Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community.The Bank has also placed a renewed focus on its environmental impact and climate change. It’s already removed plastic cups, bottles and other packaging from its buildings, and is opting for more renewable and recyclable alternatives throughout its ious operations.Stephen, who lives in Belfast with his we Carrie and two young sons, is also a member of the CBI’s UK Financial Services Council.The Financial Services Council is made up of senior representatives from a erse range of financial services organisations and insurers, including Lloyds Banking Group, Barclays, JP Morgan, Bank of America, Santander, Aviva, MasterCard Europe and RSA Insurance Group.Looking at Danske Bank’s most recent financials, Stephen says while it remains an uncertain economic climate, Danske Bank is continuing to grow, year-on-year.And on Brexit, he says the Bank is preparing and planning by looking through two lenses – a focus on controlling costs, while also seeking out growth opportunities.“We want to maintain where we are at through this period of uncertainty and prepare ourselves for when the clouds clear – that’s the ambition.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/con211.jpg","title":"connaire mcgreevy brewing a burgeoning m business","story":"Posted on Monday December  by Ulster Business In the last  years Co Down man Connaire McGreevy has built his facilities management business CTS Projects into a £m firm, started a brewery, bought a bar and chaired a football club. He speaks to John Mulgrew about further growth, holding back on GB expansion due to Brexit, and why staying in the EU is the best deal we have “It’s good for the environment, businesses and people,” Connaire McGreevy tells me.He’s speaking of course about EU membership, and he’s one of Northern Ireland’s business leaders not concerned with remaining partisan on the matter, as we head into a Christmas General Election and sit with a deal on the table which would likely lead to increased costs and bureaucracy between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.Connaire founded CTS Projects back in , and has developed it into a erse facilities management business, recently expanding further into the Republic – giving him reach from Donegal to Waterford, and “everything in between”.“We are an all-island facilities management company with signicant growth in the last number of years, particularly in the Republic of Ireland,” he told Ulster Business.“It has had signicant growth in the last number of years, particularly in the Republic of Ireland. We made moves after the Brexit referendum – we needed to ersy with a subsidiary.“There has been signicant growth in the Republic of Ireland, with % year-on-year. In business, it’s easy to grow from a base of nothing so we will see that normalise.”CTS began le refurbishing rundown properties, such as old social housing stock, to get them prepared to accept new tenants. That then grew and developed to include a focus on renewable heating, such as biomass boilers and solar  – focusing on energy efficiency. Around % of its work is with public sector clients, and the remainder with private companies.Those private sector clients include private office schemes in Belfast, looking after all of the main facilities management. CTS has grown into a -strong full-time workforce, with around  additional full-time sub-contractors also working for the business. And it’s on track to hit £m turnover this year.But CTS, like many other firms, has actively held back investing in new operations in GB, until there is a clear Brexit outcome.“Unfortunately we have noticed NI business opportunities have started to stagnate or decline,” he said. “A lack of an Assembly is having an impact on public sector– core maintenance, as opposed to new infrastructure development,” he says. “With private, there has been a downturn.”But he says since the summer “people seem to have found a new sense of confidence”. He says some of those who were holding back post-referendum appear to have now pushed forward with some investment.Speaking about which areas the company has grown in to, he said it has developed further into a more erse building management business.“We also expanded into fire and security in  – areas such as fire extinguishers, alarms and . We have found that energy efficiency and the environmentalis coming to the fore.” That includes areas such as battery energy storage and solar  for homes.“We have a lot of public sector clients in housing, education and healthcare. We have had local government in the past, and are actively targeting that area with new innovation.”Connaire’s own interest in decent beer drew out his entrepreneurship five years ago when he set up Mourne Mountains Brewery in Warrenpoint. On a separate note, he’s also the current chairman of Warrenpoint Town FC.“ was a passion turned into a business,” he says. “It’s exciting stuff, in terms of creating beer and marking five years. It’s still in its infancy and has been impacted by a mushroom of craft breweries.“I am still optimistic in the market, but I don’t see it growing as fast anymore. Looking at the market across the island, some may close their doors. The scale might not be there, and there are lots of larger breweries and imported beers – the consumer has so much choice. People know what they are looking for.”An opportunity also came knocking recently which saw Connaire taking on a bar in Warrenpoint, the Ye Old Ship Inn, which he says has a very personal connection.Connaire’s sister Ciara, who worked with him in CTS Projects and was a former gaelic footballer, passed away suddenly in . Connaire says she had worked in bars over the years, and the idea of taking one on was a conversation which they had.“There is vertical integration with the bar, as it’s an outlet there for us, with pop-up bars with the brewery.”But he, like many others in the brewing and distilling industry, says Northern Ireland’s licensing laws “are in the dark ages”. The main concern is that beer producers cannot sell their products to the public during a tour of the brewery, and require a drinks licence to do so.“We have a number of tourists who arrive at the doors, asking about tours and beer… it’s embarrassing for Northern Ireland. We don’t have the legislation in place. I am passionate about tourism in the area, and we have tourism projects in the mix.”With Brexit, Connaire believes the current deal from Prime Minister Boris Johnson would create a ergence down the Irish Sea, making all-island business a more attractive and palatable affair for companies here.“It’s an administrative border – paperwork, time and a cost to business,” he says. “Our plans would be going into GB to set up new company, with a small acquisition and some back office administration support. “All-island, under the deal it looks like we can have easy access, which is welcome. It’s so connected and any ergence is going to have an impact.”He said that could have an impact on foreign direct investmentas companies from outside the UK and Ireland. And Connaire says there is still no clarity of what a potential deal with the EU could look like on the outside.“It’s a waypoint in that journey and we have to be very cautious,” he said. “I personally feel we get the best deal possible being in the EU. Looking across the world, there are now trading blocs everywhere.“At this stage, in business circles, a lot of people are holding back investment to see what the trading environment is like. It’s the most uncertain period in my business journey.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/EHP_20191106_8525_web.jpg","title":"leading from the front kpmgs johnny hanna","story":"Posted on Wednesday December  by Ulster Business Fresh from a three month sabbatical travelling with his family, KPMG’s new partner in charge, Johnny Hanna, sits down with Ulster Business to discuss growing an already-strong local professional services firm with global reach, developing the next generation and what’s needed to set Northern Ireland apart on the world stage Johnny Hanna’s new role as partner in charge at KPMG in Northern Ireland sees him take the helm of an organisation already in a strong position, but also one which is very much in growth mode.And with more than  years under his belt working across KPMG, he’s now been tasked with taking the next leap forward – building on its strong client base, tackling the new business landscape which lies around the corner, and growing the next generation of top talent.While a global firm, KPMG works with a host of Northern Ireland businesses of all shapes and sizes – having le-long relationships with indigenous success stories such as First Derivatives and Norbrook – while also working with global businesses with connections to the UK and Ireland.TALENTKPMG now boasts a Belfast workforce of nearly  staff. But as the intake of top new graduates and experienced hires grows, that number looks set to expand and develop further still. Johnny’s confident that the company will continue to grow at its offices at the Soloist building in Belfast city centre. He points to the benefits for KPMG staff of signicant collaboration and shared working opportunities with Dublin as part a successful all-island business now employing over  people. The firm’s Corporate Finance team, for example, led by Russell Smyth are the go-to advisors in the renewables sector when it comes to fundraising for new assets north and south.“It’s an exciting time for the firm,” Johnny says. “We have done a lot in the last few years, working with many new clients, investing in our new office and increasing our graduate numbers. In addition there has been a record number of promotions. I’ve been working closely with our previous partner in charge John Hansen on all of that as well as continuing to grow and drive our large tax team, an area of expertise which we’ve always been renowned for.“My focus will be about maintaining this momentum and ensuring we continue to offer the expertise and solutions which our clients need, which will drive our growth. That means being alive to changing trading conditions, increased regulation and a business environment increasingly uncertain, disruptive and complex”.A law graduate from Queen’s University Belfast, Johnny’s also a fellow of Chartered Accountants Ireland, and a Chartered Tax Adviser– starting his career in Dublin with the former Arthur Andersen, which was later merged with KPMG.The Newry man became a partner with KPMG in  and has been head of tax in Northern Ireland since . The tax practice boasts around  tax professionals, most of which are dual qualied in tax and accountancy. “It’s a key dferentiator for us,” he says.“And while tax and audit represent the more traditional strands of business, KPMG has invested signicantly in new skills, specialisms and services arising from technological advances such as articical intelligence and cyber-security.”Johnny takes over his role at a time when Northern Ireland, along with the rest of the UK and Ireland, is undergoing arguably its biggest business and economic sht in a generation.“Brexit is just one part of it. We have been working closely with companies to prepare for Brexit, whether there is a ‘no deal’ or some sort of deal here.“We have had a lot of engagement with business groups and other stakeholders over the last three years to highlight our concerns and those of our clients. Wherever we end up on Brexit will definitely dictate the future trading conditions. Our role will be to help clients navigate their way around any new barriers they could face, as well as examining the potential opportunities which may arise from the UK’s exit from the EU.” ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT Attracting foreign direct investmentis something which cannot be ignored here, and a dferentiator for Northern Ireland could help bolster that – whether it’s a deal which moulds Northern Ireland as a unique business destination in the UK and Ireland, finally introducing a lower devolved rate of corporation tax or ideally a package of measures.“Not long after I took over the head of Tax role in  we co-hosted a breakfast in our KPMG New York office with ious international businesses. At that time there was a lot of talk around the reduced corporation tax rate. There was a lot of positivity and enthusiasm in the room that morning around the opportunity for Northern Ireland, and I’m looking forward to getting back to those types of discussions.“Northern Ireland requires a range of tools to help drive economic success in the post-Brexit era. It’s investment in infrastructure and skills, initiatives on export-led growth, delivering a .% tax rate and some sort of devolution of income tax powers – we need step change initiatives which can really turbocharge the private sector.”COMMUNITYGetting the right talent is also key for KPMG, building and developing a workforce which is increasingly erse, as well as giving back to the community. That includes a range of initiatives, including the recent launch of a skills-based scheme which has seen KPMG staff volunteering to help children, from a wide iety of backgrounds, with their literacy and numeracy skills.“Our graduates want to do more than get their qualications and service clients. They want to know that what they are doing has a broader purpose and objective. They want to know about our commitment to the local community and on environmental issues and be proud to work for KPMG”.  “We are ambitious to keep growing the practice and have a fantastic pool of talent in Belfast at all levels to help us realise those ambitions.“Ensuring we maintain the right culture within the firm for our people to reach their full potential and achieve their career aspirations is incredibly important. I was delighted we were able to add to our already strong team with the recent addition of four new partners in Ashleen Feeney, Paddy Doherty, Neil O’Hare and Dominic Mudge within our Deal Advisory, Tax and Audit teams.  “My role is to ensure that when I hand over to the next partner in charge, we are in an even stronger position than we are today. That’s the challenge and the goal but given the strong team and our market position, I know that I will relish the opportunity”.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
