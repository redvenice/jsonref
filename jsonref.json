I would have expected more honourable behaviour coming from such nobility.The 34-year-old legal aide said she has suffered Alopecia and has endured sustained stress and anxiety while attempting to care for her young son alone.She said that she and Mr Reeve first met on Facebook but eventually started a six-month relationship. She fell pregnant last summer and gave birth to a baby boy, Henry, in March this year but says Mr Reeve has not once seen his son.\u0027We were seeing each other for about six months when I fell pregnant by accident last summer.\u0027He took the news well initially and after talking it over we decided that at our age if it didn\u0027t happen for us now it might never happen so we decided to keep the baby.

He began to cool on the idea of being a father and abandoned me when we went for a scan and blood test.\u0027I\u0027ve no idea why, maybe it all became too real for him and it was too much to take.\u0027But I\u0027m the one whose now bringing up our son and he should pay his fair share.\u0027It\u0027s not me that I feel for, it\u0027s Henry. He\u0027s his son and the fact that he\u0027s not bothered to even meet him is heartbreaking.\u0027Ms David says she is being crippled financially because she cannot afford child care to go back to work.Her local vicar, Reverend Prebendary Dr Brian Leathard, Rector of Chelsea, felt compelled to write to the Bishop of Lincoln, who runs the diocese.In the letter, Rev Leathard says he wishes to \u0027institute a formal complaint in respect of a pastorally unacceptable situation, which has clear safeguarding implications and, if proven, has potential to place Lincoln\u0027s reputational position in jeopardy\u0027.He adds: \u0027James, early in the pregnancy accompanied Georgie to a hospital appointment and during the appointment left his pregnant partner in the hospital, as I understand, never seeing her again.\u0027James has never visited his son, though I understand he does not dispute parentage.\u0027Georgie reports that her sole wish is for her son with James to be acknowledged by the family, to rejoice in a precious new human life.\u0027I think it is very likely that Georgie will seek the legal and financial support to which she is entitled from James Reeve and I fear for the repute of one of Lincolns\u0027 Lay Canons should this matter burst into the public realm.\u0027The Tory MP for Chelsea and Fulham, Greg Hands, said he will raising Ms David\u0027s case with Justin Tomlinson, Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Family Support, Housing and Maintenance.The CMS calculates payment costs from declared annual income but does not currently take into consideration a person\u0027s assets.Mr Reeve claims to not have a current salary and says he is only given a modest income from his family.However the Reeves own Leadenham House, a sprawling estate built in 1790, worth at least £5m which boasts stunning views over the surrounding Lincolnshire countryside that has been in their family for generations.They also own the three floor Grade II-listed High House in Leadenham, worth £700,000 and the Leadenham Polo Club and Manor House, which can be hired out as a wedding venue or for stag and hen parties.The club also runs £200-a-head \u0027Polo Weekends\u0027 and sells merchandise, such as polo shirts, hoodies and jackets, for between £45 and £100.

Mr Reeve continues to cooperate with the CMS.\u0027Ms David must have been fully aware of the assessments made and would have had money paid into her account during the first assessment.\u0027A spokesman for the Bishop of Lincoln confirmed he was asked to intervene personally.He said: \u0027The matter was referred to the Bishop of Lincoln who asked for an investigation. The conclusion was that this is a private matter for the two parents of the child.\u0027The DWP said of the case that they are \u0027committed to doing all we can to recover child maintenance payments that are owed.\u0027A spokesman said: \u0027Legislation has recently passed through Parliament that will help tackle issues around self-employment and enable us to take into account a person\u0027s assets – including property, savings and investments – as well as their self-declared income.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Philippines flight attendant tells breastfed passengers baby","story":"    Patrisha Organo, 24, from Manila, breastfed a stranger\u0027s crying infant after the baby\u0027s mom discovered she did not pack enough formula for the flight           Organo, who has a nine-month-old daughter named Jade, said she felt like she had no choice but to help another mom in need after the infant started wailing just a few minutes into the flight\u0027As an employee of Philippines Airlines, we are encouraged by our company to make sure passengers know that Filipino people have caring hearts. \u0027So it\u0027s our primary job not just to see to the general needs of our passengers, but to also be caring, compassionate and aware of all their needs.\u0027The mother was traveling alone and out of necessity she had to arrive at the airport at 9pm, even though the flight was not due to depart until 5am the following morning. \u0027She misjudged the amount of formula she would need and only realized she was in trouble when the baby began to wail.\u0027The flight took place on November 6, but Organo did not disclose where it originated nor its destination to protect the mother and baby\u0027s identity.Organo, who has been a flight attendant for the past four years, says she did her best to help comfort the mother and child, but nothing seemed to work.

The children are frequently injected and put to sleep, apparently the school nurse is the one who does the injections.PICTURED: Injuries of actress who claims Michael Avenatti...BREAKING NEWS: Trump REFUSES to sanction Saudi crown prince...Share this articleMcNeill claimed up to 18 teachers from the primary school were also involved in abusing children.She said members of the cult - from all walks of society - carried out satanic rituals in secret rooms at a Hampstead church.Referring to McNeill’s claims, the prosecutor said: ‘There is someone who works in Costa Coffee, a solicitor, someone who works in Waitrose, people who work in Hampstead police station, then we have got people from the Royal Free Hospital, social services and finishing up with people from the Brownies.’Ms Moore told the court: ‘In September 2014 the Metropolitan Police received reports of wide spread child abuse. Satanic child rape and murder in churches in Hampstead in north London.‘These allegations surround two small children, commonly referred to as P and Q.’She said police initially took the complaints seriously and interviewed the children.          Blackfriars Crown Court heard McNeill denies four counts of harassment and 17 counts of breaching a restraining orderThe matter eventually reached the High Court and Mrs Justice Pauffley ruled that the accusations relating to the cult were ‘baseless.’But recordings of the children’s police interviews surfaced online and McNeill began her campaign to uncover the alleged cult, said Ms Moore.‘All of this is completely fake and as a result of Ms McNeill’s activities, these woman have had to change their lives drastically - they have had to take their children out of school, they have had to protect their children.’Jurors heard one parent was forced to install a panic alarm and another was approached by a paedophile online looking to sleep with her child, ‘making her physically sick.’Describing how McNeill directed the campaign, Ms Moore added: ‘She said online that members of the public should paint dolls of the Barbie variety with red nail polish and send them to business owners in the Hampstead area.‘She contributed to the GoFundMe account of Rupert Quaintance. He is an American gentleman who was able to read online about the abuse and he decided to come over to the UK and cause problems. She even offered him a bed when he got here.’Quaintance was arrested after posting a picture of himself outside the school claiming he had a knife, the court heard.He was subsequently charged and convicted of harassment.McNeill was involved in a protest at the church in March 2015 and subsequently arrested.She was later cleared of plotting to intimidate a vicar and his parishioners after a trial at Blackfriars Crown Court, but handed a retraining order to stop her harassing the parents involved.‘Having been told not to publish these false allegations, particularly about the school and the church, and having been before the courts on a few occasions she changes method,’ said Ms Moore.‘She goes to what I will call the analogue method.‘She attends the General Synod who were having a meeting to deal with the Church of England’s approach to child abuse.‘She attends the meeting and gives out leaflets. Ms McNiell was again arrested for doing that.‘She is an online troll of the worst kind, making the lives of innocent families a misery.’McNeill from Camden, denies four counts of harassment and 17 counts of breaching a restraining order.The trial continues. "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/caed4b8d84c533d620cf3e03cbc5db9aa10779f9/0_0_3929_5246/master/3929.jpg?width=720\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=311e2cb1955648428017a6b4d2a5ea55 1440w","title":"recycling the old masters in pictures suzanne jongmans","story":"Dutch artist Suzanne Jongmans creates photographs that echo the old masters, but with a modern twist: she crafts intricate costumes using recycled plastics, old blankets and used packaging.

Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week:First up: ancient history. Thucydides’ History of the Peloponnesian War continues to delight paulburns:First read it at age 17. I’ve lost count of the number of times I’ve reread it after that. Its one of my favourite books. Just to mention a few magnificent highlights of great historical writing - The sea battle between the Corcyreans and Corinthians, 433 the plague in Athens, 430 the fighting at Megara, 424 the character sketch of the Spartan commander, Brasidias the rise and fall of Cleon the destruction of the Athenian Expedition in Sicily, 413 the oligarchic Coup and its overthrow in Athens.I can’t do a post on Thucydides and not mention his use of speeches. He gives recollections of speeches he has heard himself or pieces together a speech from accounts of those who were there at the time. Apart from the Melian dialogue, where he more or less expounds on his philosophy of history, he begins a tradition in classical historiography which is eventually much abused by speeches just being made up by some later writers. If you haven’t yet read Thucydides, put aside some time to do so. Its a reading experience you won’t forget.Another “non-fiction delight”, Babel (Around the World In 20 Languages) by Gaston Dorren, has occupied storm46:What an enjoyable read for a Languages nerd! The story of 20 Lingua Francas, sometimes their particular linguistic quirks (to other language speakers - not to the native speakers concerned of course), their social conventions, their rise to power and the reasons why they may have become a lingua franca, and just oodles of fascinating facts. The chapters, depending on the language under discussion, cover linguistics, history, politics, and the writing style is effortlessly readable and very funny.I particularly appreciated this quote from the sardonic chapter on Français, written in 1671: “Of all languages, French has the most natural and sleekest pronunciation. The Chinese and well-nigh all Asian peoples sing the Germans grumble the Spaniards holler the Italians sigh the English whistle. Only the French can properly be said to speak.”BerlinBirdie wants to “rave” about The Buddha in the Attic by Julie Otsuka:About Japanese brides travelling to the US in the 1920s to marry Japanese emigrants there, who’d mostly lied about their financial and social status, and sent photos of younger, better-looking men to tempt their brides. Rather like a dating app in fact. The book details the women’s experiences in a precise, moving way, not by following inidual stories but by depicting their varied but collective experiences - written in a first-person plural voice (“We were... Some of us found...”) and taking their lives stage by stage - the voyage, the arrival, the first night, babies, children, etc etc. A lot of their experience was hard as you might expect, yet the tone is never accusing or miserable. It’s clear, calm, delicate - almost poetic in fact. Brilliant.Completely brilliant, every last story. Every last word. There were stories from all across the spectrum, pre-war Colorado, antebellum slavery, Mexico in the days of Pancho Villa, hardscrabble Texas... They all seemed to rotate a common center of gravity, the struggle against unrealized potential for pre-Suffragge women. It still seems relevant in an age when women’s health choices are often dictated to them by the ovary-free.Me Talk Pretty One Day by David Sedaris has been the “right book at the right time” for LiteraryWanderings:This was my first foray into the world of David Sedaris and it won’t be my last. I found that the essays became stronger after the first third, but how much this was the writing or me becoming attuned to Sedaris I’m not sure. Laugh out loud funny in parts, this has been a perfect reading companion of late.Finally, EstelleMoon took a “nosee into nostalgia” and read Night Watch by Terry Pratchett:I really liked it! It’s one of the City Watch series within Discworld which focusses on Sam Vimes and the police force of Ankh-Morpork. It made me laugh out loud more than once, and is at the same time a pretty pointed and successful satire on revolutionary idealism.It’s a great book. We need Vimes now more than ever…If you’re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag #Books, and we’ll include a selection in this blog.

By  Sarah MasonIn May 2016, after months of failing to find a traditional job, I began driving for the ride-hailing company Lyft. I was enticed by an online advertisement that promised new drivers in the Los Angeles area a $500 “sign-up bonus” after completing their first 75 rides. The calculation was simple: I had a car and I needed the money. So, I clicked the link, filled out the application, and, when prompted, drove to the nearest Pep Boys for a vehicle inspection. I received my flamingo-pink Lyft emblems almost immediately and, within a few days, I was on the road.Initially, I told myself that this sort of gig work was preferable to the nine-to-five grind. It would be temporary, I thought. Plus, I needed to enrol in a statistics class and finish my graduate school applications – tasks that felt impossible while working in a full-time desk job with an hour-long commute. But within months of taking on this readily available, yet strangely precarious form of work, I was weirdly drawn in.Lyft, which launched in 2012 as Zimride before changing its name a year later, is a car service similar to Uber, which operates in about 300 US cities and expanded to Canada (though so far just in one province, Ontario) last year. Every week, it sends its drivers a personalised “Weekly Feedback Summary”. This includes passenger comments from the previous week’s rides and a freshly calculated driver rating. It also contains a bar graph showing how a driver’s current rating “stacks up” against previous weeks, and tells them whether they have been “flagged” for cleanliness, friendliness, navigation or safety.At first, I looked forward to my summaries for the most part, they were a welcome boost to my self-esteem. My rating consistently fluctuated between 4.89 stars and 4.96 stars, and the comments said things like: “Good driver, positive attitude” and “Thanks for getting me to the airport on time!!” There was the occasional critique, such as “She weird”, or just “Attitude”, but overall, the comments served as a kind of positive reinforcement mechanism. I felt good knowing that I was helping people and that people liked me.But one week, after completing what felt like a million rides, I opened my feedback summary to discover that my rating had plummeted from a 4.91 (“Awesome”) to a 4.79 (“OK”), without comment. Stunned, I combed through my ride history trying to recall any unusual interactions or disgruntled passengers. Nothing. What happened? What did I do? I felt sick to my stomach.Because driver ratings are calculated using your last 100 passenger reviews, one logical solution is to crowd out the old, bad ratings with new, presumably better ratings as fast as humanly possible. And that is exactly what I did.For the next several weeks, I deliberately avoided opening my feedback summaries. I stocked my vehicle with water bottles, breakfast bars and miscellaneous mini candies to inspire riders to smash that fifth star. I developed a borderline-obsessive vacuuming habit and upped my car-wash game from twice a week to every other day. I experimented with different air-fresheners and radio stations. I drove and I drove and I drove.The language of choice, freedom, and autonomy saturate discussions of ride hailing. “On-demand companies are pointing the way to a more promising future, where people have more freedom to choose when and where they work,” Travis Kalanick, the founder and former CEO of Uber, wrote in October 2015. “Put simply,” he continued, “the future of work is about independence and flexibility.”In a certain sense, Kalanick is right. Unlike employees in a spatially fixed worksite (the factory, the office, the distribution centre), rideshare drivers are technically free to choose when they work, where they work and for how long. They are liberated from the constraining rhythms of conventional employment or shift work. But that apparent freedom poses a unique challenge to the platforms’ need to provide reliable, “on demand” service to their riders – and so a driver’s freedom has to be aggressively, if subtly, managed. One of the main ways these companies have sought to do this is through the use of gamification.Simply defined, gamification is the use of game elements – point-scoring, levels, competition with others, measurable evidence of accomplishment, ratings and rules of play – in non-game contexts. Games deliver an instantaneous, visceral experience of success and reward, and they are increasingly used in the workplace to promote emotional engagement with the work process, to increase workers’ psychological investment in completing otherwise uninspiring tasks, and to influence, or “nudge”, workers’ behaviour. This is what my weekly feedback summary, my starred ratings and other gamified features of the Lyft app did.But colour-coding checkout screens is a pretty rudimental kind of gamification. In the world of ride-hailing work, where almost the entirety of one’s activity is prompted and guided by screen – and where everything can be measured, logged and analysed – there are few limitations on what can be gamified.In 1974, Michael Burawoy, a doctoral student in sociology at the University of Chicago and a self-described Marxist, began working as a miscellaneous machine operator in the engine ision of Allied Corporation, a large manufacturer of agricultural equipment. He was attempting to answer the following question: why do workers work as hard as they do?In Marx’s time, the answer to this question was simple: coercion. Workers had no protections and could be fired at will for failing to fulfil their quotas. One’s ability to obtain a subsistence wage was directly tied to the amount of effort one applied to the work process. However, in the early 20th century, with the emergence of labour protections, the elimination of the piece-rate pay system, the rise of strong industrial unions and a more robust social safety net, the coercive power of employers waned.Yet workers continued to work hard, Burawoy observed. They co-operated with speed-ups and exceeded production targets. They took on extra tasks and sought out productive ways to use their downtime. They worked overtime and off the clock. They kissed ass. After 10 months at Allied, Burawoy concluded that workers were willingly and even enthusiastically consenting to their own exploitation. What could explain this? One answer, Burawoy suggested, was “the game”.For Burawoy, the game described the way in which workers manipulated the production process in order to reap various material and immaterial rewards. When workers were successful at this manipulation, they were said to be “making out”. Like the levels of a video game, operators needed to overcome a series of consecutive challenges in order to make out and beat the game.At the beginning of every shift, operators encountered their first challenge: securing the most lucrative assignment from the “scheduling man”, the person responsible for doling out workers’ daily tasks. Their next challenge was a trip to “the crib” to find the blueprint and tooling needed to perform the operation. If the crib attendant was slow to dispense the necessary blueprints, tools and fixtures, operators could lose a considerable amount of time that would otherwise go towards making or beating their quota. (Burawoy won the cooperation of the crib attendant by gifting him a Christmas ham.) After facing off against the truckers, who were responsible for bringing stock to the machine, and the inspectors, who were responsible for enforcing the specifications of the blueprint, the operator was finally left alone with his machine to battle it out against the clock.According to Burawoy, production at Allied was deliberately organised by management to encourage workers to play the game. When work took the form of a game, Burawoy observed, something interesting happened: workers’ primary source of conflict was no longer with the boss. Instead, tensions were dispersed between workers (the scheduling man, the truckers, the inspectors), between operators and their machines, and between operators and their own physical limitations (their stamina, precision of movement, focus).The battle to beat the quota also transformed a monotonous, soul-crushing job into an exciting outlet for workers to exercise their creativity, speed and skill. Workers attached notions of status and prestige to their output, and the game presented them with a series of choices throughout the day, affording them a sense of relative autonomy and control. It tapped into a worker’s desire for self-determination and self-expression. Then, it directed that desire towards the production of profit for their employer.Every Sunday morning, I receive an algorithmically generated “challenge” from Lyft that goes something like this: “Complete 34 rides between the hours of 5am on Monday and 5am on Sunday to receive a $63 bonus.” I scroll down, concerned about the declining value of my bonuses, which once hovered around $100-$220 per week, but have now dropped to less than half that.“Click here to accept this challenge.” I tap the screen to accept. Now, whenever I log into driver mode, a stat meter will appear showing my progress: only 21 more rides before I hit my first bonus. Lyft does not disclose how its weekly ride challenges are generated, but the value seems to vary according to anticipated demand and driver behaviour. The higher the anticipated demand, the higher the value of my bonus. The more I hit my bonus targets or ride quotas, the higher subsequent targets will be. Sometimes, if it has been a while since I have logged on, I will be offered an uncharacteristically lucrative bonus, north of $100, though it has been happening less and less of late.Behavioural scientists and video game designers are well aware that tasks are likely to be completed faster and with greater enthusiasm if one can visualise them as part of a progression towards a larger, pre-established goal. The Lyft stat meter is always present, always showing you what your acceptance rating is, how many rides you have completed, how far you have to go to reach your goal.Retention is a problem in large part because the economics of driving are so bad. Researchers have struggled to establish exactly how much money drivers make, but with the release of two recent reports, one from the Economic Policy Institute and one from MIT, a consensus on driver pay seems to be emerging: drivers make, on average, between $9.21 (£7.17) and $10.87 (£8.46) per hour. What these findings confirm is what many of us in the game already know: in most major US cities, drivers are pulling in wages that fall below local minimum-wage requirements. According to an internal slide deck obtained by the New York Times, Uber actually identifies McDonald’s as its biggest competition in attracting new drivers. When I began driving for Lyft, I made the same calculation most drivers make: it is better to make $9 per hour than to make nothing.Before Lyft rolled out weekly ride challenges, there was the “Power Driver Bonus”, a weekly challenge that required drivers to complete a set number of regular rides. I sometimes worked more than 50 hours per week trying to secure my PDB, which often meant driving in unsafe conditions, at irregular hours and accepting nearly every ride request, including those that felt potentially dangerous (I am thinking specifically of an extremely drunk and visibly agitated late-night passenger).Of course, this was largely motivated by a real need for a boost in my weekly earnings. But, in addition to a hope that I would somehow transcend Lyft’s crappy economics, the intensity with which I pursued my PDBs was also the result of what Burawoy observed four decades ago: a bizarre desire to beat the game.Drivers’ per-mile earnings are supplemented by a number of rewards, both material and immaterial. Uber drivers can earn “Achievement Badges” for completing a certain number of five-star rides and “Excellent Service Badges” for leaving customers satisfied. Lyft’s “Accelerate Rewards” programme encourages drivers to level up by completing a certain number of rides per month in order to unlock special rewards like fuel discounts from Shell (gold level) and free roadside assistance (platinum level).In addition to offering meaningless badges and meagre savings at the pump, ride-hailing companies have also adopted some of the same design elements used by gambling firms to promote addictive behaviour among slot-machine users. One of things the anthropologist and NYU media studies professor Natasha Dow Schüll found during a decade-long study of machine gamblers in Las Vegas is that casinos use networked slot machines that allow them to surveil, track and analyse the behaviour of inidual gamblers in real time – just as ride-hailing apps do. This means that casinos can “triangulate any given gambler’s player data with her demographic data, piecing together a profile that can be used to customise game offerings and marketing appeals specifically for her”. Like these customised game offerings, Lyft tells me that my weekly ride challenge has been “personalised just for you!”Former Google “design ethicist” Tristan Harris has also described how the “pull-to-refresh” mechanism used in most social media feeds mimics the clever architecture of a slot machine: users never know when they are going to experience gratification – a dozen new likes or retweets – but they know that gratification will eventually come. This unpredictability is addictive: behavioural psychologists have long understood that gambling uses variable reinforcement schedules – unpredictable intervals of uncertainty, anticipation and feedback – to condition players into playing just one more round.We are only beginning to uncover the extent to which these reinforcement schedules are built into ride-hailing apps. But one example is primetime or surge pricing. The phrase “chasing the pink” is used in online forums by Lyft drivers to refer to the tendency to drive towards “primetime” areas, denoted by pink-tinted heat maps in the app, which signify increased fares at precise locations. This is irrational because the likelihood of catching a good primetime fare is slim, and primetime is extremely unpredictable. The pink appears and disappears, moving from one location to the next, sometimes in a matter of minutes. Lyft and Uber have to dole out just enough of these higher-paid periods to keep people driving to the areas where they predict drivers will be needed. And occasionally – cherry, cherry, cherry – it works: after the Rose Bowl parade last year, I made in 40 minutes more than half of what I usually make in a whole day of non-stop shuttling.So, who sets the rules for all these games? It is 12.30am on a Friday night and the “Lyft drivers lounge”, a closed Facebook group for active drivers, is ided. The debate began, as many do, with an assertion about the algorithm. “The algorithm” refers to the opaque and often unpredictable system of automated, “data-driven” management employed by ride-hailing companies to dispatch drivers, match riders into Pools (Uber) or Lines (Lyft), and generate “surge” or “primetime” fares, also known as “dynamic pricing”.The algorithm is at the heart of the ride-hailing game, and of the coercion that the game conceals. In their foundational text Algorithmic Labor and Information Asymmetries: A Case Study of Uber’s Drivers, Alex Rosenblat and Luke Stark write: “Uber’s self-proclaimed role as a connective intermediary belies the important employment structures and hierarchies that emerge through its software and interface design.” “Algorithmic management” is the term Rosenblat and Stark use to describe the mechanisms through which Uber and Lyft drivers are directed. To be clear, there is no singular algorithm. Rather, there are a number of algorithms operating and interacting with one another at any given moment. Taken together, they produce a seamless system of automatic decision-making that requires very little human intervention.For many on-demand platforms, algorithmic management has completely replaced the decision-making roles previously occupied by shift supervisors, foremen and middle- to upper- level management. Uber actually refers to its algorithms as “decision engines”. These “decision engines” track, log and crunch millions of metrics every day, from ride frequency to the harshness with which inidual drivers brake. It then uses these analytics to deliver gamified prompts perfectly matched to drivers’ data profiles.Because the logic of the algorithm is largely unknown and constantly changing, drivers are left to speculate about what it is doing and why. Such speculation is a regular topic of conversation in online forums, where drivers post screengrabs of nonsensical ride requests and compare increasingly lacklustre, algorithmically generated bonus opportunities. It is not uncommon for drivers to accuse ride-hailing companies of programming their algorithms to favour the interests of the corporation. To resolve this alleged favouritism, drivers routinely hypothesise and experiment with ways to manipulate or “game” the system back.When the bars let out after last orders at 2am, demand spikes. Drivers have a greater likelihood of scoring “surge” or “primetime” fares. There are no guarantees, but it is why we are all out there. To increase the prospect of surge pricing, drivers in online forums regularly propose deliberate, coordinated, mass “log-offs” with the expectation that a sudden drop in available drivers will “trick” the algorithm into generating higher surges. I have never seen one work, but the authors of a recently published paper say that mass log-offs are occasionally successful.Viewed from another angle, though, mass log-offs can be understood as good, old-fashioned work stoppages. The temporary and purposeful cessation of work as a form of protest is the core of strike action, and remains the sharpest weapon workers have to fight exploitation. But the ability to log-off en masse has not assumed a particularly emancipatory function. Burawoy’s insights might tell us why.Gaming the game, Burawoy observed, allowed workers to assert some limited control over the labour process, and to “make out” as a result. In turn, that win had the effect of reproducing the players’ commitment to playing, and their consent to the rules of the game. When players were unsuccessful, their dissatisfaction was directed at the game’s obstacles, not at the capitalist class, which sets the rules. The inbuilt antagonism between the player and the game replaces, in the mind of the worker, the deeper antagonism between boss and worker. Learning how to operate cleverly within the game’s parameters becomes the only imaginable option. And now there is another layer interposed between labour and capital: the algorithm.After weeks of driving like a maniac in order to restore my higher-than-average driver rating, I managed to raise it back up to a 4.93. Although it felt great, it is almost shameful and astonishing to admit that one’s rating, so long as it stays above 4.6, has no actual bearing on anything other than your sense of self-worth. You do not receive a weekly bonus for being a highly rated driver. Your rate of pay does not increase for being a highly rated driver. In fact, I was losing money trying to flatter customers with candy and keep my car scrupulously clean. And yet, I wanted to be a highly rated driver.And this is the thing that is so brilliant and awful about the gamification of Lyft and Uber: it preys on our desire to be of service, to be liked, to be good. On weeks that I am rated highly, I am more motivated to drive. On weeks that I am rated poorly, I am more motivated to drive. It works on me, even though I know better. To date, I have completed more than 2,200 rides.A longer version of this article first appeared in Logic, a new magazine devoted to deepening the discourse around technology• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0945be1c1eceb22a1aa1edbc20ee36d02dc89cce/0_209_5403_3243/master/5403.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=79b07a9e57e73a2a2bc6019a35d8da92","title":"wall street senses change as the bear reveals its faangs","story":"Bumper summer for Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google ends with a spillAugust’s trillion-dollar headline was provided by Apple when it became the first company to achieve such a lofty stock market valuation. Amazon got there in September. October was a fallow month for trillion-dollar statistics but here comes November’s offering. The big five “Faang” companies – the other three initials provided by Facebook, Netflix and Google – have collectively shed $1tn in capitalisation from their high points this year. The sector has turned at spectacular speed.It’s just a demonstration of the thrills and spills of investing in technology, it could be said. There’s something in that idea, of course, since nobody owns these stocks for a dull life. Investors are betting on fabulous rates of earnings growth, projected many years into the future. It only takes a modest shift in the financial weather for valuation to be whacked.Yet tech stocks do not inhabit an entirely different investment universe. There are at least two reasons why the current tech rout may be signalling broader market worries.That is partly because of the second factor – the US-China trade war. “If you want a short-term solution, there is no solution,” said Jack Ma, the Alibaba billionaire in September, predicting 20 years of trade hostility. Investors didn’t want to believe it, but they’ve having to reassess.Hopes of a truce at this month’s G20 are low and falling after US vice-president Mike Pence said at an Asia Pacific conference this week that the US “will not change course until China changes its ways”. Meanwhile, China has launched a high-profile price-fixing investigation into three big computer chip makers, including one US firm. That affair may be unrelated, but it clearly doesn’t make peace over intellectual property more likely. On current form, you’d bet that the next round of US tariff hikes – scheduled for January – will happen.“All good things eventually come to an end,” said Goldman Sachs’ market analysts on Tuesday, striking a bearish tone in their predictions for 2019. “Cash will represent a competitive asset class to stocks for the first time in many years,” the Wall Street bank said. That is eye-catching, as end-of-year forecasts are supposed to be, but it reflects the suddenly downbeat mood. If Apple can no longer shift more iPhones at higher prices, which is the micro worry about the tech sector, something big may have changed.The reaction of senior Renault executives to the arrest of Carlos Ghosn was fascinating. “On your behalf, we would like to state here our full support for our chairman and CEO,” wrote chief operating officer Thierry Bolloré to staff, before stating that “the governance bodies are playing their full role in defending Groupe Renault’s corporate interest”.It’s not hard to read between the lines. On the Renault side, they clearly don’t trust the process by which Ghosn has been accused of under-reporting his income at Nissan and committing “numerous” misdeeds. And they clearly suspect this affair will turn into a battle for control of a three-way corporate alliance that also contains Mitsubishi.One can understand Renault management’s suspicions. Nissan chief executive Hiroto Saikawa didn’t wait to hear if Ghosn denies the fraud charges. Nor did he attempt to explain if Nissan, or its auditors, could have been complicit in any alleged wrong-doing. He just seemed anxious to condemn the “negative” aspects of Ghosn’s regime and ignore the obvious questions about lax governance at Nissan itself."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fdeec04310a3177892901e441a494859868356de/45_0_3770_2263/master/3770.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fb47c6c2657772755d11bee2c76189e8","title":"artefacts reveal vikings were more urban pioneers than violent raiders ribe","story":"Excavations in Ribe, Denmark show that Viking culture was based on sophisticated production and trade. Is their brutal reputation unfair?The same excavation also found the remains of wooden homes moulds for fashioning ornaments from gold, silver and brass intricate combs made from reindeer antlers (the Viking equivalent of ivory) and amber jewellery dating to the early 700s.Even more extraordinary, however, was the discovery that these artefacts were not for home consumption by farmers, let alone itinerant raiders. Instead, the Vikings who made them lived in a settled, urban community of craftsmen, seafarers, tradesmen and, it seems, musicians. “Ribe confounds history,” says Richard Hodges, a British archaeologist and the president of the American University of Rome. “What we have here defies the opinion that all the Vikings did was to raid and to rape.”The discoveries at Ribe suggest mass production, high levels of specialisation and a ision of labour – all characteristics of a settled urban society rather than a nomadic one based on pillaging.“We can see in Ribe that Viking society was based on sophisticated production and trade,” Hodges says. “It is a paradox: they made these beautiful things, they had gorgeous cloth, wonderful artefacts, but at the same time they are known to history for their brutality.”European history has been written from the perspective of Christian chroniclers who wanted to tell us that Vikings were barbarians, Hodges notes.The evidence suggests that, over the decades before launching their infamous raids on Britain with the attack on Lindisfarne in AD793, the Vikings created one of the first post-Roman Scandinavian urban bases for world trade and exploration. The culture was based on craftsmanship and trade and helped create the basis for sweeping changes in economic life over the ensuing millennium.Speeding through the autumn countryside on one of his frequent journeys to Ribe, Søren Sindbæk, an archaeologist from Aarhus University, keeps up a constant stream of thoughts about the site’s broader historical significance. “A transformation took place in northern Europe between the end of the Roman period – when this was the dark side of the continent – and the Middle Ages, when it became a bustling region with great cities, cathedrals and commercial shipping,” says Sindbæk.“That change, leading eventually to the European age of exploration and world trade hegemony, begins here on the North Sea coast, where urban Vikings were a catalyst.”Another find is a tiny silver coin the size of a fingernail, preserved so well it could have been minted yesterday. Coinage is evidence of a stable trading community, says Morten Søvsø, chief archaeologist.“Looking at Ribe we can see there was a monopoly coin system already from the eighth century,” Søvsø says. “It’s all about trade and tax, and about keeping the peace – so people could rely on a return from their trade.”Ribe has long been known as an early trading settlement. The question posed by the latest discoveries is about the relationship between these urban Vikings and the period of raids that followed the attack on Lindisfarne – Britain’s 911 moment, as Sindbæk puts it.“The fact we can see this trading system was already in place before the Viking raids started in the British Isles makes it likely that the two things have something in common,” he says, adjusting the broad-brimmed Indiana Jones hat he keeps in the boot of his car for rainy days.“It could be that the raids were actually the tip of an iceberg of trade – there is evidence of a trading relationship with Scandinavia, but we haven’t heard about the peaceful side.”The site in Ribe is unique because it enables precise dating of the finds, thanks to deposits that have lain undisturbed in the sandy, worm-free soil. Lasers have been scanning the site as each layer of history is peeled away, creating a 3D model of the eighth century so samples can be precisely located in the archaeological record.This method has revealed that the bead-makers of Viking Ribe were early victims of globalisation. Mass-produced beads from towns such as Raqqa in present-day Syria started arriving in bulk around AD780, undercutting the local trade.The Danish archaeologists have applied another technique for squeezing every last drop of knowledge out of the site at Ribe. Blocks of soil no larger than a cigarette packet are impregnated with resin so they can be sliced into thin sections, which can then be analysed under a microscope.The dig, funded by the Carlsberg Foundation and carried out by Aarhus University with the Museum of Southwest Jutland, began in 2017 and is now complete the 100 sq metre site has returned to public use. Many discoveries lie ahead, Sindbæk says, as he and his colleagues study the data and materials they have assembled.In a corrugated hut outside the warehouse where all the finds are kept, Sara Hee and Jane Sif Hansen are engaged in the less high-tech business of sifting through bags of mud. Hee describes how the discoveries are upending prior theories that the Vikings were marauders rather than traders.A few days earlier, she says, she plucked a perfect tiny amulet from the muddy soup, marked with a Christian cross – a “huge adrenaline rush” – suggesting Christian currents were present here long before King Harald Bluetooth’s declaration on the Jelling runestone circa AD965 that he had brought the religion to the Danes.“Some written sources have presented the Vikings as barbarians in order to make themselves look good,” Hee says. “So we cannot completely trust people writing at the time: are they describing what they saw or imposing their own understanding on it?”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/caf0c0522cc03cc32efa79c92302e14c2d88db25/0_0_1080_1440/master/1080.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=f53099e3a561152084b386c907491a01 1400w","title":"britain boardroooms brexit westminster europe","story":"On the one hand, you have the self-inflating chaos at Westminster, the fever dreams of Jacob Rees-Mogg’s gang and the rehearsed rage of the Democratic Unionists. And on the other, you have the truth nailed by Philip K Dick. “Reality,” he wrote, “is that which, when you stop believing it, doesn’t go away.” So let’s remind ourselves of some reality.While Tory MPs jostled over a replacement for Theresa May the head of the Confederation of British Industry, Carolyn Fairbairn, warned that millions of pounds were “flooding out” of business investment and into preparing for Britain crashing out of Europe with no deal. Food warehouses said they were running out of space. And auto-parts manufacturer Schaeffler announced that it would shut factories in Plymouth and Llanelli, leaving more than 600 workers facing the dole.“The banks and insurers are moving, the big pharmaceutical firms are investing abroad,” says Paul Drechsler, who was CBI president until June and now chairs London First. “These trains are leaving the station, and when they leave, they won’t come back.” The country he describes is already shrinking, its job opportunities dwindling, its reputation abroad in eclipse.This is the real national emergency. An entire rotten political-corporate regime is crumbling away – and its replacement threatens to be even worse. It will be worse, specifically, for those parts of the country, like Llanelli and Plymouth, that voted leave as the ultimate kick against the pricks of a hollow economy and a deaf government.The succinct definition of our current model comes from the head of the Bank of England. The UK relies, said Mark Carney in 2016, on the “kindness of strangers”. The willingness of overseas investors to keep ploughing in their cash keeps us in the style to which we’ve grown accustomed. Out of all the 28 members of the European Union, the UK is second only to Ireland in its dependence on investment from abroad. Margaret Thatcher’s eagerness to sell off whatever she could get her hands on and her mandarins’ carelessness over ownership has turned us into one of the biggest foreign-capital junkies in the developed world.Those investors don’t come here out of charity. Our government competes with others around the world to lure in cash from overseas. But look what inducements we offer. Just weeks before the Brexit referendum, David Cameron’s government published its Invest in the UK brochure, promising “the most competitive” labour costs in western Europe, and “the least strict regulation in the EU.”. Why buy euros when you can have Poundland?No other country does this. Analysis by Kevin Farnsworth at York University shows that, while all states assure investors they’re competitive locations, Sweden boasts of its “anti-corruption” and “good industrial relations”, while Germany highlights its “efficiency” and “training”. The UK, he writes, “uniquely competes for international capital by offering a package of a low-tax, low-cost, low regulatory business environment”.Here, whether Conservative or Labour, successive governments have marketed us as the open-all-hours, bargain-basement landing strip off mainland Europe. Until, that is, Britons vote in a referendum to kick away two of the three legs of the post-Thatcherite economic model, namely openness and closeness to the continent. What’s left then is our cheapness – in taxes, in wages and in regulation.This is Britain in 2018, paying the price for decades of underinvestment and cutprice competition. We have a highly skilled workforce, with almost half of Britain’s young people holding a university degree. And yet in 2014, Charlie Mayfield, former boss of John Lewis and then head of the UK Commission on Employment and Skills, pointed out that over one in five British jobs required only primary-school education. We have a world-class car-manufacturing industry, yet over half of the components in the cars that roll off the lines in Sunderland or Ellesmere Port come from abroad.You can expect a lot more of this over coming months and years: panicky politicians paying your tax money to grumpy-looking corporate executives. You can expect other countries to try to poach our businesses, just as after the 2016 vote Paris began advertising itself as the ideal post-Brexit corporate headquarters. Their posters read: “Tired of fog? Try the frogs”You can also expect this government to press even harder the case that Britain is the low-tax, low-wage capital of the rich world. But ministers will get a disappointing response from businesses, believes EY’s chief economist in the UK, Mark Gregory. He thinks multinationals will shift away from using Britain as a stepping stone into Europe and the rest of the world – which is logical, given that any new trading arrangements will take years to settle and will almost certainly not be as smooth as the regime Britain currently has. Instead of building factories to make things to sell to the world, big businesses will instead put their money into storage and showrooms to sell things to Britons. The UK will become, Gregory says, “a warehouse economy: low skills, low productivity and low growth”.That projection was already a reality for lots of people I met who plumped for Brexit in 2016. They were on minimum wage and had minimum rights and minimum prospects. If Brexit is to be radically changed now, it is those voters – the disenfranchised Labourites, the sod-them-all brigade – whose support is needed. A second referendum, in which well-meaning metropolitans offer those in the Rhondda the status quo, probably deserves to fail. Instead, any remain option will have to come with a worked-out argument about rebalancing power in this country. And that means reshaping the relationship between capital and the rest of us."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4d93e5e017ef2f01e36818de219a6e9e5cbd1fe3/1_0_3063_1838/master/3063.jpg?width=465\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=65230a1b5cf20147d3b37b584372e8b0 930w","title":"christian parent legal action heavers farm school pride parade","story":"Izoduwa Adhedo accuses south London primary of trying to ‘indoctrinate’ her son against her beliefsA London primary school is facing the prospect of legal action after a Christian parent formally complained about a “Proud to be Me” event she claims promoted LGBT lifestyles.Heavers Farm school in South Norwood has strongly denied that it organised a “gay pride parade” earlier this year, but Izoduwa Adhedo claims her son was forced to take part “in an event that goes against our Christian beliefs”.Adhedo, whose son has since been withdrawn from the school, was due to meet school governors on Tuesday evening to press a formal complaintShe is being supported by Christian Concern, a conservative evangelical organisation whose legal arm takes up cases of perceived religious discrimination. A spokesperson said the Adhedo family was looking at potential legal action if the complaint was not resolved.The complaint centres on an event organised by the school in June, in which pupils were encouraged to march with banners highlighting what made them proud to be themselves.In a message to parents, the school said: “At this parade each child will be celebrating what makes them proud of themselves and their family. We encourage you to talk to your children about what they will be celebrating.”Susan Papas, the headteacher, told the : “Equality is a thread that goes through our curriculum. We’ve done projects on black history month, disability and women’s history.“At the end of the year we decided to do something on anti-homophobia as part of Pride month, taking the idea that people and families can be different but everyone can be proud. There were some objections but they were outweighed by support.”She declined to comment on Adhedo’s complaint, saying she could not discuss inidual pupils or their families.In a statement, Adhedo said: “After I complained about my young child being forced to take place in an event that goes against our Christian beliefs, the school’s attitude towards me changed completely. I know other parents who are afraid to speak up because of how the school has treated me.“It was like being bullied. They stopped treating me like any other parent but were antagonistic towards me. I believe that they retaliated against me by unreasonably excluding me from the premises, victimising my child and not taking my safeguarding concerns seriously.“I wasn’t even trying to stop the Pride event. I just wanted my child to receive an education, rather than indoctrination.”According to Christian Concern, Adhedo withdrew her son from the school last month after he was put in detention for three hours. The school insisted its maximum detention was one hour, in line with its behaviour policy.Roger Kiska of Christian Concern said: “It is inappropriate for children to be proselytised on this issue. The school has crossed a line.”Under the Human Rights Act, schools were obliged to respect the rights of parents’ religious and philosophical convictions in providing education, he added.According to the school’s policy published on its website, “issues such as bullying, racism, homophobia, sexism and prejudice are dealt with in lessons and assemblies. Classes visit places of worship that are important to different faiths.“Special celebration events are held and parents and visitors from different cultures, faiths or religions share their beliefs, customs, food and knowledge all greatly enhancing learning within the schools.”Earlier this year, the Christian Legal Centre, an organisation linked to Christian Concern, took up the case of Alfie Evans, a terminally ill infant whose parents contested medical advice to turn off his ventilator.It is also representing a Christian couple accused of discriminating against LGBT guests at their Welsh guest house, and others “who have suffered discrimination and challenges because of their desire to live and work according to biblical beliefs”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/90cb0f65036288d82737e612ac4480d69c0a9302/0_56_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=43021c32d568f9cdcd99b0bb77a26715","title":"labour vow end compulsory maths english retakes","story":"Shadow education secretary says students will be allowed to choose alternative qualifications under new policyLabour has promised to end the “remorseless cycle” of compulsory GCSE maths and English resits as part of its plans to reform further education (FE).Currently, FE students are required to keep retaking GCSEs until they get at least a grade 4 (or a C under the old grading system) as a condition of college funding, even though many fail again and again.Under Labour plans announced on Tuesday, students and colleges will be allowed to choose alternative qualifications instead to ensure that they meet the required standards in English and maths, rather than being forced down the GCSE route.Experts in the sector have expressed mounting concern about the resit policy, which puts an enormous strain on FE resources and frequently fails to improve GCSE grades, despite numerous attempts by some students, even up to the age of 19.Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said instead of struggling with GCSEs, students should be allowed to make progress in English and maths through high-quality functional skills programmes. “We welcome Labour’s commitment to end the remorseless cycle of GCSE English and maths retakes which the government has forced on further education,” Barton said.“It’s absolutely right that students should be able to retake these important qualifications if they choose to do so. But there is no point in compelling large numbers of students to keep resitting qualifications with diminishing results. It is demoralising for both them and their teachers and puts an intolerable strain on scarce resources.”In a speech to the Association of Colleges’ (AoC) annual conference on Tuesday, shadow education secretary Angela Rayner announced a series of reforms aimed at supporting FE students and raising the profile of FE in the education spectrum. “The prime minister promised that austerity was over, but it clearly isn’t for the 100 colleges facing the real risk of insolvency after years of relentless cuts,” she told the conference.“We have seen the number of adult learners fall by one million since 2010 and overall spending on adult skills cut by almost half, just at the time when we need to develop a skilled workforce more than ever, with Brexit looming.“Labour will reform the system to put learners first, focusing on improving the quality of further education, widening access to these opportunities, and ensuring every learner is supported.”AoC deputy chief executive Julian Gravatt said it was vital that every young person should leave education with strong foundations in maths and English. “Colleges have long called for flexibility in how to support learners to achieve this.

At a meeting between Solheim and staff in Nairobi in September, of which the  has seen a recording, Tim Christophersen, the head of the freshwater, land and climate branch at Unep, said: “Some of the work in my branch basically has hit a bit of a wall, because the donors we speak with are freezing their contributions to the environment fund.“None of us inidually is more important than the UN,” Christophersen told Solheim. “What should not happen in this organisation is that people are allowed to put their personal agenda ahead of the organisation, whether this is where you prefer to live, how you prefer to travel.”Numerous Unep staff have contacted the  criticising Solheim’s perceived closeness to China and the project he initiated related to the environmental sustainability of China’s huge infrastructure Belt and Road Initiative. The US in particular was concerned and its representatives raised a long list of questions as far back as April, including about how the project was funded and how intellectual property rights would be protected.Another concern to staff was the $500,000 sponsorship Solheim agreed to give the Volvo Ocean Race, despite it not being mentioned on the VOR sponsors’ web page or announced by Unep.Solheim emailed staff on Tuesday and said: “I wanted UN Environment to be a lead agency for reform, even if it raised some questions. Doing things differently is never easy and I will depart knowing I never spared a moment in my effort to implement this vision and leave UN Environment more capable and more impactful.”One senior employee welcomed Solheim’s resignation: “It will let us get on with the job we have to do, which is a big one. This was getting in the way.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4b93fd7a862a18d32d64b6be61dae37ed07868e8/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5dd79e3484a443e1a53623653791dd5e","title":"premier league numbers run furthest missed most chances 12 games statistics","story":"Twelve games into the Premier League season, we have probably learned enough about each team, using the most basic statistical metrics of goals scored, goals conceded and points gained, to come to certain conclusions about their style and their prospects. But with international fixtures forcing the league into a pause there is time to take a deeper e into the statistical swamp, which reveals a few interesting details.There is a fairly clear statistical link between effort expended and results achieved. The 10 teams that have collectively run the furthest contain seven of the top 10 and all of the top six of the seven teams that have run the least six are in the bottom half and three in the bottom four. The key exceptions are Crystal Palace and Huddersfield, eighth and ninth on the list but stuck in the bottom five, while Manchester United have outrun only four teams, yet retain European ambitions. While most of the 20 teams are fairly tightly clustered Cardiff have run more than 40km less than any other side, and more than 130km less than Arsenal, who top the effort table.As for iniduals, few will be surprised that N’Golo Kanté tops the charts for covering the most distance so far this season. But the clearest picture painted by these numbers is that the centre of midfield is no place for the lazy: only Marcos Alonso of the top 10 try-hards does not play there. Meanwhile only three players have covered more than 13km in a single game, and of the top five greatest single-player, single-game efforts every one was playing for a top-six team against another top-six team. The identity of the No 1 player for these lung-busting one-off efforts is unexpected, though: the only man to have three performances in the top 10, including the No 1 spot, is Bernardo Silva."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/985f284a7ddc61e2f8bdec37e59ab26ecd4ccca5/0_213_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1f06e76d4f291d91581ae06f9ca7027f","title":"italy v usa international friendly live","story":"90 mins+1: Gall takes the corner but it’s a poor one and doesn’t clear the first man. He’s the 23rd player to be given his first cap under Sarachan by the way. this has been a loooooooong interegnum period for the USA...89 mins: Gall looks up 30 yards out and sends a shot goalwards that Sirigu tips wide as we head into stoppage time.86 mins: Lasagna leaves the field to break would be humorists’ hearts and to make way for Politano.At the other end of the field, Adams and De Sciglio have a clash of heads which the Italian seems to come out of worst. He ends up jogging off for treatment while Adams looks none the worse for wear. New York Red Bulls fans may be raising an eyebrow at the sight of him and Long finishing up the full 90 minutes, given their MLS commitments this weekend though.84 mins: Ball bounces kindly for Lletget and for a second he looks free on goal, but he checks looking for support and the chance drifts away. Meanwhile:As I post that (with heavy heart), Lasagna spurns another chance, as the ball squirts into his path from a KeanCarter-Vickers tangle just inside the box. Lasagna rather rushes his shot though and fires over.82 mins: De Sciglio looks up from 30 yards and hits a fierce looking shot goalward, but he just gets underneath it and the ball flies over. Lletget on for Pulisic and Romain Gall on for Acosta, to make his US debut.80 mins: I want you all to know that I am doing my duty by fielding some terrible Lasagna puns cluttering up my inbox. And yes I said “terrible” and not “cheesy”. Because dignity.Game drifting into last ten minutes with Zimmerman poking clear a dangerous looking low ball across the six yard box from Sensi.78 mins: The US pick up only their second corner of the night and Acosta will send in the outswinger. Adams does well to get to the second ball and head to Wood in a pocket of space, but the forward can only poke an awkward shot wide of the near post.76 mins: Acosta’s free kick is blocked and Italy can break. Kean shows some nice touches bursting into the box on the left, but his low cross evades everyone in the box.74 mins: Pulisic is knocked off the ball by Sensi as he tries to angle inside. That looked like another booking, but with Sensi already on a card, the referee went for discretion again.Cannon comes off for Villafana before the free kick. Gagliardini comes on for Barella, as Italy make a change too.72 mins: Horvath in action again as Lasagna is sent racing through on a tight offside decision. Again, Horvath makes the block, though once again, the shot was straight at him.The longer this goes on, the more the Italians’ profligacy in front of goal becomes one of the main takeaways. No sign of a brand new Pipa Inzaghi on tonight’s evidence.70 mins: Another good block from Horvath as Grifo sends a stinging shot from distance that forces the keeper to e and push the ball out for a corner.68 mins: Cannon chops down Emerson, and if this wasn’t a friendly you’d be expecting him to see a second yellow for that. As it is, the US must face a free kick from wide left. It results in another free header for Acerbi, though as it turns out he was offside behind the USA’s high line.66 mins: I am so proud of the  readership’s attempts to extract meaning from this contest. Here’s Tim Singleton:“It has disturbed me for a while the similarities between the stand-in U.S. coach and the stand out Twin Peaks character Leland Palmer. The coaching style seen as Lynchian could explain a lot. If it is, in fact, Leland Palmer, more. I say we keep him as things could only get ‘interesting’.”64 mins: Oooh...that was interesting. Acosta whipped in a great free kick to the back post that bounced nicely into the path of Zimmerman, to force a point blank headed save from Sirigu. He’s had nothing to do tonight, but that was a key stop from the Italian keeper.62 mins: Pulisic goes down hard in the center of the park. And that will be the cue for more subs to start coming in. Trapp for Delgado. Wood for Sargent. Kean comes on for Italy.60 mins: Another decent block by Horvath as Lasagna burst up the middle looking to slide the ball past him. Horvath’s done his job tonight. And with Zach Steffen having overtaken him this year as the presumptive choice as goalkeeper for the next generation, this is a timely reminder of his credentials. Especially with Steffen looking somewhat out of form of late.58 mins: Little scraps of opportunity for the USA, though with set pieces looking like their best hope, the fact that the referee is blowing his whistle for any suspected infringement isn’t benefitting them.Right on cue, Sensi picks up the fifth yellow card of the night as he clips Sargent in the center circle.56 mins: Rare US break, and after a series of slightly ponderous touches and passes Delgado picks up a free kick on the right corner of the box after a barge from Grifo. Acosta’s outswinger is headed clear and the referee blows for a foul before Delgado can drive the clearance back towards goal.54 mins: Berardi goes down under pressure in the box. He’s not looking for anything in the aftermath but we do have VAR this evening and Long’s tackle looked clumsy.Now the US go to sleep as Verratti comes charging in to glance a header just over the bar, when everyone thought the ball had gone out of play before the cross came in.Another cross now, from Emerson, and the US looking stretched at the back.52 mins: Sargent tries to chase a ball down the left, but he’s offside. He’s looked a little tentative so far — dutifully doing what someone in his position is supposed to do, without looking like he’s dominating his area of the field. Italian defenders just nudging him off the ball when necessary.50 mins: Adams gets tripped up. A fan runs on the field. Play stops. Time passes.48 mins: Grifo came on for the lively Chiesa, which may come as some relief to the USA back line.In early moments the USA are looking a little more proactive n closing Italy down in their own half. Better looking shape too.Grifo is on for Italy. More subs news as we get it.More bookings to report: I missed noting Shaq Moore and Kelyn Acosta picking up yellow cards in the final moments of the half — the latter during that incident with Verratti that had them both chatting to each other in the aftermath.Christian Isaac writes with this:“Kevin Lasagna is a very odd Italian name, would be like an England player being called Guiseppe Pork-Pie”Correspondents, do your worst...Half-time thoughts:This has been pretty poor. Italy looking organized though not especially adventurous under Mancini — who may be having a word right now about just how many possibilities exist for them against this US team. Chiesa looked lively and caused problems throughout the half as he popped up at all points along the Italian line of attack.USA looking indistinct — neither compact enough when they drop in blocks, or disciplined enough when they attempt to press to ever get a toehold in the game. In terms of bright spots, they were few: Horvath gradually got busier and made a couple of decent stops, but beyond that, this feels like so many recent USA games. No coherence, no partnerships, nothing much to meaningfully glean.Half-time thoughts in a moment...45 mins +1: Acosta having an animated chat with Verratti on the nature of sportsmanship, before jogging back to concede a corner. Nothing comes of it and that should be it for the half.44 mins: Cannon gets a yellow card as he fouls Emerson near the left corner of the box. Chance for Italy to finish the half on a high. From the free kick, Verratti sends in a skimming low ball that bounces just in front of Horvath and forces the keeper into a great instinctive save to parry the ball away.42 mins: Pulisic teases a little chipped ball forward looking for Sargent bursting behind the defense, but it’s just too strong, and Sirigu scoops it up easily enough. Nice idea from Pulisic.40 mins: Lovely dipping swerving shot from Berardi from the edge of the box forces Horvath to tip the ball over the bar for a corner. Sargent clears the set piece with a header at the near post. We’re drifting to half-time now, and still no goals.37 mins: Chiesa leads a break down the left and toe pokes a dangerous looking ball just behind Lasagna and beyond Long, but Berardi had just checked his run and can’t get to the ball.35 mins: Berardi’s neat cutback past Moore almost opens up a shooting chance on the edge of the box, but Moore recovers enough to force the ball clear.Justin emails again:“Hey Graheme, you misspelled my last name as Kavanaugh. I feel supremely ill-judged!”You sound very chipper Justin. Are you sure you’re watching this?32 mins: Italy tiptoe to the right edge of the US box, only for Long to shove Berardi off the ball and give up a free kick. Long looked like he was expressing some heartfelt frustration as he delivered that shove.Berardi will swing it in, but it’s too high and hard and drifts past the back post.30 mins: Italy playing neat little passing triangles in the USA half, with Sensi prodding play this way and that. Whatever the virtues of this exercise for the USA, this has been a neat sparring exercise so far for the Italian B team. Half an hour gone. No score yet.26 mins: The Italians still toying with the US then looking for telling final passes behind or through them. No decisive breakthrough as yet, but for now they’re looking pretty comfortable going forward, though on occasion now, the US are beginning to make their press look a little more effective in the Italian half.24 mins: Sargent bundled off the ball on the edge of the box, but only gets a throw-in for his pains.Meanwhile, in further email intrigue, Joe Harvey drops by to foment revolt:“I don’t understand why any of the promising young players for the US even show up to these friendlies if there’s no real coach. I’m honestly surprised there hasn’t been an honest to goodness player revolt.”I’m guessing they’d have to learn each others’ names to get organized first?22 mins: Acosta’s inswinger is dealt with easily enough, but the referee had blown for a foul by Zimmerman anyway.Meanwhile Justin Kavanaugh emails to muse idly:“The current USA set up reminds me of that old joke where you call up a friend and ask himher “How do keep an American soccer fan in suspense?” Then you hang up. Arsène Wenger is free, I hear. Could a Frenchman ever manage the USA national team, I wonder.”20 mins: ...how did Bonucci miss that? Sensi floats the ball to the edge of the six yard box where Zimmerman had lost Bonucci to give him a free header. Somehow he directed it straight at Horvath with the goal gaping. Let off for the USA.At the other end of the field Di Sciglio gets himself a yellow card wide left in his own half, as he chops down Delgado.18 mins: Adams gives up a free kick in a dangerous spt some 25 yards out left of center. Sensi is over it...16 mins: Rare chance for the US as Pulisic drives a ball across goal looking for Sargent, but it never reaches him and there’s too little support from his team mates to put Italy under pressure as they clear the lines.Immediately the US are under pressure at the other end and Carter-Vickers has to make a last ditch recovery tackle at the expense of a corner.14 mins: Chiesa barrels in looking to great a floated cross to the edge of the six yard box, but Moore does enough to impede him and earn the foul. Going to be a busy night for the Reus Deportiu man.A minute later Chiesa sends a cross of his own in and Berardi has a free header near the spot, which he directs just past the near post.12 mins: Now Chiesa tries to sneak past Moore at the back post on a ball ver the top, but Horvath read the cross easily enough. And now Aaron Long steps across to clear another probing pass out for a throw.Long and team mate Tyler Adams are both still in the MLS playoffs by the way — interesting to see how long they play before expected starts in Atlanta on Sunday.10 mins: Chiesa’s been popping up along the front line and now he comes central to send a low shot from distance skimming past Horvath’s right post. The US goalkeeper had it covered, but more alarming for Dave Sarachan will be the ease with which Chiesa was able to get the shot off in the first place. Still 0-0.8 mins: US trying to play their way forward, and Adams gets his foot on the ball looking for a free team mate. He picks out Pulisic, but all the lanes are closed down quickly and any glimmer of progress is gone.6 mins: Cannon tracks Emerson well to play the ball off him for a goal kick, but it’s already looking like an attack versus defense training exercise with the US dropping off and the Italians comfortable trying to unpick them in the final third.4 mins: Sarachan has sent out a 3-5-2 led by Sergant and Pulisic, and with the instruction to be proactive. They’re lying pretty deep so far, though the forward two almost start a scrappy transition in Italy’s half, without much support from fellow white shirts. So that fizzles out.At the other end Horvath has to be smartly off his line to smother a ball over the top for Chiesa. And now there’s another warning as Italy pass through the lines to almost get Berardi free for a shot on the left of the box.2 mins: Chiesa gets clattered early by Moore, before Chiesa can get any fancy ideas about dribbling. Italy knock the ball around patiently, though a fair distance from the USA goal.Referee Cuneyt Cakir of Turkey gets us underway — fun fact: he was the referee for the England-Croatia World Cup semi-final. Italy kick off...Nope...nothing yet, just anthems:Italy arm in arm and looking relaxed as they belt out their singalong (A couple of them are even swaying), after the US youngsters stood looking pretty petrified during their anthem, like a line of kindergarteners on their first visit to the principal’s office. Apart from Pulisic, tonight’s captain, who as usual looked pretty unfazed by any occasion he finds himself in.The USA does not have a head coach yet:This blog has been live for about an hour now, and there’s still no sign of a permanent head coach for the USA, which leaves the youngest ever starting XI for a US national team wandering around Italy, like a lost group of gap year backpackers. Gregg Berhalter’s Columbus Crew SC are out of the MLS playoffs now, so it may be that he’ll be confirmed in the coming days — so this should be Dave Sarachan’s last game in charge. He’s done a competent job cycling the next generation through, but the lack of coherent direction forward has been painfully apparent in the last couple of international get togethers.Snark aside (granted — a tall order for a  liveblog) even the US players are beginning to let their diplomatic masks slip when showing up for these international windows, since the months have drifted by without sign of a permanent coach. The 3-0 loss to England was pretty dismal, but hardly unexpected after window after window of constantly rotating formations (we’re expecting a 3-5-2 today FWIW) and personnel. Ironically, the list of teams the USA has played in that time have represented something of a Who’s Who of elite world teams, yet it’s been hard to see how those experiences can coalesce into any sort of coherent institutional memory for the coming World Cup cycle.Horvath, Carter-Vickers, Zimmerman, Long, Adams, Cannon, Moore, Delgado, Acosta, Pulisic, Sargent. Subs: Guzan, Miazga, Wood, Weah, Lletget, Green, Villafana, Trapp, Gall. So, Sassuolo’s Berardi, Udinese’s Lasagna and Fiorentina’s Chiesa will get first crack at yet another reshuffled USA defense, with Ethan Horvath replacing Brad Guzan in goal, and by the looks of it, everybody replacing everybody else. Except Pulisic. Josh Sargent has recovered from his slight injury worry to get a proper run out up top for the USA, but other than that it’s a continuation of this year’s theme of giving exposure and experience to numerous young players with an EYE TO THE FUTURE or something.Get ready for some meaningful action.Italy:So after the weekend’s 0-0 draw with Portugal, Roberto Mancini has slightly shuffled his squad around — with the following 22 in place for tonight’s game:It’s a young looking squad, as they generally have been since the failure to qualify for the World Cup mandated change. After Leonardo Bonucci, there’s a pretty steep drop off in terms of international experience, until you get to Marco Verratti, who is by far the most experienced international midfielder Italy will have on the field. Both will be starting tonight.What’s most intriguing is wondering who out of the group of forwards is going to make a name for themselves and establish themselves in this group. The USA’s permanent state of flux ought to make for a...er...sympathetic defense to face under the circumstances.Afternoon all, and welcome to the latest episode of the end of history. With Dave Sarachan’s interim stint as US head coach entering itsMeanwhile Italy are looking like a very model of stability by comparison, what with their credible draws and Nations League solidity under Roberto Mancini making them look just like classic group stage Italian sides of yore, if you squint a bit. They’ll play host this afternoonevening.We’ll have some team news shortly, but for now get your tweets coming in to @grahamparkerfc or email graham.parker@the with the subject line, “How does it take a year to say Gregg Berhalter?” and I’ll get back to you sometime in the next World Cup cycle.Graham will be here shortly, in the meantime here’s some transfer speculation regarding Christian Pulisic:Christian Pulisic has said he is open to moving to the Premier League, with Chelsea understood to be leading the race to sign the forward from Borussia Dortmund next summer.The USA international is expected to face his clubmate Jadon Sancho at Wembley on Thursday having been left out of the Dortmund side that beat Bayern Munich on Saturday in favour of the 18-year-old Englishman.Pulisic has been linked to several Premier League sides including Liverpool and Tottenham in the past but it is understood that Chelsea have shown most interest in prising him away from the Bundesliga leaders.You can read the full article below:"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af3add74872d02df08f43a93033b21aa5dd143d4/48_0_2113_1267/master/2113.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7be73b5d0178a88d8915bd22b1dba73c","title":"scotland v israel nations league live","story":"90 min+1: Zahavi’s deflected shot hits Bates and spins out for a corner, McGregor unable to claim the ball before it runs behind. The pressure is relentless here. The corner’s cleared but Israel put the ball back in. Fraser tears back to win it.90 min: There will be four added minutes.89 min: It’s tense now! That really was a marvellous save from McGregor.88 min: A long ball over the top catches Scotland out and reaches Hemed, who lifts an acrobatic volley towards the top corner. It looks a certain goal, only for McGregor to show stunning reflexes and push it aside. Much to the Scotland goalkeeper’s relief, the rebound’s slashed across the six-yard box. What an escape!85 min: Tomer Hemed replaces Tawatha. He’s on just in time for an Israel corner. McGregor flaps at it a bit, but Scotland hack the ball clear.81 min: As nervy as Scotland are, Israel are yet to make them sweat.78 min: Scotland break in a bid to calm their nerves, but Fraser fires over under pressure.76 min: Scotland make a double change, Matt Phillips and Graeme Shinnie replacing Stuart Armstrong and Ryan Christie.It isn’t over yet. Zahavi collects possession 25 yards from goal, turns and whips a fine shot past the flatfooted Alan McGregor, who can only watch the ball zoom to his right. It might have taken a touch off McKenna. Either way, Israel have hope. They only need one more goal.74 min: Seba almost scores straight away, only to drag his shot wide after taking a touch to set himself.71 min: Harush punches Fraser’s free-kick away. But back come Scotland, with the rampant Forrest surging down the outside on the left. He hangs a cross over Harush, but no one’s there when Fletcher heads back across goal.70 min: Peretz slides through the back of Callum McGregor on the right. Booking.69 min: Forrest has another go after cutting inside from the left, but this time his shot whistles over from 25 yards.67 min: The Sky commentator lets us know that James Forrest is the first Celtic player to score a hat-trick for Scotland since Jimmy Quinn against Ireland 110 years ago. Almog Cohen replaces Taha.This is another neat goal from Scotland. They press on the left and spy an opening when Robertson slides a pass through to Fraser. The Bournemouth winger wriggles into the area and slips a pass inside to Forrest, who takes a deft touch to leave Ben Harush on the floor and set himself up for another confident finish from close range. He’s been so composed in front of goal this evening and that’s the reason Scotland look set to finish first in this group.James Forrest completes his hat-trick!62 min: Scotland deal with Zahavi’s corner. Israel have been very disappointing since half-time.58 min: Harush palms Fraser’s free-kick from the right away. It’s all Scotland at the moment.56 min: Fletcher slams a shot miles wide from a ludicrous angle.53 min: Paterson’s deflected shot spins wide for a corner on the left. Fletcher glances Fraser’s delivery over.52 min: Taha picks up a booking for cynically stopping a Scotland counterattack.49 min: Zahavi’s deflected shot fizzes over for a corner.48 min: Fraser drives a low ball into the six-yard box. Harush plunges on it.46 min: Israel, who need a goal to salvage their campaign, get the second half underway.Scotland lead thanks to a clinical double from James Forrest. After an awful start, they’re 45 minutes away from a Euro 2020 play-off spot!45 min: There will be two added minutes.A long ball’s pumped forward towards Steven Fletcher. What the striker needs is someone running off him - and that’s precisely what Christie offers here. Christie surges forward, into space on the left, and he has the composure to loft the ball into the path of the unmarked Forrest. The winger is never going to miss. He takes a touch and drills another low shot past Harush. It’s his fourth goal in a week and Scotland have turned this match on its head!40 min: Callum McGregor picks up a booking for a late tackle on Dabbur.37 min: Scotland deserved that. They’ve dominated the last 15 minutes and got their reward. Israel are still a threat on the break, though.The pressure had been building and now Scotland are level. Armstrong was at the heart of it again, making room on the edge of the Israel area for a firm shot that hits a defender and falls to Forrest. The winger takes a touch and ks the ball past Harush from 15 yards. A cracking finish. Israel, however, are still top of the group.31 min: Buoyed by this little spell of pressure, Scotland attack again and the volume rises when Forrest shakes off his marker with a brilliant turn and drives into the Israel area. For a moment he looks certain to score - but his shot’s deflected wide for another corner.30 min: Another corner to Scotland. This time Fraser flings it in. McKenna throws himself at the ball but his header’s blocked and Israel clear their lines.29 min: Yeini slides to stop the ball running out for a Scotland corner. The flag goes up anyway. He’s annoyed. Not that Scotland can rub salt int the wound, bungling a short corner.28 min: Christie bursts down the right, but his deflected cross drops into Harush’s gloves.26 min: Bates faffs around with the ball on the halfway line, loses it and leaves a big gap in the heart of Scotland’s defence. He’s lucky Zahavi doesn’t turn and run through on goal when the ball comes to him. Instead the Israeli striker slows the move down and ends up passing to Robertson.22 min: Scotland inject some urgency into their attack, Armstrong bursting down the left and spreading concern in Israel’s defence. Fraser takes over and works it inside to Fletcher, who has the ball whipped off his toes before he can shoot. Callum McGregor picks up possession 25 yards out and tries to do a Kayal, but Harush pushes his fine effort wide.20 min: Tawatha, who’s having a good game on the left, pings a cross to the far post. Conscious that Zahavi’s lurking over his shoulder, Robertson guides it behind.19 min: Israel break and Dasa slides a clever ball through to Peretz. It’s just overhit, though, and Peretz ends up sliding to bring down McKenna.15 min: The Scotland fans aren’t happy at the moment. The home team are struggling to string two passes together. In the stands, meanwhile, an Israeli fan is having a read. I should know the name of the book, but I’m a self-hating Jew.13 min: Israel are running this. Dabbur scoots down the left and threatens to twist and turn past Bates, only to overrun the ball at the vital moment. Bates was a bit lucky not to bring him down.Israel play the ball around patiently outside Scotland’s area. Scotland think they have the situation under control and stand off the visitors. That, however, invites Beram Kayal to shoot from 25 yards and the Brighton midfielder’s effort swerves towards the top left corner and flies beyond the despairing e of Alan McGregor.This is some goal.8 min: Tawatha breaks down the left and drills a low cross into the Scotland area. Callum McGregor cuts it out.6 min: Remember when Steven Fletcher scored five goals in his first four games for Sunderland? Heady days.2 min: Nothing comes from Dabbur’s corner.Peep! With the anthems out of the way, Scotland get the game underway. They look to make a fast as they kick from left to right, Forrest teeing up Christie 25 yards from goal. Christie scuffs his shot and Israel counter, Tawatha winning a corner on the left.Here come the teams! Hampden Park awaits a classic night of Nations League.Hello. You’ve got to love the Nations League. In different circumstances, these would be grim times for Scotland. If Uefa had chosen to keep the status quo intact, it’s unlikely that a couple of wins over Albania would have made Scottish fans feel so optimistic. Instead they’d be focusing on a run of three defeats in their past five games, Belgium, Portugal and Israel meting out the damage, and talking about whether Alex McLeish deserves to be replaced by Craig Levein. Nobody would be excited about this evening’s home game against Israel, that’s for sure.Yet the quirky format of the Nations League, the competition that keeps on giving, means that those wins over Albania have given Scotland a chance of earning a Euro 2020 play-off spot. That’s quite the incentive for a country that hasn’t qualified for a major tournament since the 1998 World Cup, though let’s not get ahead of ourselves just yet. Scotland still need to beat Israel to guarantee they finish top of Group C1. No point tempting fate.

Upliftingly, the 60-year-old credits at least part of her success to husband – and coach – Tom Hintz. “I love being coached by my husband,” she says. “We both share the same love and passion for track.” Surely it sometimes gets a bit stressful, working with a spouse? “He’s very good at wearing two hats.”Events: W60: 400m, 800m, 1,500mBarry FergusonThe 76-year-old hurdler first joined Cambridge Harriers running club back in 1983. He was invited on to the Masters circuit, albeit with only modest success. With his 50th birthday looming, Ferguson decided to take his preparation more seriously – and went on to not only win his next race but set a new British record, which opened the floodgates to a slew of gold medals and records. “I have now travelled all over the world to countries I would not have visited otherwise, for example, Japan, South Korea and Brazil,” Ferguson says.Events: Sprint hurdles – 60m, 80mSue YeomansJust two years after she began training aged 47, Yeomans vaulted her way to victory at the 2002 world championships. So what does she consider her highest accomplishment? “It’s a toss up really – Porto Alegre Brazil 2013 was my most golds in one world championship, in pole vault, high jump, long jump and triple jump. Or there is my comeback world championship gold in pole vault, and a championship record in Perth, Australia six weeks after my mastectomy.” Talk about setting the bar.Events: Pole vault, high jump, long jump, triple jumpMary Trotto“I just completed my tenth decathlon,” says the remarkable 71-year-old athlete from Kihea, Hawaii. “And I still do the steeplechase.” Trotto reckons that beyond the simple joy of competing and winning medals, staying in peak Masters condition improves her quality of life in all sorts of erse ways. “I can play with young nieces and nephews, I can go all day with their asking and visiting without getting tired. I feel strong.”Events: All running events, especially 5km, decathlon, sometimes triathlonPaul OslandA former Olympian who represented his native Canada during the late 1980s and early 1990s, Osland is the current chief executive of Athletics Ontario. He’s looking forward to the Masters World Championships coming to his hometown of Toronto in 2020. “In 2005, I attended my first world championships in Spain. I won the M40 800m race, even though I wasn’t even aware of Masters racing until just a few months prior to the championships.”Events: 800m and 1,500m, occasional 400m, 4x400m and 4x800m relays, some javelin, high jump and pole vaultJoanna HarperHarper, from Portland, Oregon, has been a reliable fixture of the Masters scene since turning 40 in 1997. Until 2004, she competed in the men’s ision, but was forbidden from entering the female ision until three years later despite transitioning her gender. “Those were dark years, when I only entered races on an unofficial basis,” Harper told us. Her data-led work unpicking the stigma of trans women in athletics has seen her make fierce, articulate appearances on Fox News and on the pages of the Washington Post.Events: Distance running, 1,500m to marathonMoira WestWest’s journey to the Masters began more than two decades ago. “Aged 46, I put on some trainers and went for a jog. A lady I met while out running said I could join her for company and when I could run 2 miles she’d take me to the local Overton Harriers club. So it started – 5k became 10k and I enjoyed road races and cross-country. Aged 50, a teammate suggested I would be better suited to sprinting. I entered the Cardiff indoor Masters championships and got a silver medal in the 200m, and in 2012 was awarded my first world championship medal.”Events: 60m, 100m, 200m and 400mJohn WaskoAs a resident of American Samoa in the South Pacific, Wasko faces a daunting commute whenever he wants to compete at the Masters. But he still trains just as hard. “Personal satisfaction isn’t always about being at a big meet,” the 74-year-old says. “It’s knowing you’re competitive with other athletes. My times are up there with the top runners in the world.” He’s evangelical about track running. “It’s not like soccer where there’s overtime, a second chance. When the gun goes off you have to excel, even if nobody is in the other lane.”Events: 100m, 200m, 400m"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dceff5a99da4f63b8d881adb13c5bab28742defb/205_412_2647_1588/master/2647.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2f43ee73ef8d5ff47a434c1413486246","title":"five scenic uk cycle routes for beginners","story":"Cycling doesn’t have to be all about endurance, speed and derring-do – it’s also an activity that can be relaxing and even meditative. These five routes are perfect for those looking to take on longer rides at a gentler paceMore and more people are rediscovering cycling as a gentle way to exercise and explore new places on their own steam. Cycling lets us experience our surroundings in new ways – from the sights and smells we might miss in the car, to the simple pleasure of feeling the wind in our hair. It’s also something just about anyone can enjoy: cycling is non-weight bearing, and for many people it’s easier than walking. There are also bikes to suit most needs. With some great, flat, traffic-free or low-traffic routes across the UK that you can enjoy at a gentle pace, inspiration and adventure are just around the corner.Distance: 18 milesStart: PadstowEnd: Wenford BridgeTime taken to cycle: one-and-a-half to two hours without stopsThe Camel Trail is one of the UK’s best-loved cycle trails, not least with families, for its beautiful waterside scenery and wealth of wildlife. From picturesque Padstow it follows the Camel estuary’s shore, a designated Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, and home to little egrets, peregrines, ospreys and kingfishers. The delightful riveted Little Petherick creek bridge once served the former railway line. After an on-road section through Wadebridge it wends through wooded country beside the River Camel, past Bodmin, before briefly skirting Bodmin Moor, to Wenford Bridge.Pit stopTreats on Trikes is a traditional tea, cake and ice cream vendor on a tricycle, midway between Padstow and Wadebridge, at Penquean quarry.Distance: 13 milesStart: Sirhowy valley country parkEnd: Taff Bargoed parkTime to cycle: one to one-and-a-half hours without stopsExplore three south Wales valleys parks by bike. Starting at Sirhowy valley country park, north-west of Newport, you’ll follow a former railway line over the listed Hengoed viaduct, with its 16 towering arches, and past the Wheel o Drams, an 8-metre tall circular sculpture of mining carts. Penallta country park once housed the deepest pit in the south Wales coalfields, and now features viewpoints, wetlands, and the UK’s largest earth sculpture – Sultan the Pit Pony (above, top left). You’ll finish in Taff Bargoed park, once three pits, and now a wildlife haven perfect for a riverside picnic. There are train stations at Crosskeys, Hengoed and Quakers Yard.Pit stopsLord Nelson Inn, Commercial St, Nelson, Treharris. Cafe on the Rock, the Old Drift Mine, Trelewis, Treharris.Distance: 10.6 miles Start: Aberdeen station End: DrumoakTime to cycle: one to one-and-a-half hours, at a leisurely paceThe Deeside Way in its entirety follows a former railway line from Aberdeen to Ballater, of which this is a 10-mile, largely traffic-free section. Start at the Polmuir Road entrance of Aberdeen’s Duthie park, behind the Winter Gardens. One of the largest indoor gardens in Europe, it is well worth a visit, with rare plants from around the world, and the tantalising “corridor of perfumes”.Follow the leafy path past homes and parkland, and under tree canopies towards Peterculter. You’ll join a quiet country road at Coalford keep on the path until you reach an access road leading to Drumoak. There are three former stations en route, as well as the Peterculter Heritage Centre and, a short distance from the Deeside Way at Drumoak, the 13th-century Drum Castle. At Drumoak, you can catch a bus back to Aberdeen with the bikes.Pit stops Duthie Park Cafe, 25 Polmuir Gardens, Aberdeen.Newton Dee Cafe, at Newton Dee Village, Bieldside. The Bieldside Inn, 37 North Deeside Road, Bieldside.Distance: 8.5 milesStart: Blackwell MillEnd: BakewellTime taken to cycle: around one hour without stopsLike most great traffic-free cycling routes in the UK, the Monsal Trail started life as a railway line. The popular route, in the heart of the Peak District, is steeped in geological, industrial and rail heritage. There are six rail tunnels, four of which are around 400-metres long and lit during the day, as well as excellent views from Monsal, Headstone and Miller’s viaducts. From Blackwell Mill, just south of Buxton, head east through enchanting Chee Dale, in the Upper Wye valley. The lime kilns at Millers Dale station are imposing, fortress-like structures, cut into the rock face.Pit stop Hassop Station Cafe is in an old station building on the trail, complete with sun terrace. It’s open year-round, serving tea, cakes and ice-cream.Distance: 16 miles one-way (32-mile return)Start: CowesEnd: SandownTime to cycle: one-and-a-half hours without stops three-four hours returnNearly half of the Isle of Wight is a designated Area of Outstanding Beauty, and it’s one of the few places in England with red squirrels. The Red Squirrel route links two traffic-free trails, and the compact island’s north and east coasts, with some on-road sections running through towns. Starting at Cowes, it traces the Medina River to Blackwater, before wending through peaceful countryside, following the River Yar to Sandown. En route are Osborne House (above left), Queen Victoria and Albert’s former holiday home, Cowes Maritime Museum, the Museum of Island History in Newport, Carisbrooke Castle and Dinosaur Isle, in Sandown."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6ae32aa9665c8bb81e78575c511a20b24227276c/407_46_2136_1282/master/2136.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=34a9783d5bd14517a526fb0038048d52","title":"the ebike has landed six models to get you on the road","story":"The age of the ebike has arrived, helping to make a pedal to work or the shops easier than ever. From the high-end to the competitively priced, here are six electric bikes to spark your imaginationSo you like the idea of cycling but you’re put off by thinking it could be too intense? Or maybe you’d be fine with getting on a bike if it wasn’t for that merciless hill nearby.Electric bikes, or ebikes, are a great solution for non-cyclists. You can enjoy exercise as you pedal on the flat, but the onboard battery can bolster your effort, making hills manageable – and quicker – without reducing you to a puddle of sweat. That extra oomph also means you can breeze away from traffic lights with minimal exertion.So what sort of ebike would you like? One that looks noticeably different from regular rides, or one that blends in, so nobody spots your unfair advantage? Before you go making that kind of decision, it’s worth noting that an ebike attracts a price premium for the extra electronics. You’ll also have to remember to charge the battery fairly regularly – after all, this adds around 6kg to the bike’s weight, so if you let it go flat, you’ll need to pedal harder on your suddenly heavy ride.Gocycle GSFrom £2,499 from gocycleThe British-designed Gocycle has a magnesium frame, which makes it both great-looking and tremendously light it’s a slick, assured ride. Weighing in at around 16kg, the GS is partly foldable for easier carrying, although it’s nowhere near as fast to open and close as the Brompton (see below). The docking station for faster recharging, available separately, reduces recharge time from seven hours to less than four, providing a range of between 40 and 50 miles, after which it’s just down to you to do the pedalling. This is Gocycle’s fourth ebike, and its most accomplished – with an exceptional attention to detail in the design. This includes what Gocycle calls a Cleandrive, which means the chain and oil are in an enclosed housing to keep your jeans oil-free.Gtech eBike SportFrom £995.99 from gtechBritish manufacturer Gtech makes ebikes in two styles: Sport and City. The Sport has a 51cm frame with crossbar, while the City has a 43cm step-through frame. In either case, the bike needs to be assembled when it arrives. This is not arduous, and online videos can guide you through this, as well as how to operate the battery. It’s not as powerful as some bikes here, but more than competent. And it’s very well-priced – under £1,000 including delivery. It also comes with a 14-day trial, so you can return it if you don’t get on with it. But it is an appealing, fun ride that offers plenty of electric support. The battery range is quoted at 30 miles, so you need to charge it more frequently than most, but it also charges faster than most other ebikes, taking three hours against the typical five or more.Brompton ElectricFrom £2,595 from bromptonThe familiar Brompton folding bike now has an electric version, which looks almost identical to other bikes in the range. The removable battery sits in a bag in front of the handlebars, connecting to the small but powerful motor, which sits on the front wheel. You can customise the handlebar shape and the gearing, and the Brompton is just a little heavier than the Gocycle GS. The ride and feel of the Brompton is very similar to a non-powered model nippy and precise, in other words. And the fold, which is quick and effective, is second to none. It’s one of the things that makes the brand so deservedly successful, and the 40cm wheels help the folded bike feel particularly compact. The other benefit of a Brompton, electric or otherwise, is that you can take it indoors with you, reducing the chances of it being stolen.Pinnacle Lithium Ion 2018£2,000 from evanscyclesThe Lithium Ion – from Pinnacle, Evans Cycles’ in-house brand – is a very comfortable ride, equally at home on country roads or urban streets. The detachable battery sits on the frame and is hard to miss. But because it’s removable you only need to charge that rather than carrying the whole bike up a flight of stairs, say. Although it’s visible, the battery is well placed to balance the bike, and you don’t feel it as you’re riding. It includes disc brakes that are responsive and effective on even steep downhills or in damp weather. Battery range is about 60 miles, a touch more than some here. But if you keep it in the high-assistance mode, it’ll be much less than that, perhaps half.Volt Pulse£1,499 from voltbikesVolt specialises in electric bikes, and the strikingly designed Pulse is one of its standout models. It comes with a choice of frame sizes and battery capacities, so you can ride for up to 60 or up to 80 miles, as you please. Pedal assistance is very smooth – so much so that you may fool yourself into thinking you’re doing all the work. Bikes, ebikes included, are mostly priced according to the quality of components on board and the parts here, including disc brakes, are excellent, meaning less adjustment and maintenance. The battery can be detached when you need to charge it, although you need to remove the seat post to do so.Pendleton Somerby Electric£850 from halfordsOlympic gold-medal winner Victoria Pendleton is behind this Halfords range of bikes, all of which are competitively priced and well built. The electric model comes in a step-through frame in two sizes, 43cm and 48cm. The battery sits on the back wheel, with a luggage rack helpfully placed on top. If you don’t look too closely, it absolutely looks like a regular, classically styled bike. Mudguards come as standard. It’s heavier than some here, although the battery power will help alleviate the effect of that. Although it’s not the nippiest bike around, it suits a gentle commute or weekend ramble. The white and navy frame won’t be to everyone’s taste, but it’s also available in a more discreet midnight black (with rose gold accents)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7dd11e7b1b7463c2b603bc491b63d881667aa44a/171_113_2379_1428/master/2379.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b5054ccf5f24480f05ef341d5cb3921d","title":"no time for the gym then try hiit the workout you can do anywhere","story":"High-intensity interval training (HIIT) can be done in a matter of minutes and delivers fitness in dense, bite-size chunks of exercise throughout the day. No wonder the fitness world loves itIf you have an injury or health condition, consult your doctor before doing these exercisesIt doesn’t take much time to improve your health. HIIT has become a staple in the fitness world and for good reason: it’s the time-efficient, super-effective way to get fitter that’s backed by science.But it doesn’t always have to mean donning your lycra – in fact, research shows that as little as a minute of HIIT can benefit the body. The workouts below take two minutes each, one for each hour of your working day. They target every muscle group in the body, require no equipment and can be done in very little space.The benefits? You’ll boost your circulation and energy levels every hour, so no more wanting to sleep face down on your keyboard it will increase your cardio fitness, muscle strength and core stability, and you’ll continue to burn calories even after you’re back at your desk!Before doing each workout, warm up by gently jogging on the spot for 30 seconds and then standing and raising one knee at a time in front of you – 10 on each leg. Work as hard as you can for the 20-second bursts of exercise. At the end of the workout, pace around for 30 seconds to cool down and stretch out any muscles that feel tight.Each workout follows the same pattern: do the first three exercises for 20 seconds each, with 10 seconds of rest in between each one. Do the fourth exercise for 30 seconds:Plank Lie on your front, hands beneath your shoulders, elbows pointing back. Tuck your toes under and push yourself up until your arms are straight, pulling your navel up towards your spine so you feel the core stability muscles around your middle engage. Keep looking at the floor and make sure your bottom is neither sagging towards the floor nor pushing up towards the ceiling.Press-ups From a plank position, bend your elbows to lower yourself towards the floor. Letting your elbows flare out to the side works the chest harder keeping them nearer your sides focuses more on the triceps. A full-press up is touching your nose almost to the ground, but you may not get that far to start with. The most important thing is to keep a straight line from your knees, to hips, to head. Balance on your knees rather than your feet to make it easier if needed.Jumping jacksStand with feet together and hands by your sides. Simultaneously, jump your feet out sideways and swing your arms out to the side and up until your fingertips meet above your head. Jump back to starting position.Bottom kicksJog on the spot, flicking your heels up to kick your bottom.High kneesJog on the spot while bringing your knees up high in front of you. Use your arms to really drive the movement and go as fast as you can. If this is too vigorous for you, do the same action but as though you’re walking rather than running.Mountain climbersFrom a plank position, lift your right foot off the floor and drive the knee towards your chest. Place the foot back and repeat with your left knee. Don’t stick your bottom high in the air and keep a rapid flow.Shadow boxStand with feet hip-width apart and bring fists up into a boxing position. Punch upwards with the right hand then the left, then punch across your body with your right hand then left, allowing your body to rotate towards the direction of the punch and heel to come off the floor.Bear crawlKneel on all fours, hands directly under your shoulders, knees under your hips. Tuck your toes under and lift your knees to hover a few inches above the ground. Now crawl forwards – right arm at same time as left leg and vice versa – for six paces, then crawl backwards for six. Keep your abdominals engaged and back as flat as possible (imagine you’re balancing something on it).Reverse lungesStand with feet hip-width apart. Step back with your left foot, lowering the front knee to a right angle or deeper. Focus on using the glute in your right buttock to power back up to standing. Repeat with the right leg.Sumo squatsStand with feet wide apart, toes turned slightly out (about 45-degree angle), hands clasped in front of your chest. Keeping your back straight, bend your knees in the direction of your toes (but don’t go beyond them) to lower yourself until your knees are as near to 90 degrees as possible. Keep your weight in your heels. Come back to standing.Squats or jump squatsStand with feet just wider than hip-width apart. Cross your arms and place your hands on opposite shoulders. Keeping your torso upright and chest facing forward, bend your knees and stick your bottom out, spread your weight through your heels and ensure that your knees don’t stick out beyond the end of your toes. For a full squat, you’re aiming to lower your bottom to knee height while keeping your chest facing forward, but go as far as is comfortable. Return to standing. To make squats harder, add in a little jump at the top of the move.Bicycle crunchesLie on your back with feet flat on the floor, hands touching your ears, elbows out to the side. Simultaneously, lift your feet and head off the floor and begin to slowly move your legs in a pedalling motion. As your right knee comes towards you, bring your left elbow towards it and vice versa with the left knee and right elbow. Keep your torso still by engaging your core stability muscles."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d561550f395d36ff842e3c37219820785e369573/100_0_1500_900/master/1500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b8413fc535bbb78c56d960c310f25adf","title":"best new android iphone games 2018","story":"Pop bubbles, play pool, become a neighbourhood god, a viking hero, or start a craft beer empire in 2018’s best new mobile games for iPhone and Android.Farming’s far from the whole story in this charming sim: there’s plenty of crop management and animal-rearing, but getting to know the other inhabitants of the town around you is just as important, with some touching stories to be uncovered. Inspired by the Harvest Moon games, it’s more accessible, but with lots of scope for endless tinkering with your farm alongside ticking off in-game achievements.Piffle comes from the same developer as Crossy Road, and it’s just as characterful and compulsive. It’s a puzzler with shades of classic brick-breaking games Breakout and Arkanoid. Dressed in a cat onesie, you fire “Piffle balls” to clear each level’s screen of blocks, while taking advantage of bowling-ball power-ups, explosive dynamite block and other power-ups. The in-app purchases – for coins that can be used to keep playing when you fail a level, or to buy power-ups to help – aren’t aggressively forced upon you, while daily challenges and themed levels stop it from getting samey.The 2019 edition of this ever-popular football management sim adds new features to an already excellent game. Those include a new training system, the ability to manage in Russia or China, and transfers negotiated in real-time for quicker offers and counter-offers. Otherwise, what’s not broken ain’t been fixed: FMM zeroes in on tactics, transfers and training, so you can blast through seasons quickly whether you’re playing on a train, in front of the TV or (heaven forbid) at work.The Reigns and Reigns: Her Majesty games are marvellous, using a Tinder-style interface to test your skills as a monarch by swiping left or right on binary decisions. The third game in the series comes with a high-profile licence: HBO’s Game of Thrones. You’ll be ruling Westeros as Cersei, Jon, Daenerys, Tyrion or Sansa, making your decisions ahead of the ever-coming winter. It’s a perfect fit, and while you will regularly meet an untimely, brutal end, the game’s structure means you’ll face new situations every time you replay it. And you’ll want to do that a lot.There is an official version of the classic town-planning game SimCity on mobile called SimCity BuildIt, but its freemium moneygrubbing makes my teeth itch. Pocket City is a great alternative. This is a loving homage to classic SimCity, as you plan residential, commercial and industrial zones, plus the utilities and entertainment required to keep your growing population healthy and happy. It’s sensibly stripped down for phones, too, never burying you in sub-menus or overloading the economic complexity. Whether you work your way through its quests to build a megalopolis or let loose in its no-restrictions sandbox mode, it’s a reminder of why virtual town planning was so addictive all those years ago.You wait ages for a game where you play a hole in the ground, then two come along at once. Donut County heavily “inspired” a similar game called Hole.io, which topped app-store charts earlier this year. Donut County the better of the two, thanks to a storyline that amps up the quirk factor with its anti-hero, a scenery-swallowing raccoon (he “drives” the hole) called PJ, who is trying to make amends for landing his friends and their homes 999 feet underground. The physics are the satisfying thing here: swirling your hole underneath objects to tip them in feels just right, while the way it grows each time turns the levels into a careful puzzle of progression from small to big items, rather than a pure rampage.Its princess-rescuing trope may feel over-familiar, but there’s nothing else tired about Wonder Blade. It’s a sparky side-scrolling action game in which you set about groups of enemies with sword-swipes, magic spells and Mortal Kombat-esque execution moves. There’s plenty of humour in the bug-eyed characters you meet. On the grounds that there aren’t enough games that also feature chase scenes where you ride a pig, dressed as a block of Swiss cheese, pursued by a giant castle-shaped monster, this one’s a keeper.This PC-game port starts with an inventive premise: you play a character for 60 years from baby to old age, with each year taking a minute of real-world time. When they die, you start again as a baby – but benefiting from the actions and inventions of your first character. This, in a massively multiplayer world where other players are buzzing about with their own life cycles – including some who will be parenting you when you respawn as a helpless infant. The fascination comes from exploring the world and its objects, and figuring out how you can break them down and then recombine them to create new items that will help you and your descendants. Unselfish planning for future generations? Given current issues from Brexit to climate change, it’s a timely conceit for a game.The Asphalt racing franchise is firmly in Need for Speed street-racing territory, featuring physics-defying jumps and drifts, as well as nitro boosts that remain sadly unavailable for your real-world hatchback. Asphalt 9 has been engineered for mobile gamers who aren’t that experienced with racing games: it can optionally handle acceleration and steering automatically, leaving you to focus on the stunts and scenery – even if that scenery is often about to slam itself into your bonnet. The game’s system of in-app purchases also seems fairly tuned. Its timers system means you’ll need to switch cars sometimes to keep playing, but you’re not overly pressured to pay.Mobile games where you make words from letter tiles with a Scrabble-style points system are 10-a-penny. Alphabear, launched in 2015, was one of the better ones, and this sequel builds on it well. It’s designed as a single-player game, with a story mode leading you through levels with various gameplay restrictions to keep you on your toes – from time limits to bonuses for specific kinds of tiles. Around this, there is a system of cartoon bears to be unlocked. These have their own special powers and score-multipliers (such as earning you extra points for words ending with ‘s’). If turn-based multiplayer word games such as Words With Friends feel a bit intimidating, this is a more relaxed alternative.Lebensborn was an initiative in Nazi Germany that involved sending children to be adopted by “racially pure” parents, both within Germany and occupied countries. Factor in themes of bullying and abuse, and it’s no wonder that a content warning about potential distress is the first thing you see. The game has you trying to parent a Lebensborn child in Norway, and their experience at school is far from idyllic. In fact, you’ll probably feel increasingly bleak the more you play, as your desire to fix things surges at the same rate as your fury that you can’t. A worthwhile, if not always pleasant experience. Read the full reviewPocket-Run Pool seems very simple: it’s a top-down, drag-to-aim pool simulator with decent ball physics. But there are some twists that make it much more interesting. There are score-multiplier pockets, which rotate after every shot – hitting the 10-ball into the 10x pocket scores 100 points. High Stakes mode introduces a gambling element where you play for chips with quirky challenges such as bumpers on the table, or “death balls” that instantly end your game. Insta-Tournament gets you competing in your own time against other players’ best scores. It’s ideal for quick goes when you have five minutes to kill, and more than capable of making you miss your train stop or bedtime.This is a game about exploring an infinite galaxy, exploring planets, collecting loot and uncovering the odd ancient mystery. It’s firmly action-focused: when you beam down to a planet, you’ll run around blasting aliens while keeping a close eye on your health, sometimes encountering satisfyingly big bosses to take on. What keeps you playing is everything around that – turning loot into upgrades for your weapons and fighting skills, for instance, or building a space base. Space Pioneer is not aggressive about asking for money, either. There are no sudden difficulty-level lurches to nudge you towards in-app purchases, so you can play at your own pace.Mobile gamers have been playing neighbourhood-god in The Sims: FreePlay, a cut-down version of the life-simulator Sims games on PC tuned for smartphone habits, since late 2011. It’s now been superseded by The Sims Mobile, which is much closer to the bigger, better PC games. It suits the rhythm of mobile play (short bursts rather than long sessions), letting you micromanage your Sim people and see their work, love lives and home decor evolve. There are energy meters and a timer that locks you out of the game, both designed to nudge you towards in-app purchases, but it nonetheless retains the magnetism of the PC games as your community develops.The first Evoland was essentially a megamix of the best bits from the history of role-playing games, from monochrome Game Boy questing to Final Fantasy-style battles. The sequel continues in that vein, packing in knowing references for long-time game and anime fans without bamboozling everyone else. From pixel-art platforming to 3D open-world exploring, Evoland 2 sends you through a montage of fun moments, both familiar and novel.A playground craze the likes of which we’ve not seen since Minecraft, Fortnite is a colourful, rather creative battle-royale shooter: 100 players begin a match, one remains at the end. Where Fortnite prevails over its rival PUBG, which also appeared on phones this month, is that it feels natural on a touchscreen, from the smart placement of the on-screen buttons to double-tap gestures that make aiming while running painless. You might download it for your kids, but you’ll want to play it yourself.Alto’s Adventure, from 2015, was a beautiful-looking, endless snowboarding game, but developer Snowman has swapped snow for sand for the sequel, with a desert theme providing plenty more scenery to gawp at. You’ll be swooping down slopes, flipping somersaults while airborne, and avoiding obstacles from rock-piles to chasms, taking in sunsets and storms. It’s calming and meditative, with a zen mode that strips out the scoring aspect for an even more relaxed experience.The fourth in a series of super-tactile puzzle-box games, Old Sins bucks the law of diminishing returns: it’s the best yet. Exploring a ghostly doll’s house, you solve a physical puzzles by manipulating the objects you find there, sliding open secret compartments, rotating statues and ringing bells. Experimental tapping will only get you so far: real progress (and intense satisfaction) comes once you tune in to The Room’s twisty logic.This turn-based strategy game sits somewhere between Hearthstone and Clash Royale, because you battle with fantasy character cards. There’s a well-designed solo mode to teach you how to fight and build a decent deck, ready for taking on other players online. There’s a lot of scope to sculpt a deck for your preferred battling style, using archer- and spell-heavy ranged attack tactics to up-close brawny brutes, but the intricacies don’t feel overwhelming.More fantasy deck building here, but Meteorfall is focused on solo play, with elements of dungeon adventuring woven in to its card battling. You choose a character, get a basic deck of attack cards, then swipe your way through fights with monsters, stopping off to expand and upgrade your deck and level-up your hero. Deaths are unavoidable, but you can save the gems earned by playing to unlock some new cards for the next time round. It’s a tight, cleverly focused card battler with an irresistible one-more-go factor.

In an age threatened by groupthink and strongman politics, they provide an essential antidoteCrazy. Feisty. Bolshy. Bossy. Hysterical. Sassy. Shrill. Spinster. Cat woman. Hag. Cougar. Frigid. Slut. Bitch. The English language has no end of words to describe women who don’t behave the way they are supposed to. They are all derogatory and almost none of them have a male equivalent. The most complimentary thing you can hope to be called if you are a woman who doesn’t conform to societal expectations is the E-word: eccentric.While the idea of eccentricity is nebulous, it is an important barometer of society and women’s place within it. “The amount of eccentricity in a society has generally been proportional to the amount of genius, mental vigour and moral courage it contained,” wrote John Stuart Mill in 1859. If that is the case, then I think we should be incredibly excited by the loud and proud display of feminist vigour running through popular culture. From Janelle Monáe rocking very unsubtle vagina trousers in the music video for her song Pynk to Marina Abramović’s provocative performance art, and TV shows such as Killing Eve and Sally4Ever that revel in weird women, female eccentricity is having a moment.Dr David Weeks, a neuropsychologist at the Royal Edinburgh hospital and the author of Eccentrics: A Study of Sanity and Strangeness, agrees. “We are seeing more female nonconformists, and most eccentric women come from that group. There are more eccentric women nowadays, although they were not as well documented over the period from about 1580 to 1800 in the UK.”The emergence of more female eccentrics is a sign of how much feminists have achieved. Women, Weeks says, now have more opportunities to “exercise their creativity, independent-mindedness and their feminist, anti-sexist rights.”To be labelled as eccentric rather than crazy used to be a privilege only a great deal of money could buy. In the past, eccentric women tended to be aristocrats. Being upper class gave one more licence to stray from social norms. As Edith Sitwell, one of history’s most famous female eccentrics, noted: “The genius and the aristocrat are frequently regarded as eccentrics because genius and aristocrat are entirely unafraid of and uninfluenced by the opinions and vagaries of the crowd.” If you were posh enough, you could get away with anything.Sitwell came from an incredibly wealthy and famously odd family. Her father, Sir George Sitwell, invented a tiny pistol for shooting wasps and a musical toothbrush. When not shooting wasps, he wrote a number of unusual – and unpublished – books, including A Short History of the Fork and Acorns as an Article of Medieval Diet. Then there was her maternal grandfather, the Earl of Londesborough, who died after contracting a disease from a parrot. Some of her relations were reportedly fond of hiding live lobsters between the sheets as a prank. Her mother, Ida Sitwell, was an alcoholic who spent a few months in Holloway prison for fraud. It would have been remarkable, with all that going on, if Sitwell had ended up in any way conventional.This is particularly true considering her appearance, which was striking. She was 6ft tall with a magnificently beak-like nose and dressed in unusual clothes. The author Elizabeth Bowen described her as looking like a “high altar on the move”. Her poetry was similarly idiosyncratic, as was her manner of performing it: she has been described as the world’s first white rapper and performed the poems of her series Façade through a large megaphone behind a curtain. There is more than an echo of Sitwell’s defiance of gender and genre norms in many of today’s eccentric women – particularly when it comes to Tilda Swinton, who happens to be Sitwell’s cousin. (Swinton paid her respects to her forebear in a photoshoot for W magazine this month when she dressed up as Sitwell.)But Sitwell is not the most eccentric female aristocrat to have graced history. In fact, in many ways, she led a conservative life compared with the extraordinary Hester Stanhope. Born in 1776, Lady Stanhope spent her early adulthood managing the household of her uncle, William Pitt the Younger, who was then serving as prime minister. In her early 30s, after her uncle’s death and a love affair gone wrong, she reinvented herself as an archaeologist and explorer and headed off in pursuit of adventure in the Middle East.Like Sitwell, Stanhope was known for her unusual fashion she was shipwrecked during her travels and lost her English wardrobe, so she started dressing like a Turkish man. She even shaved her hair and wore a cashmere turban. Her clothing, along with her confidence, meant that no one knew what to make of her. “She was neither a man nor woman, but a being apart,” said her biographer, Joan Haslip. She was treated as a being apart, too, getting unique privileges and access. She became the first European woman to enter Palmyra in Syria and earned the nickname the Queen of the Desert.While, historically speaking, being an English aristocrat helped ensure you were put in the eccentric box rather than a mental asylum, it has never been a mandatory requirement for attaining eccentric status. What is most important is defying categorisation being impossible to pin down. That has traditionally been much harder for women than for men, with society having invented so many labels for women so many convenient ways to reduce them to types rather than appreciate them as iniduals so many ways to cast off female nonconformity as mad or bad rather than interesting.One woman who defied categorisation without the help of any blue blood was Vivian Maier, a US nanny and street photographer who died in 2009. Maier took more than 100,000 photographs during her lifetime but her work was largely a secret. Her prodigious output came to light by chance in 2007, when a young estate agent called John Maloof bought a box of negatives at auction, hoping it would contain pictures of his Chicago neighbourhood. In fact, it contained work that is now considered to be among the finest street photography of the 20th century. Maloof became obsessed with finding out more about their unlikely creator.What makes Maier so intriguing is the contradictions she embodies: career nanny street photographer proudly independent mysteriously private. She resists any easy attempt at categorisation. There is no easy way to bundle up and explain her you must approach her as an inidual.This insistence on unapologetic iniduality is what makes modern eccentrics such a powerful force for social change, particularly at a time when authoritarianism and groupthink threatens to take over the world. The likes of the Icelandic musician Björk, Swinton, Abramović and Monáe do not fit comfortably into a particular era or genre, nor within the conventional confines of gender. They are purely themselves and they are unapologetic about it. And that is the most revolutionary thing a woman can ever be.“I’m always left of centre and that’s right where I belong,” Monáe sings on I Like That, a single on her latest album, Dirty Computer. “Told the whole world  I’m the venom and the antidote  Take a different type of girl to keep the whole world afloat.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29154973f074960f0af69cc6dd7f29cd56de0967/0_50_2016_1210/master/2016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=09e9e989b476cafc49db8d6d0e45625a","title":"guardian passes 1m mark in reader donations katharine viner","story":"Business model showing way for journalism to ‘regain its relevance’, says editor-in-chiefMore than a million people worldwide have contributed to the  in the last three years, with 500,000 paying to support the publication on an ongoing basis, according to  News and Media’s editor-in-chief, Katharine Viner.She said the business model was showing a new way for journalism to “regain its relevance, meaning and trusted place in society”.Viner told the Society of Editors’ annual conference in Salford that many contributors donated specifically because they wanted the  to stay free and outside a paywall, so “progressive journalism can have the widest possible impact”.“Many readers didn’t understand the challenging commercial reality facing all news organisations, but once we told them more, they expressed real interest in wanting to support the ,” she said. “This was helped by the fact that any money made by the  has to be spent on journalism, because of our ownership structure with no shareholders or owner.“This entirely new revenue stream of monthly and one-off contributions is now a crucial part of our plan to get the  to break even by next April.

The former Daily Mail editor Paul Dacre criticised Rusbridger in his lecture on Sunday night.“His record on investigations in the public interest was exceptional, a model for how to hold the powerful to account,” Viner said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9decace90bb0a15a7e8889e2046f27a3ce61b2be/0_72_6585_3951/master/6585.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=02a76ce2cdd66493d5bfd7d4376ac655","title":"support guardian readers future journalism","story":"By supporting our journalism, you can become part of a global community of over a million  readers with a shared set of core values and a vision for a more hopeful worldThank you to the 1,000,000  readers who have offered us their support over the past three years.

Not yet? Many people never do. One in three adults in the UK have no private pension, and will rely on the state pension in old age. Even those who do start saving usually only get round to it in their 40s and 50s, upping their pension contributions in the hope of retiring in their 60s. But there is a new breed of supersavers who have no intention of waiting that long. They intend to quit before the age of 40 and live a free life.The Financial Independence, Retire Early (Fire) movement originated in the US, but has spread to the UK, attracting twenty- and thirtysomethings who do not intend to spend 40 years strapped to the corporate machine. Instead, they are practising a combination of extreme saving and rigorous investing to try to build up the “stash” you need – commonly seen as 25 times your annual expenditure – to quit, or, as these millennials put it, to “get Fired”.Hall says it’s a question of being organised, not miserly. “I wouldn’t want to come across as some tight old git who doesn’t socialise,” he insists. He says the choices he makes are simply rational, and mentions using the free coffee machine in his office rather than stopping off for an expensive one at the shop at the entrance. “You would not believe how many people every single day get the coffee downstairs, paying £2.50 or £3. Do that every day for a year and it adds up to quite a significant number. Going out for lunch is another big thing.” Make your own sandwiches, he suggests.He is putting his money into a lifetime Isa and “passive” tracker funds, which follow the stock market and charge low fees because they are not actively managed. He intends to buy a property in Manchester, rent it out and perhaps work abroad. “I enjoy my job for now, but things can change, and when I’m 30 or 35 I’d like to have the option of thinking: ‘Do you know what? Stuff it. I’m going to go and do something else.’ The goal is not retirement, but freedom to do whatever I want to do.”Dave Hamilton, who is 41 and lives in south London, retired five years ago after spending 15 years working in data analytics. “I was always convinced there was more to life and more fun to be had in the world of nonwork,” he says. He has paid off his mortgage and, after spending the final seven years of his working life saving £35,000 of his £75,000 salary, has accumulated a pot of £500,000. Properly invested, he says, this should keep him going for the rest of his life. “I have very simple tastes. I don’t buy flashy clothes, cars, computers. My aim wasn’t to retire rich, but to retire with a realistic understanding of what I would need for my living standards to continue.”He says his family and friends thought he was mad. “‘Why are you doing this?’ they said. ‘You’ve got a good job. You’ll get bored. I reckon you’ll be back in a year.’ I didn’t know what I was going to do, I just knew that the world was full of things I wanted to see and do, and even if I chose to watch daytime TV all week, at least I didn’t have to go into the office at someone else’s beck and call. Now, I have been retired for more than five years. In that time, I’ve travelled a lot, got married, had a child, learned Italian, taken up painting and built a house. I play a lot of tennis and rarely switch on the telly. I spend much less money now because the things I enjoy don’t cost that much.”Emily (she prefers not to reveal her surname), who is 44 and earns £90,000 a year at a scientific company, is another committed Fire follower. She says she will work at most for another 10 years. That would make her a late retiree by Fire standards, but she wants to be sure she will never have to do paid work again.She admits to getting carried away now and again, and imposing “shopping bans” where she does not buy anything except food. “You can get really obsessed about not spending any money, and that’s not good for you either,” she says. “The whole point about saving a huge pot of cash is not having to stress about money, so overstressing about saving that pot of cash isn’t doing you any good. You need to find that sweet spot between saving a decent amount and still living a life.”Mr Money Mustache, AKA Pete Adeney, is the standard-bearer for Fire. A 44-year-old Canadian living in Colorado, he worked for 10 years before packing it all in just after he turned 30. He describes himself as a “mild-mannered retired computer engineer”. “I realised in my mid-20s that I was perfectly content to ride my bike to work and cook my own dinner,” he says. “So I had no interest in spending the relatively high salary that even an average income earner, let alone an engineer, makes here in the US. But I knew that money was a useful thing, so I wanted to put it to good use. I decided that buying my own freedom was probably the best use of that money.”He ided his life into two phases – the working, earning, saving part and the living, creating, parenting part. “As a young engineer, I remember seeing what a challenge my older colleagues faced with having to ide their attention between their careers and their kids,” he says. “It seemed like they were not able to give their full efforts to either endeavour. So, I decided to focus purely on my work for that period of my life, and then focus on being a dad for the 18 years thereafter. I’m currently on year 13 of the second project.” He and his wife orced recently, but he says they are “still very close co-parents”.Through his widely read blog, Adeney has become the philosopher king of the movement, though he admits his ideas were anticipated by earlier practitioners such as Jacob Lund Fisker in his blog Early Retirement Extreme. Adeney calls his version of Fire “Mustachianism”, and says he started his blog in 2011 “out of a sense of exasperation”. “Already six years into retirement at that point, I was amazed that peers with similarly high incomes were not only still stuck working, but were still living almost paycheck to paycheck,” he says. His main tenet is that “happiness is not very expensive” – it is only retail companies and ad agencies that try to persuade you it is.He tells his adherents, no matter how much they are earning, that they should aim to save and invest half their income. “At this level, your mandatory work career is about 17 years,” he says. “Just for comparison, saving three-quarters puts you at about eight years. It’s not really about early retirement it’s about starting to live the best life you can right now, with more purpose and less stress. My blog has never really been about money it is about encouraging humans to live happier and more rational lives.”Barney Whiter, AKA the Escape Artist, is the best-known UK-based disciple of Mustachianism. Now 48, he retired five years ago after a 20-year career in corporate finance. On his blog, he says he paid off his mortgage when he was 32, built up an investment portfolio and quit his job at the age of 43.I tell Whiter Mustachianism sometimes sounds like a cult, and to my surprise he agrees. “You’ve got this charismatic leader and these very loyal followers,” he admits. But, he says, those followers are very erse. “The people who come to the meet-ups are anything but clones. What they have in common is a desire not to be ripped off by ‘the Man’. They don’t subscribe to consumerism.”Whiter says the Fire movement will get a boost early next year with the release of Travis Shakespeare’s documentary Playing With Fire, which charts the rise of the movement and looks at one couple’s efforts to achieve financial independence. Shakespeare has skin in the game, he says, because he has been practising Fire for the past decade, having previously been “financially illiterate” and still in the red when he turned 40. Discovering Fisker’s and Adeney’s writings (and inheriting some money from his father) saved him. “I told myself: ‘I have a chance now to not end up eating cat food in my old age.’”Eight years on, he is financially independent, and feels this has allowed his career as a producer and director to flourish. “I began to make bolder choices at work because I knew that if I ‘failed’, I had a reliable backup plan,” he says.Shakespeare argues that people who free themselves from what he calls “obligatory work” will be a force for good because many of them will use their creativity for socially useful ends, and that they have the capacity to become standard-bearers for anti-consumerism. He traces the idea of a fulfilled, liberated life back to 19th-century writer Henry David Thoreau and his paean to nature, Walden. The Fire movement even has its own version of Thoreau in Elizabeth Willard Thames, AKA Mrs Frugalwoods, who has written a book about opting out of urban life and buying 26 hectares (66 acres) of woodland in rural Vermont, on which she lives with her husband and two daughters. Like Adeney, she hymns the simple, outdoor life unencumbered by excess – a rival American dream to the consumerist one. Both dreams require money – buying 66 acres of rural Vermont complete with house and barn cost the Frugalwoods $389,000.Does Fire have anything to offer people on lower incomes? Most of the practitioners in the UK who I speak to are sceptical. It is possible to see the whole movement as malign (Whiter wonders whether I am preparing a “hatchet job”), with middle-class people using rising property prices and a buoyant stock market to become a new leisured aristocracy.I don’t want to do a hatchet job – I can see that financial independence is attractive, and that an anticonsumerism philosophy, even if more libertarian than socially driven, can be positive. But you can’t ignore what one Fire aspirant called the movement’s “dirty little secret”: saving on a low income is hell. What does Fire offer those who are on low-paying or zero hours contracts, can’t escape high rent or childcare costs, and will be lucky to get out of poverty and enjoy leisure on a reasonable income at 70, let alone 40?“Your question is one that I have also grappled with,” Shakespeare says. “Obviously Fire is not a path for the working poor, and I don’t think anyone is claiming it ever could be. However, once a person earns more than she needs for basic expenses, she is in a position to grow wealth and pursue a greater sense of freedom and agency over her life.” Shakespeare suggests adopting an incremental approach – everyone who has something left over from spending on essentials should save what they can to buy some degree of freedom. “I personally think of Fire less in terms of polarity – ie, you’re either financially independent or not – and more in terms of stages,” he says. “For example, if someone is able to save a month’s salary, he is protected from events like a water heater going out or a car breakdown. If he saves six months, his ability to comfortably manoeuvre, say, a job change is much more powerful. A year’s savings gives a person the ability to take a year off, try to start a business, go back to school, etc. All these markers grant the inidual greater power over, for lack of a better phrase, wage slavery. If you’ve got three years of wages in the bank you can make even bolder decisions.”“My favourite debate!” says Whiter. “The tools and techniques of Fire are needed more by low-income people – to avoid them being fucked over by the system.” In a blogpost entitled Financial Independence Is for Everyone, he tackles the subject head on: “If you’re not a high earner, it’s even more important not to piss your money away on ridiculous spending. Living paycheck to paycheck leaves people at the bottom of society prone to disaster. They, more than anyone, need the techniques of financial independence to build a safety net and gain options to improve their life.”In another post last month, Whiter featured his friend Ken Okoroafor, who arrived in the UK from Nigeria at the age of 14, speaking poor English, lived in a bedsit and encountered daily racism. Twenty years later, he too is financially independent. If Okoroafor could do it, suggested Whiter, anyone could. But he went on to make a more general point – that everyone, whatever their circumstances, can do something to improve their situation. “Sometimes, people tell me that not everyone can get to financial independence,” he writes. “I file that information under ‘N’ for ‘No shit, Sherlock’. Not everyone can run a marathon in three hours either. But more people would be able to run five or 10 miles if they put down the doughnuts and went for a run.”Greg had a brain haemorrhage last year – which was the trigger to put their plan into action. The Owens were keen on boating and, when Greg recovered, they sold their house in Bradford and bought a 55ft narrowboat. They now cruise the canals of Yorkshire, moving on every couple of weeks to avoid mooring fees. They have a budget of about £750 a month, which they admit is tight, but say that having to forgo a few luxuries is worth it in exchange for the freedom.I ask them what their children think of their nomadic lifestyle. “They are somewhere between amused and despairing,” says Frankie, “but I think they are secretly quite pleased. They understand that we want to do something for us and that we worked hard for a long time.” Greg, who used to be a copywriter, says having their first child at 19 meant they were never “young and free”, so they have chosen freedom now. A perfect example of living your life backwards, though they accept that in a couple of decades, when they take their occupational and state pensions, they may come back on to dry land and invest in a flat. Until then, they just hope to stay afloat.Financial advisers, who may feel threatened by the Fire community’s capacity for independent action, are largely dismissive of its approach. “People need to realise that we can’t have our cake and eat it,” Martin Stewart, director of the financial advice firm London Money, told the Daily  in September. “Sure, save half your salary, eat the roadkill, bin-dip, raid the charity shops, recycle everything, just stay in and actually read the T\u0026ampCs of things rather than waste money going out. From this you will create lots of savings, but sadly very few memories.”“I hate it,” the US personal finance guru Suze Orman said last month when asked about Fire on the Afford Anything podcast. “As you get older, things happen. You’re hit by a car, you fall down on the ice, you get sick, you get cancer. Things happen, and if you don’t have a significant amount of money, what are you going to do? You are going to burn up alive.” By significant amount of money she didn’t mean $250,000 (£195,000) or even a million. “Two million is nothing,” she said. “It’s nothing. It’s pennies in today’s world.” She thought $10m might just about do it.“This thinking is completely backwards,” Adeney countered in a blogpost. “Money will not cure your fear, as the megamillionaire Suze proves so clearly. If you are afraid of what might happen in the future, you have a mental problem rather than a financial problem.”He ended his counterblast with what sounded like a manifesto. Fire, he said, is “a system of living your best life in all ways rather than just the financial, based on our best understanding of human nature, with a bit of math and science behind it … It’s always open for modification or improvement, but like science itself, there’s nothing for a rational person to hate. Who hates learning? The reason it has spread to millions of people is that it works. People try it, they like the results, so they share it with their friends, and the cycle repeats. There’s no stopping an idea or a movement like that.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0c09baa6969dcca638feebf75a3bd0675bbf31d4/0_8_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7a68a3c1cbad455276043533b0e7d87d","title":"mps blast banks for discriminating against tenants on benefits","story":"Government told to address ‘housing blacklist’ operated by mortgage lenders MPs have slammed banks for “discriminating” against tenants on housing benefit and suggested the government may need to ban them from operating “no DSS” policies.NatWest was criticised in October after it emerged that the bank prohibited many of its buy-to-let landlord borrowers from having tenants on housing benefit. The case, involving landlord Helena McAleer and her tenant, a vulnerable older woman, came to national prominence after the  published an article headlined: “NatWest, is it right to evict a woman on housing benefit?”The Commons work and pensions committee has intervened, saying the government must address the “housing blacklist” created by mortgage lenders’ “no DSS” policies.McAleer’s buy-to-let mortgage is on a house in Belfast and her tenant has always paid the £400-a-month rent on time for more than two years.When McAleer approached her mortgage lender, NatWest, for some additional borrowing, she was surprised to be told that this would only be possible if she kicked out her tenant.NatWest’s mortgage policy for landlords with fewer than 10 properties includes a restriction on letting to tenants in receipt of housing benefit. There are about 4.2 million housing benefit claimants in Britain. NatWest was keen to state that it was not throwing the tenant out on the streets, but its correspondence with McAleer made clear that “the options available to you are to seek an alternative tenant or move your mortgage to another lender”.McAleer, who lives in London, decided to move her mortgage and organised a petition calling on the government “to stop banks discriminating against welfare recipients”.The work and pensions committee has published correspondence relating to the case and said it was “deeply concerned” about the extent to which mortgage providers were preventing landlords from renting to benefit claimants.Frank Field, who chairs the committee, said: “Allowing banks to operate a ‘no DSS’ policy is a return to the wicked old days of housing discrimination, with claimants effectively blacklisted for housing and at risk of being senselessly evicted for no greater crime than receiving housing benefit.“NatWest is now taking a look at its policy and other mortgage lenders will no doubt follow suit. If the change we need to protect people is not forthcoming voluntarily, we may need to look to regulation.”NatWest is part of the state-controlled Royal Bank of Scotland, whose chief executive, Ross McEwan, said in a letter to the committee that he was “extremely disappointed” with the way the case was handled by the bank. “We are now in the process of conducting a review of our buy-to-let policies,” he said, but pointed out that the bank’s policy in this area was “in line with a number of other lenders in the buy-to-let market”.McAleer said she welcomed the committee’s intervention and would like to see the issue debated in parliament."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/adf306486891a75d1227c0b4ec24d54c2482c19c/23_73_1127_676/master/1127.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e440ab8ba46c765bf87bfd37b2925726","title":"story bagpusss magical folk soundtrack sandra kerr john faulkner oliver postgate","story":"Sandra Kerr and John Faulkner on recording the music for the 1974 series about ‘a saggy old cloth cat’, stress-tested by Ewan McColl and Peggy Seeger – and endorsed by Belle and SebastianLast year, Sandra Kerr retired from her job at Newcastle University, where she had taught a course on “traditions of these islands” for the music department. “Through the whole 17 years,” she says, “I’ve had students say to me that Bagpuss was their first introduction to traditional music. That’s enormously pleasing, to think that young people who have gone on to get attention and admiration for their music might have started with hearing the music for Bagpuss.”Bagpuss, of course, was the most important, the most beautiful, the most magical saggy old cloth cat in the whole wide world. He lived in a shop window, deposited there – along with the mice and their mouse organ, the carved woodpecker bookend known as Professor Yaffle, Madeleine the rag doll, and Gabriel the toad – by a little girl called Emily, who brought back objects that would inspire flights of fancy as the toys came to life. Oliver Postgate and Peter Firmin’s stop-frame animation ran for only 13 episodes in early 1974, but through repeats imprinted itself on the consciousness of successive generations. And alongside the magical stories, the music made for the series by Kerr and her then husband, John Faulkner, seeped into the imaginations of musicians and music lovers. Now all the music they recorded for Bagpuss – alongside outtakes and alternate versions – is getting the reissue it deserves, in a beautiful book-style package, from Earth Records.Kerr and Faulkner were, on the face of it, unlikely candidates to soundtrack a children’s TV series. They met in 1963, through the folk scene – both were at first enraptured by skiffle and US roots music – but something else happened that changed their musical orientation. “I went off to live with Ewan MacColl and Peggy Seeger, to be their au pair and folk apprentice,” Kerr says. “That does sound like an extraordinary job description, doesn’t it? I was completely and utterly over the moon with that. I had one-to-ones with Ewan in things like the social and political history of folk songs. With Peggy, I had formal musicology and guitar lessons. I was very fortunate indeed to have that year it was my folk degree.”The young couple were invited by MacColl into an informal gathering he established, the London Critics Group. “We felt we had a mission to promote British folk songs and folklore, which were being ignored because of the influence of American music,” Faulkner says.“The first thing I always think about was how exciting it all was,” Kerr says. “There we were with one of the architects of the folk revival, and with Peggy, and every week we were in their house listening to traditional singers, analysing what they did, singing ourselves, and learning to critique what they did. We studied hard and worked incredibly hard.”The pair have different memories of how, in 1973, they came to be approached by Postgate. “Oliver, who didn’t know me and Sandra, knew Ewan.” Faulkner says. “I think there was a connection through his father, Raymond, who was a socialist historian. I think Oliver contacted Ewan and explained he was doing a series, and asked if Ewan could recommend anyone who might be interested in making music for it.”Kerr’s version begins with her and Faulkner supplying the theme for Sam on Boffs’ Island, a series written by Michael Rosen for schools television, starring Tony Robinson, Miriam Margolyes and Michael Rosen. “The producer, Claire Chovil, had lunch with Oliver. He said he was doing a new series about a saggy old cloth cat and he wanted a different kind of music for it. She said she had just worked with a couple who had played hundreds of instruments, which was us.”Faulkner says: “He explained what these programmes were about, and they were sort of experimental, in the sense that he liked the idea of using music that was traditional-based, because the stories he had written were very folky. He wanted something more bedrock, and we could provide the kinds of instruments I don’t think he’d considered – autoharp, mandolin, concertina.”Both remember making the Bagpuss music to be a delight. Postgate would tell them the stories he was telling in the episodes, sometimes supplying them with lyrics to set to music, and they would compose around his suggestions. “He would give us a lyric, like The Bony King of Nowhere,” Faulkner says, “and say: ‘Can you write a melody for that?’ We would go away and throw it around, then record a tune to cassette. Because of what we were presenting, he started to think of it as music-led. I think it’s true to say that he was inspired by what we were giving him, and we were certainly inspired by what he was giving us.”The pair were inspired by many different strands of traditional music of the British Isles: the Irish traditional song Brian O’Lynn makes an appearance for The Weaving Song, they set Postgate’s words to an old Scottish tune called The Calton Weaver. One of the most recognisable pieces – the mouse round, We Will Fix It – dated back centuries. “I think we had just recorded Sumer Is Icumen In with the Critics Group,” Kerr says, “and, when Oliver said he wanted a little round, that must have been in my head.”The results were magical. The unusual instrumentation – with concertina, Appalachian dulcimer and autoharp prominent – gives the music a timeless, otherworldly feel that is almost hallucinatory in its quality (in his sleevenotes for the reissue, Stewart Lee suggests that it has influenced acid folk). And the very best of the music – The Miller’s Song, for example – is so good you can’t believe it was recorded for a lunchtime children’s TV programme. “That’s my favourite,” Kerr says. “And Oliver loved that song in particular. I still sing it, and people respond to it whether or not they were Bagpuss fans, so I suppose it has entered the folk tradition, which is very gratifying.”Of course, the original audience for Bagpuss barely comprehended the music in their infancy, but as they grew older, its wondrousness became apparent. “It wouldn’t surprise some people to hear that in the days before iPads, when we went on tour we used to watch videos on the bus, and one of the regular things was Bagpuss videos,” says Sarah Martin of Belle and Sebastian. “I remember sitting on the bus watching it with Chris Geddes and The Miller’s Song came on, and we both said: ‘What a great song.’ You’re not aware of it as a kid, because it’s quite wordy and meaningful, but to find a gem like that on a children’s TV show is extraordinary.”• The Music from Bagpuss is out now on Earth Recordings."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/83e44dc10db4a71291fb943ceeba67d7a20343a0/0_141_6570_3942/master/6570.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=edb28840f19a8062635a0904aa02ce24","title":"poverty in britain a social calamity","story":"As part of his field work for a damning report into poverty in the UK, Philip Alston, the UN rapporteur, visited Newcastle where he found people struggling to negotiate the benefits system and going hungry.

The European Research Group had significantly overestimated the number of people attending the launch of its new paper – why the UK should tell the EU to sod off: part 183 – and there were a few dozen empty seats by the time the event got under way at a converted church in Westminster. Perhaps a few of the invitation letters had gone astray. Or some of those who promised to attend just hadn’t shown up.At a previous ERG event to launch an earlier paper – why the UK should tell the EU to sod off: part 156 – the Conservative MP Steve Baker declared himself to be a “numbers man”. As in, making up the numbers. In both senses. Ever since the former junior Brexit secretary was promoted to well above his pay grade as Jacob Rees-Mogg’s second-in-command, the ERG has struggled with basic maths.For several months, the group had claimed it was only one or two letters short of the 48 needed to trigger a vote of confidence in the prime minister. So when Rees-Mogg announced that he too had sent his letter to the chairman of the 1922 Committee, Baker quickly predicted the 48 threshold would be reached within a day or so. However, it’s turned out there have been far fewer letters sent than had been promised. More imaginary numbers.Quite what has happened to the other letters is unexplained. Given that many members of the ERG aren’t the brightest, it’s possible that some Tory MPs either forgot to put on a stamp on their letters, sent them to the wrong address, misspelled Brady as Brodie, or posted them by mistake into a rubbish bin. But if even Andrea Jenkyns, the ERG idiot’s idiot (a title bitterly contested by Andrew Bridgen), can manage the basics of letter writing then it’s safe to assume a group of Tory rebels fuelled largely by fantasy have unsurprisingly turned out to be fantasists.Either way, the ERG has seemingly managed the impossible. In less than a week, they have made Theresa May appear vaguely plausible while relegating themselves to an embarrassing, long-past-its-best, music hall act. With Rees-Mogg as Archie Rice. In a straight fight between the ERG and Dad’s Army, Captain Mainwaring would come out on top every time. Tuesday’s event had all the feel of the final hurrah before the knacker’s yard.Behind the stage was a placard with the words “Global Britain”. Global Britain turned out to be seven old, white men waiting for the golf club bar to open. Only the presence of Rees-Mogg brought the average age below 65 and he was feeling every one of his 49 years. Even he never thought he’d sink this low. Whatever would Nanny think?Peter Lilley, a former trade secretary, got things under way as if he were auditioning for Dragon’s Den: he had virtually founded the World Trade Organization single-handedly he was certain everyone was overexaggerating the problems of cross-border trade, as he had once brought a cheese from his second home in France back to the UK without being stopped no one should worry about Kent becoming a car park as illegal immigrants had already turned it into one and he’d never come across a trade deal he couldn’t negotiate in 10 minutes. Baker perked up at that. Ten minutes probably really meant five. Nothing escaped the numbers man.The next three nonentity guests had little more to say, other than that they hadn’t read the paper but were sure they probably agreed with it. Sir David Ord – me neither – even managed to do this while appearing to be asleep. The rest of us should have been so lucky. It was left to a dishevelled David Davis to wrap things up. “I’m overawed to be in such distinguished company,” he began. He really needn’t have been. He was perfectly matched, with the stupidity bar set comfortably low.Much to the panel’s disappointment, no one had any questions to ask about Global Britain. Mainly because it was all a rehash of what the ERG had put out several times before and been comprehensively dismissed on every occasion. Instead, everyone wanted to know if the 48 letters were ever going to materialise. Along with the more existential one of why an organisation should have gone to such lengths to prove its lack of credibility. So instead, Lilley recited something from the bible.Come the end, a scrum rapidly surrounded Rees-Mogg, who did his best to persuade reporters that everything was going totally to plan. Apart from the bits that weren’t. The madness becomes ever madder. Even Labour organises better coups than this. Davis tried to use the fracas to escape the scene unnoticed before anyone could ask him if he had written a letter, only to find he had left his briefcase behind a pillar and had to fight his way back in to get it. The end of the end of the pier show."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2e2a911bff70f5927071218c1c82b3260c6afff5/0_119_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=13d220b19ff3e0e27e27f923a84eac99","title":"lords committee defends decision to suspend anthony lester","story":"Sexual harassment case was ‘dealt with according to principles of natural justice’A House of Lords committee that suspended a Liberal Democrat peer who it found had sexually harassed a women’s right campaigner has defended its decision, after the upper house voted to block the punishment.The privileges and conduct committee, which announced last week that it was suspending Anthony Lester after finding that he tried to pressure Jasvinder Sanghera into having sex with him by promising her a peerage, said its inquiry into the matter “accorded with the principles of natural justice and fairness”.The committee, which met to discuss its next steps after a debate in the Lords last Thursday to confirm the planned suspension until June 2022, instead voted to accept an amendment from a fellow lawyer and friend of Lester, David Pannick, saying the process had been unfair. The move prompted Sanghera, a longtime campaigner against forced marriages, to say she felt “victimised all over again”.Female peers complained about the tone of the debate, which saw Pannick and others question why Sanghera had been cordial to Lester after the alleged harassment. On Tuesday, more than 70 Lords staff wrote to the Times saying they were “dismayed” by the vote.After the committee met on Tuesday, its chair, the former Labour MP John McFall, said the members – who include the Tory, Labour and Lib Dem leaders in the Lords – “reconfirmed its view that the process undertaken to investigate Lord Lester’s behaviour accorded with the principles of natural justice and fairness”.McFall said the investigation into Lester by Lucy Scott-Moncrieff, the upper house’s commissioner for standards, “was carried out entirely in line with the House of Lords code of conduct under which the complainant, Jasvinder Sanghera, made her compliant, and which all members sign up to at the start of each parliament”.Allies of Lester have argued that the system was flawed because it did not allow for the peer, or his representative, to cross-examine Sanghera on her evidence.The committee, McFall said, “will reflect on the amendment passed in the house last Thursday and the points raised in the debate and we will bring a further report to the house that more fully explains our position as soon as possible”.Sanghera had told the inquiry that the harassment took place 12 years ago after she attended a meeting at the Lords and missed her evening train. Lester, now 82, suggested that she stay at his London home.He groped her thigh while driving her to the house and made suggestive remarks, she said. The next morning, when his wife had left, Lester chased Sanghera around the kitchen, she said.It was at a later meeting at the Lords, she said, that Lester made the offer to make her a baroness. She told the inquiry: “He even spelled it out, putting my surname in, and asked me how that sounded.”The report said Sanghera provided six witnesses, among them a judge, who were able to say she had described the events immediately after she said they had taken place.The debate about the suspension saw Pannick note that after the alleged harassment, Sanghera had written to Lester “in affectionate terms” in a book she gave him, saying this was inconsistent with her claims."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6fa7633f5948be93a68fc073862c43ffabeac081/0_89_4134_2480/master/4134.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=253a0bacbc3889830297c1d2c81ca61c","title":"theresa may brexiters customs plan irish border solution","story":"Facing pressure from rebels, PM puts technological model back on cabinet tableTheresa May has offered a sop to rebellious hard Brexiters by suggesting technological solutions previously dismissed by No 10 could ultimately be used to maintain an invisible border between the UK and Ireland.The unexpected change arose on Tuesday during a two-and-a-half hour cabinet meeting at which, the prime minister’s spokesman said, ministers had discussed “the potential for alternative arrangements to avoid a hard border” in Ireland.The spokesman said one of the alternative arrangements “could involve technological solutions” – a suggestion reminiscent of the “maximum facilitation” model pushed by hard Brexiters but ditched by No 10 earlier this year.May’s decision to put it back on the table comes as she tries desperately to prevent rebellious Tory MPs from sending in enough letters to the party’s backbench 1922 Committee to trigger a confidence vote.The number of letters publicly submitted to the committee chairman, Graham Brady, declaring no confidence in May had stalled at 26 on Monday, well short of the 48 needed, though Eurosceptic MPs have insisted more have been submitted privately.Earlier on Tuesday, Jacob Rees-Mogg called on Tory backbenchers to push for a vote of no confidence immediately, otherwise May would remain in post for years. “I think it is now or the prime minister will lead the Conservatives into the next election,” he said.May is due to head to Brussels on Wednesday afternoon for further negotiations with Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president, on the final political declaration for the future relationship between the UK and the EU.No 10 would not say when the declaration would be published, although both it and the already published legally binding withdrawal agreement could be signed off in Brussels at a special European summit on Sunday.A pamphlet published by the thinktank Global Britain and the European Research Group restated the case for “max-fac” on Tuesday morning, a model under which customs checks enabled by technology happen away from borders.No 10 had previously rejected it after tax chiefs warned it could cost up to £20bn a year to implement. There was also widespread scepticism outside pro-Brexit circles that the technology was ready.But with May under intense political pressure, No 10 said it was “looking at what alternative arrangements might exist” and hoped one of them could eliminate the need for the Northern Ireland backstop.The UK and the EU hope to reach a long-term, free-trade deal to avoid a hard border returning between Northern Ireland and Ireland. The previously stated alternatives to that involve extending the transition period beyond 2020, or deploying the backstop, which is unpopular on the Tory right and with the Democratic Unionist party in Northern Ireland, which props up May’s government.At a morning lobby briefing for journalists, the spokesman said: “I think there was discussion in cabinet about the fact that the withdrawal agreement recognises and keeps open the potential for alternative arrangements to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland.EU officials have insisted that the price of having an all-UK customs union as a backstop was that it would be a “bridge” to the future relationship, as laid out in the jointly published outline of the political declaration, as this was the only legal way to include such an arrangement in the withdrawal agreement.“The condition for having the single customs territory is, we said, that is the starting point for the future customs negotiations.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/92361abc1043d27ff9fd6186913c815f67ac5953/0_0_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6c9db6b9f7ce07d6bdb53613fe1f6be3","title":"brexit dup defends not backing may on budget saying consequences were inevitable politics live","story":"Rolling coverage of the day’s political developments as they happenBut after his meeting with Sturgeon, the Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable said his priority was getting support for a second referendum. He said:I made it explicitly clear to the SNP and others that the priority must be stepping up efforts to build the momentum for a People’s Vote. That has been the priority for the Liberal Democrats for over two years, and it remains so. I am glad the other opposition parties were today able to agree to work together to achieve a people’s vote, including the option to remain in the EU.Meanwhile, Labour is missing in action. They claim to want a general election before a people’s vote, but are making no moves to get one. Jeremy Corbyn cannot continue to court both sides of this debate - it is time to decide.That’s all from me for today.Thanks for the comments. Jeremy Corbyn did not vote in the ision last night where the DUP voted with Labour, and the government won by just five votes. (See 9.26am.) As my colleague Heather Stewart reports, some Labour sources are saying that his absence was not agreed.My colleague Jessica Elgot says the word is he was at home.Corbyn is not the only party leader to face embarrassment for missing a close vote. The same thing happened to the Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable earlier this year.David Henig, a trade expert and former civil servant who is now director of the UK Trade Policy Project, has written a Twitter thread assessing the ERG report on customs policy published earlier today. He is not particularly impressed.At the 2017 general election the nationalist SDLP and the Ulster Unionists both lost the few seats they had in parliament, leaving all the seats in the hands of the DUP and Sinn Fein, apart from one independent. But Sinn Fein don’t take their seven seats, and as a result almost all the parliamentarians you see at Westminster speaking on behalf of Northern Ireland are from the DUP. The fact that the Northern Ireland assembly has been suspended for almost two years does not help either. It is easy to come away with the impression that the DUP are the unanimous political voice of Northern Ireland.Here is Aodhan Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, on the story.Read more at: https:www.newsletternewsbrexit-sammy-wilson-says-ufu-and-business-leaders-are-puppets-of-ni-office-1-8711528My colleague Peter Walker is just back from the Downing Street afternoon lobby briefing.On the World at One Sarah Wollaston, the Conservative chair of the Commons health committee and a former GP, said that she and doctors in the Commons would be tabling an “informed consent” amendment to the government motion approving the Brexit deal. She said this would make Brexit conditional on the public approving it in a second referendum.I don’t think we have informed consent from the public to this particular version of Brexit. I’m going to be bringing forward an amendment that actually asks the public what they think of this version of Brexit. ‘Is this the Brexit that you had in mind when you voted over two years ago?’Wollaston said that, under her plan, the referendum would involve a choice between May’s Brexit deal and staying in the EU.She has given more details about her plan in an article for the BMJ, jointly written with the Labour MP and former GP Paul Williams. They say:It is not acceptable for MPs to sit on the sidelines claiming that the people have already delivered their verdict. Without informed consent there is no valid consent.The best way to give legal weight for a referendum on the final deal would be through amending the approval motion to make this conditional on a referendum. If the motion is approved without amendment, there are no binding mechanisms to introduce a “people’s vote” at a later stage. It is highly risky to rely on collapsing the government or forcing a No Deal Brexit as preconditions for supporting a referendum. The reality of the Parliamentary arithmetic is that there can be no referendum unless Labour supports one. Most Labour members do, but unequivocal front bench support for the “informed consent” amendment will be needed for it to pass.With less than 140 days to go until we could chaotically crash out of the EU without a deal, it is time for all MPs to take responsibility for avoiding the consequences.My colleague Dan Sabbagh has more on Wollaston’s plan here.The DUP is expected to abstain again on votes on the finance bill, instead of supporting the government as it is supposed to on budget measures under the confidence and supply agreement, the BBC’s Emma Vardy reports.Yesterday the House of Commons library put out a briefing paper on the extra £1bn going to Northern Ireland as a result of the confidence and supply agreement between the Tories and the DUP, the same deal that is now looking distinctly threadbare in the light of the DUP’s decision not to vote with the government on the finance bill last night.

The £1bn is due to be spent over five years and, according to the report, more than half of the cash (£570m) has yet to be spent.These, from the Spectator’s James Forsyth, are interesting.Nicola Sturgeon, the SNP leader and Scottish first minister, has now held meetings at Westminster with Jeremy Corbyn, the Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable, the Green MP Caroline Lucas and the Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price.After the meetings a spokesperson for Sturgeon said:These discussions were worthwhile and it is clear that we are united in our opposition to the prime minister’s Brexit deal, which puts jobs and living standards at risk. We agreed that we will not be boxed into supporting no deal.The SNP has consistently said we will work with other parties to prevent a damaging Brexit - and we will continue to do so.Commenting on the meeting with Corbyn, a Labour spokesperson said:Jeremy Corbyn had a constructive meeting with Scottish first minister Nicola Sturgeon. They discussed their common opposition to Theresa May’s botched Brexit deal and determination to work across parliament to prevent a disastrous no deal outcome.And, after the Plaid meeting, Price said:Plaid Cymru and the SNP have been consistent and clear, the least damaging exit from the EU means staying in the single market and customs union. We will continue to work together to make sure the voices of Welsh and Scottish people are heard in Westminster.We simply cannot sit back and let our respective nations face the harm the Westminster government is intent on causing by ripping us out of these economic pillars of Europe.The Westminster government is shedding cabinet ministers and refusing to change course.To paraphrase the prime minister, we have three options left – bad deal, no deal or no Brexit. It is only Labour that seem intent that the last option should not be perused.The Labour leadership must now come to its senses and work with Plaid Cymru and the SNP to find a way out of this Brexit madness.If you want some relief from Brexit - and who doesn’t? - this story, from my colleague Rajeev Syal, is lovely, and well worth reading.It is worth reminding readers that HMRC said earlier this year that “max fac” could cost British business up to £20bn a year.We have emphasised from the start the importance of having some transition between the current arrangements and the ultimate arrangements.So we welcome the transition arrangements in the withdrawal agreement ... and take note of the possibility of extending that transition period.According to the BBC’s Europe editor, Katya Adler, Theresa May is not going to have much chance to alter the text of what the EU agrees on the framework for the future relationship later this week. A seven-page outline (pdf) has already been published, but a longer version is being drafted, to go alongside the text of the withdrawal agreement that is now regarded as finalised.Here are some more quotes from Jacob Rees-Mogg, the chair of the European Research Group, which represents Tory MP pushing for a harder Brexit. He was speaking to journalists after the ERG briefing earlier.I would wait and see about that. You speak to Tory MPs and find Tory MPs who say they are really keen that Theresa May should lead us into the next general election?Basically, if there is a vote of confidence it is not just for a year. Getting the 48 letters has shown to be quite difficult, so the idea that in a year you just repeat the process and then she would go at that point I don’t think that is realistic. I think it is now or the prime minister will lead the Conservatives into the next election.You find MPs privately who will say to you they think that is a really good idea in any number and I would be quite surprised.This is interesting, because it is a new argument from Rees-Mogg as to why MPs should support him in voting against May. He is widening the issue beyond Brexit, which could be seen as recognition that she won’t be defeated in a confidence vote purely on Brexit grounds.I have suggested something and not everybody has wanted to do it. That’s political life.I felt I ought to go public because I have previously been so supportive of the prime minister. When I came to the conclusion that you couldn’t separate the person and the policy, I felt I had no choice but to write my own letter of no confidence.The government has put forward its proposal. It will have to bring it to a vote. There are many people who expect to oppose the deal in the vote and they think that is the time to write letters, not now, and that is a perfectly reasonable thing to do."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/77238d5718397af40ece653337c518bc79672961/0_0_6585_3951/master/6585.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d4e6364e64efa301d93c46b2054cc57c","title":"un poverty expert philip alston amber rudd","story":"Philip Alston says minister’s criticism of the tone of his austerity report ‘misses the point’The UN expert on extreme poverty has hit back at the new work and pensions secretary, Amber Rudd, after she complained that the tone of his report into the consequences of austerity in the UK was “highly inappropriate”.Philip Alston urged Rudd to instead follow some of his recommendations to make the welfare system “more humane” rather than dismissing the powerful language in his report examining the impact of cuts and welfare reforms, including universal credit, as “extraordinarily political”, as she did in the Commons on Monday.Alston, the UN special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, told the : “I think that dismissing a report that is full of statistics and first-hand testimony on the grounds that the minister didn’t appreciate the tone of the report rather misses the point. I remain hopeful that Amber Rudd might actually take some of the steps needed to address the worst aspects of the existing approach.”After a two-week fact-finding trip across the UK, Alston concluded on Friday that the government had inflicted “great misery” on its people with “punitive, mean-spirited, and often callous” austerity policies driven by a political desire to undertake social re-engineering rather than economic necessity. “Poverty is a political choice,” he said.The 24-page report was roundly dismissed by Conservatives. A government spokesperson said it “completely disagreed” with Alston’s findings, while the junior Brexit minister, Kwasi Kwarteng, told the BBC: “I don’t know who this UN man is, I don’t know where he’s been.”Mel Stride, a Treasury minister, said he was “rather disappointed” with the picture Alston had painted of Britain, while Rudd attacked “the extraordinary political nature of his language”, which “was wholly inappropriate and discredited a lot of what he was saying”.“They should get out of their cars,” she said. “They are turning a blind eye. I was very happy with his report. He took the time to speak to everybody. He didn’t ask leading questions. He was fact-finding and the facts speak for themselves. If they are going to ignore the facts, I don’t see any way out of poverty and the food banks.”Mike Burgess, who runs the Phoenix Detached Youth Project in North Shields, where poverty led to riots in 1991, said of the government: “They are not in the real world. They are people who have no idea what is going on. Poverty is political. When you are suffering, you are going to get angry about it. What the UN envoy saw was anger. These people shield themselves from the anger and suffering.”He said the government’s dismissal of Alston’s report was effectively a dismissal of the people who testified to him. “They are in denial of what they are doing to people and it is more convenient to shoot the messenger,” he said.Zahra Alipour, 18, from Ealing, who met Alston last week to talk about her experience of poverty, said: “It’s a shame that Amber Rudd wants to deny our truth, although it is probably easier for her to dismiss the facts than to help fix them. The delusional approach she’s taking is absurd. Maybe she should try and be honest with herself and others too. I hope the government can now rectify and make a similar effort as Mr Alston to listen to how their policies are impacting on people.”But it responded with a barrage of other statistics, some of which were five years old. It said income inequality remained lower than in 2010 and that there were 637,000 fewer children growing up in workless households. He concluded: “There are a number of steps that could be taken simply through instructions provided by the minister to DWP that would make the system much more humane. I’m hoping that actions will speak louder than words.”Alston will deliver a fuller version of his report to the UN human rights council in Geneva next year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5cc0a6ac96e195999059dbf9493e418e7c931f57/285_684_6128_3679/master/6128.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b72a60ca6d91b7f0f3c90df4d4dcfa7f","title":"a liquid catapult big wave surfer returns to scene of nightmare wipeout","story":"Andrew Cotton, who broke his back on a huge wave at Nazaré in Portugal in 2017, prepares to scale the notorious peaks againLooking out from the jagged headland at Nazaré in Portugal, the Atlantic Ocean below looks tranquil. Baby waves – or so they seem from above – peel left across the town’s northern beach and there’s barely a sign that this stretch of water is considered one of the most monstrous surf spots in the world.“It’s impossible to visualise it on a day like today when it’s beautiful and sunny but sometimes it gets big out there and sometimes it gets to the next level, beyond the realms ...” says the surfer Andrew Cotton, tapering off as he considers how best to describe the 60ft wave that flattened him exactly a year ago. “It’s like moving mountains,” he adds.“It’s disorganised, it’s really tricky to surf, there are peaks everywhere, you get these crazy, crazy teepees with loads of energy, and when the waves break right in front of the lighthouse it’s like woah! Without doubt it’s the riskiest spot in the world to surf.”Cotton knows first-hand about the risks at Nazaré, where a deep offshore canyon funnels the ocean towards the headland and, during certain winter swells, creates waves up to seven storeys high.Last November, the 36-year-old Devon surfer was hit on the head by a mammoth wave before being spat 20ft into the air, the momentum eventually slamming him down onto the surface of the ocean with such force that it broke his back.It was dubbed a “liquid catapult into space” by the World Surf League big wave awards. Cotton remembers it all with eerie detail.“When I was checking the swell that morning I was seeing giant, perfect lefts,” he says. “I mind-surfed them and I knew exactly what I wanted from the day: I wanted to be in a 60ft barrel. Getting barrelled at three feet is amazing but getting barrelled at 60ft, that’s the dream.“It was probably my fourth wave of the day and I was like, ‘this is it, I’m going to send it’, but it went from being the best wave I’d ever seen to being possibly the worst. Suddenly I knew the lip wasn’t going to throw out as far as I expected. I could see it feathering above me so I hit the eject button and jumped off.“I never jump off my board,” he stresses, the panic recounted in his voice, “but instincts just took over”. The moments that followed were amongst the strangest of his surfing career.“I’ve fallen off my board a lot in the last 30 years and this time was weird, like nothing else,” he says. “I was having this weightless feeling and I thought maybe I was in the centre of the wave. I thought to myself ‘maybe I could’ve ridden this out’. And then bang! I landed so hard. When that impact happened I was like ‘I’m done’.”Was it painful? “Umm, yeah,” he says with bewilderment, as if the feeling was almost beyond register. “It was like jumping off the top of a building on to concrete.”Cotton was swept under by the ensuing white water and took a second, huge wave on the head before being rescued by his tow-surf partner, Hugo Vau. The pair eventually made it back to the beach, where Vau lost control of the jetski and spilled Cotton onto the sand, adding injury to injury. Needless to say, Cotton won the WSL Wipeout of the Year award.Having suffered an L2 vertebrae compression fracture, he was initially unable to walk. “At first I was on pain killers and I was like ‘it’s not that bad’,” he recalls. “But after a few days they put a body brace on me to see if I could stand up. I couldn’t even put my feet off the bed. Garrett (McNamara) and Hugo were there and I could see on their faces I’d really fucked up.”It has taken 12 months of intensive rehabilitation for Cotton to fully recover. As he wanders around the shipping hanger in Nazaré where Red Bull athletes keep their kit – where photos of past triumphs and remnants of broken boards decorate the walls – he’s feeling grateful to be back on his feet, back in town, back in the water.He checks his inflatable life vest and CO2 canisters, prepares the first aid kit which includes military-grade tourniquet dressings, and speaks of a mental comeback as much as a physical one.“Some days you go on internet binges looking at waves and all your mates having fun and you’re like, will I ever do that again?” he says. “I don’t think you know how much a wipeout like that changes you until you come back.“It would have been really easy to say ‘forget it’. I’ve got a family, I’m a qualified plumber, I’ve got other stuff going on in my life. Plumbing can get pretty exciting if you’ve got a leak going on!Last week, in the first significant swell of the season, Cotton surfed waves that were around 40ft high. He suffered another wipeout, this time snapping his board in two instead of his back. That experience fortified his belief that he’s ready to scale Nazaré’s moving mountains again.“Of course there was fear when I first came back here,” he says. “I was nervous, shaking a little bit with the adrenalin, but I said to myself it’s a long winter, just build your way back slowly.”Over the coming months he hopes to set new benchmarks while “drawing exciting, critical lines”. And having towed McNamara into a then world record wave at Nazaré in 2011 – the moment when Nazaré first caught global attention – Cotton is determined to add his own record to his ignominious wipeout award.On reflection, he muses: “Sometimes you have to endure the worst situation to get to experience the best.”• To find out more about Andrew Cotton, visit Redbull"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/85c4f3abbd48d4a7211bb2757879670cfd63e881/174_127_1636_981/master/1636.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2b20d059d67c56264f7c707d17d05300","title":"chris ashton ruled out of england test against australia due to calf injury","story":"Eddie Jones has lobbed a tantalising curveball in Australia’s direction by retaining Manu Tuilagi in his 26-man squad for this Saturday’s Test at Twickenham, barely 24 hours after the head coach described the centre as “very doubtful” and suggested England would not rush him back prematurely.With England not due to confirm their lineup until Thursday, Jones is clearly happy to keep the Wallabies’ management guessing as to whether the 27-year-old, who has not started a Test since 2014, will feature. Sources at his club, Leicester, believe there is a good chance Tuilagi will be involved this weekend, however, assuming he comes through Wednesday’s afternoon’s training unscathed.Should England ignore their own advice and rush Tuilagi back into the fray there is every chance of a major row if he subsequently returns injured to Leicester. Had England released him back to his club on Tuesday night, however, Tigers would have been within their rights to consider him for their Premiership game at home to Saracens on Sunday given that an England team spokesman confirmed on Tuesday night he was “in contention” for the Australia game.The vision of a fully fit Tuilagi back at his rampaging best has been a recurring dream for English rugby fans ever since he left the All Blacks trailing in his wake at Twickenham six years ago. Jones is as keen as anyone to welcome the big man back but not until the moment is absolutely right. “I don’t think we should over-hype his entry back in the England side,” he cautioned last month. “It’s been a long time and he’s played a couple of good games for Leicester.”Tuilagi’s increasingly confident display against Scarlets in the European Champions’ Cup last month made his teammates sit up and Ben Youngs, England’s scrum-half, was among those who felt it marked a turning point after years of injury setbacks. “Everyone just watched him that night and thought: ‘He’s back,’” said Youngs. “Australia have got Israel Folau: a game-changer who can make something out of nothing and win you a game with the last play. Manu is that person for England.”The Wallabies will be spared a reunion with Chris Ashton, however, following confirmation the Sale winger will be sidelined for a couple of weeks with a calf injury he sustained in Saturday’s 35-15 win over Japan. It could mean another opportunity for Bath’s Joe Cokanasiga, a try-scorer on his Test debut last Saturday, although Jack Nowell and Jonny May are also among the 26 players still in Bagshot.With England keen to end the Quilter series with a resounding win, the forwards coach Steve Borthwick acknowledged that Cokanasiga had impressed against Japan. “Joe did really well. He’s got massive potential and is really eager to learn. Physically he’s got some great attributes and attitude-wise he wants to be the best he can be.” Ted Hill, who also won his first cap last weekend, has been released back to his club Worcester but Wasps’ Nathan Hughes and Bath’s Elliott Stooke have been retained."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8d79b2a37127a83c6f7693a858305dcba97c8227/276_928_3251_1951/master/3251.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8ad7460ecfa44f295572920f7c45b00d","title":"ecb funding build network 2000 female coaches mentors cricket","story":"Six months after unveiling its ambitious South Asian Engagement Plan, the England and Wales Cricket Board has secured £1.2m of lottery funding to develop a network of 2,000 volunteer female coaches and mentors over the next four years.Ostensibly the funding will be used to expand and maintain a female volunteer network in seven of its 10 targeted cities that have a high South Asian population – Birmingham, Bradford, London, Leeds, Leicester, Manchester and Nottingham – and will be rolled out as part of the ECB’s All Stars Cricket programme for five to eight year olds.Jenny Betteridge, Sport England’s strategic lead for volunteering, said: “We know that if you consistently don’t see people like you volunteering in sport and physical activity it is very difficult to think of that sport as something for you. That’s why attracting those who don’t normally volunteer has the potential to change the face of community sport across the country.”Encouraging more girls and women to play cricket is just one of 11 goals in the South Asian Engagement Plan, which was published in May. Progress elsewhere includes the installation of 64 non-turf pitches and 14 turf pitches in the targeted cities – the first of 1,000 planned by 2024 – as well an expansion of the ECB’s City T20 Cup to 16 regions.Leyton Cricket Club in east London has also been chosen as the pilot venue for the ECB’s new Urban Cricket Centres – indoor community facilities – 20 of which will be created in the most erse urban areas of the country."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1502016176b075b4fa2588ef3128c988c431fa72/0_339_4128_2477/master/4128.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a9a5d8c2f79e3a46024b744c59397bc4","title":"jonny bairstow england sri lanka ben foakes","story":"English cricketers do not get dropped as often as they used to be. For example Alastair Cook, Marcus Trescothick and Kevin Pietersen (if we restrict this to purely cricketing criteria) were never dropped from the Test team.This is not always a good thing but the modern thread of consistency is better than the insecurity of previous generations when so many England cricketers turned up for a Test match on the assumption that it might well be their last. Joe Root was dropped for the Sydney Test of January 2014 and it galvanised him to make sure that this never happened again. Ian Bell was jettisoned after the Sabina Park match of February 2009 and before long he returned a more dedicated cricketer. Something similar applied to Andrew Strauss in 2007. A bit of time for contemplation and reassessment can often be a good thing and the best players always return. Even Ricky Ponting was dropped.In this series, two talismanic English cricketers – Stuart Broad and Jonny Bairstow – have been overlooked without doing anything wrong. And the signs are that they are both responding in the most appropriate manner. They do not need to agonise too much since their form has not disintegrated. They just have to see the bigger picture and bide their time. They appear to be doing that. Curiously even without playing – or because they are not playing and not sulking – their standing within the squad may actually be enhanced.It has been a tough three months for Bairstow in particular, culminating in his omission at Pallekele when he was deemed fit to play. Untimely injuries have upset a smooth career path. So how has he reacted? “I just went out there and trained hard,” he says. “Just to try to get back in the team. That’s what I want to do. It’s difficult. No one wants to be not playing. The last two and a half years I’ve been in the team and I was in the top 10 batters in the world – and then you’re not playing. But … that’s part and parcel of sport. It’s good for the squad with such competition for places.“It’s all about how you react to it. You react by going away, working hard, training hard and doing the right things around the guys because you don’t want to be sulking around them and not helping the lads out. If you’re sapping the energy from the group, that’s not a good thing.”Has he ever known an England side with so many players pushing to get in the final XI? “Well, yes. The one-day side. When we got to No 1 in the world we had exactly the same situation.” Currently it is Alex Hales, a proven performer, who is the unlucky man to be missing out now that Bairstow himself has superseded him as an opening batsman.In the Test arena Bairstow understands his current plight with Ben Foakes as the preferred keeper but he does not accept that this will always be the situation. “You don’t want to accept that. You don’t know what’s around the corner. So I’m still working on both my primary skills just as I’ve done for the last three years. You don’t know how the make-up of sides works or how injuries happen. So yes, I’m working on all my skills.” Which means that his wicketkeeping gloves are still at the top of the cricket bag.However, one suspects he is also buying into the new outlook. “At the end of the day you want your best 11 players and then to find how those players fit into your team,” he says. This hints at a new flexibility among the management and in the mind of Bairstow, who will surely do anything and bat anywhere to get back into the team.In fact no one doubts Bairstow and Broad will be playing again soon, though it is unlikely that both can return in Colombo even though Sam Curran seems unlikely to be fit for the final Test. Yet both appear to be coping with their temporary demotions in exemplary style. The England team invited some old players to join them in a fundraising quiz on Monday evening and there was Broad to the fore in the Jeremy PaxmanAlexander Armstrong role as one of the question-masters while Bairstow enthusiastically tried to keep his team in the race, cunningly feigning ignorance when he was the answer to one of the questions. There was much laughter and no sulking.

Gareth McLean reflects on 20 years of the League and speaks to the gents themselvesby  Gareth McLean Photographs by  Sarah LeeSince The League of Gentlemen graced the cover of  Weekend 17 years ago (and were interviewed by yours truly), Jeremy Dyson, Mark Gatiss, Steve Pemberton and Reece Shearsmith have been keeping themselves busy. Inidually, the trio have written and performed in Doctor Who, Psychoville, Inside No 9 and Sherlock. But the League still looms large. In the hearts of the British public, Royston Vasey residents found a home, however unlikely that seemed, given the monstrous, macabre or murderous natures of many. From Tubbs and Edward, Pauline, Ross and Mickey, to the Dentons, Papa Lazarou and Les McQueen, there’s someone for everyone in Royston Vasey. Gay, straight or bi, give us a try. And that, I think, is what The League of Gentlemen is about, at least in part. The British have an obsession with community, and television a consequent preoccupation in (re)creating it – however illusory, idealised and, ultimately, isolating that idea is. The imagined standards with which we are forever presented as to what makes a “good” or typical community do not accord with reality that then feels defective – yet we tend to blame reality for falling short, not the idealised version for selling us a lie. The League of Gentlemen spoke to that frustration. As far as I can tell, Dyson, Gatiss, Pemberton and Shearsmith haven’t changed that much in 17 years. At heart, they’re still the (self-described) socially awkward, cheerfully morbid, wildly imaginative boys they’ve always been but they are also the men they were, but more so. Now they fill the likes of the Edinburgh Playhouse and the Hammersmith Apollo. It is, as Les McQueen might say, a shit business.“The appearance of Lazarou was always a great moment in the show. He arrived with a bit of misdirection – as people did not expect him to have been ordained to bishop!” Reece Shearsmith“I never regretted playing Plop Plop, as I felt it needed to be a ‘performance’ in itself: ‘skin work’, as it’s called. But it took discipline not to panic once I was entombed in the outfit.” Reece Shearsmith“Reverend Bernice was great fun to play. As with the last tour, we decided that she would return to her role as Agony Aunt and be on hand to impart her particular no-nonsense words of wisdom.” Reece Shearsmith“This photo depicts Steve and me at the start of act two. We have just been given a one-minute warning and so as you can see, our noses are going up with the sellotape.” Reece Shearsmith“Pauline’s lipstick is like Poirot’s moustache – the character just isn’t there until it’s applied. Makeup maestro Liv would slather on the lipgloss, then it’s one quick pout and she’s off (Pauline, not Liv).” Steve Pemberton“The dinner suits were our uniform, a blank canvas we could use to conjure up any characters we wanted. In this scene Ollie Plimsoles has written a play about his favourite subject: himself. We wanted to romp through a ‘greatest hits’ of Legz Akimbo Theatre Company, as well as highlight Ollie’s take on the past 70 years of British theatre. It was a thrilling end to the first half of the show and one of my favourite bits to perform.” Steve Pemberton“I’m so very fond of Les McQueen. He is based on someone real but he’s also very representative of a lot of people’s thwarted ambitions. He was nearly there. Eurovision (heats). He’s a total chump but his unflagging optimism keeps him going and going and going.” Mark Gatiss“I love that in this picture Reece appears to be the real Edward. It’s a genuinely creepy image. Smiling through shark’s teeth. I suppose that sort of sums ups the show ...” Mark Gatiss“This (last) photo makes me think of Hilda Ogden handling Stan’s glasses after he died in Coronation Street. The original stage Tubbs never wore glasses, but they were useful for hiding the wig gauze which we used on TV to pull the nose up.” Steve Pemberton“This sketch which was conceived as being a sort of Ultimate Dentons – a riff on an old live favourite that would play on the audience’s expectations of what they were going to see.

You, the British people, have our soul,” she added.Hoa Hakananai’a was taken without permission in 1868 by the British frigate HMS Topaze, captained by Richard Powell, and given to Queen Victoria.The British Museum has faced numerous claims to return artefacts to the countries they originate from, including the Parthenon marbles to Greece and the Benin Bronzes to Nigeria.The Rapa Nui people, who last year gained self-administration over their ancestral lands on Easter Island, have launched a campaign to recover what they consider as one of the most important statues of the nearly 900 scattered across the South Pacific island.With its scowling eyes, straight-lined mouth and paunchy profile, the monolith stands at the entrance to a gallery in the British Museum.The moai is distinguished by carvings on the back depicting the island’s birdman cult and other ceremonial aspects of Easter Island’s enigmatic past.The Rapa Nui believe it brought peace to the island, around the year 1000, ending inter-tribal wars.After the meeting, Ward said he was optimistic but cautioned that the campaign for the return of the statue would be a long one.“This is the first of many conversations we will have,” he told reporters at the museum.“We are looking forward to the next, and probably the second one will be in Rapa Nui (Easter Island), where we invited the authorities of the museum.”It is the first time that the British Museum, which holds cultural treasures from around the globe, has agreed to hold talks about the statue. But on Tuesday the museum was talking only of a loan, not the return, on the artefact.“The museum is one of the world’s leading lenders and the trustees will always consider loan requests subject to usual conditions,” a spokeswoman said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/89ba100df04782dc8ee832eebb591a6ef54f296c/0_0_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5ba15243b55e8d51762b37b9d08bbf06","title":"how populism emerged as electoral force in europe","story":"Populism is spreading across the continent but has different characteristics by region• Revealed: one in four Europeans votes populistJan Kavan was one of the students who led the ill-fated pro-democracy uprising known as the Prague spring 50 years ago. He went on to be an MP and a senator, foreign secretary and deputy prime minister, and president of the UN general assembly. Now 72, there is not much in politics he has not seen. “Populism of a kind,” he said, “has existed for as long as there have been politicians. It wins elections. But there’s populism and populism. And some of the ‘pure populism’ we see now ... it didn’t exist here even 10 years ago.”The number of Europeans ruled by a government with at least one populist in cabinet has increased from 12.5 million to 170 million. This has been blamed on everything from recession to migration, social media to globalisation.The Czech Republic demonstrates that the factors behind populism’s surge are both far more complex and infinitely more varied than first thought, and that a voter’s decision to cast their ballot for a populist party is just as often a reflection of psychological state as of circumstances and identity.Populists tend to frame politics as a battle between the virtuous \u0027ordinary\u0027 masses and a nefarious or corrupt elite – and insist that the general will of the people must always triumph.  is adopting the classic definition of populism proposed by political scientist Cas Mudde. Populism, he says, is often combined with a \u0027host\u0027 ideology, which can either be on the left or right.Against the backdrop of increasing populist vote share and influence, the  is launching a six-month investigative series to explore who the new populists are, what factors brought them to power, and what they are doing once in office.“Here, there has been no harsh economic crisis, no big shifts in society,” said Martin Mejstrik of Charles University in Prague. “This is one of the most developed and successful post-communist states. There are, literally, almost no migrants. And nonetheless, people are dissatisfied.”Postwar populists found an early toehold in Europe in Alpine countries with long histories of nationalist or far-right tendencies. The exclusionist, small-government Swiss People’s party (SVP), rooted in “authentic” rural resistance to urban and foreign influence, led a referendum defeat of Switzerland’s bid to join the EEA in 1992, and has swayed national policy since. The Swiss party practically invented rightwing populism’s “winning formula”: nationalist demands on immigration, hostility towards neoliberalism and a fierce focus on preserving national traditions and sovereignty. It helps of course that Switzerland is also a magnet for the “international elite”, symbolised by Davos, banking secrecy and a spray of UN headquarters.Italy, another country with a history of radical rightwing politics, voted four times for the populist Silvio Berlusconi. But for the rest of the 1990s, the tendency remained confined to this central troika, each with their own political peculiarities. The tide started to turn with the turn of the century. The political landscape in the Netherlands was shaken up in 2002 with the rapid rise of the populist Pim Fortuyn, and then by his assassination. That same year, Jean-Marie Le Pen of the far-right Front National rocked France by reaching a presidential runoff vote. Twice in 2005, referendums in France and the Netherlands rejected a draft EU constitution, seen at the time as victories for the “ordinary people” against the European elite.In 2008 came the financial crisis and recession. As many people, particularly in southern Europe, saw living standards shrink, the centrist parties that had governed hitherto – and the Eurocrats in Brussels with their clipboard austerity – became an obvious target.In Italy, decades of corruption, mismanagement and the impact of the 2015 refugee crisis resulted in the anti-establishment, tax-and-spend Five Star Movement sweeping to power last year in an unlikely coalition with the far-right, anti-immigration League.More recently, western Europe’s solid inner circle has started to succumb to the populist wave. In Germany, the far-right, anti-immigration Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) – founded in direct response to Chancellor Angela Merkel’s assertion at the height of the financial crisis that there was “no alternative” to the EU bailing out Greece – has 92 seats in the Bundestag.Le Pen’s daughter Marine made the second round of France’s presidential elections in 2017. Perhaps as remarkable as that, her first-round score was little higher than that of Jean-Luc Mélenchon of the surging populist leftwing group La France Insoumise. In the Netherlands, Geert Wilders’ anti-Islam Freedom party (PVV) has risen to become the second-largest parliamentary force.Both parties only started showing their true colours – populist, culturally conservative, authoritarian – after they were first elected. They are now attacking core liberal institutions such as the independent judiciary and free press, increasingly defining national identities in terms of ethnicity and religion and demonising opponents, such as the Hungarian-born Jewish financier George Soros, in language reminiscent of the 1930s.Mainstream Nordic parties have long resisted forming coalition governments with rightwing populists, but have been forced to give ground in Norway, where the Progress party has been in government coalitions since 2013, and Finland, where the small Blue Reform party – an offshoot of the populist Finns – is also in coalition.Across Europe, rightwing populist parties have also succeeded in influencing policy even when they are not in government, with parties such as Britain’s Ukip, the Sweden Democrats, the Danish People’s party, the PVV and the AfD dragging the discourse of their countries’ dominant centre-right parties to the right on subjects such as immigration. Populist progress has been accompanied almost everywhere by a profound redrawing of Europe’s postwar political landscape and a continuing fragmentation of national votes. As the big mainstream parties of government have shrunk, the smaller parties – some of them populist but by no means all – have been getting steadily bigger.Ano means “Yes” in Czech, but is also an acronym for for Akce nespokojených občanů, or Action of Dissatisfied Citizens. The party was founded and is still led by Andrej Babiš, the Czech Republic’s second-wealthiest citizen, worth an estimated £2.7bn, who owns two of the country’s biggest newspapers and was finance minister in the previous coalition government.So what persuaded Czech voters to become a part of Europe’s populist surge? Underscoring populism’s many national nuances and variations, Babiš – despite facing damaging corruption allegations – presents as a successful outsider, a businessman who can get things done in the way that career politicians cannot.The Babiš pitch, said Vlastimil Havlík, a political scientist from Masaryk University in Brno, is that he has built “a big, highly successful corporation that he is a businessman untainted by a long career in politics and that he can simply run the place better – make people better off – than the corrupt, cack-handed politicians”. Adding to the populist appeal, Babiš is a good communicator and has no apparent ideology beyond national efficiency – and maintaining his own popularity. “He doesn’t have to be the best manager, just perceived as better than his rivals,” said Havlík.“First it was all: ‘These guys are thieves, they’ve stolen the country from you,’” said Ondřej Kolář, the young centre-right mayor of Prague’s sixth district. “Now it’s: ‘You can trust me, I will take care of your problems.’ And because the economy is doing well, he can afford pay rises for teachers, and public transport discounts for pensioners.”But the Czech Republic is a long way from becoming another Hungary or Poland, whose populist leaders are ramping up their efforts to turn courts into extensions of the executive and public radio stations into state propaganda outlets. These two countries represent a grim warning of what can happen when nationalist populists of a certain ilk come to power. For the time being, though, back in Prague, Kavan remains optimistic. “It’s true that a measure of populism wins elections,” he said. “But if these pure populists don’t combine it with something else, something real … Look, it’s simply not enough just to offer people a feeling that you are on their side. In the long term, you know, you have to offer real solutions.” Additional reporting by Paul Lewis in London.

But critics say that populists in power often subvert democratic norms, whether by undermining the media and judiciary or by trampling minority rights.Populists tend to frame politics as a battle between the virtuous \u0027ordinary\u0027 masses and a nefarious or corrupt elite – and insist that the general will of the people must always triumph.  is adopting the classic definition of populism proposed by political scientist Cas Mudde.

In order to track the success of populist parties in Europe, Rooduijn and the  worked with political scholars to examine hundreds of political parties and decide whether or not they were populist at different stages over the past 20 years. National election results since 1998 were then mapped on to the party definitions to show trends over time.The map shows how populism flickered across the continent in the late 1990s before really catching on in eastern Europe throughout the 2000s. It spread north in the immediate aftermath of the financial crisis before making substantial inroads in western Europe’s major powerhouses in the past three years.Europe is not alone in experiencing this rise: populists have been elected to executive office in five of the world’s seven biggest democracies: India, the US, Brazil, Mexico and the Philippines. Populist parties enjoyed success in Norway, Switzerland and Italy in the 1990s. But it was not until the turn of the century that populist ideas, legislators and challengers started to proliferate, from the Netherlands to France, Hungary to Poland.The research shows that leftwing populists, which in Europe are far less successful than their conservative counterparts, have begun increasing their share of the vote in national elections, giving rise to challenger parties such as Podemos in Spain and La France Insoumise. Claudia Alvares, an associate professor at Lusofona University in Lisbon, who was not involved in the  research project, said: “The success of such politicians has very much to do with their capacity to convince their audiences that they do not belong to the traditional political system. As such, they are on a par with the people to the extent that neither they nor the people belong to the ‘corrupt’ elites.”She said social media had a role to play in the rise of populism, its algorithmic model rewarding and promoting adversarial messages. “The anger that populist politicians manage to channel is fuelled by social media posts, because social media are very permeable to the easy spread of emotion. The end result is a rise in the polarisation of political and journalistic discourse.”While the overall trend in Europe shows a dramatic rise in populist vote share, the picture remains nuanced. In Belgium, for example, the populist Flemish nationalist party Vlaams Belang has been in decline for a decade. And populist parties that enter government – and are, of necessity, forced to compromise on their promises – can find life hard. Continent-wide, however, the picture is unambiguous: 12.5 million Europeans lived in a country with at least one populist cabinet member in 1998 in 2018, that has risen more than tenfold, to 170.2 million.As for the future, elections in the first half of 2019 will provide further scope to chart the rise and rise of populism, from Ukraine to Denmark, Finland to Belgium.“In the short term, populist parties will probably stay roughly this strong, although they will be even more clearly radical right and there will remain significant regional and national differences,” said Mudde. “The main question is how non-populist parties are responding.”To conduct the research, the  enlisted the help of more than 30 political scientists to assess which European parties could be considered populist, under academic definitions of the word, at various points over the past 20 years. Matthijs Rooduijn, a political sociologist at the University of Amsterdam, oversaw the project, and made the final decision on all party classifications.The full methodology can be found here along with the list of academics who reviewed the study.

File photograph:  Olivier HosletPool via ReutersMinister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney has told the Dáil the Brexit withdrawal agreement is “not going to be reopened”.Mr Coveney said it was not a draft and was not open for renegotiation.He told Fianna Fáil Brexit spokeswoman Lisa Chambers that the only document that would change was the political declaration about the future relationship between the EU and the UK.He also said that many people had been too quick to assume the worst. They should instead be looking at ways to talk it up and maximise support for the deal and that was what British prime minister Theresa May was doing.During questions on foreign affairs the Tánaiste said the document on the political declaration was expected to be at least 20 pages when the wording had been completed, which they expected to have later on Tuesday night or Wednesday evening. Mr Coveney said they had a “short, seven-page skeleton document last week”.But he stressed that even if EU leaders backed the agreement at their meeting in Brussels on Sunday, and if it was backed by a majority of MPs at Westminster, they had at least two to three years of negotiations ahead on the future relationship.The Brexit agreement is sensitive and difficult, he said. “It’s a compromise on both sides.”Ms Chambers had expressed concern that comments in the House of Commons last week suggested that this was not the final agreement and “certain aspects of it were only temporary”.The Tánaiste told her that “this is a text that has been agreed between the negotiations teams, it has been agreed by the British government. So to that extent, it is not a draft text, it now the text, and it is not going to be reopened.”But it was a process “where Ireland will continue to have to be vigilant to mitigate against unintended consequences of the fallout of Brexit”.He also warned that “many people have been far too quick to start jumping past the time when the parliament in Westminster makes the decision and are assuming the worst”.“We should not do that. We should spend the next couple of weeks explaining to people and reassuring them as to what is in the deal,” he said.“It is a good deal for Ireland, the UK and the EU. It captures the complexity of an economy the size of the UK leaving the European Union and tries to deal with a whole series of competing and complex questions to do with that.”“Instead of focusing on contingency after a failed vote in the House of Commons, we should be talking about how we talk this up to maximise the chances of it getting support in the House of Commons, which is what the prime minister is doing.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Gareth Chaney CollinsTaoiseach Leo Varadkar accused Mary Lou McDonald of “hobnobbing with the super-rich” in New York on Armistice day. He was responding in the Dáil to the Sinn Féin leader who had accused the Government of favouring the superrich while cutting flat rate expenses worth €100 a year for low paid workers.Ms McDonald said the Taoiseach claimed at his party’s ardfheis he would deliver five years of tax cuts but he never said that tens of thousands of low paid workers would lose their entitlement to flat rate expenses, worth an average of €100 a year from January 1st next year.She said the group affected included “people like panel beaters, kitchen porters, nurses and members of the Defence Forces”. She said “shop assistants, the group worst affected, some 75,822 will lose €120 a year and that’s a net saving to the exchequer of €9 million a year”.She said “ordinary workers fall to the bottom of the pile” of the Government’s priorities compared to the super wealthy.She also said there were nearly 500 people with wealth of €50 million and in 2015 that cohort “claimed €93 million in tax credits, a great multiple of that claimed by low paid workers”.She added that €45 million of that was for expenses such as furniture. Ending breaks for banks would deliver €175 million and ending tax breaks for multinationals for onshore intangible assets would raise €750 million.Mr Varadkar said it would have no impact on people’s incomes next year and would not come into effect until January 2020 “if at all”.The Taoiseach stressed “all employees will still be able to claim for vouched expenses” and said it was part of a move away from flat-rate to vouched expenses.Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe later confirmed in the Dáil that the Revenue Commissioners will carry out a review of tax relief on expenses next year but there will be no changes until January 2020.Some 80,000 workers were expected to lose the tax relief on flat rate, unvouched expenses and a majority of those workers, over 75,000 retail employees would lose an average of €120 a year, from January 1st next year.However during debate on the Finance Bill Mr Donohoe said “expenses that are wholly, exclusively and necessarily included for the purposes of work will continue to be claimable under the Tax Consolidation Act and that is not changing”.He said however that “the matter will be reviewed”. Revenue had told him that there would be no changes on how they implement this policy until January 2020, he said.Earlier Mr Varadkar criticised Ms McDonald and questioned Sinn Féin’s relationship with the superrich.Ms McDonald said that on November 14th she attended a remembrance day service at Sligo Grammar, an event all leaders were invited to, and paid her respects there.She said the Taoiseach’s response amplified his position on tax relief for corporates but a very different view was taken for retail workers.“Can you for once empathise and put yourself in the place of retail workers?”“We see Sinn Féin trying to claim that they can put themselves in the shop workers’ shoes, when we know for years and years and years they told porkies about their own salaries, that they were living on the average industrial wage.”He said the Government was clamping down on tax breaks and tax evasion left, right and centre, including the exit tax and closing off the double Irish.Mark Guilfoyle, president of Sinn Féin’s US fundraising arm, declined to comment on the Taoiseach’s remarks about the Friends of Sinn Féin annual dinner in New York but said that it was held on November 8th - three days before Armistice Day, the day Mr Varadkar said it took place.He would not be drawn on the Taoiseach’s characterisation of the party’s guests as being “super-rich.” He would only say that it was “another successful event” hosted by the organisation. Declining to reveal the sum raised at the event, Mr Guilfoyle, a Cincinnati-based lawyer, said the group would publish financial details around the event in its biannual filings to the US Department of Justice as a foreign agent of Sinn Féin as required under US law. That filing, which will be made in mid-2019, will list the names of donors who attended the annual dinner, Sinn Féin’s most lucrative fundraiser every year in the US, and the amounts raised as well as the group’s expenditure in the six-month reporting period from November to April 2019. “We do value transparency, and the Justice Department filing is the best vehicle for delivering on transparency,” Mr Guilfoyle told The .The group will publish a filing in the coming weeks covering the reporting period between May and October 2018.Mr Guilfoyle directed queries around Mr Varadkar’s political comments to Sinn Féin.In the six-month fundraising period covering last year’s fundraising dinner in New York, Friends of Sinn Féin raised $309,802 (€265,000) and spent $365,500. Some $143,900 was spent on fundraising event expenses, mostly relating to the New York dinner."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3704094.1542705963!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"penguin intervention on attenborough show defended by top film makers","story":"A BBC camera crew, working on David Attenborough\u0027s Dynasties series, take the very rare decision to intervene and rescue a group of penguins that had become trapped in a ravine.

Photograph: Stefan ChristmannBBC NHUPA WireLeading wildlife camera operators and film-makers have defended the film crew on David Attenborough’s latest BBC series over their decision to break with convention and intervene to save a group of penguins that had become trapped in a ravine. Nature film-makers are discouraged from intervening in the events they are attempting to capture on film. While the general principle is to avoid interfering with the natural course of events, the crew on the Dynasties series stepped in when they saw the birds’ predicament. The penguins at the centre of Sunday’s episode of Dynasties had either blown or tumbled into a gully in a storm and were unable to to get out. In what BBC Earth described as an “unprecedented move”, the crew dug a shallow ramp so some of the penguins would be able to use it to save themselves. But Allan said he saw no problem with the film crew’s intervention. “Interfering or not is a decision based on what you’re seeing at the time. To interfere on a predation event is definitely wrong but, in this situation, they didn’t spook the penguins. All they did was create an escape route for them,” he said. Allan explained it would have been a far more stressful situation for the penguins had the film crew decided to pick them up and move them. He added: “I certainly think, in that case, what they did was entirely justifiable and entirely understandable. I would have done the same thing in their situation.” Philip Hoare, author and film-maker, said the crew were bound to upset someone whichever way they responded. He said he found himself in a similar position when he was in Sri Lanka filming sperm whales. When a group of killer whales appeared to hunt the sperm whales, he realised his boat was in between the predator and prey. “It was a very difficult thing to make a decision on,” he said, “I didn’t want to see any whales die, but there was a possibility that, by being there, we were frustrating one species’ natural instinct and need.” In that instance, his crew moved the boat. He added that it was impossible to document an encounter between a human and another species objectively. “This notion of purity of an encounter between a human and another species is absolutely ridiculous. There’s no possibility of that.” Mike Gunton, the executive producer of the series, also defended the crew’s decision to help the penguins. He told Radio 4’s Today programme: “In the 30 years I’ve been doing this, it’s one of the very few occasions when we’ve ever done anything like this because it’s a very unusual situation. Normally, you don’t interfere, you can’t interfere, or you wouldn’t interfere because of all sorts of consequences. “One, it would be very dangerous to do often for both you and the animal. Also, you’ll probably be changing the dynamics of the natural system or you might be depriving something of its food. But, in this particular situation, none of those things applied.” While it has previously been reported that Attenborough had opposed the move, saying that “tragedy is a part of life”, Gunton said that the presenter had told him he also would have rescued the penguins.–"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3704745.1542740317!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"the week in brexit key days ahead","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe European Union’s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier.

Photograph: Henry NichollsReutersTheresa May has revived the idea of a technological solution to keep the Border open after Brexit in an attempt to win over Eurosceptic Conservatives opposed to the draft withdrawal agreement. During a 2½-hour cabinet meeting on Tuesday, ministers discussed “alternative arrangements” that could provide an alternative to the backstop set out in the withdrawal agreement.“One possible alternative arrangement could involve technological solutions,” the prime minister’s official spokesman said after the meeting.The Irish protocol in the withdrawal agreement says the backstop will apply “unless and until an alternative arrangement implementing another scenario is agreed”. The protocol refers to last December’s joint report, which said that, if the future EU-UK relationship did not resolve the Border issue, “the United Kingdom will propose specific solutions to address the unique circumstances of the island of Ireland”. In the absence of agreed solutions, the backstop would come into operation.At a meeting in Downing Street on Monday with Brexiteers including former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith and former Northern Ireland secretary Owen Paterson, Mrs May agreed to explore a technological solution. Until now, the British and Irish governments, along with the European Commission, have rejected proposals for maximum facilitation at borders through technology as unrealistic.“There’s scope to get rid of the backstop – this is the alternative,” Mr Duncan Smith said on Tuesday.DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds warned the prime minister she could not rely on his party’s support if she pressed ahead with the withdrawal agreement.“The government will require DUP support to deliver its domestic agenda. We will continue to use our influence for the good of everyone across the United Kingdom. If the government can look beyond a withdrawal agreement, which is uniting people from across the political spectrum against it, and instead work towards a better deal, then an outcome can be delivered that truly works to benefit all parts of the United Kingdom,” he said.The DUP abstained on some amendments to a finance Bill on Monday night, in apparent breach of their confidence-and-supply agreement with the Conservatives, which requires them to support the government on all budget and finance Bills.\u0026nbspA Government spokesman in Dublin declined to comment on the discussions in London but made clear that the text of the withdrawal agreement could not be renegotiated. “The withdrawal agreement between the UK and EU was agreed last week and is clear from our perspective in guaranteeing no return to a hard border in Ireland in any circumstances,” the spokesman said.Mrs May will travel to Brussels on Wednesday evening for talks with European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker on the text of a political declaration on the future relationship between Britain and the EU. Downing Street said the meeting would not mark the conclusion of the negotiations and suggested the political declaration might not be finalised until after EU leaders meet in Brussels on Sunday.European Council president Donald Tusk has scheduled just one hour for a discussion between Mrs May and the other 27 leaders but the prime minister’s official spokesman described the timetable as purely illustrative.Mrs May’s latest attempt to win over Brexiteer backbenchers comes as an attempt to topple her by the Eurosceptic European Research Group (ERG) appears to have faltered. The group’s leaders, Jacob Rees-Mogg and Steve Baker, acknowledged on Tuesday they had failed to secure the backing of 48 MPs required to trigger a confidence vote in the prime minister’s leadership.\u0026nbspDeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward.

Wine coolers, velvet sofas, table lamps and bar stools were sold at vastly inflated prices as scores of telephone and online bidders competed with a packed auction house and the club’s regulars watching and bidding via a live stream from the club itself.Negro Sitting, an oil painting by Glyn Warren Philpot, sold for £368,750,  three times it’s estimated price, while a pen and pencil drawing by Henry Mayo Bateman called Honour was satisfied in the season in retrospect, went for £32,500, well above its £4,000 estimate and a world record for the artist at auction.Three other Bateman cartoons, The Millionaire, Why We Halted and The Post Impressionist Exhibition, sold together for £25,000, ten times above its estimate.The Batemans made up the majority of the pictures dotted around the main bar and entrance, and will therefore be familiar to most visitors.Portrait of a Lady by Augustus John, said to remind club members of all the subject had witnessed as she gazed upon them sold for £27,500.A doorman’s woollen coat, recognisable to every member who had stepped through the club’s doors, was estimated to sell for between £50 and £80 but went for £1,875.Auctioneer Will Porter joked: “‘No regrets’, that’s the moral of Annabel’s,” as he brought the hammer down at £242,750 for Study of a Grey Horse, a painting by Sir Alfred James Munnings that had been expected to go for up to £25,000.The sale of its contents by Richard Caring, the multimillionaire restaurateur who bought the club as part of a £90m deal in 2007,  generated a wealthy of interest from its well-heeled, nostalgic patrons.Liz Hurley is said to have set her sights on its iconic red velvet sofas, while Nick Grimshaw was keen to snap up the oak planks of the dance floor on which he once watched Grace Jones hula hoop.Mr Birley once said that decorating Annabel’s was “an intuitive thing” with pieces of art bought in a “haphazard” way. Caring has claimed he is likely “extremely upset” about the sale.The auction was expected to raise significantly more than the estimated £1million, which Caring has vowed to use to purchase further extraordinary works of art for the new Annabel\u0027s and other restaurants for thousands to enjoy.Criminals may escape conviction due to lack of resources for forensics, says Lord Chief JusticeJustice secretary defends decision not to challenge rapist parole moveGambling more common among teenagers than drinking, smoking or taking drugsTheresa May tells Nicola Sturgeon her Brexit deal is good for Scotland and its fishermenDonald Trump jokingly warns pardoned turkey of election recount in annual White House traditionDemocrats vow to investigate Ivanka Trump\u0026#39s use of personal emails for government businessTraveller gang told brewery \u0026#39£20k or the place is ours\u0026#39 before leaving scene of devastation, court toldComment: US sanctions target conspiracy between Iran, Syria, and Russia to keep Assad regime in oilComment: Donald Trump has given Saudi Arabia permission to murder at willPolice apologise for describing flasher as man with \u0026#39small penis\u0026#39Duke of Cambridge reveals mental health battles as he says treating child on air ambulance took him \u0026#39over the edge\u0026#39Comment: The denigration of traditional policing has damaged the public\u0026#39s respect for us copsInterpol infiltrated by Russia so UK must work with other countries to set up alternative, MPs sayComment: Don\u0026#39t be complacent Mrs May.

The patient had undergone a liver transplant surgery in May 2017, and subsequently developed abnormal liver symptoms. Clinical tests later showed that he had contracted the rat hepatitis virus. Researchers ruled out infection via his blood and organ donors. Instead, they found his housing complex had piles of rubbish and evidence of rodent infestation, including droppings.The patient was cured over a few months with the help of antiviral drugs, though it is likely it took longer given his weakened immune system after surgery. In the most recent instance, the woman’s symptoms cleared within weeks and didn’t require medication.Both were believed to have been infected in 2017, and lived in the same Hong Kong neighbourhoods. However, scientists haven’t found a direct link between the two cases.Like many other cities around the world, Hong Kong officials have long battled rats, which were described to one local paper as being “as big as kittens.”Hepatitis affects the liver and is usually transmitted through contaminated food and water – for instance, by eating under-cooked meat or coming into contact with unclean water.The specific strain, hepatitis E, infects around 20 million people a year and is most prevalent in East and South Asia, according to the World Health Organisation.Symptoms can vary from mild discomfort to very severe some infections become life-threatening.The rat version, first discovered in 2010 in Germany, has a “very significant genetic difference” from the strains typically known to infect humans up until now, Dr Sridhar said.Criminals may escape conviction due to lack of resources for forensics, says Lord Chief JusticeJustice secretary defends decision not to challenge rapist parole moveGambling more common among teenagers than drinking, smoking or taking drugsAnnabel\u0026#39s Buddha that watched over dance floor sells for more than £100,000Theresa May tells Nicola Sturgeon her Brexit deal is good for Scotland and its fishermenDonald Trump jokingly warns pardoned turkey of election recount in annual White House traditionDemocrats vow to investigate Ivanka Trump\u0026#39s use of personal emails for government businessTraveller gang told brewery \u0026#39£20k or the place is ours\u0026#39 before leaving scene of devastation, court toldComment: US sanctions target conspiracy between Iran, Syria, and Russia to keep Assad regime in oilComment: Donald Trump has given Saudi Arabia permission to murder at willPolice apologise for describing flasher as man with \u0026#39small penis\u0026#39Duke of Cambridge reveals mental health battles as he says treating child on air ambulance took him \u0026#39over the edge\u0026#39Comment: The denigration of traditional policing has damaged the public\u0026#39s respect for us copsInterpol infiltrated by Russia so UK must work with other countries to set up alternative, MPs sayComment: Don\u0026#39t be complacent Mrs May.

including 17 caravans - entered Thwaites Brewery in Blackburn after one of the group used a chainsaw to cut a lock on a pedestrian entrance and then opened the main gates on the evening of May 26.A spokesman for the travellers allegedly told brewery bosses: Twenty grand or the place is ours.Thomas Ward, 43, of Aspull Common, Leigh, Greater Manchester, initially demanded £20,000 from Thwaites to leave within the hour before he settled on a handshake to take payment at noon the following day provided no damage was caused, jurors at Preston Court were told.But prosecutors say travellers went on a wrecking spree and ransacked the office building later that afternoon after Ward formed the view his demand would not be met.Staff and police finally gained full access to the brewery on May 28 and Thwaites chief executive Richard Bailey said he was greeted by a scene of utter devastation, with extensive damage estimated at £300,000.The travellers finally left later the same day under police escort, the court heard.The travellers caused £300,000 worth of damage at the brewery, jurors were toldWith a brewing heritage that stretches back over 200 years, Thwaites sells its beer exclusively in its chain of pubs, hotels, inns and lodges.In 2001, Prince Charles toasted Thwaites Beers at Craven Heifer, Stainforth and in 2005 the company signed cricketer Andrew Flintoff to become the face of their ‘Lancaster bomber’ as he helped England win the Ashes.On Tuesday, Ward pleaded guilty to blackmail, conspiracy to burgle Thwaites and conspiracy to commit criminal damage.John Ward, 33, also of Aspull Common, and a 17-year-old male, who cannot be named for legal reasons, also admitted the conspiracy offences.A fourth defendant, Patrick Ward, 32, of Aspull Common, who has pleaded not guilty to the same conspiracy offences, is on trial at Preston Crown Court in his absence.Jurors heard that a security guard on duty at Thwaites rang management to say they had a major problem after the travellers broke in.In a statement to the court, Mr Bailey said when he arrived he saw a large number of travellers and vehicles in the yard.Dog kennels had already been laid out in what was clearly an advanced stage of encampment.Work contractor Greg Hartley had already discussed with Big John, a spokesman for the travellers, his terms for them leaving, said Mr Bailey.Mr Hartley said: Big John said give me 20 grand and we\u0027ll be gone in the next hour.He said he relayed the message to Mr Bailey and explained to Big John it was not possible to obtain any money immediately.They finally agreed on a handshake for a noon handover as Big John reminded him: Twenty grand or the place is ours, he continued.On May 27, Thwaites were allowed into the premesis - with police assistance - to remove a number of valuable items, including artwork and memorabilia worth £2 million.A number of males were seen to trespass the office building in a horsebox and a beer dray, at around 4:30pm.The CCTV - which also showed young children playing in the yard - stopped recording when the power was cut on site at about 5.50pm, the court heard.Kimberley Obrusik, prosecuting, said it was the Crown\u0027s case that Patrick Ward was one of the offenders caught on CCTV stealing items at the brewery.Jurors were told that Patrick Ward denies it was him, although he does accept he was in the area at nearby Morrisons supermarket and Gala Bingo on May 27.Criminals may escape conviction due to lack of resources for forensics, says Lord Chief JusticeJustice secretary defends decision not to challenge rapist parole moveGambling more common among teenagers than drinking, smoking or taking drugsAnnabel\u0026#39s Buddha that watched over dance floor sells for more than £100,000Theresa May tells Nicola Sturgeon her Brexit deal is good for Scotland and its fishermenDonald Trump jokingly warns pardoned turkey of election recount in annual White House traditionDemocrats vow to investigate Ivanka Trump\u0026#39s use of personal emails for government businessComment: US sanctions target conspiracy between Iran, Syria, and Russia to keep Assad regime in oilComment: Donald Trump has given Saudi Arabia permission to murder at willPolice apologise for describing flasher as man with \u0026#39small penis\u0026#39Duke of Cambridge reveals mental health battles as he says treating child on air ambulance took him \u0026#39over the edge\u0026#39Comment: The denigration of traditional policing has damaged the public\u0026#39s respect for us copsInterpol infiltrated by Russia so UK must work with other countries to set up alternative, MPs sayComment: Don\u0026#39t be complacent Mrs May.

The Cupertino-based firm, which reached a trillion dollar valuation earlier this year, has plunged into a bear market due to fears over iPhone production. A bear market is generally held to be one in which a stock’s value declines by 20 per cent or more from a 52-week high, or over a period of two months. Apple becomes first public company to be worth $1 trillionApple designer Jony Ive explains his \u0027utterly absurd\u0027 way of workingWhy Apple plans to stop putting a number on iPhone salesApple reports profits rise but iPhone sales stallThe share price fell 4 per cent on Monday after reports that Apple had cut production orders for its three newest iPhones, and the stock was down 4.5 per cent in early trading on Tuesday. Apple’s decline brought the other so-called FAANG stocks (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google) down too - altogether, these companies have lost more than $1 trillion (£780bn) in market cap from the point of their highest valuation in the last year. Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index, said the sliding share prices showed how the FAANG firms can be victims of their own successes. “As much as the companies could do no wrong when investors were positively inclined towards them, Amazon, Netflix, Facebook and Microsoft are now selling off much quicker than other stocks,” she said. “Part of the problem is that investors no longer expect an average growth in profit if the sales are not double digit and spectacular – as is the case in with the latest iPhone - the disappointment quickly translates into a selloff in shares. “Given how high these stocks have risen over the last year the selloff then triggers chart signals which only provoke more and faster selling.”Tech firms in Europe have felt the pain of their US counterparts, with the European Stoxx 600 tech index dropping on Tuesday to hit its lowest level since February 2017.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The hall is ided in two, with rows of seats facing each other, adversarially. But the first recipient of the Stephen Hawking Fellowship, apart from the professor himself who gave the initial Fellowship speech last year, was anything but combative.Sir Jonathan Ive, Chief Design Officer at Apple, was awarded the fellowship because he fulfilled its twin criteria, as explained by Charles Connor, President of the Cambridge Union for the Michalemas term. Connor said Ive showed flair in the STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) fields and the ability to communicate complex ideas in a way to excite the imagination.Jony Ive, as everyone calls him, made a speech that was intellectually rich but still accessible, dense with ideas and fascinating. He spoke eloquently, gently, even tenderly, about the creative process and the importance of listening to the quietest voice. Throughout, he was open and humble, repeatedly revealing the curiosity which is a central part of doing his work.Jony Ive addressed an audience of mostly students at the Cambridge Union on 19 November, 2018 (Apple)The Union’s main hall holds around 400. It was packed, mostly with students. Ive stood in the dead centre of the hall, turning back and forth between the facing rows, elegantly but quietly dressed in an immaculate blue suit, pale blue shirt and tie.We designers create tools, tools that you can live in, sit on, eat with, tools that enable communication and support learning, creating and mending. Our tools can be powerful, they can be beautiful, and on many occasions they\u0027re not motivated by understood or articulated needs.But though Ive works in the world of technology, he recognises it can be challenging.As an aside, it\u0027s interesting, isn\u0027t it, when we struggle with technology, we assume the issue is actually with us. If you eat something that tastes dreadful, you don\u0027t assume that the issue is with you.

Firstly, I could actually use it. I loved using it and it became a very powerful tool that helped me design and create. Secondly, and I think this is in some ways a rather embarrassing admission because this was at the end of four years of studying design, I realised that what you make represents who you are.It stands testament to your values and your preoccupations, and using the Mac I sensed a clear and direct connection with the people who actually created the Macintosh. For the first time, I remember being moved by obvious humanity and care beyond just the functional imperative. This, he said, led to him finding out more about the people at Apple and moving to California in 1992 to join the team.Jony Ive was awarded the 2018 Professor Hawking Fellowship (Apple)But his most interesting thoughts concerned creativity and the nature of ideas. I spend my time at Apple in that intersection of art and technology. I think that, almost by definition, ideas are fragile. If they were resolved, if they were robust, they wouldn\u0027t be ideas any more, they would be shipping products, a finished album, a completed building. I\u0027m not really entirely sure why, but I think I\u0027ve always taken an enormous delight when the most tentative thought, often from the quietest voice, evolves into significant and substantial products.As he described the process that surrounded one interface project which began in around 2002 to 2003, he intriguingly revealed that the concept of the Apple App Store began a long time ago.This was a project that we came to describe as multi-touch. Some of you may remember the first time you experienced the interface. Perhaps it was on one of the first iPhones or later on an iPad. But multi-touch describes the ability to directly touch and interact with your content to be able to pinch to zoom an image or flick through a list with your fingers.Importantly, it defined an opportunity to create applications with their own unique, very specific interface. So, not being generic but being specific inherently describes the application\u0027s function. We came to see that we could make applications purposeful, compelling and intuitive to use. And so, as the potential for a vast range of apps became clear, so did the idea for an app store.But it took time before it could happen: In reality, the supporting technology, the enabling technology, took years to catch up with the ideas. And I have to say the ideas posed problems and defined challenges, but in the process, we came close to giving up on a number of occasions.Thankfully, they didn\u0027t give up. But ideas, he said, were not in response to a defined problems. Nobody asked us to solve a problem. They were not in response to a technological opportunity. These ideas, they weren\u0027t vulnerable or fragile for a couple of weeks or for a couple of months, these ideas were fragile for years.Still, after nearly 30 years at Apple, he is eager to create. I remain completely in awe, completely enchanted by the creative process. I love the unpredicability and the surprise. The whole process is fabulously terrifying and so uncertain. But I love that on Monday, there\u0027s nothing. There is no idea, there is no conversation, the room is silent, there\u0027s certainly not a drawing. Prototypes are way in the future. On Monday, there is nothing, but on Wednesday, there is. No matter how partial, how tentative. Now, the problem is: which Wednesday?Collaboration is a key element, he said, even if this can lead to complexities. Without doubt, collaborating closely with multiple experts from different disciplines is one of my favorite aspects of being part of the team at Apple but this does present challenges that are a function of working as a large group. As a larger group, opinions often become confused with ideas. Opinions expressed in larger groups tend to focus on what is measurable, tangible and can be easily evaluated and communicated. That\u0027s why there\u0027s an obsession with attributes like size and weight and speed, capacity, schedule or price. But there often follows the dangerous assumption: we talk about these attributes because we think they\u0027re important.Apple\u0027s Jony Ive on how he created the But, common vision and shared purpose, Ive says, is not enough. When we genuinely look at a problem it\u0027s an opportunity to learn together, and we discover something together. We know that learning in community is powerful. It feeds and supports momentum which in turn encourages a familiarity and an acceptance of challenges associated with doing difficult things. And I\u0027ve come to learn that I think a desire to learn makes doing something new just a little less scary.He also described a paradox in the way he works which, he says, almost becomes absurd.There is a fundamental conflict between two very different ways of thinking. It is the conflict between curiosity and the resolve and focus that is necessary to solve problems. Curiosity, while it fuels and motivates, despite being utterly fundamental to the generation of ideas, in isolation just culminates in lots of long lists, perhaps some ideas, but alone that\u0027s sort of where it ends.The necessary resolve to find solutions to the problems that stand between a tentative thought and something substantial, that resolve and that focus very often seems in direct conflict with most creative behaviour. Honestly, I can\u0027t think of two ways of working, two different ways of being, that are more polar. On one hand to be constantly questioning, loving surprises, consumed with curiosity and yet on the other hand having to be utterly driven and completely focused to solve apparently insurmountable problems, even if those solutions are without precedent or reference. And so, of course, this is where it becomes sort of ironic and teeters towards the utterly absurd.You see, in the mode of being unreasonable and resolute, you have to solve hard problems. But solving those problems requires new ideas. And so, we\u0027re back to needing ideas and back to having to be open and curious. This is not a shift that occurs once or twice in a multi-year project. I find it happens to me once or twice a day and that frequency of shifting between two such different ways of seeing and thinking is fantastically demanding.He ended by quoting Steve Jobs, the late CEO of Apple, with whom he had a deep and incredibly fruitful creative relationship. As he read Jobs’ words, he slowed, seeming moved, as if hearing the words anew.I\u0027m going to read you something that my close friend and collaborator, the remarkable Steve Jobs, said about 10 years ago. I thought to conclude with his words rather than mine seemed entirely fitting. \u0027There\u0027s lots of ways to be as a person. People express their deep appreciation in different ways. But one of the ways that I believe people express their appreciation to the rest of humanity is to make something wonderful and put it out there. And you never meet the people, you never shake their hands. You never hear their story or tell yours but somehow, in the act of making something with a great deal of care and love, something is transmitted there. And it\u0027s a way of expressing to the rest of our species our deep appreciation.\u0027 Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Found could be picked up for a better price outside of the Black Friday weekend was that the a 60” LG television advertised at £799 by Amazon during the promotion that was £50 cheaper on at least 62 occasions after Black Friday and dropped a further £150 for at least four days at the end of December and beginning of January.The Sony Cybershot HX60B Superzoom compact camera was advertised as £189 (save £10) on Black Friday by Currys PC World, but was found to be £10 cheaper in June and July last year and then again in December and January.The results suggest consumers should be careful about attributing too much value to discounts which may not be as good as they first appear.Despite the findings UK shoppers are expected to spend billions on the Black Friday period.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

A transition to WTO could look like no deal, no transition, or it could look more like a seamless move to WTO. We’ll just expose all that so you can have a proper assessment of it.”Highways Agency officials told The Independent in June that\u0026nbspplanned Channel port lorry parks will definitely not be available by March 2019 – too late to help tackle the estimated 30-mile lorry queues Dover is expected to face in the event of a collapse in exit talks.Mr Carney stressed that no deal next March with no transition would be even more economically damaging.“This would be a large negative shock to the economy – no deal, no transition – there should be no doubt about that,” he said.The risk of the UK crashing out of the European Union as soon as next March has risen after\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbspgave an almost universally hostile reception to Theresa May’s withdrawal agreement\u0026nbsplast week.Earlier this month Mr Carney said he did not think the risk of chaotic Brexit next year was high, but that if it did happen the Bank could be forced to raise interest rates.Asked on Tuesday whether the chance of no deal has now risen he said: “We’re going to find out relatively soon! Some of you may know already.”“We’ve always operated from the view that this might happen so get the system prepared. We’ve been preparing for it since the day after the referendum effectively. We’re quietly confident that we have in place all the measures we could have in place.”He also claimed the Bank of England would be something of a “sideshow” in the event of a chaotic Brexit.“This would be a very unusual situation. It is very rare to see a large negative supply shock in an advanced economy. You would have to stretch back at least in our analysis until the 1970s to find analogies.“This is not a financial crisis round two, where the Bank of England and other central banks were centre stage, this is a real economy shock and therefore central banks have a role but we’re more of a sideshow.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The committee asked Threadneedle Street to provide an analysis of how the EU Withdrawal Agreement will “affect the Bank’s ability to deliver its statutory remits for monetary and financial stability, including in a \u0027no deal, no transition\u0027 scenario”.The central bank said it had changed the date for publication of the results of its annual stress tests of the UK’s major banks - during which it analyses how the country’s biggest lenders would cope with a variety of risks.

Virgin Money and CYBG strike £1.7bn deal putting 1,500 jobs at riskCYBG set for Virgin merger but consumers shouldn’t get too excitedThe shares sell-off wasn’t just about brexit. The bank fell into a pre-tax loss for the year to the end of September, thanks largely to\u0026nbspa much bigger than expected provision to cover the cost of Payment Protection Insurance (PPI) misselling. Shore Capital had hoped for a better idend than was offered too.\u0026nbspThe baleful influence of Brexit, however, exacerbated the negatives in the bank’s numbers.\u0026nbspShortly after the EU referendum in June 2016,\u0026nbspCYBG held a capital markets day when the banking group\u0026nbspsaid it expected the impact of the leave vote to be felt 18 to 24 months down the line. Those\u0026nbspcomments have proved prescient.\u0026nbspOutside of\u0026nbspthe PPI nasty, CYBG has a decent enough story to tell. Merging with Virgin Money should give it a shot in the arm.

The Cupertino-based firm, which reached a trillion dollar valuation earlier this year, has plunged into a bear market due to fears over iPhone production. A bear market is generally held to be one in which a stock’s value declines by 20 per cent or more from a 52-week high, or over a period of two months. Apple becomes first public company to be worth $1 trillionApple designer Jony Ive explains his \u0027utterly absurd\u0027 way of workingWhy Apple plans to stop putting a number on iPhone salesApple reports profits rise but iPhone sales stallThe share price fell 4 per cent on Monday after reports that Apple had cut production orders for its three newest iPhones, and the stock was down 4.5 per cent in early trading on Tuesday. Apple’s decline brought the other so-called FAANG stocks (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google) down too - altogether, these companies have lost more than $1 trillion (£780bn) in market cap from the point of their highest valuation in the last year. Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index, said the sliding share prices showed how the FAANG firms can be victims of their own successes. “As much as the companies could do no wrong when investors were positively inclined towards them, Amazon, Netflix, Facebook and Microsoft are now selling off much quicker than other stocks,” she said. “Part of the problem is that investors no longer expect an average growth in profit if the sales are not double digit and spectacular – as is the case in with the latest iPhone - the disappointment quickly translates into a selloff in shares. “Given how high these stocks have risen over the last year the selloff then triggers chart signals which only provoke more and faster selling.”Tech firms in Europe have felt the pain of their US counterparts, with the European Stoxx 600 tech index dropping on Tuesday to hit its lowest level since February 2017.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

A transition to WTO could look like no deal, no transition, or it could look more like a seamless move to WTO. We’ll just expose all that so you can have a proper assessment of it.”Highways Agency officials told The Independent in June that\u0026nbspplanned Channel port lorry parks will definitely not be available by March 2019 – too late to help tackle the estimated 30-mile lorry queues Dover is expected to face in the event of a collapse in exit talks.Mr Carney stressed that no deal next March with no transition would be even more economically damaging.“This would be a large negative shock to the economy – no deal, no transition – there should be no doubt about that,” he said.The risk of the UK crashing out of the European Union as soon as next March has risen after\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbspgave an almost universally hostile reception to Theresa May’s withdrawal agreement\u0026nbsplast week.Earlier this month Mr Carney said he did not think the risk of chaotic Brexit next year was high, but that if it did happen the Bank could be forced to raise interest rates.Asked on Tuesday whether the chance of no deal has now risen he said: “We’re going to find out relatively soon! Some of you may know already.”“We’ve always operated from the view that this might happen so get the system prepared. We’ve been preparing for it since the day after the referendum effectively. We’re quietly confident that we have in place all the measures we could have in place.”He also claimed the Bank of England would be something of a “sideshow” in the event of a chaotic Brexit.“This would be a very unusual situation. It is very rare to see a large negative supply shock in an advanced economy. You would have to stretch back at least in our analysis until the 1970s to find analogies.“This is not a financial crisis round two, where the Bank of England and other central banks were centre stage, this is a real economy shock and therefore central banks have a role but we’re more of a sideshow.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The committee asked Threadneedle Street to provide an analysis of how the EU Withdrawal Agreement will “affect the Bank’s ability to deliver its statutory remits for monetary and financial stability, including in a \u0027no deal, no transition\u0027 scenario”.The central bank said it had changed the date for publication of the results of its annual stress tests of the UK’s major banks - during which it analyses how the country’s biggest lenders would cope with a variety of risks.

It’s a wartime story in which, for a change, the men are relegated to supporting roles. It follows in a tradition of French rural family sagas like Jean De Florette or Manon Des Sources. The landscapes and the changing seasons play as much of a part in the story as the main characters.Dark River offers little such consolation. It has some lyrical and delicate moments but the mood is generally overwhelmingly bleak and lugubrious. Incest and abuse don’t leave much space for any comic interludes. This is a powerful film with a grinding intensity about it. Light relief it isn’t but Dark River still has quite an impact.Late on in Argentinean director Lucrecia Martel’s startling, highly original new feature, Zama, a character who has just had both his arms cut off, is advised to “shove your stumps in the sand … if you don’t bleed out, you’ll survive.” It’s a grisly, darkly humorous moment in a film that continually surprises us with both its brutality and its lyricism.The most dispiriting aspect of this otherwise enrapturing Oscar-nominated animated feature is that its storyline still seems so current. The film depicts an Afghan society in which women don’t have a face. It is set during the Taliban rule, which lasted from the mid-1990s until late 2001, but this doesn’t feel like a period piece. Seventeen years after the Taliban were ousted from power in Afghanistan following the US invasion, the plight of women in the country appears hardly to have improved. Spike Lee’s work sometimes risks sensory overload. He fires off so many different ideas and storytelling styles that audiences can become bamboozled by his scattergun approach. BlacKkKlansman is one of his very best films because the digressions are as entertaining as ever but don’t get in the way of the main story.Much of the pleasure in Aardman films has always lain in their gently ironic, Alan Bennett-like humour. They take very exotic characters and subject matter but then deal with them in a matter-of-fact fashion. They make a virtue out of their own relative modesty. Early Man isn’t the flashiest animated feature that you’ll see this year but it is certainly the most likeable. 717 Isle of DogsLike all of Wes Anderson’s work, Isle Of Dogs is very stylised, very offbeat and characterised by its extremely dry and often ironic humour. This Japanese-set stop-motion fable is also gorgeous to look at – packed full of intricate visual detail. It deals with some weighty themes (ethnic cleansing, fascism and corruption) but does so in an idiosyncratic fashion.817 Three Billboards Outside of Ebbing, MissouriWriter-director Martin McDonagh has a host of award-winning plays behind him but his movies haven’t always lived up to his stage work. This one certainly does. It shares some of the dark and nihilistic humour found in McDonagh’s previous film, Seven Psychopaths.In an era of wearisome poltergeist movies, haunted house stories and torture porn, A Quiet Place is a refreshingly pared-down and very original affair. Director John Krasinski relies on editing, sound effects and off-screen action to crank up the tension. We do see the creatures from time to time, sometimes even in extreme closeup. They are very grotesque, bigger versions of the polyp-like succubus which exploded out of John Hurt’s stomach in Alien. However, the most terrifying moments here come when the humans are waiting for them to appear, desperately hoping that they won’t. Lady Bird is one of the best American coming-of-age films since Barry Levinson’s Diner. Written and directed by Greta Gerwig, it offers an utterly winning mix of humour, poignancy and sharp-eyed social observation. Gerwig approaches her subject matter with the same tenderness and affectionate irony with which the adolescent Lady Bird regards Sacramento. Gerwig also shows Lady Bird’s heroism as the young heroine strives against the odds to become the very best version of herself she can be.If Phantom Thread is indeed Daniel Day-Lewis’s final film as an actor, he is going out on a wondrously bizarre note. This must be the oddest film in his career, one in which he gives a typically commanding but very idiosyncratic performance. Almost everything here is jarring – but generally in a very positive way. It is not so long ago that Paul Schrader seemed to be giving up on cinema. The American writer-director (whose credits include Taxi Driver, American Gigolo and Affliction) had taken to making movies like the sour Hollywood satire The Canyons with Lindsay Lohan and the cartoonishly violent Dog Eat Dog, shot cheaply, aimed at a VOD audience. The former had a montage of closed-down movie theatres. In interviews, Schrader struck a gloomy note about the future of the industry. This is why First Reformed is so refreshing. This is not just Schrader’s best film in a very long while. It is also a re-affirmation of the director’s belief in the medium.Oscar Wilde goes to ruin in Rupert Everett’s debut feature as director. Everett also wrote and stars in the film, giving a grandstanding performance as the Irish writer at the end of his life, after his release from prison, where he has been doing hard labour for “gross indecency”. This is a moving and surprising biopic that squeezes out every last drop of pathos from its subject matter. Black Panther is not only one of the most entertaining recent superhero films but has an intelligence and a political dimension that such inchoate offerings as Suicide Squad and Justice League completely lacked. It is an action movie which touches on Pan-Africanism and which owes as much to Malcolm X as it does to Batman or Captain America. Sicilian Ghost Story is a genre-bending affair that combines elements of teen romance, gothic psycho-drama and political thriller. It is loosely based on a true story of a boy called Giuseppe Di Matteo whose father, an ex-member of the Sicilian Mafia, turned “grass” against his erstwhile associates. The Mafia responded by kidnapping Giuseppe and keeping him in captivity for nearly 800 days. First Man is all about understated heroism. It’s affecting precisely because Armstrong (played with quiet intensity by Ryan Gosling) doesn’t feel the continual need to boast about his mission. The film is a tearjerker but a very subtle one. Dogman is one of the best Italian films of recent times, a modern day neo realist fable that bears comparison with the great work of Fellini, Rossellini, De Sica et al. Its main character, the dog groomer Marcello (Marcello Fonte), is a wonderful creation: loveable, vulnerable, seedy and comic all at the same time. From its slow-burning beginning, s develops into an epic melodrama. It’s a wartime story in which, for a change, the men are relegated to supporting roles. It follows in a tradition of French rural family sagas like Jean De Florette or Manon Des Sources.

Sicilian Ghost Story is a genre-bending affair that combines elements of teen romance, gothic psycho-drama and political thriller. It is loosely based on a true story of a boy called Giuseppe Di Matteo whose father, an ex-member of the Sicilian Mafia, turned “grass” against his erstwhile associates. The Mafia responded by kidnapping Giuseppe and keeping him in captivity for nearly 800 days. First Man is all about understated heroism. It’s affecting precisely because Armstrong (played with quiet intensity by Ryan Gosling) doesn’t feel the continual need to boast about his mission. The film is a tearjerker but a very subtle one. Dogman is one of the best Italian films of recent times, a modern day neo realist fable that bears comparison with the great work of Fellini, Rossellini, De Sica et al. Its main character, the dog groomer Marcello (Marcello Fonte), is a wonderful creation: loveable, vulnerable, seedy and comic all at the same time. There have persistent rumours since that this will be the last Coldplay album ever produced, although the band have yet to confirm their future.Follow\u0026nbspIndependent Culture\u0026nbspon Facebook for all the latest on Film, TV, Music, and moreShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Don’t be fooled by the bonnets and balls: beneath the sugary surface is a tart exposé of the marriage market in Georgian England. For every lucky Elizabeth, who tames the haughty, handsome Mr. Darcy and learns to know herself in the process, there’s a Charlotte, resigned to life with a driveling buffoon for want of a pretty face.240 The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole, Aged 13 ¾, Sue TownsendRead this one when you’re decrepit enough, and chances are you’ll die laughing. No-one has lampooned the self-absorption, delusions of grandeur and sexual frustration of adolescence as brilliantly as Susan Townsend, and no one ever will. Beyond the majestically majestic poetry and the pimples, there’s also a sharp satire of Thatcherist Britain.It’s not often an idiom coined in a novel becomes a catch-phrase, but Joseph Heller managed it with his madcap, savage and hilarious tour de force. War is the ultimate dead-end for logic, and this novel explores all its absurdities as we follow US bombardier pilot Captain John Yossarian. While Heller drew on his own experience as a WWII pilot, it was the McCarthyism of the fifties that fueled the book’s glorious rage.440 Tess of the d’Urbervilles, Thomas HardyA good 125 years before #metoo, Thomas Hardy skewered the sexual hypocrisy of the Victorian age in this melodramatic but immensely moving novel. Tess is a naïve girl from a poor family who is raped by a wealthy land-owner. After the death of her baby, she tries to build a new life, but the “shame” of her past casts a long shadow. Read this if you want to understand the rotten culture at the root of victim-blaming.A classic exposé of colonialism, Achebe’s novel explores what happens to a Nigerian village when European missionaries arrive. The main character, warrior-like Okonkwo, embodies the traditional values that are ultimately doomed. By the time Achebe was born in 1930, missionaries had been settled in his village for decades. He wrote in English and took the title of his novel from a Yeats poem, but wove Igbo proverbs throughout this lyrical work.The ultimate piece of dystopian fiction, 1984 was so prescient that it’s become a cliché. But forget TV’s Big Brother or the trite travesty of Room 101: the original has lost none of its furious force. Orwell was interested in the mechanics of totalitarianism, imagining a society that took the paranoid surveillance of the Soviets to chilling conclusions. Our hero, Winston, tries to resist a grey world where a screen watches your every move, but bravery is ultimately futile when the state worms its way inside your mind.A timeless plea for justice in the setting of America’s racist South during the depression years, Lee’s novel caused a sensation. Her device was simple but incendiary: look at the world through the eyes of a six-year-old, in this case, Jean Louise Finch, whose father is a lawyer defending a black man falsely accused of raping a white woman. Lee hoped for nothing but “a quick and merciful death at the hands of the reviewers”: she won the Pulitzer and a place on the curriculum.Dickens was the social conscience of the Victorian age, but don’t let that put you off. Great Expectations is the roiling tale of the orphaned Pip, the lovely Estella, and the thwarted Miss Havisham. First written in serial form, you barely have time to recover from one cliffhanger before the next one beckons, all told in Dickens’ luxuriant, humorous, heartfelt prose.940 The God of Small Things, Arundhati RoyRoy won the 1997 Booker Prize with her debut novel, a powerful intergenerational tale of love that crosses caste lines in southern India, and the appalling consequences for those who break the taboos dictating “who should be loved, and how. And how much”. Sex, death, religion, the ambivalent pull of motherhood: it’s all there in this beautiful and haunting book.In an astonishing act of literary ventriloquism, Mantel inhabits a fictionalised version of Thomas Cromwell, a working-class boy who rose through his own fierce intelligence to be a key player in the treacherous world of Tudor politics. Historical fiction so immersive you can smell the fear and ambition.1140 The Code of the Woosters, PG WodehouseIf you haven’t read PG Wodehouse in a hot bath with a snifter of whisky and ideally a rubber duck for company, you haven’t lived. Wallow in this sublimely silly tale of the ultimate comic double act: bumbling aristocrat Bertie Wooster and his omniscient butler, Jeeves. A sheer joy to read that also manages to satirise British fascist leader Oswald Mosley as a querulous grump in black shorts.Shelley was just 18 when she wrote Frankenstein as part of a challenge with her future husband, Percy Shelley, and Lord Byron, to concoct the best horror story. Put down the green face paint: Frankenstein’s monster is a complex creation who yearns for sympathy and companionship. Some 200 years after it was first published, the gothic tale feels more relevant than ever as genetic science pushes the boundaries of what it means to create life. 1340 Lord of the Flies, William GoldingAnyone who has ever suspected that children are primitive little beasties will nod sagely as they read Golding’s classic. His theory is this: maroon a bunch of schoolboys on an island, and watch how quickly the trappings of decent behaviour fall away. Never has a broken pair of spectacles seemed so sinister, or civilisation so fragile.The protagonist of Rushdie’s most celebrated novel is born at the exact moment India gains independence. He’s also born with superpowers, and he’s not the only one. In an audacious and poetic piece of magical realism, Rushdie tells the story of India’s blood-soaked resurgence via a swathe of children born at midnight with uncanny abilities.You will need a cold, dead heart not to be moved by one of literature’s steeliest heroines. From the institutional cruelty of her boarding school, the “small, plain” Jane Eyre becomes a governess who demands a right to think and feel. Not many love stories take in a mad woman in the attic and a spot of therapeutic disfigurement, but this one somehow carries it off with mythic aplombThis is a richly satisfying slow burn of a novel that follows the lives and loves of the inhabitants of a small town in England through the years 1829–32. The acerbic wit and timeless truth of its observations mark this out as a work of genius but at the time the author, Mary Anne Evans, had to turn to a male pen name to be taken seriously. Stick another log on the fire and curl up with this dark, peculiar and quite brilliant literary murder tale. A group of classics students become entranced by Greek mythology - and then take it up a level. Remember, kids: never try your own delirious Dionysian ritual at home. A subtle and engrossing look at racial identity, through the story of a charismatic young Nigerian woman who leaves her comfortable Lagos home for a world of struggles in the United States. Capturing both the hard-scrabble life of US immigrants and the brash isions of a rising Nigeria, Adichie crosses continents with all her usual depth of feeling and lightness of touch.An absolute unadulterated comic joy of a novel. Stella Gibbons neatly pokes fun at sentimental navel-gazing with her zesty heroine Flora, who is more interested in basic hygiene than histrionics. In other words, if you’ve “seen something nasty in the woodshed,” just shut the door.Dedicated to the “Sixty Million and more” Africans and their descendants who died as a result of the slave trade, this is a cultural milestone and a Pulitzer-winning tour de force. Morrison was inspired by the real-life story of an enslaved woman who killed her own daughter rather than see her return to slavery. In her plot, the murdered child returns to haunt a black community, suggesting the inescapable taint of America’s history.Evelyn Waugh bottles the intoxicating vapour of a vanished era in this novel about middle-class Charles Ryder, who meets upper-class Sebastian Flyte at Oxford University in the 1920s. Scrap the wartime prologue, and Charles’s entire relationship with Sebastian’s sister Julia (Dear Evelyn, thank you for your latest manuscript, a few suggested cuts…) and you’re looking at one of the most affecting love affairs in the English language. You can almost feel your mouth dry with thirst as you enter the world of Frank Herbert’s Dune and encounter the desert planet of Arrakis, with its giant sandworms and mind-altering spice. It’s the setting for an epic saga of warring feudal houses, but it’s as much eco-parable as thrilling adventure story. Rarely has a fictional world been so completely realised.Will there ever be a novel that burns with more passionate intensity than Wuthering Heights? The forces that bring together its fierce heroine Catherine Earnshaw and cruel hero Heathcliff are violent and untameable, yet rooted in a childhood devotion to one another, when Heathcliff obeyed Cathy’s every command. It’s impossible to imagine this novel ever provoking quiet slumbers Emily Bronte’s vision of nature blazes with poetry.The savage reviews that greeted F Scott Fitzgerald’s third novel – “no more than a glorified anecdote” “for the season only” – failed to recognise something truly great a near-perfect distillation of the hope, ambition, cynicism and desire at the heart of the American Dream. Other novels capture the allure of the invented self, from Stendhal’s The Red and the Black to Thomas Mann’s Confessions of Felix Krull, but Fitzgerald’s enigmatic Jay Gatsby casts a shadow that reaches to Mad Men’s Don Draper and beyond. From the moment we meet Alex and his three droogs in the Korova milkbar, drinking moloko with vellocet or synthemesc and wondering whether to chat up the devotchkas at the counter or tolchock some old veck in an alley, it’s clear that normal novelistic conventions do not apply. Anthony Burgess’s slim volume about a violent near-future where aversion therapy is used on feral youth who speak Nadsat and commit rape and murder, is a dystopian masterpiece.Banned from entering the UK in its year of publication, 1955, Vladimir Nabokov’s astonishingly skilful and enduringly controversial work of fiction introduces us to literary professor and self-confessed hebephile Humbert Humbert, the perhaps unreliable narrator of the novel. He marries widow Charlotte Haze only to get access to her daughter, 12-year-old Dolores, nicknamed Lo by her mother, or as Humbert calls her “Lolita, light of my life, fire of my loins. My sin, my soul.” Cloaking his abuse in the allusive language of idealised love does not lessen Humbert’s crimes, but allows Nabokov to skewer him where he hides.2740 Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, Philip K DickHere be Roy Baty, Rick Deckard and Rachael Rosen – the novel that inspired Blade Runner is stranger even than the film it became. Back in an age before artificial intelligence could teach itself to play chess in a few hours better than any grandmaster that ever lived, Philip K Dick was using the concept of android life to explore what it meant to be human, and what it is to be left behind on a compromised planet. That he could do it in 250 pages that set the mind spinning and engage the emotions with every page-turn make this a rare science-fiction indeed.2840 Heart of Darkness, Joseph ConradInspired by Conrad’s own experiences of captaining a trading steamer up the Congo River, Heart of Darkness is part adventure, part psychological voyage into the unknown, as the narrator Marlow relays the story of his journey into the jungle to meet the mysterious ivory trader Mr Kurtz. Although debate continues to rage about whether the novel and its attitude to Africa and colonialism is racist, it’s deeply involving and demands to be read.Whatever passed between Irish theatre manager Bram Stoker and the Hungarian traveller and writer Ármin Vámbéry when they met in London and talked of the Carpathian Mountains, it incubated in the Gothic imagination of Stoker into a work that has had an incalculable influence on Western culture. It’s not hard to read the Count as a shadowy sexual figure surprising straitlaced Victorian England in their beds, but in Stoker’s hands he’s also bloody creepy.3040 The Catcher in the Rye, J D SalingerIt only takes one sentence, written in the first person, for Salinger’s Holden Caulfield to announce himself in all his teenage nihilism, sneering at you for wanting to know his biographical details “and all that David Copperfield kind of crap”. The Catcher in the Rye is the quintessential novel of the adolescent experience, captured in deathless prose.Dashiel Hammett may have been harder boiled, his plots more intricate but, wow, does Raymond Chandler have style. The push and pull at the start of The Big Sleep between private detective Philip Marlowe, in his powder-blue suit and dark blue shirt, and Miss Carmen Sternwood, with her “little sharp predatory teeth” and lashes that she lowers and raises like a theatre curtain, sets the tone for a story of bad girls and bad men.All the teeming life of 19th century London is here in Thackeray’s masterpiece, right down to the curry houses frequented by Jos Sedley, who has gained a taste for the hot stuff as an officer in the East India Trading Company. But it is Becky Sharp, one of literature’s great characters, who gives this novel its enduring fascination. As a woman on the make, Becky is the perfect blend of wit, cunning and cold-hearted ruthlessness. Try as film and TV might to humanise and make excuses for her, Becky needs victims to thrive! And she’s all the more compelling for that. The only novel written by the poet Sylvia Plath is a semi-autobiographical account of a descent into depression that the book’s narrator Esther Greenwood describes as like being trapped under a bell jar – used to create a vacuum in scientific experiments – struggling to breathe. Almost every word is arresting, and the way that Plath captures the vivid life happening around Esther, news events, magazine parties, accentuates the deadening illness that drives her towards suicidal feelings. Plath herself would commit suicide one month after the novel’s publication in 1963.3440 Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Roald DahlHarry Potter may be more popular, but Willy Wonka is altogether weirder. From the overwhelming poverty experienced by Charlie Bucket and his family, to the spoilt, greedy, brattish children who join Charlie on his trip to Willy Wonka’s phantasmagorical sweet factory there is nothing artificially sweetened in Roald Dahl’s startling work of fantasy. Andrew Davies’s recent TV adaptation of War and Peace reminded those of us who can’t quite face returning to the novel’s monstrous demands just how brilliantly Tolstoy delineates affairs of the heart, even if the war passages will always be a struggle. In Anna Karenina – enormous, too! –the great Russian novelist captures the erotic charge between the married Anna and the bachelor Vronsky, then drags his heroine through society’s scorn as their affair takes shape, without ever suggesting we move from her side. The most deliciously wicked experience in literature, this epistolary novel introduces us to the Marquise de Merteuil and Vicomte de Valmont, who play cruel games of sexual conquest on their unwitting victims. The Marquise’s justification for her behaviour – “I, who was born to revenge my sex and master yours” – will strike a chord in the #metoo era, but emotions, even love, intrude, to the point where Laclos’s amorality becomes untenable. Sexy but very, very bad. 3740 100 Years of Solitude, Gabriel Garcia MarquezThe energy and enchantment of Garcia Marquez’s story of seven generations of the Buendia family in a small town in Colombia continue to enthrall half a century on. Hauntings and premonitions allied to a journalistic eye for detail and a poetic sensibility make Marquez’s magical realism unique.“Someone must have been telling lies about Josef K…” So begins Kafka’s nightmarish tale of a man trapped in an unfathomable bureaucratic process after being arrested by two agents from an unidentified office for a crime they’re not allowed to tell him about. Foreshadowing the antisemitism of Nazi-occupied Europe, as well as the methods of the Stasi, KGB, and StB, it’s an unsettling, at times bewildering, tale with chilling resonance.The second Mrs de Winter is the narrator of Du Maurier’s marvellously gothic tale about a young woman who replaces the deceased Rebecca as wife to the wealthy Maxim de Winter and mistress of the Manderley estate. There she meets the housekeeper Mrs Danvers, formerly devoted to Rebecca, who proceeds to torment her. As atmospheric, psychological horror it just gets darker and darker. Published posthumously in 1958, Tomasi di Lampedusa’s novel is set in 19th century Sicily, where revolution is in the air. The imposing Prince Don Fabrizio presides over a town close to Palermo during the last days of an old world in which class stratifications are stable and understood. Garibaldi’s forces have taken the island and a new world will follow. It’s a deep and poetic meditation on political change and the characters that it produces.140 Pride and Prejudice, Jane AustenIt is a fact universally acknowledged that every list of great books must include Pride and Prejudice. Don’t be fooled by the bonnets and balls: beneath the sugary surface is a tart exposé of the marriage market in Georgian England. For every lucky Elizabeth, who tames the haughty, handsome Mr. Darcy and learns to know herself in the process, there’s a Charlotte, resigned to life with a driveling buffoon for want of a pretty face.240 The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole, Aged 13 ¾, Sue TownsendRead this one when you’re decrepit enough, and chances are you’ll die laughing.

It’s not hard to read the Count as a shadowy sexual figure surprising straitlaced Victorian England in their beds, but in Stoker’s hands he’s also bloody creepy.3040 The Catcher in the Rye, J D SalingerIt only takes one sentence, written in the first person, for Salinger’s Holden Caulfield to announce himself in all his teenage nihilism, sneering at you for wanting to know his biographical details “and all that David Copperfield kind of crap”. The Catcher in the Rye is the quintessential novel of the adolescent experience, captured in deathless prose.Dashiel Hammett may have been harder boiled, his plots more intricate but, wow, does Raymond Chandler have style. The push and pull at the start of The Big Sleep between private detective Philip Marlowe, in his powder-blue suit and dark blue shirt, and Miss Carmen Sternwood, with her “little sharp predatory teeth” and lashes that she lowers and raises like a theatre curtain, sets the tone for a story of bad girls and bad men.All the teeming life of 19th century London is here in Thackeray’s masterpiece, right down to the curry houses frequented by Jos Sedley, who has gained a taste for the hot stuff as an officer in the East India Trading Company. But it is Becky Sharp, one of literature’s great characters, who gives this novel its enduring fascination. As a woman on the make, Becky is the perfect blend of wit, cunning and cold-hearted ruthlessness. Try as film and TV might to humanise and make excuses for her, Becky needs victims to thrive! And she’s all the more compelling for that. The only novel written by the poet Sylvia Plath is a semi-autobiographical account of a descent into depression that the book’s narrator Esther Greenwood describes as like being trapped under a bell jar – used to create a vacuum in scientific experiments – struggling to breathe. Almost every word is arresting, and the way that Plath captures the vivid life happening around Esther, news events, magazine parties, accentuates the deadening illness that drives her towards suicidal feelings. Plath herself would commit suicide one month after the novel’s publication in 1963.3440 Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Roald DahlHarry Potter may be more popular, but Willy Wonka is altogether weirder. From the overwhelming poverty experienced by Charlie Bucket and his family, to the spoilt, greedy, brattish children who join Charlie on his trip to Willy Wonka’s phantasmagorical sweet factory there is nothing artificially sweetened in Roald Dahl’s startling work of fantasy. Andrew Davies’s recent TV adaptation of War and Peace reminded those of us who can’t quite face returning to the novel’s monstrous demands just how brilliantly Tolstoy delineates affairs of the heart, even if the war passages will always be a struggle. In Anna Karenina – enormous, too! –the great Russian novelist captures the erotic charge between the married Anna and the bachelor Vronsky, then drags his heroine through society’s scorn as their affair takes shape, without ever suggesting we move from her side. The most deliciously wicked experience in literature, this epistolary novel introduces us to the Marquise de Merteuil and Vicomte de Valmont, who play cruel games of sexual conquest on their unwitting victims. The Marquise’s justification for her behaviour – “I, who was born to revenge my sex and master yours” – will strike a chord in the #metoo era, but emotions, even love, intrude, to the point where Laclos’s amorality becomes untenable. Sexy but very, very bad. 3740 100 Years of Solitude, Gabriel Garcia MarquezThe energy and enchantment of Garcia Marquez’s story of seven generations of the Buendia family in a small town in Colombia continue to enthrall half a century on. Hauntings and premonitions allied to a journalistic eye for detail and a poetic sensibility make Marquez’s magical realism unique.“Someone must have been telling lies about Josef K…” So begins Kafka’s nightmarish tale of a man trapped in an unfathomable bureaucratic process after being arrested by two agents from an unidentified office for a crime they’re not allowed to tell him about. Foreshadowing the antisemitism of Nazi-occupied Europe, as well as the methods of the Stasi, KGB, and StB, it’s an unsettling, at times bewildering, tale with chilling resonance.The second Mrs de Winter is the narrator of Du Maurier’s marvellously gothic tale about a young woman who replaces the deceased Rebecca as wife to the wealthy Maxim de Winter and mistress of the Manderley estate. There she meets the housekeeper Mrs Danvers, formerly devoted to Rebecca, who proceeds to torment her. As atmospheric, psychological horror it just gets darker and darker. Published posthumously in 1958, Tomasi di Lampedusa’s novel is set in 19th century Sicily, where revolution is in the air. The imposing Prince Don Fabrizio presides over a town close to Palermo during the last days of an old world in which class stratifications are stable and understood. Garibaldi’s forces have taken the island and a new world will follow. It’s a deep and poetic meditation on political change and the characters that it produces.Glamour\u0026nbsppublished its first issue in the US in 1939.

Sixteen nations were involved in its construction. In addition to the US and Russia, those were: Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the UK. \u0026nbsp2. No fewer than 136 space flights from seven different types of craft were deployed to deliver parts to the engineers. The large modules were delivered on 42 assembly flights: 37 on US shuttles, five on Russian Proton and Soyuz rockets.3. The result is the largest manned object in space, 357ft long — just a yard short of a full-length American football field.4. The ISS weighs 419,725kg including the weight of spacecrafts, of which it can accommodate as many as six at any one time.5. It is the single most expensive object ever built at £93.4bn.6. It is the third brightest object in the night sky after the moon and Venus.7. The ISS travels at a speed of 4.791 miles per second, fast enough to go to the moon and back in a single day.Nasa space shuttle Endeavour (Getty)8. At that pace it orbits the earth approximately once every 90 minutes or 16 times in a 24-hour period, meaning it passes through 16 sunsets and sunrises per day. It passes over 90 per cent of the earth’s population in the course of its orbital path.9. The space station has more living space than a six-bedroom house, offering six sleeping quarters, a gym and a 360-degree bay window, but only two bathrooms. There are no chairs either —\u0026nbspastronauts taking time out to eat their three square meals a day of canned and dehydrated food have to float\u0026nbspgently in zero gravity.

So far 230 people from 18 nations have visited the ISS\u0026nbspand it has been continuously occupied since November 2000.11. Nasa’s Peggy Whitson set the record for the longest time living and working in space at 665 days on 2 September 2017, before returning to earth the next day.12. Astronauts aboard have completed 205 spacewalks since 1998 to carry out construction jobs, maintenance and repairs.ISS crew members\u0026nbspfrom the Vatican (Reuters)13. The physical toll all this takes on astronauts is considerable: crew members need to work out in the station\u0027s gym for at least two hours a day to mitigate the loss of bone and muscle mass and maintain the normal bodily health they would experience on terra firma.14. Four different delivery craft supply the crew with food\u0026nbspand equipment: Orbital ATK’s Cygnus, SpaceX’s Dragon, JAXA’s HTV and the Russian Progress.15. A Water Recovery System on board reduces the astronauts\u0027 dependence on these cargo craft by 65 per cent through recycling.

Oxygen is generated by a process of electrolysis: current captured from the station’s acre of solar panels is used to split water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen.17. The ISS\u0027s internal pressurised volume is 32,333 cubic feet, which is roughly equivalent to that of a Boeing 747 passenger jet.18. Software on board the ISS monitors 350,000 sensors checking in on crew health and safety. The station meanwhile carries 50 computers and eight miles of wire, enough to run around the perimeter of Central Park in New York City.19. The ISS provided the set for the first music video ever shot outside of our atmosphere when commander Chris Hadfield\u0026nbspmade a short film set to\u0026nbspDavid Bowie’s “Space Oddity” up there in May 2013.20. To mark its turning 20, the ISS is getting a Refabricator for a birthday present.

Given its brightness, it is surprising it was not discovered a lot sooner.Nasa reveals more about mysterious \u0027alien spacecraft\u0027 asteroidThe swirling cloud of dust is a mere 8,000 light years from Earth is a vast system made up of two shockingly bright stars. The astronomers who found it named it Apep, after the Egyptian god of chaos, reflecting the intensity and vastness of the system but also the curling shape of the snake-god, which matches its whirling appearance.The two bright stars\u0026nbsporbit each other every hundred years or so, according to the researchers. As they do, a fast wind is thrown off, moving as fast as\u0026nbsp12 million kilometres an hour.Eventually the system is going to throw out a\u0026nbsplong-duration gamma-ray burst, according to the astronomers who found it. They can last just a couple of seconds but throw out as much energy as the sun will emit in its whole lifetime.The two stars appear to be rotating so fast that they are close to ripping each other apart. It\u0027s that fast rotation that scientists expect will mean that Apep is likely to throw out one of the GRBs\u0026nbspwhen its core collapses at the end of its life.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Three courses were charged at £39.50.After The Independent asked Tate Modern to comment, it was dropped from the menu.\u0026nbspFoie gras comes from the fatty, enlarged livers of ducks and geese that are force-fed grain and fats, twice a day or more, until they are grossly overweight.Last week footage was released from a French foie gras farm that activists said showed geese and ducks experiencing extreme suffering as they were force-fed using metal tubes.The activists\u0026nbspsaid they witnessed “terrified, panting ducks crammed into tiny, filthy cages, while\u0026nbspgeese struggled\u0026nbspto escape as a vast amount of food was pumped down their throats using a large metal tube”.Tate is a charity and partly funded by the taxpayer, not a privately owned restaurantEmma Milne, who witnessed the animals\u0027\u0026nbsptreatment, said: “The birds’ vocalisation made absolutely clear that it was an extremely unpleasant experience. If that’s what they’re happy to show you, I dread to think what some of the worse farms are like.”Animal Equality are now\u0026nbspasking all British restaurants not to offer foie gras.“Tate Modern offers it only on its festive menu, not year round, so is reinforcing the idea that foie gras is a luxury product to treat yourself to at Christmas,”\u0026nbspToni Shephard, the group’s executive director, told The Independent.\u0026nbsp“Offering foie gras is completely at odds with the idea of a ‘modern’ institution. It is produced in a barbaric and outdated way, and production is banned in this country on welfare grounds.“Tate is a charity and partly funded by the taxpayer – not a privately owned restaurant that is accountable to no one but its shareholders. The Tate’s own website states it is accountable to the public via Parliament for the services it provides.”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Waves crash over Seaham lighthouse near Durham as the cold and wet weather continuesPrime Minister Theresa May speaking at the CBI annual conference at InterContinental Hotel.

We will see what letters come in due time.Do 47 want to come with me or not? I may find that they don\u0027t or they don\u0027t do it today but when we get the meaningful vote.

You speak to Tory MPs and find Tory MPs who say they are really keen that Theresa May should lead us into the next general election.Basically, if there is a vote of confidence it is not just for a year. Getting the 48 letters has shown to be quite difficult, so the idea that in a year you just repeat the process and then she would go at that point I don\u0027t think that is realistic.I think it is now or the prime minister will lead the Conservatives into the next election.You find MPs privately who will say to you they think that is a really good idea in any number and I would be quite surprised.He also told ConservativeHome earlier, that some people don\u0027t want a leadership vote but would like it when the meaningful vote comes up and think that is the time to put in letters.Mr Baker, a former Brexit minister, said\u0026nbspit was a “grave decision” to trigger a leadership bid\u0026nbspand he had “considerable sympathy” with wavering MPs.He added: “Let’s not forget we are up against the full might of the state and the Tory Party.

The analysis will consider the long-term\u0026nbspcosts and benefits of moving to new trading\u0026nbsprelationships with the EU and the rest of the world.”Created with Sketch.

They\u0026nbspwill consider it a major victory that the prime minister’s proposed deal will be officially compared with the potential merits of staying in the EU and\u0026nbspnot merely considered against the risks of a no-deal Brexit.Mr Umunna said the amendment could “change everything”.Writing exclusively for The Independent, he said: “In a big admission – given she has been peddling, for many weeks, the falsehood that the choice is between her deal and no deal – the PM conceded in the House of Commons last week that the country actually faces three choices: no Brexit no deal or her agreement.“Therefore it is only right that\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbspare provided with an economic analysis with a comparison between those options. Anything less would amount to pulling the wool over the eyes of parliamentarians and the people we represent.\u0026nbsp“Let parliament see the figures, and then\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbspcan weigh up just how bad the trajectory the country is on will be for our communities.”Theresa May: ‘It’s the future relationship that delivers on the Brexit vote. It’s the future relationship that actually says this is the right deal for the future for our country’Speaking after ministers agreed to back down, he added: “This was the first test of strength facing the People’s Vote campaign in parliament since the government published their draft deal, and it is one that we in the campaign have won after gaining support from all sides of the House.“The government was planning to con the British people. It is vital at this crucial time for our country that MPs and the public know the full facts about the cost of Brexit and how it compares to the deal we already have inside the EU.”The latest blow to the prime minister’s authority came as Tory Brexiteers scrambled to secure enough signatures to trigger a vote of no confidence in her.Despite claiming\u0026nbspthey would have reached the threshold of 48\u0026nbspby Monday night, the rebels appeared to still be short of support as their attempt to oust Ms May rapidly lost momentum.But Ms May faced a further headache as the DUP, whose votes she relies on in Parliament, broke their agreement to back the government on key issues and abstained during\u0026nbspseveral Finance Bill votes.\u0026nbspDUP abstain from crucial vote in warning over May’s Brexit agreementPro-Brexit Tories struggling to gather support for May challengeSpain threatens to reject Brexit deal over GibraltarNo-deal Brexit spending by UK firms a waste of money says CBIEight of the party’s ten\u0026nbspMPs also backed a Labour amendment on child poverty.It raises urgent questions over the future of the pact between the DUP and the Tories just weeks before Parliament is expected to hold the crunch vote on the prime minister’s Brexit plan.Ms May will need the DUP’s support if her deal is to have any chance of passing the Commons.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Let’s be clear and honest and tell the EU that’s what we are prepared to do.”Stop the posturing – MPs like David Davis have no idea about BrexitDavis says there will be ‘some hiccups’ if UK leaves EU without dealUnited Kingdom will ‘split apart’ because of Brexit, Spain warnsBritain will only enter into a transition phase if the government reaches a withdrawal agreement with the EU. Mr Davis was Brexit secretary when UK and EU negotiators agreed the terms of the transition period, due to run until the end of 2020.Liberal Democrat MP Layla Moran, of the pro-EU group Best for Britain, said: These comments by David Davis are completely unbelievable. He is frankly just deluded or just plain stupid.“It seems like the man who was in charge of delivering Brexit doesn’t understand the process. You can’t have a transition without a deal and everyone knows that.“The truth is that there are two genuine options available to the parliament and to the country: firstly the government’s deal that loses us decision making power and would leave us worse off, and second, our current deal that would keep our prosperity, keep our say over EU laws and trade agreements and deliver what the majority of people in the UK now want.”Jon Worth, visiting professor in EU policy at Bruges’s\u0026nbspCollege of Europe, tweeted: “How the sodding hell has Britain had a Brexit Minister (Davis) who does not even understand the basic scheduling of the process? Or is so mendacious or lazy he doesn’t want to understand?”Mr Davis’s opinion piece – which he began by quoting a Spice Girls lyric – was published as Tory Brexiteers\u0026nbspstruggled to gather support for a leadership challenge on Theresa May.“What we need now is leadership and the courage and confidence to deliver for the UK,” he wrote, claiming “MPs, Party members and the British public are rightly dismayed” with the\u0026nbspprime minister’s proposed EU deal.It is not the first time Mr Davis has been accused of failing to fully understand the Brexit negotiations.\u0026nbspFormer Irish prime minister Bertie Ahern, speaking about the implications for the Irish border,\u0026nbspsaid in January: “I continue to have my doubts – does he understand this stuff?”Mr Davis was also widely ridiculed for suggesting three weeks after the EU referendum that Britain would have completed most of its global trade deals “within between 12 and 24 months”.The Independent has contacted Mr Davis’s office for comment.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

A third of those who replied were undecided.\u0026nbspThe majority (63.3 per cent) backed a second referendum when asked how the government could give people a say on the terms of Britain’s exit from the bloc, while 10.9 per cent suggested a public consultation.About 10 per cent said they trust the government to do a good job, and 7.4 per cent said the UK should just leave the EU.Kajal Odedra, executive director of change.org UK, said people feel “bombarded but gagged by Brexit”, regardless of whether they voted to leave or remain in the European Union.EU to decide whether Brits will need visas in event of no-deal BrexitVoters in most vulnerable Tory seats \u0027back fresh Brexit vote\u0027Every day takes us closer to giving the people the final say on BrexitThornberry says Labour could still back Final Say Brexit referendumCorbyn rejects calls for Final Say referendum, despite Labour backlashJohnson insists May can be forced into Final Say referendum on BrexitWriting exclusively for The Independent, Ms Odedra said: “The choices the government makes in negotiations are critical.\u0026nbsp“But they are being made far away from the public with no consultation whatsoever.\u0026nbsp“When we asked change.org users, only 7 per cent of those polled felt they have been given a chance for their voices to be heard since the referendum.“And 85 per cent felt they didn’t have any say in shaping the government’s Brexit strategy.”Leave voters were more likely to feel heard by ministers at about 23 per cent, while only 1.4 per cent of Remain voters said they had been listened to, according to the poll.Young people were also more likely to feel ignored than older voters, the findings show, with just 8.3 per cent of 16 to 24-year-olds reporting that they believe their voices are being heard.Around a quarter of over-65s said they felt listened to, compared to 20 per cent of those aged 55 to 64, and 10.5 per cent of 25 to 34-year-olds.It comes after a special parliamentary event heard that\u0026nbspmore people back a fresh referendum than oppose one in all of the 67 most marginal Tory seats.The YouGov survey of 25,000 people\u0026nbspalso found that a majority of voters in the Labour constituencies that voted Leave in 2016 now back a fresh referendum, by an average of 59 per cent in favour compared to 41 per cent against.It also comes as more than 3,000 people were expected to attend a major rally in London to urge\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbspto reject a bad Brexit deal.Cross-party MPs have backed the call,\u0026nbspincluding Tory Jo Johnson, who resigned from government last week over Theresa May’s Brexit strategy, Labour’s David Lammy and SNP\u0026nbspWestminster leader Ian Blackford.Liberal Democrat MP\u0026nbspLayla Moran, who backs the Best for Britain campaign,\u0026nbspsaid: “No one voted for this pathetic little deal which actually hands over our sovereignty, making the UK a rule taker rather than a rule maker. It is the opposite of taking back control.”Caroline Lucas, former Green party co-leader,\u0026nbspadded: “The only solution is to take the final decision out of the hands of deadlocked politicians, away from the backroom deals, and give it back to the public with a People’s Vote.“On Brexit, it’s clear we have a parliament in stalemate that can’t deliver a clear choice for the future. So it’s time to let the British public do it instead.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

She has also avoided a vote of no confidence in her leadership for the time being.Ms May will see European Commission president Mr Juncker in the late afternoon on Wednesday with talks focussing on details of the outline future relationship.On Thursday Ms May will also hold discussions with\u0026nbspthe chancellor of Austria, who holds the rotating presidency of the European Council.A Downing Street spokesperson\u0026nbspsaid the meetings should be seen as part of the\u0026nbspnegotiations on the outline “future framework” – the part of the Brexit deal broadly setting out the shape of post-Brexit\u0026nbsprelations with the EU.But it is the withdrawal agreement part of the Brexit deal – containing the controversial Irish backstop\u0026nbsp– that continues to cause No 10 problems at home.DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds renewed his call for Ms May to ditch her proposed version, saying: “With the rejection of the prime minister’s withdrawal agreement on all sides of the House and across all parties, it is increasingly clear this deal does not have support necessary to pass the meaningful vote in parliament.”In a sign that the Tories’ relationship with the DUP is crumbling, the Northern Irish party withheld their votes during parts of the Finance Bill on Monday.It emerged that former foreign secretary Boris Johnson – Ms May’s leadership rival – will attend the DUP’s conference in Belfast this weekend, as well as chancellor Philip Hammond representing the government.A large amount of opposition to Ms May’s deal is around what happens to keep the Irish border open if no new trading relationship has been fully agreed by the end of the transition period in December 2020.Until now the prime minister has said that the current withdrawal agreement includes two options, an extension to the transition period or the backstop, a form of customs union hated by Brexiteers because to leave it the UK needs the mutual consent of the EU.Created with Sketch.

It would be a huge upset if they did not sign the agreement.The Daily Mail and the  could save us from a hard BrexitThere will not be any negotiation on the withdrawal agreement and its controversial backstop – that, as far as the EU is concerned, is settled. Many countries have said as much publicly, in the face of cabinet Brexiteers demanding a rethink.But the second part of the deal, the future relationship, is far from sealed. If anything, EU states believe their negotiators might have given away too much to Britain: some are unhappy about concessions given with little in return, and want quid pro quos like guaranteed access to British waters for their fishing fleets.If there are changes there, things could get even trickier for the prime minister at home – but these are real countries fighting for their own interests, not fantasy negotiating partners only committed to making things easy for the prime minister.None of the details for the summit are finalised yet, with an agenda set to be released later this week. We’re not sure at this point whether actual negotiation will take place at it, or whether it will just be a glorified rubber stamp. Brussels is known to favour the latter.I was on holiday during the Brexit chaos – what did I miss?Legally, the summit has to take place, because only the European Council – that is the 27 leaders meeting together in Brussels – can sign off the deal and make the political declaration about the future relationship.Those in Brussels and other EU capitals do not like being seen to “meddle” in British politics, precisely because they know how poorly they are perceived.They mostly stayed out of the referendum, they accepted the result, and they have mostly declined to call for a rerun or anything to that effect.But it is possible some may break the habit of a lifetime at the gathering and urge British members of parliament to back the deal. If they do not do it directly, they might apply pressure through other means – perhaps by warning of the prospect of no deal if it is voted down.This will be a difficult sell, however. Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, said as recently as last week that Brexit could be stopped if Britain wanted. If the deal is voted down, staying in is still an option. And there is clearly not a majority for a no-deal departure in the House of Commons.But despite conspiracy theories from both some Brexiteers and the odd\u0026nbspRemainer, everyone around the summit table will want a deal – just not necessarily at any cost.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The star system is wrapped in an elegant spiral dust cloud, which is what makes it look so \u0026ldquospectacular, experts state. The two stars in question are Wolf-Rayet stars which are among the hottest of all the star types in the universe and the gas being produced is travelling at around 3,400 kilometres per second.                NASA announcement: Space agency teases return to the Moon and Mars                Aliens to be discovered in TWO decades top British scientist claimsNamed Apep, the two stars located around 8,000 light years away from Earth, are emitting vast amounts of hot winds and gasses, which is a sign they are at the end of their lives and will soon explode in a supernova.Professor Paul Crowther, of the University of Sheffield, who was involved in the study which was published in the journal Nature Astronomy, said: It remains a mystery how dust \u0026ndash similar to soot from a candle \u0026ndash forms in such harsh environments\u0026ldquoBut this newly discovered system is the most beautiful case seen to date.Professor Peter Tuthill, co-autgor of the study, added: \u0026ldquoWhen we saw the spiral dust tail we immediately knew we were dealing with a rare and special kind of nebula called a pinwheel.\u0026ldquoThe curved tail is formed by the orbiting binary stars at the centre, which inject dust into the expanding wind creating a pattern like a rotating lawn sprinkler.\u0026ldquoBecause the wind expands so much, it inflates the tiny coils of dust revealing the physics of the stars at the heart of the system.Co-author Dr Benjamin Pope from New York University, said: \u0026ldquoThe key to understanding the bizarre behaviour of the wind lies in the rotation of the central stars.\u0026ldquoWhat we have found in the Apep system is a supernova precursor that seems to be very rapidly rotating, so fast it might be near break-up.\u0026ldquo\u0027The rapid rotation puts Apep into a whole new class. Normal supernovae are already extreme events but adding rotation to the mix can really throw gasoline on the fire.The stars will eventually supernova (Image: )These types of stars have never before been discovered in the Milky Way, and Professor Tuthill says the explosion could be spectacular.He said: \u0026ldquoUltimately, we can\u0027t be certain what the future has in store for Apep.\u0026ldquoThe system might slow down enough so it explodes as a normal supernova rather than a gamma-ray burst.\u0026ldquoHowever, in the meantime, it is providing astronomers a ringside seat into beautiful and dangerous physics that we have not seen before in our galaxy.

The court heard the pair is now back together.The Manchester Crown Court heard Field had met Miss Beattie six years ago and later moved in with her and her two children aged 15 and 16.\u0026nbspBut prosecutor Simone Flynn said: Soon afterwards his behaviour became increasingly aggressive. On this particular occasion on July 27th last year she was at home with the defendant in the bedroom, and her two children were also in the house.An argument broke out between her and the defendant and she was shoved by the defendant with both hands in the chest area, and she staggered backwards. As she fell backwards she grabbed the door frame with her left hand fingers. But the defendant grabbed hold of the door and slammed it, which closed on her fingers, three to four times.On the first slam, she screamed and shouted at him. This didn\u0027t stop him and he continued to slam the door and she heard him shout: get out, I will kill you.\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoShe headed downstairs and she would later discover that she sustained a fractured finger. Twenty minutes later she returned to the bedroom to remove her clothes.The defendant begins throwing the clothes at her so she goes downstairs to the kitchen. Standing in the kitchen she leaned against the kitchen counter. The defendant then walked straight up to her and shoved her backwards, again with both hands in the chest area.The force used caused her head to fly backwards hitting the kitchen cupboard, accumulating in a long cut to the scalp, on the hairline above the right ear.Mother-of-two Joanne Beattie (Image: Joanne Beattie Cavendish Press)Police were called to the address, but the defendant had left. She was taken to Bolton Royal Hospital where her cut to her head was glued, and her finger was operated in, and a pin was inserted into the bone to ensure it was set properly.\u0026nbspThe couple reconciled and Field moved back on July 3 this year, another argument erupted between the two, and he went on the rampage around the property.\u0026nbspMiss Flynn added: He punched the walls and doors of the property and one door had to be replaced, costing \u0026pound300. He also caused damage to the bedroom and smashed the TV by throwing it outside.There was further damage to the shed and damage to the rear patio door costing \u0026pound700.

A total of 65 offences are recorded on his criminal record including offences of ABH, robbery with an imitation firearm and criminal damage.Whilst he was on bail for his attacks upon Miss Beattie he attended her address twice in two days.\u0026nbspOn the first occasion he claimed he wanted to pick up some clothes, but a row broke out and he threw her mobile phone at her.\u0026nbspThen on the second he got access to her Miss Beattie\u0027s home and smashed a mug during another argument.In mitigation defence lawyer Richard Dawson said: The past is the past, they remain in that relationship and wish for that relationship to continue. He has, at least, some degree of insight into these problems. These underlying issues need to be addressed so they can be tackled.If he was to be sent to custody, that will do little if anything to tackle these underlying issues. He needs constructive help in regards to tackling this domestic and violent behaviour. He does have underlying anger management difficulties. It is highly unlikely that will be tackled in a custodial environment.There is frustration, there was tension and an element of hostility. He will not be able to address these issues if he does not receive the support and help he needs, and he needs the correct approach in order to tackle these underlying issues, and in my submission, sending him to custody is not the correct approach.\u0026nbspThe couple is now back together (Image: Joanne Beattie Cavendish Press)Sentencing Judge Suzanne Goddard QC told Field: You have got a bad record and all that I have read about you shows you have serious anger management problems and that you don\u0027t know how to react appropriately to the stresses of life and relationships.There is never and excuse for shutting a door on someone\u0027s fingers. You say it was an accident, but you don\u0027t really understand exactly what problem you have got. On the the hand, the relationship is still on going and the reparation is that you are remorseful.With a degree of concern and because of the support of your family and partner, I am persuaded to take the option suggested by the probationary service. But I am going to keep a close eye on you.Field was also ordered to complete 25 days of rehabilitation requirement activities, attend a Building Better relationships programme and will complete 100 hours unpaid work.\u0026nbspHe was also issued with a restraining order prohibiting him from molesting Miss Beattie for a period of five years.Boses behind the BBR course says it is designed to promote lifelong changes in behaviours and attitudes which, in the past, have resulted in male service users being convicted of intimate partner violence.\u0026nbsp            "},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/22/183x122/1047853_1.jpg","title":"brexit news latest deal general election 2018 theresa may andrew bridgen","story":"Andrew Bridgen predicts Prime Minister Theresa May will deliver a General Election in the spring, adding the Conservatives have no majority in the House of Commons without the DUP\u0026rsquos support.

Options could include the BBC copying the Government scheme and paying for it.                BBC BLASTED: David Davis furious at plans to cut OAP free TV licenses But, it writes, that could cost around a fifth of our budget - the equivalent to what we spend today on all of BBC Two, BBC Three, BBC Four, the BBC News Channel, CBBC and CBeebies.That would mean over 75s would not have to pay, as at present, but we think it would fundamentally change the BBC because of the scale of service cuts we would need to make.Another option could be scrapping the free licence fee for over-75s.This would mean the BBC would not have to make significant cuts to BBC services, but would have an impact on those over 75s, particularly poorer pensioners, who currently do not pay, it says.The BBC says it could also reform the scheme in various ways including discounting the cost of a licence fee for older people, raising the age from 75 to 80, or introducing means-testing.The broadcaster said that it was not backing any particular option over another today, as it opened a three-month consultation.Its Board hopes to make a decision by the summer.BBC director-general Tony Hall said: This is an important decision.The scheme will include discounting the cost of a licence fee for older people (Image: )We have set out a range of options - each has merits and consequences, with implications for the future of the BBC, and for everyone, including older people.We need to hear views to help the BBC make the best and fairest decision.Sir David Clementi said: We will listen to their views and balance all the options and arguments before making a decision.Shadow media secretary Tom Watson called for the Government to step in and save TV licences for the elderly.TV licence for over 75s (Image: )The Government should never have privatised welfare policy in this way. Labour opposed this move from the start, he said.The prospect of elderly people losing their free TV licences makes a mockery of the claim that austerity is over, he said.It is expected that free TV licences would cost \u0026pound745 million a year by 202122.Economic consultants have said the cost of providing a free BBC service to over-75s would exceed \u0026pound1 billion a year in a decade\u0027s time.The Board of the giant broadcaster is hoping to make a decision by the summer (Image: Oli ScarffGetty Images)The corporation took over the cost from the Government of providing free TV licences for over-75s as part of its charter renewal negotiations.A spokesman for the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport said: We know people across the country value television as a way to stay connected with the world.The BBC will take on responsibility for free licences for the over-75s from 2020 and it is right that they\u0027ve confirmed no decisions will be taken until the public have been fully consulted.We\u0027ve been clear that we would want and expect them to continue with this important concession.Ultimately it is the BBC\u0027s responsibility to ensure its substantial licence fee income is used effectively to deliver fully for UK audiences.

Another lie.Macron said Europe should have its own armed forces to guard against interference from Russia, China and — the USA.What a rude and stupid statement to make in the run up to Armistice Day.When French people would do well to remember that it was us — and the Yanks — that saved their benighted country.Sometimes I wonderit was worth it.Trump was right on the case, with one of his famous tweets.He des­cribed Macron’s comments as insulting.And he added thatit wasn’t for the Americans, the French would be speaking German by now. Quite right.And he’s right, too, that the EU nations do not pull their weight when it comes to funding the real alliance against our real enemies, Nato.They all like to snipe from the sidelines at the USA.And resent the Americans for their power, influence and success.And for bailing them out of the last war.But then they expect the yanks to spend vast amounts of money protecting them all.Germany, one of the richest countries in the world, spends only . per cent of its GDP on forces for Nato. That is as pathetic as it is typical.The French themselves spend only . per cent.We’re second only to the Americans in our spending — but even then I would argue that it’s not enough.Our Armed Forces have been cut to the bone over the past two decades.Would we be able to retake the Falkland Islands now,Argentina invaded  I doubt it.The truth is that Nato is the one alliance of which we should be glad to be a member.It is an alliance of largely civilised, largely democratic countries which has held fast against tyrants, despots and warmongers for  years.Most notably, of course, the Cold War, in which the Soviet Union was defeated without a shot being fired.But now Trump is getting a bit tired of Nato because the US always has to spend, spend, spend.And with the Europeans thinking again of having an EU army there are many who think the days of Nato are numbered.That would be a terrible mistake.An EU army to replace Nato It would be bureau­cratic, incompetent and short-funded.And it would surrender before you could say “Macron”.THE Lord Mayor of Sheffield is a ludicrous dingbat called Magid Magid who has been coughed up from somewhere deep in the bowels of the Green Party.Shortly before Remembrance Day he posted a publicity shot of himself online wearing a white poppy and a T-shirt saying “never again!”A good moment, then, to ask the vital question: Have you ever met someone wearing a white poppy who wasn’t a complete and utter moron We wear red poppies to commemorate the terrible loss of le in battle.People wear white poppies to commemorate themselves and their fatuous sensibilities.It’s called showing off.WAGES have risen at the fastest rate for almost a decade.They went up by nearly three per cent in the three months to September, compared to a year earlier – and about time, too.

Suppose we had to submit to a trade and tarf regime designed solely to benefit the other .I hope both sides could agree that such an outcome would be the worst of all possible worlds. And yet, that is where we appear to have ended up.First, under the transition, we shall explicitly be non-voting members for two years.As Brussels has spelt out with brutal clarity, the only change will be that Britain loses its Commissioner, its MEPs and its vote in Council.Then, under the backstop, that status, or something very like it, will be imposed on us in semi-perpetuity.Surely no one — Remain or Leave — can favour such an outcome.I have been arguing since polling day for moderation.I was prepared to accept any compromise, including European Free Trade Association and including Chequers, provided it restored the supremacy of our laws.But the purgatory that now beckons is surely, by any definition, worse than either staying or leaving.From the start, our objective was simply to reach a deal — any deal.Our negotiators, shell-shocked by the referendum result, approached the talks in a spirit of damage limitation.They never seriously contemplated walking away, and the other side smelt their desperation.To be fair, our officials were not helped by the noises coming out of Westminster.How would you expect EU negotiators to react when senior British politicians urge them to hang tough and force a second referendum We might view Tony Blair, John Major and Nick Clegg as has-beens but, believe me, they are seen in Brussels as men of influence.So we fell into a pattern. Britain would make some new concession in the hope of unlocking a deal.Then Brussels would pocket the concession and demand more and — incredibly — British Remainers would cheer.The UK agreed to hand over more money than was due accepted the EU’s absurd and illogical sequencing made an unconditional security guarantee offered to copy EU standards and promised not to be more competitive than its neighbours.Each time, the EU brusquely demanded “more movement”. Each time, Britain rushed to comply.Which brings us to where we are — facing colonial rule from Brussels, of the sort the EU imposed on Bosnia following the Yugoslav war.I am not one of those Brexiteers who half-favoured no deal all along.On the contrary, I was proposing moderation even before the vote, and have repeated that call many times since.But, paradoxically, our reluctance to countenance no deal has made such an outcome likelier.We have reached the point where the terms on offer are less attractive than either a World Trade Organization-based Brexit or a second referendum. This last point is critical.I suspect that two contradictory arguments will now be wheeled out before wavering MPs.Europhiles will be told that the deal, backstop and all, is better than “crashing out” on WTO terms.Conversely, Eurosceptics will be told thatthey don’t approve the deal, Parliament might vote to extend Article , thus imperilling Brexit.These two lines of argument can’t both be true, of course and, in reality, neither of them is.We’re invited to believe thatBoris Johnson and Jo Johnson, from opposite ends of the Brexit spectrum, both oppose the deal, it can’t be too bad. In fact, both Johnsons oppose it because it is a lamentable failure of statecraft.Boris was no Brexit headbanger: He came out for Leave only after the EU refused to give David Cameron any powers back.And Jo is no Remoaner: He has spent two years in Government trying to deliver a reasonable Brexit. If neither of them will back the deal, that tells us something.There is still time — just — to recover our position.As things stand, the backstop has no legal force.The moment it finds its way into a treaty, it will be binding. If any MPs oppose the current approach, now is their chance to act. There won’t be another.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

So he refused to hold it.His successor Gordon Brown, never big on honesty when a lie served him better, pretended this Lisbon Treaty was too insignicant to bother voters with.The EU is founded on deceit. “When it becomes serious, you have to lie,” says President Jean-Claude Juncker. Voters are bullied into reversing inconvenient referendums or denied a say at all.And so to Mrs May, the Brexit deal her Cabinet agreed last night and the revealing EU leak yesterday which makes crystal-clear Brussels’ intentions to keep us in its vice-like grip for ever.That plan being to lock us into its Customs Union for all time, unable to make our own trade deals, powerlessly swallowing its orders and obeying its rules.Our Government knows we cannot legally escape this central pillar of the EU — which we voted to “leave”, remember — without consent from Brussels that it will never give.This is not some minor afterthought, to be bargained away, which is why MPs rejected it in July.

Preferably driving John Barrowman’s jeep.But definitely presenting I’m A Celebrity . . . Get Me Out Of Here! which kicked off, on Sunday night, with Dec hosting and Holly ­Willoughby hanging around like a competition winner.An arrangement that would be unsustainable in other years. I’m prepared to cut the  series some slack, though, for two reasons.First, it is purely a temporary pairing and, second, ITV has promised me Noel Edmonds, who shouldn’t just have been the first one in the camp, he should’ve been choppered in about eight years ago, when the contestants started all this “bonding” rubbish, which has ruined more series than I care to remember.Oh, what some of them could’ve done with a one-man feud generator like Noel, whose Wikipedia entry will give you a fair idea of his inner turmoil even before you get to the bit where he says: “When I die, my energy willto where it came from.” Ilford He’s also got a le-size mannequin doll called Candice, who accompanies him everywhere and would be a more than welcome replacement for a few of the camp mates, who’ve got a bit of a Rita Who and Knob Too feel about them this year.The knob part of that equation, fairly obviously, is all-singing, all-dancing John Barrowman “MBE” , who described himself as “fabulous”, “an icon” and “down-to-earth” within the space of one sentence, on Sunday, and was wrong on every count.He also hit on the yacht waiter, using one of his dance moves.“It’s a pas de bourrée. Kick ball, change and turn. Can you do that ”“I’m not allowed.”Not even the kick balls bit Shame. He needs someone to calm him down.Although, as horrendous as it must be to live with, I don’t mind Barrowman on I’m A Celeb, as the show does need a massive irritant to get under everyone’s skin.On similar grounds, I also welcome EastEnders’ Rita Simons, who looks like she might have a tantrum or two in her, Nick Knowles, who will be incapable of stling his Sir Galahad complex, and Harry Redknapp, just because he’s Harry Redknapp.Of the others The public jury’s probably still out on Emily Atack and The Chase Governess Anne Hegerty, who “used to be a Brownie”, as well as eating a lot of them.Mentally, though, I have already completely written off Coronation Street’s Sair Khan, some bloke off Hollyoaks, The Vamps’ James McVey and X Factor’s Fleur East, who arrived dressed as a dispatch rider for the first episode.Possibly for the very good reason she’s now working as one.This might sound like a hasty and fairly damning assessment, I realise, but compared to some series, four solidly promising bookings isn’t actually a bad .What it very clearly needs, though, is Edmonds, because, without him, Sunday’s opening episode, for all its high adrenaline thrills, became a bit of a drag.It usually does, of course, as the celebs haven’t yet let their guard drop.But, in this instance it meant the spotlight fell on Holly Willoughby, and you quickly realised Dec hasn’t had to work this hard since he tried bouncing jokes off Hogan the Koala.Just as Edmonds could turn out to be a massive disappointment, Holly Willoughby could get the hang of I’m A Celeb, obviously.At the moment, though, her one signicant contribution came after the parachuting challenge when she asked: “How come Shane had a helmet and Emily didn’t ”’Cos the bloke was doing all the hard work and she was just hanging around.Buckle up, Dec.Alastair Campbell’s far-too-frequent Good Morning Britain appearances always proving as welcome as a turd in a swimming pool.Strictly stars forever banging on about reaching Blackpool without ever mentioning it means they get paid more.Every wretched, product-placing second of the entertainment on Friday’s Children In Need.And particularly EastEnders’ big song-and-dance routine, which had the Disney Company’s Angela Affinita claiming: “We have Letitia Dean actually interacting with Mickey Mouse.”Good luck with that one, Mickey.IF you want to know just how brutally British republicans would mistreat the Royal Family,they ever came to power, just take a look at what those who claim to love them the most do to the Windsors now.Stuff like We Are Most Amused And Amazed, a th birthday tribute, hosted by Armstrong  Miller, on ITV, that probably left the future King Charles III thinking Charles I got off lightly.Two hours of canned laughter and pick-a-card-any-card magical tw*ttery with the likes of Sandi Toksvig, who took  seconds to remind us she’s gay, Omid Djalili, who took an entire  seconds to remind us he’s Iranian, and Rowan Atkinson, who rather set the evening’s tone by announcing: “As the more perceptive of you will have noticed, this is hell.”There was a family of German illusionists as well, which I thought was a bit insensitive, given the royal circumstances, plus Sooty  Sweep and a lot of grovelling from randoms, like Cheryl Tweedy and Kylie Minogue.Presumably because they could both be guaranteed to keep a straight face when describing the birthday boy as “a style icon” and “philanthropist”.Then, at the end of it all, dear old Charles shuffled on, waved and thanked everybody.And he may even have meant every syllable of it as well, given that Alexander Armstrong thrilled the Palladium crowd by deciding not to sing.Truly, the Royal Family is the most wondrous thing.Jenny Eclair: “The last thing any woman needs, during or after the menopause, is a bothersome vagina.”Tough, you’ve got one for another  minutes.MEANWHILE, desperate times call for desperate means at the rugby, as England trail Japan - and Sir Clive Woodward suggests: “We’ve got to start using our physicality, just outside the rucks, to suck these Japanese guys.”A WELCOME antidote to all of the lazy, repetitive, biased, hideously self-satisfied and right-on comedy broadcast by the BBC and Channel  finally reappeared, on Saturday night.Michael McIntyre’s Big Show, on BBC, which has to be the most perfectly judged hour of television, all year.A quota-free joy that’s warm, funny and has mainstream appeal, without ever being too cloying, safe, predictable or slick, as you will have noticed when Lionel Blair completely sabotaged the “Unexpected Star” reveal, in a pop-up Zimmer frame shop, with -year-old David Owen.“Say hello to David,” McIntyre whispered into his ear-piece.“Hello David!”Pause. “How does he know my name’s David ”Well, quite. Among his other gts, though, Michael McIntyre, above, has the ability to charm and ad-lib his way out of these situations, which gives his Big Show a seat-of-its-pants feel, despite being one of the most carefully structured formats on television.As anyone with a brain can see, in fact, it should be the blueprint for almost everything BBC comedy does.So I can pretty much guarantee, this time next year, Have I Got News, The Mash Report and Frankie Boyle’s New World Order will still be telling us how much they hate Brexit and Donald Trump and someone from the BBC, on £, a year, will be assuring licence-payers: “Sara Pascoe is the future of comedy.”Pointless Celebrities: “Hi, I’m Luisa Omielan and I’m a comedian.” Bless.And Good Morning Britain, Susanna Reid: “I don’t think the word ambition applies to me. I don’t have any ambition.”WHO said the following on live TV, last week “The colon has been mobilised and we’re very close to the moment the bowel’s coming out.”A Nicky Campbell on Channel ’s Removing The Tumour B Theresa May in Downing Street Joe Lycett: “Measuring the strength of earth-quakes, the Richter scale was invented by Charles who ”The Chase, Bradley Walsh: “Between Newcastle and Gateshead, the King Edward Bridge spans what river ”And Joe Lycett: “Nicola Sturgeon, a Scot or a fish ”Kristy: “A fish.”MICHAEL McIntyre’s Big Show. Paddy Considine, Jessica Raines and Bel Powley all performing brilliantly in BBC’s Informer.Channel ’s strangely addictive and reassuring live operations series, with Nicky Campbell.Prime-Minister-in-waiting Johnny Mercer MP breezing through Celebrity Hunted, without dear old Kay Burley to encumber him.Scotland playing olé football against the mighty Albania.And the politically incorrect brilliance of the response Chase contestant Bethan gave to Bradley Walsh’s question: “The name of what German ­company comes from the name of founder Adolf Dassler ”“Hitler.”Compiled by Graham WrayGary Neville: “Lingard has his hands in his head.”Michael Dawson: “It’s an unexpected start for Spurs because they didn’t expect that.”Trevor Bayliss: “We’ve come to Sri Lanka to play in conditions which are foreign to us.”And Paul Merson: “A poor finish from Vardy, but that’s him at his best.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

but they show up on Google Earth satellite images.Study leader Professor Stephen Martin, from the University of Salford, said: These mounds were formed by a single termite species that excavated a massive network of tunnels to allow them to access dead leaves to eat safely and directly from the forest floor.The amount of soil excavated is over  cubic kilometres, equivalent to , great pyramids of Giza, and represents one of the biggest structures built by a single insect species.The scientists collected soil samples from the centres of  mounds and used dating technology to estimate their age.The results, published in the journal Current Biology, showed the mounds were between  and , years old.Termite mounds have a complex inner structure with numerous shafts and tunnels that serve as a ventilation system for underground nests.The constructions investigated by the scientists are not abandoned ancient relics.Their builders, all members of the termite species Syntermes dirus, still inhabit large colonies incorporating as many as  mounds, the study found.Prof Martin added: Its incredible that, in this day and age, you can find an unknown biological wonder of this sheer size and age still existing, with the occupants still present.Many questions about the termite colonies remain unanswered, said the researchers.For instance, attempts to explore the colonies with a fibre optic scope had failed to locate a single royal chamber housing the termite queen.The mounds were also distributed in a strangely regular way that did not appear to be driven by aggressive encounters between neighbouring colonies."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT000385907645.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"vape at work mps say","story":"According to the All-Party Parliamentary Group for Vaping , employers should provide designated indoor vaping areas - including in the Houses of Parliament.They want vaping to be more acceptable around the workplace with proper vaping policies for businesses and public places to be put in place in a bid to tackle misunderstandings about the practice.The group believes that guidelines for reasonable vaping etiquette should be drawn up and that all outside areas should be available to vapers unless theres a legitimate safety or professional reason to stop it.APPGV chairman Mark Pawsey said that Britains current anti-vaping culture created a  impression among the public that passive vaping was as harmful as passive smoking.Indeed, this lack of understanding was very evident in Parliament itself, a place many will look to for an example.There are only two designated vaping locations, and despite being a member for eight years, I still have no idea where either of these locations are, he said.Both of the sites are outside and given the size of the Parliament Estate could be a signicant distance away from an employee or visitors location, MPs stated.It comes after council bosses in Dundee banned staff from vaping anywhere during work hours -

In prison,  per cent of people smoke.If vaping really is  per cent safer, that could see a massive reduction in the , smoke-related deaths we see in England every year.Daniel Pryor, Head of Programmes at the Adam Smith Institute told The Sun: Britain’s businesses should make it as easy as possible for smokers to switch to e-cigs, which are at least  per cent safer than cigarettes.The latest scientic evidence shows no risks from so-called passive vaping, so letting vapers use their devices considerately indoors is a no-brainer for public health and personal freedom.Not having to pop out for a puff in the pouring rain could make the dference between someone stopping smoking using an e-cig and their quit attempt ending in failure.And stopping could make the dference between living a long and healthy le, or dying early of cancer.The New Nicotine Alliancehas welcomed the Parliamentary report, with its chair, Sarah Jakes, saying: The Parliamentary estate becoming vape-friendly would send a strong message to other employers and venue owners that vapers should be encouraged, not harassed, and would help to educate the public that vapers are simply former smokers doing something that is good for their health.There are currently . million vapers in the UK, . million of whom have quit smoking entirely using e-cigarettes.This has contributed to the rate of smoking prevalence plummeting, but many smokers are still hesitant due to misperceptions surrounding vaping.More liberal workplace policies can have the dual benefit of correcting these misperceptions while also providing a more encouraging environment for vapers to prevent relapse, as well as for smokers considering vaping instead.Back in August, MPs called for e-cigs to be made free on the NHS as a key weapon in the health services stop-smoking arsenal."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT000450794290.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"tiger farm czech republic fur stock cubes","story":"The secret raid - dubbed Operation Trophy - was the culmination of years of work by agencies working together across the Czech Republic.Sickened inspectors found one freshly killed tiger and a chest freezer stuffed full of rotting remains when they swooped on the lucrative operation in Prague.They later discovered that bones turned into stock cubes were worth up an incredible £ per gram - which is the equivalent of £, per ounce.Inidual claws ripped from the cats powerful paws are worth nearly £ and a full pelt can fetch up to £, on the Czech black market.The demand for traditional medicines containing tiger products was driven in part by the countrys Vietnamese population.Those involved in the operation now fear the discovery points to a wider problem in Europe, reports the .At a press conference, Robert Šlachta from the Customs Directorate uncovered more details about the horrying case.“The tiger we discovered was shot in the eye and in the neck, so that the skin would stay intact and could be sold on the black market, he said.The cooking of the tiger meat took five to twelve days and all parts of the animal, including the pelts, teeth or claws, were intended for commercial purposes.”The investigation - which started five years ago - was carried out in close cooperation with the Czech Environmental Inspectorate.Its head, Erik Geuss, says the illegal trade in tigers has rapidly become a growing problem in the country.“In recent years, we have observed an increase in the illegal export of tigers and other felines from the Czech Republic, he revealed.This is because there is quite a large Asian community living in the Czech Republic and there is a substantial demand for tiger products in that region.“There are currently around  tigers registered by CITES in the Czech Republic but only around  of them live in zoological gardens.And while tigers kept in zoos live to around the age of , those kept by private breeders only live around five years.”Pavla Rihova, the lead environmental inspector on the scene, said she had never seen anything like it.“I have been working for the inspectorate  years … but the situation there was really horrible, she said.If you can imagine: an old freezer, without electricity, full of meat and dead bodies, in the garden for two years.

Even at these levels, smoking is not a major risk factor for this rare disease.MPs have previously called for e-cigarettes to be free on the NHS as a stop smoking device.E-cigarettes are less harmful than conventional smoking and the two should not be treated as the same, according to a report by the Science and Technology Committee .Public Health England estimates suggest e-cigarettes are at least  per cent less harmful than smoking.Around . million Brits use e-cigarettes, and its thought , use them as an aid to stop smoking.A report from the All-Party Parliamentary Group for Vapingtoday sugguests employers should provide designated indoor vaping areas - including in the Houses of Parliament.They want vaping to be more acceptable around the workplace with proper vaping policies for businesses and public places to be put in place in a bid to tackle misunderstandings about the practice"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT000450770414.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"mini home tiny house new york devasa","story":"These images show the unfurnished interior of the  sq ft portable home, with its wood-led walls and floors, as well as stairs leading to the second floor.Other shots show the tiny home from outside in its normal guise and with the roof extended to allow access upstairs.The Devasa, as it’s known, is legally towable and once parked up and expanded, can sleep a family of four.On the first level there is a kitchen, a smallish living room and a bathroom, with the bedrooms on the second level.The Devasa’s roof is raised and lowered by four motorized screw jacks located on each corner.This can be done using a car battery via the towing bar but should the battery die or the motor fail, it is possible to operate the jacks manually.The Devasa is work of the family-owned house designers behind Tiny House NYC and is currently on sale for around £,.We are a family-owned-and-operated business based in New York City, says the company.Our mission is to provide financial freedom for those seeking to go tiny.The world has changed a lot since the great recession, and from that tragedy came the need for alternative solutions to combat rising home costs, debt and stagnant wages.Many see the tiny house movement as a lestyle.

I do think its now or never.Mr Rees-Mogg also argued that rebels had to move now - otherwise Mrs May might lead the Tories towards another catastrophic defeat.He said: I think it is now or the Prime Minister will lead the Conservatives into the next election.And getting the deal through on the back of Labour votes would split the party and the country, he added.Deep isions in the Brexiteer camp has harmed the coup - with anger that major figures including Priti Patel, Iain Duncan Smith and Sir Bernard Jenkin had not publicly backed the plot, even though they have trashed Mrs Mays deal already.The Sun revealed a bitter new row erupted as some accused others of trying to oust Mrs May because they want peerages.Senior Eurosceptics had warned that yesterday was the moment of truth for the PM as they urged more MPs to hand in their letters.Only  have gone public with them so far amid fears that toppling Mrs May could collapse the entire Government and let Jeremy Corbyn into power.Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned overnight that it would risk the most appalling chaos and could even stop us from getting through to the other side of Brexit.THERESA Mays new plan to scrap the contentious Irish backstop using technology would not be enough to win over Brexit rebels, David Davis declared today.The ex-Brexit Secretary said the alternative arrangements proposal to keep the border open was a material movement forward.But he added: It isnt by itself enough.Mr Davis said plans for regulatory alignment in the future framework would to tie British industry to the EUs rules forever.And securing a free trade agreement with the EU is much, much more important than a customs union.Asked about plans for alternative arrangements to avoid having to use the backstop altogether - revealed in today’s Sun - Mr Davis said: There’s also the question about regulatory compliance as well and that is very important to businesses.We are likely to be in the lead in things like articial intelligence, genetics and so on. We cannot be a world leader in those industriessomebody  writes the regulations for us.Similarly, it is not just a Northern Ireland border issue that determines when we get out of a customs union, it is also the question of the customs arrangements that the government has proposed.Many people think this is either impossible or would take five or ten years to put in place. That is also unacceptable.His sentiment was backed up by MP Michael Fabricant, who said today: I shall be voting against [the deal] in the Division Lobby. Pen and paper not required. A botched coup will merely strengthen the Remainers.It was revealed this morning that Mrs May will fly to Brussels for afternoon tea with Jean Claude Juncker tomorrow as she desperately tries to seal off her hated deal.Today the PM got a boost from Bank of England boss Mark Carney as he came out in favour of her Brexit plan.The Bank governor told MPs he welcomed the transition arrangements in the withdrawal agreement.And he warned the chance of a No Deal outcome is uncomfortably high, adding that it would cause an economic shock across the UK and EuropeMeanwhile, this morning Mrs May faced down unhappy Brexiteers in her Cabinet for the first time since they reluctantly signed off her agreement.The Prime Minister hosted the weekly meeting in No with her recently reshuffled top team, following a string of high profile resignations last week which almost toppled her.The meeting took much longer than planned, and was said to focus on the future trade deal with the EU Mrs May will now hope to seal.Last night the so-called Pizza Club Plotters, who were due to meet to try and force her hand, backed down amid splits.Andrea Leadsom reportedly told the PM during todays Cabinet: Prime Minister, I don’t even like pizza!Mr Gove is now said to want to draw up plans for a revised Brexit deal in the event that Mrs Mays agreement gets voted down in the Commons next month - but Mrs Leadsom was keen to keep up the pressure on the PM ahead of this weekends crunch summit.But Brexiteer John Redwood tried to put pressure on the unhappy Brexit cabinet ministers to quit, saying they would be better off resigning together than vote for the unacceptable agreement.Mrs Mays spokesman insisted senior ministers are now absolutely united on Brexit, adding: Everybody is backing the Prime Minister to get the best possible deal for the country.EU leaders will meet this weekend in Brussels to likely sign, seal and deliver Mrs Mays hard-won deal.If they agree on it, it will go to the Commons for a crunch vote in the coming weeks.But the pressure will be ramped up today after the DUP fired another warning shot to the PM last night by siding with Labour on a key Budget vote.As part of the deal with the Northern Irish party, they agreed to vote with the Conservatives on all finance matters - but last night they abstained on every vote and even sided with the Opposition on one.DUPs Sammy Wilson told Newsnight: You’ve got to keep your side of the bargain, otherwise we don’t feel obliged to keep ours.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The MP - who was accused of misleading Parliament over the welfare shake-up Universal Credit - has retweeted messages calling herself gutsy and dignied.

The hardline Northern Irish party are effectively on strike, tearing up their voting deal with the Government and vowing to abstain on Budget votes for a second day running. It leaves Theresa May seven votes short of an effective majority in the House of Commons and vulnerable to defeatsonly a few Tory rebels abstain or side with the opposition. DUP sources tonight told the Mirror their Westminster MPs planned to continue abstaining in votes on the Finance Bill in protest over Mrs May’s Brexit deal. After the votes were pulled, a Labour MP told the Mirror it was extraordinary. They said: We all ran over to vote and were told they had caved...!! The hardline Northern Irish party had promised to vote with the Government on key legislation, in a pact worth pound billion after the PM lost her majority at last year’s election.   The party, led by Arlene Foster, are opposed to Mrs May’s draft Brexit deal, which they say creates a ‘border’ down the Irish Sea. The DUP’s deputy leader Nigel Dodds urged Mrs May to “work towards a better deal” for the good of the Union. He said: “The Government will require DUP support to deliver its domestic agenda. We will continue to use our influence for the good of everyone across the United Kingdom.” DUP MP Sammy Wilson said Mrs May’s government had “torn up” promises made over Brexit, and the party “had to do something to show our displeasure.” Mr Dodds said that the agreement with Conservatives committed theDUPto pursue the shared objectives of strengthening the Union and seeking a Brexit that benefits all parts of the UK.   While theDUPhad kept to our word on the agreement, the resignation of several Conservative ministers showed that Mrs Mays deal does not represent those shared objectives, he said. He added: The Government will requireDUPsupport to deliver its domestic agenda. We will continue to use our influence for the good of everyone across the United Kingdom. If the Government can look beyond a Withdrawal Agreement, which is uniting people from across the political spectrum against it, and instead work towards a better deal, then an outcome can be delivered that truly works to benefit all parts of the United Kingdom. Both Brexiteer Boris Johnson and Chancellor Philip Hammond are due to attend theDUPs conference at the weekend, according to Co Fermanagh newspaper the Impartial Reporter.

Tory MP Steve Baker said there is “a tactical disagreement” among supporters of the hardline European Research Groupof Tory Brexiteers, over when to force a no-confidence vote in Mrs May’s leadership. Jacob Rees-Mogg, who chairs the group, called on supporters to submit letters to Tory backbench chief Sir Graham Brady on Thursday. But they have so far failed to muster the  letters needed to trigger a vote. Mr Baker, a senior figure in the ERG, said today the group was split over whether to trigger the vote now or after Mrs May loses the Commons ‘meaningful vote’ on her Brexit deal.  He said the holdouts “want to defeat the Prime Minister, and they think they’re more likely to defeat the PM after she’s lost the meaningful vote. “That’s what’s holding back quite a material number of colleagues.” “But the letters are slowly going in,” he added. “I received a call last night to say that a letter had gone in. “So obviously it’s not the case that Jacob and I’s word is not enough to sht the Conservative Party, I would have been surprisedit had been. “But everybody faces grave choices.”  Asked why the letters had not materialised at the same event, a press conference by ERG-linked group Global Britain, Mr Rees-Mogg said: Patience is a virtue, virtue is a grace. We will see what letters come in due time. He added: Do  want to come with me or not  I may find that they dont or they dont do it today but when we get the meaningful vote. Thats a decision for them. Mr Rees-Mogg denied he was trying to mount a coup against Mrs May, insisting he was using the legitimate processes of party democracy. Theresa May has a Brexit deal, but the danger is looming that it will be defeated in the House of Commons. Even getting it past her Cabinet forced Esther McVey and Dominic Raab to resign. Now she faces two more hurdles - an EU summit with  leaders on November , and then the vote in Parliament at some point before Christmas. MPs are grouped in several factions - their warring opinions are explained more fully here. But or more vote against the deal, they will defeat the deal. Against the deal TORY BREXITEERS: There are up to  , led by Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg. They will vote down a deal that keeps Britain trapped in vassalage with Brussels. TORY HARD REMAINERS: Only about a dozen, but many - including Justine Greening and Jo Johnson - will vote against, instead wanting a second referendum. DUP: Theresa Mays Northern Irish allies - who she handed pound.bn - are -strong. They will vote down the dealit allows customs checks between Ulster and Britain. LABOUR LOYALISTS: About  MPs are consistently loyal to Jeremy Corbyn on Brexit. The party has confirmed theyll be told to vote against the deal because it doesnt meet Labours six tests. LABOUR REMAINERS: There are about  hard Remainer Labour MPs. Theyre likely to oppose the deal to avoid enabling a Brexit.OTHERS: The SNP , Lib Dems , Plaid Cymruand Greensare all likely to vote against. For the deal TORY LOYALISTS: Well over  are likely to vote with Theresa May, for the deal. Many have paid government jobs - so would have to quitthey oppose her. NERVOUS LABOUR: Some Labour MPs could BACK a deal - fearing otherwise Britain will be plunged into an even worse No Deal. There could be  or more. Caroline Flint is among them. UnknownLABOUR BREXITEERS: There are only about half a dozen. It was generally thought theyd side with Theresa May, but Kate Hoey MP broke ranks and said she could vote against. Askedhis attempt to unseat the PM had been exposed as a Dads Army operation, Mr Rees-Mogg replied: Ive always admired Captain Mainwaring. Mr Baker added: “Two things have happened. Colleagues have consulted their associations, I don’t know what those conversations have yielded. “But also there’s been an enormous whipping operation over the weekend, including senior members of the voluntary party talking to members of parliament about what they’re doing, so I don’t know how opinion will have changed.

She was given her guide dog Goldie five years ago and she is now her constant companion. She said: Access was refused on the basis it was unhygienic due to the carvery, this was despite the fact there was sufficient space at the opposite side of the cafe. My eight-year-old nephew even chose to speak up and wanted to call the police saying it wasnt fair. I will be taking all the appropriate legal action required and also want to urge you to think twice about whether this is a place you want to spend your money at. Please support me and other Guide Dog owners by avoiding this place at all costs. I left feeling degraded and embarrassed. Avoid, avoid, avoid.  The cafe had a notice in the window advising that small well behaved dogs were permitted entry from Monday to Saturday but on Sundays were not allowed due to hygiene reasons. The notice said: Small well behaved dogs allowed from Monday to Saturday. Unfortunately, we cannot allow dogs on Sundays for hygiene reasons as the Carvery is served in the main seating area. Please note, dogs must be kept on the floor and not be able to reach the tables where good is served. All dogs welcome on outside on the terrace area. Laurens Facebook post has been shared over  times by other concerned iniduals.  Weston Beach Cafe posted a statement on Facebook: It is with much regret that I must make this statement concerning a person being refused entry to our cafe with a guide dog. I have spoken to the waitress that refused the customer entry and she is adamant that at no time did the dog owner identy her dog as being a guide dog. I myself asked why she felt that it was discriminatory to refuse a dog entry, at which point she identied that she is blind and her dog is a guide dog. I immediately offered the group an inside table to which she replied, I dont want to now. It is very unfortunate that the lady feels she was discriminated against. We have ALWAYS allowed guide dogs inside the cafe, even during peak season. Im currently having the CCTV footage reviewed and a copy will be made available to any parties concerned to resolve this misunderstanding. It is understandable that the lady was very upset to be refused entry due to our dog policy, but I feel this could have been avoided had she identied her dog as being a guide dog upon entering. A spokesperson for Guide Dogs said: It is always distressing for a guide dog owner to be refused the access they are entitled to by law and we are saddened to hear about this incident.

Tipping the paperboy and binmen and even watching a James Bond film on December th are no longer part of the festive routine. Researchers who carried out a detailed study found time and financial pressures are to blame along with a fear of not wanting to give the impression of being old fashioned. Overall more than half the , adults who took part expressed a belief that old traditions are falling by the wayside.  The stats show just a third of Brits will hang a wreath on their door this year, and only  per cent will put up a Christmas tree. Amazingly, one in four will NOT enjoy a Christmas dinner with all the trimmings this year. In fact, only seven in  are planning a traditional giving and receiving of gts. British Corner Shop – who export products to Brits around the world – carried out the in-depth research. A spokeswoman said: “Our research found there are lots of classic traditions that appear to be falling by the wayside.  “In fact, what we consider to be ‘traditional’ Christmas customs may no longer have a place at the Christmas of the future. “However, where old traditions die off, new ones are coming up to take their place – and there are still lots of old traditions that are as popular as ever.” It also emerged one tenth of festive Brits are set to watch a James Bond film on television – often a staple part of a long Christmas afternoon slumped in front of the TV. And just one in seven plan to have a nativity scene taking pride of place in their front room. Fewer than one in  plan to do Christmas carolling this season, and only five per cent will take part in Christingle. Nearly eight in  adults think that people have fewer interactions with friends and neighbours as a result of traditional Christmas activities decline.  And the majority of Brits believe that as years go by, Christmas gets less special, with the Christmas spirit peaking at age , then petering out. Of more modern traditions that have come to prominence in recent years, a fth of Brits now take part in a ‘Secret Santa’. And three in  love wearing novelty Christmas jumpers, with a further one in five visiting German Christmas markets in the run-up to the big day. A huge  per cent of respondents believe Christmas seems to start earlier and earlier every year, with eight in  Brits wishing it would revert to its old values. The study also uncovered the key dferences in how younger and older Brits will choose to celebrate Christmas this year. While the Christmas dinner remains the focal point for the day, and the festive event Brits cannot do without regardless of age, there were some key dferences.  Brits aged  to  are more likely to prioritise putting up a Christmas tree to mark the occasion. They are also more inclined to watch a Christmas film, open an advent calendar in the run up to the big day and listen to Christmas songs, according to the OnePoll study. Brits over the age of  prefer to celebrate by eating mince pies, hanging a wreath on their door and going for a post-dinner walk to burn off some calories. British Corner Shop’s spokeswoman added: “Young or old, some things are so quintessentially Christmas we couldn’t be without them. “While the entirety of the Christmas season is made up of a patchwork of traditions, nothing is more vital to the experience than friends and family gathering around the table for the most indulgent supper of the year.” Christmas traditions on the wane - and percentage of nation who WILL adopt them this year- Send a letter to Father Christmas through the fire - %- Christingle - %- Drink eggnog - %- Put a sixpence or penny in a Christmas pudding - %- Going out to sing Christmas Carols - %- Decorate a gingerbread house - %- Donate a shoebox to charity- %- Watch a James Bond film - %- Set fire to the Christmas pudding - %- Go to the Christmas pantomime - %- Hang mistletoe - %- Give a tip to your postman or binman - %- Have a nativity scene - %- Put holly and ivy up - %- Leave a mince pie and carrots out for Santa and his reindeer - %- Have a real Christmas tree - %- Drink mulled wine - %- Watch The Queens Speech - %- Put a stocking out - %- Go for a post-Christmas dinner walk - %"},{"url":null,"title":"dad would lie foetal position","story":"NewsDad would lie in foetal position shaking after we and sons died in house fireJohn Bickley, , said said he fell into a \"deep black hole\" after losing his family in a blaze at their home Anglesey, North WalesShareCommentsBySteve RobsonAbigail OLeary:,  NOV Updated:,  NOV NewsJohn and Heather Bickley on their wedding day in St Lucia \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA father has described the agony of living without his we and two young sons who died in a horric house fire. John Bickley said he would curl up in the foetal position shaking after losing we Heather, , and sons Felix, , and Oscar, six, in the blaze at their home Anglesey, North Wales. The grieving father, now , said he fell into a deep black hole as he tried to cope with unimaginable grief after the tragedy in . A fire investigation determined the blaze was caused by a freezer motor overheating in the utility room, reports the Manchester Evening News. It is believed Mrs Bickley, who worked as a staff nurse at North Manchester Hospital before becoming a detective in North Wales Police, and her children were overcome by smoke as they tried to flee. An inquest heard how Mr Bickley, , was out at work at the time and came back to find fire crews battling the blaze in vain.  A coroner later ruled all three were accidental deaths - adding that the house did not have a working smoke alarm fitted that may have saved their lives. John, a cabinetmaker originally from Prestwich, has told how he struggled to cope with the deep black hole of grief he found himself in. Writing for the Manchester Evening News, John has opened up about how he coped with the pain after managing to find love again. Wed laugh so much it hurt Heather spent her whole le in public service, first at North Manchester Hospital as a Staff Nurse following which she was a serving police officer in the North Wales Police for  years. She was uncomplicated, principled and loving, creating a wonderful family home for us all. My we was truly the rock and driving force behind our family. She adored Christmas which would start the day after her birthday on the November  and wouldnt end until I urged her to take down the decorations as we approached the end of January. This week she would have been just fty-four. As another Christmas approaches her presence is very strong - I can see her crazily filling our home with tinsel and lights and so much love, having the time of her le.  Felix was very sporty. He loved swimming, karate, playing football and dreamed of playing for Liverpool. I have wonderful memories of spending time together sitting at a mountain top cafe drinking his favourite hot chocolate, on a rest from skiing. Believing he’d actually flown a space ship to Mars after a ride in Disney World and sitting on my shoulders as we danced at a Florence and The Machine concert, just a few weeks before he died. He was so competitive and couldn’t bear losing to his younger brother. He had a maturity beyond his years and was such wonderful company when you had him to yourself. We’d talk for hours together. Oscar at , was still a little boy, who’d not yet lived any sort of le. He was such a sweet natured boy, very happy to sit and play lego for hours, always wanting to please, and he never complained about anything. He used to call Felix ‘seesaw’ before he could pronounce his name properly and adored his older brother, always trying to copy him. During the last six months of his le we bought a large trampoline which he absolutely loved to jump around on. Every night he’d want me to jump on it with him too. He was so studious and clever.  One of the best memories I have of my sons is when we would go on any journey and they would sit together at the front of my van. They just loved sitting high up as we all sang together at the top of our voices to lots of dferent music. We’d laugh so much it hurt. At night I would curl up in the foetal position, violently shaking My emotional state after the fire was severely shut down with the trauma. I couldn’t cope with any contact with anyone other than close friends and family, for fear of breaking down. I was incapable of personal interaction. I felt like I was in a deep black hole with no emotional strength to get out of it. I would run daily in an effort to keep moving and to exhaust myself in the hope I would sleep at night and be able to remove myself from the reality of my le. I had to keep moving because to sit still would risk being smothered by their deaths. I could barely breath sometimes. At night time I would curl up in the foetal position violently shaking as the reality of my le descended. We take for granted how precious le is  The inquest was brutal. The Coroner made clear that had smoke alarms been in situ my family may have survived. The seat of the fire was established to be an electrical fault in a fridge which had been left by the previous owners of the house. We always think it won’t happen to us. We take for granted how precious le is and somehow mistakenly believe that tragedies are suffered by others. But one minute my beautul family were larger than le, full of so much energy, noise, fun, laughter and love and the next they were piles of dust in three plastic brown urns in my living room. The silence was deafening and the pain indescribable. I urge every reader to take the time to ensure you have a smoke alarm installed in your home and to test those already in situ. Most fire services offer free home checks and many provide free smoke alarmsneeded. Its a matter of minutes to make you and your family safe. Smoke alarms save lives. A relationship with Jill or anyone  was a million miles from my mind  I had support from so many family, friends, the community of Benllech and Heather’s colleagues in the police. Jill was someone who wasn’t afraid to ask probing questions and listen to uncomfortable answers. She was a distant friend who didn’t know my family, so it was easier to talk to her than people close to me who grief-stricken themselves and coming to terms with what had happened. We were very good friends at school and for a few years after, so it felt comfy being in her company. I could just be myself. A relationship with Jill or anyone  was a million miles from my mind. The relationship was a gradual process which felt very uncomfortable at first with mixed emotions and a lot of guilt. I had been with Heather for twenty-three very happy years and so it felt very strange to be with someone . Jill and I regularly spoke about these feelings. All of le felt strange, not just a new relationship. It’s like existing in some parallel universe – my we and sons in one and a strange new world in another. Each day I have to bridge the gap between the two to try and make sense of my le.  Jill and I have always taken one day at a time and continue to do so. She reminds me daily that I am free to leave. Not because she doesn’t love me but because she does. She tells me love has to be free – which I didn’t understand at first – but eight years later I do - and it is in this space that we are able to walk together. Dont hide away from the world Even in the darkest of places light can get through, but only with time and with the right help. At first I didn’t want counselling but over time realised I couldn’t manage my grief alone. It was an outlet where I could talk and cry without judgement. Don’t hide away from the world and take the goodness that people offer you. It made such a dference to my le being surrounded by so many people who cared. The gt of their kindness and compassion was something I’ll never forget.

The reality is the romance started early on - when Elizabeth was eight, and ended in a devoted marriage. As they mark their wedding anniversary we look at the Queen, , and Prince Philip’s, , le together. From their nicknames for each other to settling into royal le and living arrangements. What they think makes their relationship successful He is someone who doesnt take easily to compliments. But he has, quite simply, been my strength and stay all these years, and I and his whole family, in this and many other countries, owe him a debt greater than he would ever claim or we shall ever know, the Queen has said previously. While Prince Philip has said it’s about having “dferent interests” and “tolerance”.  How did they meet  The Queen and Prince Philip first met in  at Elizabeth’s uncle’s wedding to Princess Marina of Greece and Denmark. She was eight, and he was  - apparently it was love at first sight. Move forward three years and they crossed paths again at the Royal Naval College in Devon. King George VIs official biographer, Sir John Wheeler-Bennett wrote: “This was the man with whom Princess Elizabeth had been in love from their first meeting.” Prince Philip jumped over the tennis nets as she watched on. Marion Crawford, Elizabeths governess, recalled: I thought he showed off a good deal. She added: She never took her eyes off him the whole time.” While Philip liked Elizabeth it seems marriage was not on his mind yet. Well, wed met at Dartmouth, and as far as I was concerned it was a very amusing experience, going on board the yacht and meeting them, and that sort of thing, and that was that, he told biographer Basil Boothroyd. This time they decided to keep in touch and write to each other while Prince Philip headed off to serve in the military. Philip was also invited to spend Christmas in  with the Royal Family at Windsor.  Long distance relationships In  some of their letters were auctioned off. Elizabeth shared her woes over a long distance relationship. I was  years of age and he was  and a cadet just due to leave. He joined the Navy at the outbreak of war, and I only saw him very occasionally when he was on leave — I suppose about twice in three years. Then when his uncle and aunt, Lord and Lady Mountbatten, were away he spent ious weekends away with us at Windsor. Then he went to the Pacic and Far East for two years. Whatever happened to a good old love letter ey  How they kept their relationship on the down low While Philip was away at sea, Elizabeth kept a picture of him in her room. She realised later the clean shaven Philip was a bit too obvious to recognise. She switched out her photo of him with one of him sporting a big old beard, which was far less recognisable. That’s one way to stop the gossip. They’re cousins The Queen and Philip are actually cousins! Second cousins once removed through King Christian IX of Denmark - they’re also third cousins through great-great-grandmother Queen Victoria. Keeping up here  Queen and Prince Philip in photos as royal couple celebrate st wedding anniversary The engagement ring Elizabeth’s and Philip’s engagement was announced on July   They posed together arm in arm at the Palace to mark the occasion the very next day. Philip actually designed her engagement ring - which was platinum and diamond. It was made by the jewellers Philip Antrobus Ltd using diamonds from a tiara belonging to his mother Princess Alice of Greece. His grand gesture on their wedding day Prince Philip made a big change for the Queen. Knowing she disliked smoking he gave up the cigarettes. He actually went cold turkey the day of his wedding, the brave man. What’s in a name   If you watched The Crown on Netflix you’ll know there was a bit of a kerfuffle regarding titles. Prince Philip struggled with the new dynamic between them - essentially he was the supporting act. Philip let his title Prince Philip of Greece and Denmark go and became Lieutenant Philip Mountbatten. He applied for British nationality and in February  he became a naturalised British subject. He also converted from Greek Orthodox to Anglican. Just five months later in July  their engagement was announced. When they married in November that year, he was given the title Duke of Edinburgh. And for a very brief time in  to  - before taking on the throne- The Queen took on the title Princess Elizabeth, Duchess of Edinburgh in a bid to calm things down.  Nicknames It’s not all titles though, the royal couple have nicknames for each other too. Prince Philip has a few for the Queen. Cabbage, Darling and Lilibet are a few of the names he calls her. Peter Morgan, who made The Queen tv series, says he has it “on good authority” that Cabbage is the prefered term… I inquired in royal circles and was told on very good authority that that is what the Duke sometimes calls the Queen, he said. If you’re wondering where it comes from, it derives from the French “mon petit chou”, which is ‘my darling’ - translating to my little cabbage in English. Sweet gestures  Prince Philip apparently always made sure dinner was ready for The Queen when she was working hard. He is reportedly a very good cook, according to author Ingrid Seward. In My Husband and I: The Inside Story Of  Years Of Royal Marriage she says he cooked dinner for the children too while she was off on duty. When The Queen was home he liked to cook her breakfast and he’s said to whip up a mean omelette, scrambled eggs and smoked haddock. Honeymoon The pair honeymooned on the Mountbatten Estate Broadlands in Hampshire. They wrote to their families sharing their joy at being married. It’s all rather sweet. I only hope that I can bring up my children in the happy atmosphere of love and fairness which Margaret and I have grown up in. We behave as though we had belonged to each other for years! Philip is an angel—he is so kind and thoughtful, Elizabeth told her parents. Prince Philip wrote to his aunt: Cherish Lilibet  I wonderthat word is enough to express what is in me. Shes the only thing in this world which is absolutely real to me and my ambition is to weld the two of us into a new combined existence that will not only be able to withstand the shocks directed at us but will also have a positive existence for the good. How sweet are these two   The royals are a dferent breed it seems and are all for dferent beds. Etiquette expert Lady Pam and Her Majestys cousin explained in a biography about the Queen: In England, the upper class always have had separate bedrooms. You dont want to be bothered with snoring or someone flinging a leg around. Then when you are feeling cosy you share your room sometimes. It is lovely to be able to choose. How they will cope with dying It’s a morbid thought, but the pair are not shying away from the idea that one day their other half will go before them. A royal aide told the People: They will be stf upper lip in public and keep their own emotions behind. They are both deeply religious people and it wont take them by surprise. Historian Robert Lacey said: “They are not a soppy couple.” Where will they be buried Even in death the pair will be side by side. The royal couple will be buried next to each other in Frogmore Gardens in Windsor Castle. British monarchs have been buried there before in St George’s Chapel or Westminster Abbey.

For months people had been speculating about the designer and the style she would go for, and the big reveal was a moment many fashionistas will never forget. The Duchess of Sussex looked beautul in a pure white dress with an open bateau neckline and three-quartersleeves, designed by Clare Waight Keller, the Artistic Director of French fashion house, Givenchy.  While many adored the dress, praising Meghan for opting for something so elegant, others were left feeling a little underwhelmed by how simple it was. And it seems they werent the only ones who questioned her choice. According to the Mail on Sunday, royal sources have revealed that the Queen was surprised by the -year-olds decision to wear white down the aisle. They said: The Queen is said to have expressed surprise that Meghan, a orcee, wore quite such a white dress for her wedding.  Traditionally a white wedding dress has been seen as a symbol of purity and once a woman had married and consummated the relationship, they were no longer meant to wear white as they had lost their virginity. Meghan, who is currently expecting her first child with husband Prince Harry, has been married once before and as such the Queen may have expected her to opt for a champagne or soft pink dress for her nupitals. The former Suits star tied the knot with movie producer Trevor Engelson in  during a four-day bash in Jamaica.  The pair had been dating for seven years before they wed but their marriage lasted only two years. For this ceremony, Meghan wore a long, white, floor- gown with an encrusted silver belt embellished on to the dress. The strapless dress also featured a short v-plunge at the front.

This is the sensational claim made in a documentary by royal biographer Robert Lacey, reports The Express. In the programme Princess Of The Palace, Mr Lacey said: It would be a great mistake to say she [the Queen] blamed Diana for what went wrong.  He went on to add: If anything, I believe that she and her husband Prince Philip put more of the blame on Prince Charles, and Prince Charles of course, as we since discovered, was already committed emotionally to another woman. The documentary also goes on to claim that the late Princess of Wales also turned to the Queen for emotional support. Royal Correspondent Ingrid Seward revealed: Nobody sees the Queen without an appointment, but Diana used to wait until the Queens last visitor -you like - had left.  Then shed dash in before the next one and just cry. Shed say everybody hates me, I hate my sister, I hate my mother, I hate my husband, and the Queen - not used to this type of moral confrontation - just didnt know how to handle Diana. Once orced, Charles was finally able to be with the woman he had been in love with since the s,Camilla Parker Bowles. The pair married in  and remain together to this day. Diana, meanwhile embarked on a relationship with Dodi Fayed, but the pair sadly lost their lives in a tragic car accident in Paris - just a year after the orce was finalised.  The Queen now appears to be a big fan of Camilla, having recently praised her in a speech about her son on his th birthday. She said: Over his  years, Philip and I have seen Charles become a champion of conservation and the arts, a great charitable leader - a dedicated and respected heir to the throne to stand comparison with any in history - and a wonderful father. Most of all, sustained by his we Camilla, he is his own man, passionate and creative. This sweet tribute praises Camillas relationship with Charles - indicating that shes a great source of support to him and his mum knows it.

Nobody understands why he had to kill them.  “I’m relieved to know that he will never be out again.

Her body was then scraped as he pushed her through a small hatch in the oil tank where he hid her and her sister Celestes bodies. Their pregnant mother Shanann was buried in a shallow grave nearby. While looking for the missing mum and daughters, investigators found a tuft of soft blonde hair on one of the tanks. Weld County District Attorney Michael Rourke told the court that Watts strangled Shanann first in the early hours of August . It would have taken two minutes to kill her.  The autopsy report said Shanann had bruises in the shape of fingers on her neck. He then smothered his daughters. Bella, , fought against her father and bit her tongue as he smothered her.

In an interview with the Denver Post, Ms Kessinger said Watts told her he had finalised a orce with his we.  “None of this answers the questions of why,” Rourke said. “If he was this happy and wanted a new start, get a orce. You don’t annihilate your family and throw them away like garbage.” The court heard that the afternoon before the murders, Watts rearranged his work schedules so he would be the only person at the site where he hid the bodies. He then called the girls school and said he was unenrolling them before discussing putting the family home up for sale with an estate agent.

Josephine Repique, , said the pregnant goat went into labour earlier this month on November  at the small farm in Sultan Kudarat, the Philippines. The two babies had to be removed by cesarean section but onlookers quickly realised something wasn’t right.  There were shrieks of horror when one of the strange-looking animals emerged from the goat. Josephine said the baby looked like a pig, with a mix of human. The small fur-less animal even had a naval - just like a tiny human. She said: We were shocked. We cant explain how it looks like that. “All our neighbours flocked into our house to get a good look. Sadly, the two infants and the mother goat all died, sparking fears that the creature was a cursed mutant devil that brought bad luck.  Josephine added: Nobody knows what it is, but its not a goat. Its scary. Were all wondering why it happened andit is bad luck. Dr Agapita Salces of the Institute of Animal Science of the University of the Philippines said the foetus appeared to have suffered a genetic mutation in the womb. He added: It is a possible case of genetic mutation. It is also possible that the mother contracted a disease called Rt Valley fever from mosquito bites and this caused the impaired development of the infant.

managers operating in the Championship right now who know better than Robbie Neilson just how powerful fans can be.As a player, he played more than two thirds of his  plus games for Hearts, whose supporters, arguably, create the best atmosphere of any club outside of the Old Firm when their team is playing in front of them at Tynecastle.And Robbie, of course, experienced more of what the Jambos fans have to offer when he successfully managed them for two-and-a-half years.Those spells in Edinburgh, in particular, taught him the backing of a passionate support can be worth points to a team.And he believes that can prove the case now he’s in charge at Dundee United.Since taking over from Csaba Laszlo at Tannadice last month, Robbie has mentioned the quality of the backing Arabs have given his rejuvenated team on several occasions.And he firmly believes they’ve more than played their part in an impressive unbeaten run of four wins and a draw that has seen the Tangerines re-emerge as serious promotion contenders from the second tier.On Tuesday night, however, it could be a case of ided loyalties for some Arabs, simply because United will be facing Alloa in a re-arranged league outing at the same time as Scotland face what could be a vital Nations League clash with Israel at Hampden.Having been blown away by the backing so far, the manager suspects it will be a case of club before country for most.“I’m definitely looking for a big turnout,” he said.“If there are any more pull-outs, my problem could be a few players might get called up for the Scotland squad!”Jokes aside, he does believe most Arabs will be in their usual seats at Tannadice and providing the kind of backing that’s become the envy of the rest of the second tier.“You have that Scotland game but the fans have been brilliant since I came in,” he said.“We took nearly , fans up to Ross County last weekend and we took , to Dunfermline the other week as well.“We’ve had great backing at home as well and, hopefully, they will turn up in numbers.“I understand midweek football means it’s always dficult for fans to make the journey.“We hope we can prove to them thatthey come along we’ll try to entertain and try to get a result.”As good as the backing so far has been, the manager does stress it remains down to his team to always make sure the supporters in the stands are given something to shout about.“The fans can make a massive dference but the initial stage will come from the players because the players, in the first  minutes of the game, have to set the tone,” he said.“They have to set the intensity and they have to get the fans off their seats.“If we can do that it reciprocates from the fans and we start putting pressure on teams and that’s what we need.”And that experience of playing with Hearts tells himthe support is on top form, at times it can mean points are picked up before a ball is even kicked.“I’ve played in venues where teams have come and you knew, because of the atmosphere and intensity, the game was done in the warm-up,” he said.“You knew you were going to win the game because the opposition couldn’t handle the atmosphere.“We need the supporters to try to give us that and we know they can.”"},{"url":null,"title":"revealed arsenal watched dundee prospect kerr waddell","story":"Dundee kid Kerr Waddell was watched by English Premier League giants Arsenal during the summer.And the -year-old’s progress continues to be monitored by a string of clubs from south of the border.Wednesday saw Waddell extend his loan at Championship outfit Morton until the end of the season, a move that will free him up to play in the Scottish Cup as well as league matches.Waddell made his temporary switch to Greenock, at first on a six-month deal, in early July but initially it had been pencilled in for a few weeks earlier so he could join the Ton at the start of their pre-season training programme.The loan was delayed, however, and he played in the Dark Blues opening build up game at Brechin City at the end of June, when he was watched by Gunners scouts.That was with a view to adding him to their U  squad and although the spying mission did not lead to an offer being tabled, Arsenal and others down south have been keeping tabs on his progress at Morton.New Dundee boss Jim McIntyre has also had reports on him but with good options available in defence, he’s decided the player’s development will be best served by remaining at Morton until the end of the season.Waddell broke into the first team at Dens early last season and got the goals that earned a vital win over Hearts a year past September.Injury and the arrival of experienced central defensive pair Genseric Kusunga and Steven Caulker in the early weeks of this year, saw his appearances in the second half of the campaign dry up.At Morton he’s made  appearances so far this term.The Dens gaffer has said he’s keeping an eye on all his players out on loan to see what they might add to the first-team should they be recalled in January.He said: “We send people to go and watch them so we are getting proper feedback.“Ideally, going forward I would like a position created for the loan players, somebody who keeps an eye on them so we are getting reports on each game.“The possibility is there for bringing them back but they need to be doing well where they are.”n Glen Kamara played

re-arranged Championship clash with Alloa knowing they can eat into the gap at the top of the table.The weekend saw leaders Ayr United slip up when they were held at home by Morton.It means three points for the Tangerines today will mean a deficit that stood at eight when gaffer Robbie Neilson took over last month would be down to just three.And it would leave them able to wipe out the Honest Men’s advantage when the pair meet at Tannadice next week, though they could still trail Ross County, who currently lie second.Robbie has stressed he and his players will be looking no further forward than today’s outing but already the meeting with Ayr on Friday week is shaping up to be one of the most important games of the season so far.United remain hopeful of having skipper Fraser Fyvie, centre-half Frederic Frans and full-back Callum Booth available for today.They were all stepping up their work in training over the weekend after injury problems.If they’ve suffered no reactions, they’ll be in the squad.And in the case of Frans and Booth, both of whom have missed games, the manager has admitted that would give him a nice selection headache.“They have been doing well in the team but so have the players who’ve taken over from them while they were injured,” said Robbie.The reserves are not in action this week and don’t have another competitive fixture until they’re due to

What’s more, eventhey don’t mutate as occurred in the case outlined here,released into the wild either by design or mistake these foreigners can cause havoc to local ecosystems.In a letter to the scientic journal Nature in , a group of German scientists began ‘it has been rumoured that an unidentied crayfish…of marbled appearance and uncertain geographical origin that was introduced into the German aquarium trade in the mid s, is capable of unisexual reproduction ’.The authors ended by warning that: ‘This crayfish…could become a menace to European freshwater systems, as the release of even one specimen into the wild would be enough to found a population that might out-compete native crayfish’.Now,  years later, this all-female crayfish has escaped into the wild.  Identied as a descendent of the fresh water slough crayfish from Florida, it is now called the marbled crayfish or Marmokrebs. So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per celland the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs. Millions of the animals have invaded the countries lakes, rice paddies and swamps and are threatening its seven endemic crayfish species.It is only a matter of time before this scenario is repeated in other locations, destroying valuable ecosystems and eliminating indigenous species."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 37","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Sir,It is always a delight when a letter awakens a landowner.James F Lithgow#s insult about ‘blow-ins’ is a typical trait. I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers# attention to the Facebook page #Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging# The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The  jobs in aquaculture will not last longmass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a -year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start againan alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued  It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September , it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The  parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause #irrecoverable damage#.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute. It is our country’s most pressing public health issue – one we must address now, collectively.Scotland has made a lot of progress over the past  years, including a guarantee of a year’s post-diagnostic support, better education and training for staff in health and social care and better standards of care for people with dementia in hospitals.There is still, however, an unacceptable gap between national policy and dementia care and support in our communities.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

Star lost possession in midfield and Connor Crawford’s clearance was closed down by the Kings Park forward whose shot beat Kalache from the edge of the box and the hosts took a - lead on the hour mark.This visibly knocked the confidence of the Star team and Kings added a second goal when poor play again from Star trying to break gted possession to the hosts and once again their striker was on hand to make it - and give Star a mountain to climb in the last twenty minutes.Star didn’t give up however and could have been back in the game when the ball fell to Gregor Peacock in the box, the ing striker hit the shot and the ball was saved by the Kings Park goalkeeper.Kyle Selfridge went close to claiming a late leline but his free kick from twenty yards cannoned off the bar and the game finished - to the home side.The Star management team were disappointed as that’s the first time the Lochgilphead side have failed to score in the league in more than two years.On Saturday November  Red Star play host to Campbeltown pupils in what looks like another tough league match.

The blundering thieves made attempts at a getaway but were snared a short distance away at the traffic lights on Ayr Road. Ayr Sherf Court heard the stolen electrical device was worth pound.. Defending Coughtrie, of Galloway Avenue, solicitor Tony Currie said: “Slightly unusual as I don’t think either of them have a caravan. “It requested both of them to carry the item out of the shop. “This is an offence that was against a background of a chaotic lestyle and drug issues.” Mr Currie explained the pair were then caught “literally straight at the traffic lights”. Sherf John Montgomery commented the theft attempt was “rather pathetic”. Defending Thomson, of Elba Gardens in Ayr, solicitor Ian Gillies said: “Mr Thomson and Miss Coughtrie were living together but they’ve decided to part – and I don’t think that’s a bad thing. They’ve been getting themselves involved in drug-taking. “Mr Thomson could do with some support.” Sherf John Montgomery told the pair: “You both tell me that you want to change – well I can provide you with an opportunity to do that with a community payback order. “If you don’t comply with the terms of the order you’ll be brought back before me and we know what will happen.” Coughtrie and Thomson were ordered to be under supervision for  months.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnCourtsPrestwickAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13471434.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_emp_ayp_080918AyrCurrie_09JPG.jpg","title":"ayr rugby club near move","story":"NewsAyr Rugby Club near move to new town centre base at Dam Park as they prepare to sell Millbrae homeThe Millbrae men, who top the Tennents Premiership, are in advanced talks to sell their Millbrae home and move to Dam Park in Ayr town centre.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  OCT NewsDam Park could play host to Ayr Rugby Club as soon as  \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailBooming Ayr Rugby Club are nearing a deal to sell their Millbrae home and move to the town centre. Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie.

Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13594714.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/1_ayr-u.jpg","title":"ayr united appear itv show","story":"NewsAyr United appear on ITV show The Chase as Bradley Walsh asks questionsThe Honest Men appeared as an answer on hit ITV show The Chase yesterday .Share.\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _CLR_GLG_chase_.jpg\" data-tracking\"facebook|share|\".\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _CLR_GLG_chase_.jpg\" data-tracking\"messenger|share|\".\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _CLR_GLG_chase_.jpg\" data-tracking\"twitter|share|\".\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _CLR_GLG_chase_.jpg\" data-tracking\"whatsapp|share|\".\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _CLR_GLG_chase_.jpg\" data-tracking\"linkedin|share|\".\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _CLR_GLG_chase_.jpg\" data-tracking\"flipboard|share|\".\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _CLR_GLG_chase_.jpg\" data-tracking\"email|share|\"ByLochlin Highet:,  NOV NewsThe Chasers \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAyr United have been flying high at the top of the Championship - and now theyve made prime time national TV.

more than , bin collections each year.Figures released through a freedom of information request show that over the last five years, council bin crews have failed to empty more than , bins from around , households.Furthermore, the number of bins missed each year has been rising since , when , bins collections were missed.Three years later, in , that number had risen to ,, and already this year , bins have been missed.Opposition councillors have lined up to criticise the figures, particularly in the wake of allegations that Scottish Borders Council is considering moving to three-weekly bin collections when the budget is proposed in February of next year.Hawick and Denholm councillor Clair Ramage said: ldquoBin collection is a very emotive subject and as councillors we receive many complaints over this very issue.ldquoTo see that there has been a rise in the number of missed bin collections is extremely alarming and has to be investigated as a matter of urgency but this is only the tip of the iceberg.ldquoIn the last month we have been informed that Scottish Borders Council is considering tri-weekly uplts, a change that I am completely opposed to.ldquoAt the moment Scottish Borders Council is struggling as we have seen householders use their recycling bins for general waste when their general waste bins are full.ldquoThis creates other problems, the recycling vehicles are then contaminated with general waste and have to pay penalties to the processing company.ldquoIf bi-weekly lts are not working then tri weekly lts will create even more problems, for example fly tipping.ldquoI realise that budgets are tight but the combination of missed bin collections resulting in rubbish spilling over encouraging vermin is not something that as a community we should accept.Hawick and Hermitage councillor Watson McAteer also commented: \"I do not recall missed bin collections being a statistic that is regularly shared with councillors. Perhaps the fact that for whatever reason , bins have failed to be collected explains why this is not on public record.ldquoI am regularly receiving complaints from constituents who find their bins still full on the pavement after the collection date.ldquoWhile of course there will always be occasions when the council have no control of the situation the figures being produced certainly challenge the current collection policy.ldquoCan you imagine the problems this would causethree-weekly collection was to be introduced  I for one will not support such a move and would ask the council to explain to council tax payers why this problem exists and what they are doing to resolve it.According to data collected by the Local Government Benchmarking Framework, which is a comparison network for Scottish councils, . per cent of Scottish Borders are satisfied with their local refuse collection.However, this is below the Scottish average of . per cent and is the second lowest of the rural and island councils that Scottish Borders Council is grouped with.The council also spends pound. per premises on waste disposal, which is below the Scottish average of pound..Leader of the opposition and Tweeddale East councillor Stuart Bell said that Scottish Borders Council officers work hard to recty issues, but residents need to be aware of how to report missed bin collections.He said: ldquoI will be interested in the councilrsquos conclusions on the long term trend. As I recall there has been a gradual introduction of food waste collections into the larger communities in the last few years, so the number of total collections may have increased at the same time as the number of missed collections has increased.ldquoBut I am concerned to see the detail of missed bin collections. I had expected, and can see, that the number of missed collections is higher in the winter months when the teams can have dficulty getting round in the snow, but it is worrying that the level of missed collections never drops below  in any one month. ldquoThe public needs to know that there is a very easy mechanism of reporting missed collections on the councilrsquos website and, in my experience, refuse and recycling staff at Scottish Borders Council do follow-up on issuesthere is a systematic cause.A spokesperson for Scottish Borders Council said that the number of bins left unemptied each year is actually very small compared to the number the council collection.The authorityrsquos waste management service says it collects around .m bins each year, meaning the number of missed bins equates to less than half a per cent.The spokesperson said: ldquoThe number of missed bin collections over the last five years will be dependent on a number of factors including: the provision of a new weekly food waste service to around , households in  access issues due to obstruction and road closures vehicle breakdowns adverse weather service error an increase in the number of new homes which bins are collected from each year and bins not being presented by householders by am on scheduled collection days and incorrectly reported as missed.ldquoIt is not possible to determine the exact cause of any increase in missed collections but the increasingly challenging winters experienced across the Borders will be having an impact.ldquoThat was the case this year, when the extreme winter conditions experienced in January, February and March caused signicant disruption, with three full days where collections were unable to be carried out across the Borders.ldquoHouseholders reporting a missed collection over this period will have contributed signicantly to the increase this year."},{"url":null,"title":"a72-to-close-at-clovenfords-while-manhole-cover-is-repaired","story":"DRIVERS in the Tweed Valley are being warned the A will be closed at Clovenfords this Sunday.Scottish

four-fold in the space of a year.According to figures just released by the Trussell Trust, foodbank use in the Borders has risen by  percent in  months - the highest percentage rise of any local authority area in Scotland.The Trussell Trust, which support a network of  foodbanks operating out of more than  centres across the UK, have reported that between April and September , a total of  emergency food parcels were issued in the Scottish Borders  to adults and  to children.And many other locally-organised foodbank services arent even included in the figures.In comparison, the same period in  saw just  being issued.Despite the percentage increase, the number of parcels issued this year in the Borders remain the lowest in Scotland over the same period.The figures also report a UK-wide increase of  percent in providing emergency supplies to people in crisis.The charity claims the rise in reliance on foodbanks coincides with the UK Governmentrsquos Universal Credit rollout, which was introduced in the Borders during the summer.The charity says the inability of benefit levels to cover essential living costs and issues with payments remains the most common reasons for referral to a foodbank.They said: ldquoUniversal Credit is not the only benefit people at foodbanks are experiencing problems with, but the new system is increasingly driving referrals due to benefit delays, which include waiting for a first payment or having problems with a new claim.The charity is calling for the five week minimum wait for a first Universal Credit payment to be reduced.Emma Revie, Chief Executive of The Trussell Trust explained: ldquoWersquore seeing soaring levels of need at foodbanks. The time to act is now. If the five week wait isnrsquot reduced, the only way to stop even more people being forced to foodbanks this winter will be to pause all new claims to Universal Credit, until funding is in place to reduce the five week wait. Foodbanks cannot continue to pick up the pieces ndash we have to make sure our benefits system can protect people from hunger.Commenting on the figures, Tweeddale MSP Christine Grahame said: ldquoThese are truly heart-breaking figures for the Borders, which bring into sharp focus the devastating impact the Tory government is having on our local community.ldquoThe fact that people cannot afford to eat is a disgrace in any circumstances, but we can see from the statistics that in the previous year there have been  incidences where emergency food has been given to children specically ndash this is an abomination in a developed country such as ours.ldquoWhile sustained Tory cuts have created this problem, we can see that where Universal Credit has rolled out, which is the case in the Borders, it has made things worse.ldquoMichelle Ballantyne MSP who is the Toryrsquos Social Security spokesperson, represents the South of Scotland which covers the Borders ndash despite her ardent defence of Universal Credit in parliament recently, she must see now how devastating this roll out has been.\"I call on her to review her position and urgently press her colleagues at Westminster to halt the roll out of UC, so the fundamental flaws can be addressed.In response Michelle Ballantyne MSP said: ldquoWhile Ms Grahame might be correct that foodbank usage has risen across the UK, she might want to look closer before placing all the blame with the UK Government.\"We should also remember that, despite this increase, foodbank usage in the Borders is still at the lowest number in Scotland.ldquoI would consider it narrow-minded to attribute the entire increase with Universal Credit there are many other factors contributing to foodbank usage across the country.\"Aberdeen City Council and Perth and Kinross have also implemented Universal Credit around the same time as the Borders and the same report notes that foodbank usage has actually decreased in these areas.ldquoHer assertion that Universal Credit is the sole reason that foodbank usage is rising in the Borders just doesnrsquot add up.ldquoI appreciate there are issues with Universal Credit and the UK Government has said they will address them. An example of this is the announcement that there will be increased work allowances which will give a boost to hundreds of thousands of people including a pound boost for couples with children.ldquoI suggest that Ms. Grahame spend less time scaremongering and instead focus on how we can address the drivers of poverty instead."},{"url":null,"title":"pet-of-the-week","story":"This weeks Pet Of The Week, from Borders Pet Rescue, features Willow and Mittens.The charity told us: \"This lovely pair of nine-year-old sisters came into the centre as they couldnt live with the dogs in their previous home.

She already looked the part with red hair and freckles, and with stunning vocals she belted out classics lsquoTomorrowrsquo and lsquoMaybersquo, which I have no doubt produced a few tears from the audience. She embraced the character with her cheeky charm and wit, and carried out the role of the ever-optimistic character beautully.Hatching a plan to escape the orphanage and find her parents, Annie is helped by her urchin friends, who had the crowdrsquos toes-tapping and knees bouncing to a fantastically choreographed lsquoHard Knock Lersquo.

What was in the champagne bottle, I do not know, but the teenager stumbled about the stage, and conveyed the child-hating orphanage boss to comic perfection. Hanniganrsquos flirtatious manner with Officer Ward , who brings Annie back after running away, had the audience chuckling, and truly convinced us of her distaste for the girls in her care with a jaw-dropping performance of lsquoLittle Girlsrsquo.Anniersquos capture isnrsquot the end of her adventure, itrsquos only just begun, as she s in perfect time to meet Grace Farrell.Miss Farrell is gracefully played by the suave and sophisticated Ava Church, dressed impeccably as the rsquos private secretary to Oliver Warbucks. Annie cheekily seizes a golden opportunity to spend Christmas with Mr Warbucks, and is swept off to live the le of royalty at his mansion.Annie soon melts the heart of wealthy businessman Oliver Warbuckswho gave an endearing performance as the billionaire.

It is very dficult for one to critic her own child. However, I am very proud to call her a vain, blonde bimbo, red-lipstick wearing, smoking, winey voiced, floozy!The three baddies gave a show-stopping performance of lsquoEasy Streetrsquo which had the audiences in stitches.True to the classic, their evil plotting is foiled and Annie has her happy ending after being adopted by Mr Warbucks.

This is a direct result of the Scottish Government slashing council funding over this period, with East Lothian Council having suffered cuts of around pound million in the last five years.ldquoEast Lothian Council has done its utmost to protect the budget.ldquoThe Scottish Government needs to recognise the impact its cuts are having and give local authorities the funding they need to protect services, including road maintenance.The county is currently covered by km of roads, ranging from class A routes to unclassied lanes.And an Annual Status and Options Report, produced on behalf of East Lothian Council, has revealed that  per cent are currently in need of repair.The report, which looks at the impact of future funding on network maintenance in the long term, warns that the current level of investment of pound.million a year will mean that more than  per cent of the roads will be in a state of disrepair in  yearsrsquo time.And it reveals that, as an asset, East Lothian Councilrsquos carriageways depreciate in value by poundmillion every year.It also found that nearly km of rural public roads in the county were in poor condition and needed immediate investigation and possible treatment.The report said: ldquoThe level of investment on public roads in East Lothian has not been sufficient to limit the decline in the overall condition of the network.It revealed that additional investment of pound.million over the next  years could signicantlyimprove the state of the roads, with fewer than  per cent likely to need repairs by the end of the decade.Peter Forsyth, asset manager for East Lothian Council, said that the recommendation for operating the carriageways following the report was to continue with the current level of investment.In a report to the councilrsquos policy and performance review committee, he said the costs of corrective treatments, in particular carriageway reconstruction, were ldquoprohibitive and a preventative treatment approach should ldquomitigate the need to invest signicantly.But he warned: ldquoShort-term under-investment could result in major long-term expenditure necessary to recty major defects which could have been addressed earlier.Councillor Jane Henderson , leader of the opposition, said: ldquoOur road infrastructure assets are vital and dficult decisions will need to be made.ldquoWithout investment now the amount of money needed in the future will be a greater problem the old expression of lsquoa stitch in time saves ninersquo was never so apt.ldquoThe decision on how much to spend on roads now will inevitably mean choices.

Visitors will be able to access it via a walkway.The plans were originally turned down after an objection from Transport Scotland, which felt it would ldquoresult in inappropriate parking which would interfere with the safety and free flow of traffic on the A.However, at the local review body meeting, three councillors disagreed and gave it the go-ahead.Among those approving the plans was ward councillor Norman Hampshire.

It is a collection of stories and anecdotes mainly relating to sporting le and animals.The following tale is inspired from one of the anecdotal stories in Eganrsquos book:ONE autumn evening in the early th century, a storm descended on the county. Dark clouds opened their dreich souls and drenched the land with a torrent of rain. The wind and downpour kept people awake for the whole night, and but by sunrise the tempest was over.Yet all the sudden rain had caused the River Tyne to flood. The folk of Haddington gathered by its banks to witness a strange sight. For the surface of the water was laid with huge masses of hay. The storm had obviously caused the hay recently cut and stacked in the fields upriver to be blown into the flood water, or swept away by it.They watched as small mountains of hay floated by. It was an intriguing sight but of course for farmers it was their winter feed for their animals going waste to the sea.Then someone spotted a swan. It seemed to be attempting to find a place to land. The river was in a torrent and at times the majestic creature seemed to give in to the current and glide on its course until once again it found the strength and motivation to make for the river bank. It was in no imminent danger, but clearly desired to get out of the fast-moving water.As people watched the swan it was noticed that a strange black spot could be seen amidst its white feathers. As the swan drted closer to the bank, people realised what the black spot was: a rat!The rat was clearly alive, at times peeping over the plumage asto see where they were. The swan seemed unperturbed by the ratrsquos presence on its back. In fact, as people watched more closely there seemed to be a connection between the swan and the rat which was most unusual.The royal bird was clearly giving the rat a collie-buckie, or piggy back. How the rat came to be on the swanrsquos back in the first place nobody could tell. The wee creature was very likely at home in one of the bales of hay when it was swept away by the river. In the swirling water it must have struggled to survive.Then rescue came with the swan. Could the creature have scrambled onto the swan without its permission  Surely not! Did the swan actively help the rat  If so, the moment of rescue had been a compassionate act unseen by human eyes. As people followed the drama they realised that the swan was looking for a place to land, not for itself but for its passenger.A crowd had soon gathered to witness the swanrsquos progress. The power of the flood water meant it had real dficulty in finding a place to get close to the river bank. But finally the swan found the strength and opportunity to swim close to the riverrsquos edge.The rat, recognising the opportunity, leaped from the swanrsquos plumage and landed safely on dry land. For an instant the rat turned and looked at the swan, then scampered away. The swan, its mission accomplished, majestically glided back into the main flow of the river.If the rat had thought itself safe then it soon realised this not to be the case. The people watching the spectacle had motivations very dferent to the swan. As soon as the rat landed, dozens of young men, urged on by their elders, chased it with sticks and set their dogs upon it.The animal, having survived naturersquos tempest, now faced an even greater danger his le was sport for humans. The creature zigzagged as people, yelling and howling with delight, chased it this way, then that. The rat, being cornered by a group of about  lads armed with stones and sticks, turned and headed back towards the water.But it didnrsquot make it. The creature was given a deadly blow by a lsquomerciless fellowrsquo. A cheer rang out and people came to view the dead rat. Then a strange silence descended as people reflected, now too late, on what had happened. In the frenzy of the chase it had been so easy to see the rat as merely vermin, rather than a living creature who had struggled to survive and so earned the right to le.People dispersed, no longer cheering.The whole scene had been witnessed by the swan from its vantage point on the river. What its thoughts were on the human behaviour it saw we can only guess.Humans can be made to do this to each other as well, of course. In the frenzy of war, people are encouraged to see others as no more worthy of le than that rat. And the insidious power of this is that both sides are encouraged to think the same way.But deep down, when we touch our humanity, we know how wrong this is. Old soldiers themselves are the first to understand the tragedy of it and see the humanity in those who had been on the lsquoother sidersquo. While there are undoubtedly people who commit evil and need to be stopped, it is the conditions which allow hate to flourish which give rise to their power and influence in the first place.In our remembrance of those who have fallen, let us do so with the reflection and not the frenzy. Let us not forget that the real enemy of us all is hate."},{"url":null,"title":"inspectors-impressed-on-visit-to-elphinstone-primary-school","story":"Parents of youngsters at Elphinstone Primary School and Nursery Class received a letter this week from Education Scotland and the Care Inspectorate following an inspection visit in September.The letter outlined a number of strengths at the school, as well as areas to improve.Fiona Robertson, head of education at East Lothian Council, told the Courier: ldquoWe are pleased that inspectors from both agencies recognise the positive dference that nursery and primary school staff are making for the children and their families in Elphinstone.ldquoThey considered leadership, learning, attainment and wellbeing amongst other areas and concluded that the school was good across these quality indicators.ldquoIrsquom especially pleased to see Alison Cameron receive recognition for her leadership and direction so early in her time as headteacher of the school.ldquoI know that she and the staff team will continue to put pupilsrsquo learning at the heart of all they do.ldquoIrsquod also like to recognise Heather Williamsrsquo work in laying the foundations for this positive outcome during her time at Elphinstone.The letter noted strengths in the schoolrsquos work, including kind and articulate children who make the most of their learning, and the warm, inclusive ethos that creates a family feel.No further inspections are planned, with the school urged to ldquodevelop a strategic, joined-up approach to self-evaluation to ensure that all children can achieve the best possible outcomes and to continue to develop the curriculum.Councillor Shamin Akhtar, cabinet spokeswoman for education, echoed the comments of Mrs Robertson regarding the schoolrsquos former and current headteacher.She said: ldquoThe inspection recognised a number of areas such as the positive relationships across the nursery and school which are making a dference for children and families.ldquoThey also commented that children were making the most of their learning and were provided with real leadership opportunities at the school."},{"url":null,"title":"austerity-over-in-the-county-definitely-not","story":"Jim Lamond, head of East Lothian Council resources, dismissed claims austerity was coming to an end as a report warned of uncertainty about the future of farming, food and drink, and tourism after the UK left the European Union .Audit Scotland identied the potential problems facing East Lothian as the key sectors of its economy came under risk.

We had just popped in to get a few simple items, but I ended up with a very upset wee boy. The supermarket had already begun to display toys. My son had noticed them immediately because they had been deliberately placed at his level.I eventually managed to distract him and we made it out without a major meltdown, but it just highlighted to me the pressures we are all put under.I kept on saying to my son: ldquoNo, but maybe for Christmas.It was a tactic to get some immediate peace, but I realised I was building up expectations that Christmas is the time when all the accumulated desires for stuff are met.We are made to feel that the value of Christmas is measured in the amount of stuff we acquire or give. I hate this and reject it but I am by no means immune from its pressure. I am made to feel guilty and every year I give in some way or another.The psychological warfare in our minds has already begun. The new toys laid out in that supermarket was but the opening shot. Soon a lsquoChristmassyrsquo atmosphere will engulf us as we do our shopping, designed to press our internal panic button that we need get on with buying lots of stuff, like a stressed squirrel collecting nuts for the winter.I know Irsquove ranted about this before but in February I spoke to a group of vulnerable parents in a course I was delivering. Many had huge debts yet had spent literally hundreds of pounds on Christmas presents, most of which were by this time broken, forgotten about or discarded.One of the parents encapsulated it perfectly: ldquoThe trouble is itrsquos easy to realise after itrsquos all over that yoursquove gone overboard, but the pressure is so hard to resist before Christmas. Yoursquore made to feel that you are a bad parent or a failureyou donrsquot get all that stuff. Itrsquos everywhere you go and on the screens. Itrsquos impossible to escape from it.In the discussion the parents said they wished there was a course or some guidance on how to resist the pressure while still making Christmas special for their kids.In a sense, this issue is not just a Christmas one, although the consumerist pressure is at its most intense in the run-up to Christmas, and even immediately afterwards with the sales. We have literally been sold the idea that buying stuff is what defines us.It has been a conscious, deliberate and sustained ideological assault on us and our children.In her brilliant film The Story of Stuff, Annie Leonard gives a quote from a retail analyst Victor Lebow: ldquoOur enormously productive economy. . . demands that we make consumption our way of le, that we convert the buying and use of goods into rituals, that we seek spiritual satisfaction, our ego satisfaction, in consumption. We need things, consumed, burned up, worn out, replaced and discarded at an ever-increasing rate.While this was in reference to the USA a number of years ago, it holds true for us here and now.Christmas, as well as other seasonal festivals, have been made a festival of buying stuff.Itrsquos destroying the very planet we live on, it piles our homes with unneeded and soon-to-be discarded consumerist items .Meanwhile, more and more of us are time poor and running about to pay for things we soon forget we even bought and are likely already in the dump or charity shop.I was once told I was being a Scrooge when I spoke of this issue. But the message in Scrooge, when he realises whatrsquos important, is that he gives his employee time off to be with his family, and a pay rise so they can eat he shows kindness and shares a meal and social time with his family. Itrsquos not about tons of stuff.Our time together is the most valuable and valued thing we will ever have. Irsquod never say donrsquot buy presents, as I know a thoughtful present is a wonderful thing. Butitrsquos lost in a sea of other stuff then its signicance is lost too.What I think is important is doing things together and measuring the value of gts by the thought put into them, rather than the price or quantity of them. And there are a host of local Christmas fairs taking place in schools and community halls all over East Lothian where many local craftspeople, artists and others will be selling locally produced and environmentally friendly gts which have real value and are designed to last. It seems to me this is the best place to take our custom.I know this has not been a proper story but, then again, in a sense it is. Itrsquos the story of how our rituals and the meanings of our lives have been turned into market value, and we now often feel powerless or unable to step out of it without feeling guilty, inadequate or ldquoa Scrooge.Thatrsquos how I feel every Christmas but Irsquom going to make a Herculean effort this year to practice what I preach. Irsquom not rejecting that lsquoChristmassyrsquo feeling or refusing to buy presents. But Irsquom defining it on my own terms, or at least Irsquoll try. Itrsquos about my time with people I value. Itrsquos about putting in thought rather than looking at the price tag.Itrsquos also about understanding how terribly dficult Christmas is for so many people and finding ways to connect with them and show them some kindness and inclusion.Maybe itrsquos just me, but I think that is one of the best gts you can give your children and others you love."},{"url":null,"title":"great-grandmother-84-enjoys-microlight-flight","story":"Jenny Lyall, , was the passenger in a microlight, taking off from East Fortune Airfield, earlier this month.The small aircraft, piloted by Kim Ritchie, gave Jenny the chance to look over her home in Haddington.Clients at the townrsquos day centre, managed by Caroline Scott, have been outlining things they would like to do, from having a holiday in the spring to going on the London Eye.For Jenny, though, it was a chance to take to the skies.She said: ldquoIrsquove always watched the microlights going over and would be sitting in the garden saying: lsquoI quite fancy doing that.rsquoldquoWhen Caroline askedthere was anything anybody would like to do I said I would like to go up in a microlight.A few days later Jenny received a phone call telling her there was a surprise for her at the day centre and she said she was thrilled when she found out that was a microlight flight, adding: ldquoI thoroughly enjoyed it ndash I would do it again tomorrow.ldquoNot bad for an -year-old!Caroline was delighted to be able to help.

Oliver looks way younger than  years on this planet would suggest, and is relaxed, yet on the clock, given one of his brood has to picked up from school in an hour.He certainly has the energy to undertake a tour of the great theatre halls of the land with his new show, telling of the British Isles in  Places, Glasgow this week which expands upon the detail in his new book of the same title. But his is all new to him  ldquoIrsquove spoken in public before, at literary festivals, but not night after night, he says. ldquoI only get a couple of days off during the months and itrsquos quite intense and nerve wracking. Having said that, itrsquos a fascinating and very dferent way of seeing a country. And it makes you question the notion of what a country is. Once you interrogate this notion you realise the audience in the North East [of England], for example, is a very dferent tribe from those in the South.\"You get this throughout Scotland as well. The iety of what you find leaves you confused. At times you donrsquot know where you are.But there is a commonality, I ask. Arent we all in the same boat ndash one which seems to be sinking  He doesnrsquot think so. ldquoWersquove been through everything, from invasion to natural disaster to famine to religious fundamentalism, he says. ldquoWersquove been through civil war, wars of independence, the industrial revolution, two world wars. All of this has unfolded in the same tapestry. This is just a period in history. In a  years there will be dferent issues and a dferent set of politics.Thatrsquos a comfort. Sort of. But meantime, what do we do about Brexit, Neil  ldquoI donrsquot want to deal in that, he says, placing his coffee cup down with a slightly emphatic clump, suggesting hersquos learned to avoid controversy. ldquoIrsquom careful not to offer an opinion on any of that. My tour aim is to put an arm around the shoulder of someone I care about, which is this archipelago. Itrsquos a love letter to the British Isles, a spectacular place which has looked after me, and now itrsquos my turn to look after him ndash or her.He offers a thought: ldquoThe motto of the Isle of Man, lsquoWhichever way you throw me I will standrsquo, the three legged symbol, I think thatrsquos a great motto for people to live by.Thatrsquos easy to say, but wersquore facing confusion, polarisation of politics, right-wing extremism. You must be afraid of the isions politics has produced and the invective that comes with it  It seems everyone wants to be angry.ldquoIrsquom sick of politics, he admits. ldquoIrsquom completely disenchanted with all of it. Politicians lack so much knowledge. If Irsquom honest, I donrsquot think therersquos a politician out there worth listening to, of any creed or colour. I donrsquot have any truck with any of them. Irsquom just looking away at the moment while they do what they do, which is self-aggrandizing and performing their Punch and Judy nonsense. I cannot be bothered with it.He adds: ldquoI was in that arena vaguely for a while on account of a few opinions I was invited to give.He certainly was. Oliver incurred the wrath of the Nationalists back in  when he declared independence for Scotland a \"dead dog.\"But does he now regret becoming involved in the independence debate He pauses for thought. ldquoNo, I think itrsquos important to say what you think is true. But I donrsquot like the atmosphere at the moment whereby you canrsquot say what you think. If you are not pleasing the social media mob you are silenced or destroyed. I was asked some questions and I gave an honest answer.Oliver rejects the offer of half a sconeand instead sips at his coffee cup. ldquoHow it really started for me was when I was being interviewed for Bannockburn  [his TV show] and a journalist asked me about the referendum. ldquoI remember saying, lsquoA referendum is like going shopping for food when yoursquore hungry.rsquo You donrsquot want to be making snap decisions.Because you come away with a packet of Hobnobs and a jar of Nutella  ldquoExactly. I donrsquot think we should have referendums to decide which side of the road we should drive on, never mind kicking the ball back to the general population to determine a nationrsquos destiny. Thatrsquos why we have political democracy, whereby we employ hundreds of people to read tedious paperwork, shout and bawl at each other in a room for as long as it takes. Thatrsquos why these -odd people have a job.He becomes more animated. ldquoReferendums are a bad idea. After the Scottish referendum there were immediate cries for another one. lsquoThat disnae countrsquo. Now therersquos been Europe. And that was seen to be wrong. And so you claim for another one. What do you do  Go for best of three  Or best of five Oliver smiles. ldquoIrsquove never been a card-carrying member of a political party. I used to scoff at university friends who were. In the same way I couldnrsquot understand why anyone would get excited about football. Irsquom not minded that way.Yet, but he is minded to recognise how politics overlaps into culture and issues of identity, which he loves to wax lyrical about on his TV shows. But there are those who donrsquot countenance his passion for explaining the likes of Iona and the coming of Christianity. Some, such as Professor Tom Devine, see Oliver as an irritant.The historian once attacked the fact Oliver had been asked to front a History of Scotland ndash given he didnrsquot have a degree in history.Oliver didnrsquot take Devinersquos comment laying down however, describing the historian as being like of the old grumps from The Muppets.More recently, Oliver got it in the neck when appointed president of the National Trust for Scotland, and many Nationalists demanded his removal, which seemed odd given the TV presenterrsquos passion for this space we live in.But the writer presenter took it on broad shoulders. Did his personal history prepare him for the future stre  Seems so. Hersquos used to adjustment. ldquoI was born in a council flat in Renfrew, my dad moved to Ayr to work [he was a commission salesman] and then to Dumfries. The family was ldquocomfortable, he says. It certainly wasnrsquot an Angelarsquos Ashes set in Scotland storyline. They even managed a holiday to Spain once.Yet, the man who would go on to explain the Picts and Vikings and anacyclosis to uswasnrsquot top of the class at school. ldquoI was in the upper half but I wasnrsquot so great at maths and science so I focused on English and history, which I was quite good at.Oliver was blessed with encouraging parents who most likely were baffled why their son wanted to study archaeology, University I fell in love with the prospectus given it rarely leads to a career. ldquoI did work as an excavator for a few years going on digs, he recalls. ldquoIt was fun, but there was no money in it. And during the winters it became a bit grim.One Friday afternoon he was excavating the Roman Road in Greenock, and on the Monday he was covering a peace protest in Lockerbie for the local newspaper. Why the switch to journalism ldquoI liked the idea of journalism because it was essentially noseyness about people, he explains, grinning. ldquoItrsquos a bit like archaeology in that itrsquos the chance to poke through the rubbish, to find out what people were doing and why. Instinctively, I want to know who, what, where, why and when.Journalism has been as important to his current career, he says, as his time spent scraping dirt with a big spoon. ldquoWhen Irsquove been cast in the likes of Coast as a presenter it helped me get something out of people. And this Magpie-like work taught me how to become engrossed in a subject for a day then drop it, and move onto something .The curious mind continued to search for the next adventure and in  he joined a BT internet company. ldquoI thought that may be my future. I was also fascinated to learn how it had evolved, largely financed by the US military, who wanted to knowcomputers could survive after a nuclear attack. And so they hired these hippies to find out. And then I wondered what do we do with it  What are the consequences of it He answers his own question: ldquoItrsquos created titans such as Mark Zuckerberg, and Amazon, Google and Pay Pal. He adds in soft, serious voice, ldquoNow, Zuckerberg is almost at the point he has more power than Putin, without the missiles.While working for the internet company, Oliver decided to set off for Zululand.ldquoI had met up with my close pal from university Tony Pollard one day in the Granary Bar in Glasgowrsquos Shawlands and we came up with the idea of going to Zululand to make a film [which became the BBCrsquos  documentary, Two Men In A Trench].Boldness has to be part of the reason for Oliverrsquos success. He had a good job, with a good salary, a car and an Amex account. ldquoBut I didnrsquot have a mortgage. I wasnrsquot married. I could take a chance. And I knew I had had experience. When the TV job ran out Irsquod do something .Does the job flipping suggest a malcontent  ldquoNo, when I was at BT I figured Irsquod give it a couple of years, he says with a wee hint of umbrage in his voice for me having suggested such a thing. ldquoAnd we made the film really because we wanted to go to South Africa. The voice warms again: ldquoArchaeology was my first love and we met again. It was like Friends Reunited. And wersquove been together ever since.Hersquos a television natural. But did he always feel confident speaking to the camera  ldquoYes. Irsquove always had a good memory and Irsquom lucky in that I can remember  words in the right order, he says, grinning. ldquoTalking to the camera is not a natural thing to do. Itrsquos like a golf swing. But some people can do it. And I enjoyed being with these like-minded people. It was quite collegiate. I loved it from the get-go.Oliver landed on the box at the right time. ldquoI was   when television began to happen for me. I had few delusions about my own reality. Irsquod been in a few dferent jobs, had the rougher edges knocked off by le experience. Irsquod filled shelves at Presto supermarket while eating the Mars Bars. Irsquod worked on an MS till. He adds, with a wry smile, ldquoIrsquod been dumped often enough by women.Women. Yes, now hersquos married to one. And history taught him he should incorporate this woman into his future. Oliver met his future we Trudi when he was at university. ldquoI was in third year at the time, the president of the archaeology society and she was in first year, and she came in to join. I made a bee-line for her when she walked in the door.He grins. ldquoI donrsquot think she was as impressed by me as I was by her.She must have liked him a little because the pair were together for seven years. ldquoAnd it just sort of fizzled out. Then, years later, I met her wee brother Johnny and we swapped numbers and a few months after that I was back in touch with Trudi. It was asIrsquod seen her the day before.He reflects: ldquoThatrsquos another great thing about my le. Whatever happens, I know Irsquom with someone who remembers me when I was  and a silly arse. She remembers me when I had all sorts of archaeology student affectations, all patchouli oil and cheese cloth shirts. We can remember the teenagers we were.Oliver reveals he had the long hair back in the day. He didnrsquot create the soft Tarzan look for telly. He has just never bothered to have it cut. And it works for him, gives him a USP, although watching him on TV with the wind blasting into his face as he stands on a clf edge he does have to brush it away from his mouth a little too often but, I suppose, a kirby grip or a hair scrunchy would wreck the image.He laughs. ldquoIrsquove been holding out for the Head and Shoulders contract for  years but itrsquos never happened.Therersquos a calm about Oliver, even though he does become animated when he talks about the politics he says he wants nothing to do with. And he clearly loves his le, beaming at the delights of a career which allows him to take his family adventuring in the likes of Australia and New Zealand while filming Coast. Yet with three children hersquos not immune to worry, about the impact of social media, for example. ldquoPeople can have , friends, but ironically they have never been more isolated and lonelier. People go to Facebook ndash I donrsquot ndash hoping to see other people in this clearing in the forest who are equally lonely.Hersquos happy however, very happy. ldquoThe thing I most love these days is writing. I wrote as a student, as a journalist and then in TV with scripts. Irsquove written ten books or so and itrsquos something Irsquoll be able to do.And now hersquos making live appearances. ldquoIrsquove sort of blundered into them. Irsquom out there talking about our world, like Simon Reeve and Dan Snow. Maybe I can do this every year. Why not So the world will be all right, Neil  We need you to tell us it will be. ldquoWe tend to think this is a modern concern, but perhaps Stonehenge and Avebury are partly expressions of feeling the same concerns, people feeling they are little specks in the great scheme of things and wanting to be heard, to make a mark.He grins, reassuringly. ldquoWersquoll be fine, but I wonrsquot beI donrsquot do this school pick-up in time.Neil Oliver ndash The Story of the British Isles in  Places, the Theatre Royal, Glasgow, November ."},{"url":null,"title":"scotlands-insider-guide-stornoway","story":"But therersquos so much more to the Hebridean capital than just great views.

But theres a time when resilience turns into defiance, and then defiance turns into delusion. Theresa Mayrsquos staying power is the nations curse, as she perseveres with a orce deal which has no hope. She has finally united Leavers and Remainers, but only to the extent that theyrsquore against her. Shes lost both her Brexit Secretaries, a host of ministers and both houses of parliament. But, like Monty Pythonrsquos limbless Black Knight, she battles on regardless.MPs on all sides say the European Court of Justice will continue to have effective jurisdiction over UK laws on things like state aid, labour conditions, environmental standards and tax. Theresa May insists it wonrsquot, and that by , a deep and meaningful future trading relationship will have been negotiated, which will make the backstop unnecessary. But that is a triumph of hope over experience. No one has yet come up with a way of ensuring frictionless trade that doesnt involve either membership of the Customs Union, or accepting many of the rules of the European Single Market. If you keep all or part of the single market you keep the ECJ.This doesnt mean that the ECJ is involved in every negotiation. There is to be an arbitration  to sort out everyday problems between the EU and UK. But when it comes to a dispute on EU law, the ECJ rulings are final. That is crystal clear in Article  of the Withdrawal Agreement which says that the ECJ ldquoshall have jurisdiction to make such a ruling, which will be binding on the arbitration .Theres nothing sinister in this ndash except in the eyes of paranoid europhobes. When you join a tennis club, no one complains that your rights and liberties are being removed just because you accept the rules. The real issue is whether you have any say in the making of them. Democracy demands that members of an international trading organisation should have have a share in the decision-making process. This is where the Withdrawal Agreement, indeed the whole Brexit project falls down, because as things stand, we dont. We will be rule takers.Theresa May realised very early on that the economic cost of leaving the EU completely was just too high. She gave assurances to all those big international companies like Nissan, Siemens and Rolls Royce, who have complex, just-in-time supply chains, that she would negotiate a deal that was at least as good as the single market. She effectively promised no tarfs, border checks or regulatory issues ndash ie no ldquofriction - between Britain and the EU. She had to, or theyd have upped and left . Components for Vauxhall cars are said to cross and recross EU borders at least  times before theyre finally assembled in Ellesmere Port.But removing tarf and non-tarf barriers is precisely what the Customs Union and the European Single Market were originally created to do. The EU is first of all a free trade area, the most comprehensive in the world. When Britain decided to leave, it meant that frictions would inevitably . Theresa May has been trying to square the circle ever since: getting the benefits of a single market without being in it.Shes achieved quite a lot, to give her credit. Under her orce deal, Britain gets broad access in to the single market in goods without having to accept free movement. But the cost was always going to be some continued observance of the EUrsquos regulations, plus ECJ oversight. Weve had to agree to ldquodynamic alignment with EU regulations, meaning that when they change in future Britain will have to go along with the new rules.The obvious solution might be to just join the single market, as Norway did after . It is not in the EU, the Common Fisheries Policy or the Common Agricultural Policy. This is Nicola Sturgeons preferred option, and she said last week thatScotland even got the same deal as Northern Ireland, which is to remain largely in the ESM, she would vote for the Withdrawal Agreement. But while this Norway option has worked after a fashion, it has powerful critics. It costs quite a lot, and there have long been complaints in Oslo about ldquofax democracy - that new laws are simply faxedfrom Brussels. But hey ndash thats just how these things work. You are either in the EU or you arent.So what happens now  Mays deal wont fly, yet she stands her ground. The deal will almost certainly be rejected in parliament, even though Labour dont really have a coherent alternative. Jeremy Corbyn was scathing about Mayrsquos ldquobotched deal, but he too wants to leave the EU. Nor do Labour wish Britain to be a formal member of the Customs Union or the European Single Market. John McDonnell, the Shadow Chancellor, says he would renegotiate the deal to achieve a ldquoclose and collaborative relationship with the single market. In other words, a better deal than Mayrsquos. But the German Chancellor, Angela Merkell, has made clear that negotiations are over. End of story.Faced with a disastrous no deal, and no prospect of renegotiating the Withdrawal Agreement, the opposition parties face a very hard parliamentary choice next month. Do they join with Jacob Rees Mogg and the DUP, and vote for an economic disaster which would damage the livelihoods of countless Labour voters  Or do they suck it up, back Theresa May and then blame the Tories in future for landing Britain with such a bad settlement  If they vote down Mayrsquos orce deal, they must know that renegotiation is not now an option. Nor is a general election, because the Tories wonrsquot vote, like turkeys, for an early Christmas. The only alternative is for the opposition parties to do what they should have done months ago: unite the Remain majority in the House of Commons to demand a delay on Article , and then force May to hold a repeat referendum.If parliament cant decide what to do, the only option is to hand it back to the people who got us into this mess in the first place: the voters."},{"url":null,"title":"the-cool-list-hotels","story":"Built in  by Lord MacDonald of Sleat and once surrounded by orange trees ndash hence the hotelrsquos name ndash Marmalade is a -minute walk from Portree harbour and offers fine views over Portree Bay and to the Cuillins beyond.

It wasnrsquot until  that it became a hotel by which point it had been added to by another famous architect, Sir Robert Lorimer, and had had a garden laid out by the inestimable Gertrude Jekyll.

On Saturday, the Edinburgh-based newspaper was put into administration by its then-owners, Johnston Press, alongside a slew of other UK titles.The papers had been put up for sale a few weeks ago, but no potential buyer was willing or able to cover the poundm of debt attached, which was supposed to be re-paid next year.For a while, it looked as though the end was nigh for the -year-old Scotsman, as well as the Edinburgh |Evening News, the i-paper and the Yorkshire Post, another of the oldest papers in the UK, which serves a population the size of Scotland. Scores of other loyal local titles were also at risk.Later, a statement confirmed that a new company had been formed by Johnstonrsquos bondholders which, it seems, will preserve jobs and titles in the short-term. Whether there is a medium or indeed long-term future for the business remains less clear.Like most of those who work in the close-knit Scottish newspaper industry, I felt sad and a bit angry as the events unfolded. Sad that so many good, decent colleagues would be worrying about their jobs and wondering how they would look after their families, angry that they and the readers they serve had been put in this precarious situation in the first place.Make no mistake, those of us on the inside know all too well how the newspaper industry has struggled to respond to the huge challenges of the digital age, seeing our newsrooms reduce in size and scope as consumers stopped buying print products, advertising revenues fell and shareholders continued to expect big idends.But we also know how hard and tenaciously the journalists work to give readers quality news and comment in an increasingly uncertain world, how determined we are to evolve and carry on. Those of us who work for long-established brands are very aware that the trust our readers put in us, the authority we carry, has never been more valuable or vital than now, in todayrsquos fragmented, confusing world.With this in mind, journalists from up and down the land tweeted and retweeted messages of solidarity and empathy with colleagues at the Scotsman, while public figures from across the political ide, including the First Minister, also voiced support.It was shocking and dispiriting, therefore, to see others react with joy and even glee at news of the Scotsmanrsquos struggles, rushing to link the paperrsquos constitutional stance ndash it was against independence in the  referendum - with recent misfortunes, seemingly delighted to see two centuries of national journalism go down the tubes, all because they donrsquot agree with an editorial line.Taking aside the plain nastiness of revelling in the misfortune of others, the hubris and naivety inherent in this narrative is equally depressing. Do the authors of such social media threads truly believe failure to endorse a Yes vote in  has been instrumental in bringing down a mainstay in what they insist on calling the ldquomainsteam media, as opposed to economics and or poor management  Surelyit was a simple as this, my excellent colleagues at The National would be the bestselling newspaper in Scotland They seem to believe consumers buy newspapers solely on the basis of constitutional affiliation. Irsquove got news - they donrsquot.Isnrsquot it blatantly obvious that no publication is solely about its editorial stance  Thatrsquos simply not the way journalism or journalists work. Open any paper, tabloid or broadsheet, local or national, and you will find stories on an endless stream of subjects, written by people from every background and age bracket, race, gender and political persuasions, with a staggering array of interests, contacts and areas of expertise. The folk who write and edit newspapers are not perfect by any means ndash they are human and sometimes make mistakes. But in my experience the overwhelming majority thrive on interrogation and scrutiny. Indeed, thatrsquos why they became journalists in the first place.Those who relish the thought of newspapers disappearing should be very careful what they wish for. Do they honestly want to live in a society where only their own viewpoint is reflected, where positive coverage of the party, cause or person they support - be it independence, Brexit, Nicola Sturgeon or Donald Trump ndash is all they can cope with  Thatrsquos a dangerous and self-destructive road to go down, that is already blunting critical faculties and making us unable to handle complexity. It also makes us less kind.The digital world has given us a capacity for pluralism across newspaper brands, broadcasters and online outlets that is breathtaking. Ironically, social media is simultaneously driving us to shut down those we donrsquot agree with. We should resist this urge at all costs."},{"url":null,"title":"kelp-harvesting-bid-sparks-plea-from-sir-david-attenborough","story":"But one Scots company wants to harvest , tonnes of kelp off the west coast in a bid that has sparked controversy, amid concern for the preservation of these intricate systems, with Sir David Attenborough now stepping in to voice his concerns.It comes as Ayr-based Marine Biopolymersclaims Scotland could lose out on a pound million industryMSPs vote to ban the industrial harvesting of kelp in its waters.The firm wants to harvest the kelp using a revolutionary process it has developed to create a product that could be used to make ldquoinvisible armour or slow release cancer drugs.The nanocellulose it produces from the seaweed is the ldquobest in the world, it claims, and could have a whole host of possible applications ndash including an alternative to the vaginal mesh implants that have left some women in crippling pain.But MBL says this hi-tech new industrywill be haltedMSPs pass new legislation that bans dredging for kelp.After more than , people signed a petition against such dredging, Green MSP Mark Ruskell successfully amended the Scottish Crown Estate Bill to ban the removal of entire kelp plants.Veteran naturalist Sir David Attenborough has also lent his voiceto the cause, speaking to Fauna  Flora International , of which he is vice-president, saying: ldquoCharles Darwin was one of the first people to recognise just how important kelp forests are for our oceans, comparing them in ersity to rainforests.ldquoThese kelp forests, which can be found right here, around the coast of the British Isles, not only form an important part of the food chain, but also act as a vital habitat for a wide array of species.ldquoTheir thick foliage offers food and safety from predators, and provides a nursery ground where juvenile fish can mature in safety.ldquoLook closely among the intricate stems and fronds of kelp, and you will find a range of fascinating sea le, from invertebrates such as sea stars, anemones and limpets, to mammals such as sea otters.ldquoMany of the fish species, suchas cod, that are so important to us economically and culturally are alsofound here.ldquoFor these reasons and many morendash carbon storage being just one ndash it is imperative we protect our kelp forests.But MBL co-founder David Mackie insisted its plans to harvest the seaweed laminaria hyperborea are ldquoentirely sustainable, saying there is an estimated  million tonnes of it in Scotlandrsquoswaters.The kelp, which he described as ldquothe daddy of the seaweeds in Scottish waters, grows up to ft long, with the plants attaching themselves to rocky surfaces.He said: ldquoPeople say we intend to dredge. Well you canrsquot dredge a rocky bottom, so wersquore not doing that.As MBL developed its processes to remove alginate from the seaweed, it found marine cellulose was also produced.Dr Mark Dorris, a senior research fellow and lecturer in material science at Edinburghrsquos Napier University, has been working with that to create new bioplastic materials, the starting point of which are fibres that are ,th of the width of a human hair.Wood pulp is already used to produce nanocellulose, but Dr Dorris said when kelp is used the end result is ldquobetter than any nanocellulose in the world.This raw product can be turned into bioplastics to be used in food packagingfor products such as sandwiches andready meals, but work has also beentaking place with the Ministry of Defence to develop a ldquotransparent armourthat could be used for helmet visors and body shields by police and the armed services.The nanocellulose could also be usedto develop slow release drugs for treating colon cancer, as well as to helpconserve fragile, historic documentsand artefacts.Dr Dorris said: ldquoTherersquos loads of applications for this, medical implants, meshes. This stuff, because it is made from seaweed, is biocompatible, the wood cellulose isnrsquot.But Mr Mackie said he fears plans to develop such products could be haltedMSPs vote through the legislation as it currently stands on Wednesday.He said: ldquoWe worked long and hard to develop our process, basically we have turned the whole alginate processing upside down, to get to what is unique, nobody  does it.ldquoWersquove got this brilliant raw material, we do a wee bit of magic with it.ldquoThis is the thing I am most proud of that we have done, and when I see what these guys can do it is just incredible.For Sir David, though, his concerns for kelp remain.He said: ldquoIt is perfectly possible to harvest them sustainably by removing their fronds while leaving the rest of the plant intact.ldquoBut dredging ndash or indeed any kind of harvesting that removes the whole plant ndash is a wholly short-sighted measure that risks the wholesale devastation of our kelp beds.ldquoI urge decision makers to take the necessary action to protect these vital,and globally important, habitats."},{"url":null,"title":"mark-smith-why-this-brexit-fiasco-could-eventually-give-us-all-peace-of-mind","story":"Forty-seven years on from that revealing little moment in political history, Theresa May now faces a vote of her own in the Commons to pretty much undo all of Ted Heathrsquos work and it makes you wonder what music might be appropriate this time round. Messiaenrsquos Quartet for the End of Time perhaps. Or John Cagersquos piece for organ, As Slow as Possible, which takes  years to perform. Or maybe even Eh-Oh by the Teletubbies. Any of them might symbolise the mess wersquore in now: the disorder, the ision, the dragged-out damage.To make some sense of it all, it might be useful to remember what Edward Heath thought he had achieved in  as well as the approach he took to some of the controversies that are still with us, such as referendums. Mr Heath said in lsquo that he believed the British people would eventually see the wider benefits of the European Community, particularly peace and prosperity. ldquoI believe they will become convinced that this is where the future of modern Britain lies, he said.For a while, they did, although Ted Heath did have to fight hard to win a majority in the Commons. He also resisted the pressure to hold a referendum, which some said was the only way to avoid the claim that the Government was dragging the country into the Common Market against its will. Mr Heath took a view that now looks impossibly elitist or hugely realistic: in a parliamentary democracy, he said, it would be irresponsible to leave a decision on so critical and complex an issue to the electorate.It obviously wouldnrsquot be easy for a politician to express that kind of view now, but there are lessons for Theresa May to learn from Ted Heathrsquos experiences ndash not easy ones though. Specically, in one respect Mrs Mayneeds to do exactly the same as Ted Heath did, which is to aim for the reasonable centre of the electorate, which still exists and which supports remaining in the EU, a soft Brexit, or some pragmatic compromise.However, it now looks like she can only achieve that result , in another respect, she does exactly the opposite to Ted Heath. Heath thought referendums contradicted the principles of parliamentary democracy ndash and they do ndash but in the circumstances wersquore in, another public vote is the only way to get us away from the extremes of Brexit. In fact, a second vote may end up being one of the few redeeming features of this process by recalibrating us back to where all the good and sensible stuff happens in politics: the centre ground.It is likely to happen because of the logistics of where we are. Theresa May did not ndash and realistically could not ndash stick to her Remain principles when she took over as leader of the Conservative party, but she has achieved the best deal in the circumstances ndash some of which were unavoidable, some of which were self-inflicted.The unavoidable bit was the UKrsquos border with Ireland ndash a hard border is impossible without being a member of the customs union ndash whereas the self-inflicted bit was Mrs Mayrsquos insistence on ending the free movement of people, which ruled out membership of the single market. In this version of our world ndash part reality, part unreality created by Mrs May ndash the deal we have is the only practical option.All of that means that the next few stages in the process are pretty much inevitable. Mrs May is still trying to appease Brexiters by promising that a wonderful free trade deal is still on the horizon but unless we can reach a deal that avoids a hard border in Ireland ndash and no one has come up with one ndash then, under Mrs Mayrsquos plan, Britain will eventually enter the backstop outlined in the withdrawal agreement. Realistically, the backstop is also likely to form the basis of the long-term relationship between the UK and the EU: in other words, a UK-wide customs union with Northern Ireland retaining some elements of the single market.However, we know, and Mrs May knows, that there is no majority in the Commons for that, which leaves only four options: three unlikely and one almost inevitable. The unlikely options are, first, a no-deal Brexitsecond, a re-negotiation of the deal, which the EU has already ruled out whatever Andrea Leadsom says and third, a general election, which neither Theresa May nor any other Tory PM would go for.Which leaves us with the fourth option: another referendum. Ted Heath was right to resist one when he was PM, but  years on, another public vote will soon be Mrs Mayrsquos only choice. She cannot appeal to the right-wing extremists who think the same way about Brexit as some Christian evangelists think about gay-cure therapy ndash that the facts of le can be changed by faith. In insisting on her version of Brexit, she has also ruled out support from the hardcore Remainers and the SNP.However, increating a situation where a second vote on Brexit is now the only option, Mrs May could be doing us all a favour. There is always a chance the result will be another vote for Leave, but the polls show a vote for Remain is increasingly likely. If so, that could help quieten the extremists of all kinds ndash Brexiter, Socialist, Northern Irish Unionist and Scottish Nationalist ndash and take us back to the centre of politics. A good result in a second referendum on Brexit might also achieve a little of what Edward Heath felt in Number  on the evening of th October : a sense that the world is in the right order, a feeling that we are doing whatrsquos best for Britain, and maybe even some longed-for peace of mind."},{"url":null,"title":"theresa-may-says-her-brexit-plan-is-best-for-britains-jobs-as-she-faces-critical-week","story":"In a message to her political rivals, the Prime Minister stressed that Brexit was not an exercise in \"political theory\" but something that affected peoples lives and livelihoods.In Brussels, Michel Barnier, the European Unions chief negotiator, said the Brexit process was at a \"key moment\" and urged all sides to remain \"calm\".One of the remaining details to be resolved is how long a possible extension to the transition period - effectively keeping the UK aligned with the EU after Brexit - could last for. This is an option because, in theory, it would help avoid having to have a backstop period.Intriguingly, Greg Clark, the Business Secretary, talked up the prospect, saying it had ldquooption value.There has been speculation that a one-off extension,sought when the agreed transition period expired at the end of , could last until the end of .Mrs May conspicuously did not knock the idea down but stressed she would want it to be over by the time of the next scheduled general election in June , while Mr Barnier said an extension could not be \"indefinite\" and a deadline would be decided in talks this week.However, a question hangs over whether or not extending the transition would mean putting off the day the UK took back full control of its fishing waters.At present, Britain will become an independent coastal state on Brexit Day. However, the UK Government has agreed that for the transition period the countryrsquos fishing industry will comply with the regime of the hated Common Fisheries Policy until December .Given that quotas are set in December for the following  months, any extension to the transition could mean that UK fishermen would be bound by the CFP for another year. If, as Mr Barnier has suggested, the transition might extend to December , this could mean the UK adhering to CFP rules until December  more than seven years after the  vote to leave the EU.Any extension to the transition that meant UK fishermen continuing to abide by CFP rules would be anathema to Scottish Conservatives, who have threatened to vote against Mrs Mayrsquos proposed deal,this were the case.But it has been suggested the draft withdrawal agreement ldquokicks the can down the road as it simply says on the future of fisheries that both sides would use their ldquobest endeavours to come up with what happens beyond December  with an agreed plan by July .Mr Barnier and others have flagged up the possibility of slapping tarfs on UK fishing productsthere is no guarantee of continued access for EU boats to UK waters.This morning, the PM took her Brexit message to the CBI conference as she sought to win business backing for her plans.CBI director-general Carolyn Fairbairn told the event in east London: \"It is a compromise. But it is hard-won progress.\"She said firms were already spending hundreds of millions on preparations for a no-deal Brexit.In her keynote speech, Mrs May said: \"We are not talking about political theory but the reality of peoples lives and livelihoods. Jobs depend on us getting this right.\"And what we have agreed unashamedly puts our future economic success, and the livelihoods of working families up and down this country, first.\"But Brexit-supporting businessman Roger Kendrick challenged her over her plans, which he said would restrict the ability to strike trade deals with countries outside the EU, telling Mrs May: \"Think again about the economics of the whole thing.\"The PM told him: \"The portrayal that you have given of what has been agreed is a little inaccurate,\" adding: \"It makes sense for us to continue having a good trading relationship with the European Union...but also have the freedom, which we will have, to sign those trade deals around the rest of the world.\"In Brussels, Mr Barnier updated ministers from the  remaining EU nations on the state of the Brexit process.Austrian EU minister Gernot Blumel said it was \"a painful week in European politics\" and \"we have the orce papers on the table,  years of dficult marriage are coming to an end\".Luxembourgs foreign minister, Jean Asselborn, said: \"This deal that is now on the table is the best there is. There is no better deal for this crazy Brexit.\"Askedhe thought Mrs May could survive, Mr Asselborn said: \"I believe she can convince her party and perhaps a part of parliament which is not on her side, so that this deal can become reality.\"The question of Mrs Mays survival is one that the EU are watching closely as Tory rebels continued to attack her plan although there still remained doubt as to whether or not they had the  signatories needed to spark a no-confidence vote. A total of  have gone public. Some MPs who were said to have put in letters to Sir Graham Brady, who chairs the  backbench committee, refused to confirm publicly they had done so.The message from both the PM and the EU representatives in Brussels was that there could be no unpicking of the orce deal, although work on the blueprint for the future relationship continues.Mrs May made clear the proposed withdrawal plan had been \"agreed in full\" by both sides.However, David Davis, the former Brexit Secretary, said: \"This deal is not what the people voted for. It will tie us to the customs union for years to come with no way out.\"But there is still time to negotiate a Canada+++ deal that delivers on the referendum. So lets get on with it.\"And Boris Johnson, the former Foreign Secretary, made yet another colourful attack on her plan.He used a column in Mondaysto describe the agreement as a \"-page fig leaf [that] does nothing to cover the embarrassment of our total defeat\".Calling for the scrapping of the Northern Ireland backstop, he added: \"We should massively accelerate our preparations to exit on World Trade Organisation terms, with a new Secretary of State responsible for all the cross-government work.\"There would, of course, be some disruption in that outcome, but by no means as much as sometimes predicted.\"And it is our failure to make proper preparations that has so gravely weakened our negotiations.\""},{"url":null,"title":"sturgeon-mps-could-potentially-back-my-brexit-plan","story":"The First Minister said she believed the Commons could yet back remaining in the single market and customs union, despite many MPs regarding it as ldquoBrexit in name only.Ms Sturgeon also told the National Economic Forum in Dundee she feared Theresa Mayrsquos Brexit plan would leave Scotland at a ldquoreal competitive disadvantage to Northern Ireland.She said Ulsterrsquos tighter regulatory alignment with the EU - something opposed by the DUP and many Tory Leavers - would give it a better foothold in the single market.Insisting there was not an inevitable choice between No Deal and bad deal, she said . m Emphasising neither a bad deal or a no deal Brexit was inevitable, she said it was vital to avoid the economic damage which leaving the single market would inflict.She told delegates: ldquoThe Scottish Governments view is that we should continue to press for - and I believe there is the potential for - a majority in the House of Commons around this, for the UK to stay in the single market and the customs union.\"That would be a solution that respects the outcome of the referendum, largely resolves the Irish border issue and mitigates the worst economic consequences of Brexit.\"She has already confirmed SNP MPs will vote against the Prime Ministers withdrawal plan.Ms Sturgeon said Mrs Mayrsquos draft withdrawal agreement had \"long-term uncertainty is hardwired\" into it and kicked dficult decisions of future trade relations down the road.She told delegates: ldquoWe must have a concern about in future being in a situation where companies can choose Belfast and will secure unfettered access to the European single market which they wouldnt get in Dundee, Glasgow or Edinburgh.\"That would be a real competitive disadvantage for Scotland and is something that is uppermost in the Scottish Governments mind.\"Organised by the Scottish Government, the National Economic Forum is a regular event attended by ministers and senior figures from business, the public sector and trade unions."},{"url":null,"title":"the-herald-diary-no-catheter-coffee-for-us-please","story":"THE Herald reported that parents groups and charities are calling for the trend of giving teachers Christmas presents from pupils to be stopped because it puts families under financial pressure.

the size of turbines nearing the end of their lespans, according to a new report.The plans have also prompted environmental concerns as it would cause further disruption to Scotlandrsquos peatland - which most turbines are built on - damaging the soilrsquos vital carbon cutting resource.Mountaineering Scotland said the move would ldquoincrease the visual impacton Scotlandrsquos mountains and landscapes, and called for the ldquoenvironmental and aesthetic impact on the landscape to be made a ldquokey consideration.Environment Protection Scotland also said that the report, by researchers at the Universities of Glasgow and Aberdeen, raises questions over the development of windfarm policy in Scotland.Charity spokesman John Bynorth said: ldquoScotlandrsquos peatlands have a powerful natural role to play in slowing climate change through carbon capture and everything must be done to prevent damage to this vital part of our eco-system.ldquoResearch by scientists has also found that even the lsquowakersquo from wind turbines can have an impact on air temperatures and humidity, impacting on the temperature of soil and on the surface of soil ndash so itrsquos clear that digging deeper or wider foundations in which to place bigger and more powerful windfarms will also potentially have a damaging impact on Scotlandrsquos environment.The report reveals that Scotland is home to more than , operational wind turbines, with a further , either under construction or awaiting planning permission.The majority of theseare on peatland.Renewable energy accounted for around % of the countryrsquos gross annual consumption in , up from just % in , with much of that increase attributed to onshore wind farms.The report revealed that as the turbines come to the end of their lespan, usually after around  years, they need to be upgraded or replaced via a process known as repowering.This means either disturbing the peat by regenerating existing turbine foundations or creating completely new foundations where on the site.The existing turbines would then be increased from  metres to roughly  metres to harness ldquobetter wind.Professor Susan Waldron, of the University of Glasgowrsquos School of Geographical and Earth Sciences, said that while the damage to peatland is serious, the ldquopayback time, i.e. the time it takes before the turbines become beneficial to the environment, is relatively short.Research suggests this is usually between two to three years, compared to the -year lespan of the turbine.Ms Waldron said the report wasof signicance internationally, and showed that Scotland is keen to lead the way in repowering, which has only been done on a small scale so far.ldquoWersquove completed the most comprehensive and collaborative report on repowering to date, she said, adding that it considers ldquothe ecological, hydrological, biogeochemical and carbon security impacts of the repowering process.ldquoThis shows that foundations could be re-engineered to take bigger turbines , but reusing the foundation generally requires more construction materials and disturbs the soil as much as a new foundation.She added that of the two repowering options,creating new foundations would be the most environmentally friendly as regeneration involved more materials and more disruption to the peat.Friends of the Earth Scotland said the report was a ldquohelpful contribution to the developing debate on repowering existing wind farms.Charity director Dr Richard Dixon said: ldquoScotland needs to develop our renewable energy capacitywe want to progress towards a zero carbon economy.ldquoThrough a process of engagement with stakeholders and expert analysis of the benefits arising, repowered sites can play a signicant role in the decades ahead.ldquoWith careful development on shallower peatland, the net emissions savings over the lespan of a turbine project can make a very large contribution to our collective climate action.Scottish Renewables said wind was the cheapest form of green energy and the Scottish governmentrsquos ldquorobust planning system already factored in the impact of on carbon emissions."},{"url":null,"title":"sturgeon-voices-degree-of-optimism-over-michelin","story":"The First Minister spoke after discussions with trade unions from the tyre factory, where  jobs are at

Downing Street suggested that the issue of whether or not fishing rights would be included in any transition extension was part of the ongoing negotiations.Extending the -month transition period as an alternative to the deeply isive issue of the backstop was raised by Theresa May at an EU summit last month. At the time the Prime Minister made clear this was not something she wanted to happen but,it did, it would only last a few months beyond December .Yet, because fishing quotas are set in December for the following  months, any transition extension that included fishing, would mean the UK not taking back full control of its fishing waters until December  at the earliest.However on Monday, Mrs May and Greg Clark, the Business Secretary, appeared more amenable to the option after Michel Barnier, the EUrsquos chief negotiator, spoke about a possible extension to December .Mrs May told the CBIrsquos annual conference that any transition extension would have to end well before the next General Election due in June . But her remarks appeared to point to more than just a few months.Mr Clark noted how extending the transition would be beneficial to the business community, which did not want more than one change from the current position a backstop would involve two.The PMrsquos spokesman explainedboth sides were looking at a few weeks or months to complete the trade deal, then ldquothis is a decision to be taken around June  andhellipit will be at that point in time we would seek a short extension of the implementation period as opposed to going into the backstop.Askedthis was now the PMrsquos preferred option, he replied that it would ldquovery much depend on the facts at the time but stressed the key point was none of this was expected to happen as the PM believed the future relationship would be in place by January .Askedthe conditions of any extended transition period would be dferent from the planned transition ndash such as on fishing policy - the spokesman replied: ldquoThese are all things that would have to be discussed.Last week, the issue was raised in the Commons by Cornish Conservative MP Sheryll Murray to which the PM replied: ldquoWe have not changed our position, which is that, as of December , the UK should be an independent coastal state able to negotiate the issue of access to its waters for the following year and, obviously, for thereafter. MPs noted the word ldquoshould rather than will.Mr Mundell and his  fellow Scottish Conservative MPs have written to their party leader, threatening mutinyUK fishermen remain tied to the hated CFP beyond December .ldquoWe are leaving the CFP and becoming an independent coastal state in . If the implementation period is extended, as far as Irsquom concerned that will have to remain the case, declared the Scottish Secretary. ldquoIm very clear we cant extend the period and include the CFP within that extension and I could not support that.Askedhe would therefore resignBritain remained bound by CFP rules beyond December , Mr Mundell said: ldquoIm not playing into the resign soap opera. What Im focused on is outcomes and we want the best outcome for Scotland.\"While both sides have delayed a decision on what happens on fishing rights beyond December , promising to use their ldquobest endeavours to sort it out by the summer of , France, in particular, is making clear the future UK-EU free trade agreement will depend on Britain offering access to its waters similar to current arrangements.

She will visit Brussels tomorrowto meet Jean-Claude Juncker, the Commission President, to try to sign off the future framework dealahead of Sundays special EU summit.The First Minister, beforeher scheduled meeting with Mrs May today, claimed the PMrsquos insistence that the choice before MPs between her draft withdrawal agreement and a no-deal was a  one.ldquoThis is a time for grown-up, responsible governance in the public interest, declared Ms Sturgeon, ldquosomething which has been sadly lacking to date as the Tory Party has continued to put its own interests ahead of the interests of jobs, communities and businesses.ldquoIt mustnrsquot be an option between frying pan or fire but it is now incumbent on all of us who oppose that  choice to propose a workable alternative.The FM is also due to have a private Commons meeting with Labour leader Jeremy Corbynthis lunch-time to push a united front for continued single market and customs union membership as an alternative to a no-deal scenario.To the same end, she is also due to hold talks with Sir Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat leader, Liz Saville Roberts for Plaid Cymru and Caroline Lucas for the Greens. The issue of pushing for a Peoples Vote is also likely to come up.Last night, Labourrsquos Sir Keir Starmer said Labour could even try to bring down the Conservative Government to block a no-deal Brexit.The Shadow Brexit Secretary told the Parliamentary Labour Party he was prepared to ldquowork with all sides to prevent the UK crashing out of the EU without a deal.\"There will be opportunities to make the majority against no-deal heard.

Heat-related deaths would also increase, insects would lose half their natural habitat, sea-level rise would affect  million more people, marine fisheries would crash. At current rates, though, the world is possibly headed for C worth of warming.Almost  senior British academics back Extinction Rebellionrsquos campaign of civil disobedience, and the former Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams has thrown his hat into the ring with them as well. These experts say that the failure of politicians to tackle climate change has broken the ldquosocial contract between government and the people.

For while Labour grandee Peter Mandelson famously said that history would remember Mr Cameron ldquosimply as the prime minister who took us out of the EU, the legacy of another of the former member for Witneyrsquos bright ideas - austerity - shows just how unfit for office he really is.Dreamed up by Mr Cameron and fellow Bullingdon BoyGeorge Osborne - who, inexplicably, has reinvented himself as the Tory-bashing newspaper editor par excellence - austerity was announced in  as the antidote to the Labour Partyrsquos preceding ldquoage of irresponsibility. With the country brought low by unscrupulous bankers and misguided borrowers - not to mention profligate Labour politicians - the time had apparently come for us all to tighten our belts for the good of the nation.Yet while Mr Osbornersquos ldquowersquore all in this together mantra rang hollow right from the off, the extent to which austerity has ravaged the poor while allowing the rich to amble along just fine was last week laid bare in a damning report from the UN rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, Philip Alston. Indeed, thanks to austerity measures such as the introduction of what Mr Alston termed ldquoUniversal Discredit,  million people in the UK are now living in poverty, with the poor, women, racial and ethnic minorities, children, single parents, and people with disabilities most severely affected. Not only is this shameful in a nation that boasts the worldrsquos fth largest economy but, as Mr Alston said, it is ldquopatently unjust and contrary to British values.Nor can Scotland claim the moral high ground. Though the UN report noted that we have the lowest poverty rates of any UK nation, Scottish Government figures show that the number of people living in relative poverty north of the Border has increased by  per cent since the advent of austerity, from , in   to a million in  , , of whom are children. And while the Alston report praised measures such as the Scottish Governmentrsquos Fairer Scotland Action Plan and said its nascent benefits agency is ldquoguided by the principles of dignity and social security as a human right, the author stressed that accountability has not been written into the system while no mechanism is in place to ensure the most vulnerable can access what assistance is available to them.When he announced his age of austerity David Cameron said the intention was to show that ldquofiscal responsibility can go hand in hand with a social conscience. It is about as far from a ringing endorsement as you can get that Mr Alston has found the exact opposite to be the case, with his report highlighting that ldquoBritish compassion for those who are suffering has been replaced by a punitive, mean-spirited, and often callous approach apparently designed to instil discipline where it is least useful, to impose a rigid order on the lives of those least capable of coping with todayrsquos world, and elevating the goal of enforcing blind compliance over a genuine concern to improve the wellbeing of those at the lowest levels of British society. Whether or not the policy has been ldquofiscally responsible, meanwhile, remains moot.Asall that wasnrsquot bad enough, Warwick University economics professor Thiemo Fetzer published a paper earlier this year that drew a direct link between austerity and Brexit, with the deep cuts to welfare from  onwards thought to be responsible for pushing many in the UKrsquos most disadvantaged communities into the arms of UKIP and the vote-Leave camp. Sold on the promise of a new dawn of Great British prosperity, those voters - like the rest of us - are now forced to live in a country so economically damaged that the Financial Times reckons the average household is pound a year worse off than it was before the vote. What that figure will be once we make our final, shambolic exit from the European Union is anyonersquos guess, though we can all rest assured that it is highly unlikely to be heading south.Given his role in getting us into this mess, the idea that Mr Cameron is our best hope for getting out of it is far-fetched in the extreme. Whether he meant to or not, our former prime minister inflicted great misery on the UK the day he declared a new age of austerity, with his Brexit gamble only serving to compound the effect.The Tory Party under Theresa May may be intent on ripping itself ndash and the country ndash apart right now, but Mr Cameron is not the answer. Austerity and Brexit are indefensible allowing him to heap yet more misery on the people of the UK would be utterly unforgivable."},{"url":null,"title":"the-proclaimers-to-play-edinburgh-castle-as-they-announce-four-special-gigs","story":"The band will play inEdinburgh, Glasgow, Inverness and Melrose as part of their tour in support of their new album Angry Cyclist.The band will play a big top tents at Melrose Rugby Club on June  and Inverness Bught Park on July .They will also play Edinburgh Castle for the first time in a decade on July  before rounding off the-monthtour at Glasgows Hydro on September .Read more:The Proclaimers demand law change as touts sell tickets for their new tour for nearly poundThe Proclaimers, brother, Craig and Charlie Reid, said: \"We are looking forward immensely to coming home during the summer for four major Scottish shows.

That would be self-indulgent and dangerous for the country.\"In another cause for concern for the PM, Mrs Mays Spanish counterpart Pedro Sanchez said Madrid would vote against the withdrawal deal at a special EU summit on SundayGibraltars future was not considered a bilateral issue between the UK and Spain.ldquoIn the past  hours, none of the documents has claried something which is fundamental for us: Gibraltar is not part of the UK, declared Mr Sanchez.ldquoAs a country, we cannot assume what is going to happen in the future with regard to GibraltarhellipIt should be negotiated between Spain and the UK. As it stands, the [Spanish] government will vote against the Brexit agreement,\" insisted the socialist leader in Madrid.Meanwhile, the DUP showed its anger with Mrs Mays Brexit deal by joining with Labour to cut the Governments majority to just five in a Commons vote on the Budget.It also abstained on a series of other amendments to the Finance Bill on Monday night, in a move intended to send a \"political message\" to the PM.Their actions appeared to call into question the future of the \"confidence and supply\" arrangement by which the DUP props up Mrs Mays minority Conservative Government.Under the terms of the deal, agreed after the Tory leader lost her Commons majority in last years General Election, the Northern Ireland party is supposed to back the Government on Budget matters and on confidence votes.But Sammy Wilson, the partyrsquos Brexit spokesman, said Mrs Mays deal with Brussels breached a \"fundamental\" assurance that Northern Ireland would not be separated constitutionally or economically from the rest of the UK.\"We had to do something to show our displeasure,\" he declared.In a bid to sway opinion, Mrs May has insisted that her draft Brexit deal puts Northern Ireland in a \"fantastic position\" for the future.In an opinion piece published in the Belfast , the PM claimed the regions constitutional status within the UK had been guaranteed in the agreement.Mrs May acknowledged that there had been a lot of focus on the Irish border \"backstop\" and said she \"understood and share some of the concerns that have been expressed\".But she argued the backstop was an \"acceptable insurance policy\" due to provisions in the deal.The DUP warning adds to the pressure on the PM just as the Tory bid to unseat her by Brexiteers appeared to have stuttered.Members of the Conservative European Research Group were last week confidently predicting they would get the  letters of no confidence needed to trigger a vote in her leadership.However, there has been no announcement from Sir Graham Brady, the Chairman of the backbench  Committee, saying that they have reached that tally, while the number of MPs who have publicly declared they submitted letters remains in the twenties.There were also reports that the so-called \"pizza club\" group of Cabinet Brexiteers was backing away from a plan to go to Mrs May to demand she re-opens negotiations with Brussels on a key element of the agreement.Michael Gove - who last week turned down the job of Brexit Secretary following the resignation of Dominic Raab - Andrea Leadsom, Penny Mordaunt, Liam Fox and Chris Grayling were all reported to be unhappy with the terms over the Northern Irish border.However, there was little sign that they were preparing to force a fresh showdown at the weekly meeting of the Cabinet in Downing Street on Tuesday, which was expected to last longer than the usual hour due to the circumstances.Elsewhere, in a further sign of the Governments weakness, ministers were forced to offer fresh concessions to stave off a damaging defeat over the publication of the Governments assessment of the economic impact of Brexit.Robert Jenrick, the Treasury Minister, told MPs they would now release a comparative analysis of the economic impactBritain was to remain in the EU rather than leave in March .Previously, the Government had only undertaken to publish its assessment of the impact of leaving with a deal, compared with a no-deal Brexit."},{"url":null,"title":"nicola-sturgeon-admits-indyref2-may-be-after-2021","story":"The First Minister said she may not be able to overcome the UK Governmentrsquos rigid refusal to grant Holyrood the power to hold another vote before .Ruling out an unofficial Catalan-style vote, she suggested the best option could be to complain vigorously about the UKrsquos action and seek a new mandate from the voters.:Scotlands \"Union idend\" is pound, per person, says David MundellHowever polls suggest the SNP will lose seats at the next Holyrood election, with Unionist parties in the majority, and so there would be no chance of a referendum after  either.The statement is likely to dismay many in the SNP, including MPs like Angus Brendan MacNeil, who called for a swt second vote at the SNP conference in October.Ms Sturgeonrsquos admission, made at a weekend meeting of the Women for Independence group, came after repeated delays to her long-awaited ldquoprecise timescale on Indyref.A new poll also gave a -point lead to No campaign.:Supreme Court rejects UK Government bid to appeal Brexit reversal caseMSPs voted -

Jim therefore tried to find historical accuracy as far as possible by researching contemporary documents and manuscripts that held vital evidence.\"There are certain liberties you can take, like for example the drumming used by the armies preparing for battle and that is often for dramatic effect.\"The film is billed as a \"true David versus Goliath story\" of how the great th-century \"outlaw king\" Robert the Bruce used cunning and bravery to defeat the larger and better-equipped occupying English army.At the films debut during the Toronto Film Festival last year there were a few raised eyebrows when American actor Chris Pine, who plays Bruce, appeared full-frontal naked in one scene.Directed by Oscar-nominated film-maker David Mackenzie the epic was shot in ious Scottish locations throughout  and Jim spent six months working on the diegetic soundtrack.Jim said: \"I had a meeting with David Mackenzie just a few weeks before the shoot and none of this particular aspect was planned. David calls himself a jazz film-maker and doesnt really like to spend too much time planning it all out.

We all love it.\"Gill Arrowsmith and Shirley Sinclair both thought the painting was \"fantastic\" while Annemarie Simpson thought that a similar venture in Wick would help tackle the \"towns eyesore\" buildings.While on that subject, one dissenting voice condemned the piece and said there was a \"masterpiece eyesore now in Wilson Street thanks to Caithness Horizons\".Beauty is, of course, in the eye of the beholder.The mural depicts a portrait of Thursos renowned botanist and geologist Robert Dick surrounded by a kaleidoscopic representation of the CHMAG facade and the scientists specimen collection.The bold use of line and colour based on modern urban graffiti cannot fail to be noticed just like the mural on nearby Tollemache House but is sited in a much less conspicuous space ndash the gallerys car park.CHMAGs curator Merran Gunn, who was instrumental in commissioning Delaye to create the work, said the artist had also spray painted a wall within the building as part of a show running called Graffito.His earlier piece has an explosive anime style figure punching out of the wall toward the viewer.\"Marcs work is bold and vibrant, electric colours jostle for dominance, and the new outside mural is no exception with tangerine skies set behind the historic Thurso of Robert Dick,\" said Gunn.Thursos illustrious scientist had his herbarium collection feature in an earlier work by the artist Joanne Carr which in turn is featured within Delayes mural ndash a clear case of one artist paying homage to another.\"Graffiti and street art is more relevant than ever whether it be in the art world ndash with the recent record sale of Banksys girl with a balloon ndash or here in the Highlands where graffiti has made its way onto the syllabus at Farr High School through art teacher Tracy Wilkinson,\" she said.After garnering great positive feedback from the current show Merran decided to \"have a moment of spontaneity\" and raised funds through a crowdfunding website and the Dounreay Communities Fund to commission Marc Delaye to breath some le into a fairly drab corner of the town.Tracy Dodson, commercial manager of CHMAG, said that the gallery was \"breaking boundaries\" with Graffito.\"It questions what actually constitutes art and what gets shown in a gallery. Graffito is an exhibition that celebrates artwork that is available to everyone.\"Traditionally graffiti has been seen as anti-social, fringe or even as criminal vandalism, but with an emphasis on social inclusion, we are celebrating street, pop, comic and zine work as mainstream art for hanging in our gallery.\"Tracy unabashedly declares that Graffito is \"aimed at young people and the young at heart, as a way of inviting new and future audiences to a museum and gallery experience\".\"This is a multicoloured on-the-wall exhibition devoted to all manner of graphic mark-making and breaking the boundaries of what art is all about,\" she said. \"We have also hosted street painting and comic workshops, guided gallery tours, and collaborating with our local schools and council.\"Marc Delaye is an established community projects artist with Freshpaint.org which is based on the Black Isle.\"Murals are as alive now as ever before and an excellent way to introduce art to internal and external spaces, giving iniduals and communities something that they can be proud of and enjoy each and every day,\" said Marc.The murals can be privately commissioned and can be an \"ideal means of advertising products, services, messages and campaigns\".Other exhibitors at Graffito include Andy Strachan, of Comic Creations Studios Dundee, David Robertson of Fred Egg Comics and Zu Dominak, all of whom work at the University of Dundee within the Masters degrees in Comics and Graphic Novels ndash the only course of its kind in the UK.Other exhibitors include Victor Nobis and his series Fallen Giants ndash a fantasy dream space where cities like Edinburgh rise and twist through the torso of neon lit giant figures.Graffito finishes on Saturday with a day of childrens workshops, guided tours and a colouring competition.Tuesday  Nov  : PM"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"November ,  at : pmOrkney MSP Liam McArthur has highlighted concerns over delays in issuing flu jabs to over-s in Orkney with the Scottish Government.

Descendants of both Vice Admiral Fremantle and Rear Admiral von Reuter will be attending the conference.The conference will cover not only the scuttle, but also the history and impact of that fateful day.Speakers will explore the American navy#s vital role in the war, how the scuttle was interpreted in Germany and how the legacy still lives on today.Six months before the centenary itself, this will be a wonderful opportunity to share Scapa#s history, stimulate ideas for  and build a lasting knowledge of what happened and why.Nick Jellicoe will publish two books next year: The Last Days of the High Seas Fleet and, in partnership with the Orcadian, Scuttle to Salvage, a book about in photographs. He is shortly launching a website to support the centenary, Scapaflow and will be producing another animation The Scapa Flow Naval History Conference will take place at Kirkwall Grammar School, Friday and Saturday, November  and .Details on the conference can be found on https:shop.scapaflow copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

We are pleased to confirm we have made some changes to the substation design at Finstown, which we hope will go some way to address concerns raised. We are also pleased to confirm that we will underground the proposed infrastructure at Hoxa Head.#In the coming weeks, SSEN’s project team will continue to assess the responses received as it further refines the project design.SSEN plans to submit its planning applications for the proposed substation at Finstown, the subsea cable and the underground land cable that will connect Finstown to the subsea cable later this year, while a final round of public consultation will be held in Spring  on the onshore infrastructure required to connect the ious renewable projects looking to connect on Orkney to Finstown substation.For more information on the project, including the latest visualisations of the proposed substation at Finstown, please visit: https:www.ssen-transmission projects orkney copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Albyn Housing is asking them to pay a lot more each month in some cases.The concerns were echoed by the MP Mr Blackford who said ldquofor quite a while now, he has been working with the CAB to get to bottom of ldquowhat I would generously describe as curious practices from Albyn Housing.He added: ldquoIn one case an Albyn Housing client who had just undertaken a tenancy was immediately sent a letter informing her rent was already in arrears.ldquoIn effect, they are asking for a payment arrangement in view that it is a debt, and extra payment is, therefore, being requested each month.ldquoI am sure as a charitable organisation Albyn Housing has their tenantsrsquo best wishes at heart, however, their recent practices raise many questions.ldquoThese must be reviewed to ensure that no additional hardship is being brought upon the people who take up a tenancy with them.In response, Calum Macaulay, chief executive at Albyn Housing Society, insisted his rent due date had not changed and said his organisation followed the statutory form of tenancy laid out by the Scottish Government in the HousingAct  ldquowhich states that rent is due on, or before, the first day of the month, paid in arrears.He went on: ldquoTenants claiming housing benefit previously had their rent paid directly to Albyn Housing.ldquoWe were always made aware that the payment was due, and as such, any arrears would be treated as technical.ldquoNow, with universal credit, the tenant is responsible for paying their rent direct. The society has no dealings with the DWP and we are not made aware of incoming housing payments. This means that all tenants, regardless of whether they are claiming universal credit or not, are required to pay their rent in accordance with their tenancy agreement.He said housing officers would be ldquomore than willing to help tenants make arrangements that work for them.It comes weeks after Albyn Housing had to apologise to a vulnerable tenant in Inverness after a boiler check bungle ended up leaving the single mum locked out of her flat for the night with her toddler daughter and having to rely on social workers to pay for emergency accommodation.Tuesday  Nov  : PMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Responses also showed that, of the adopted children who responded,  per cent had been teased or bullied because they were adopted, and that  per cent of parents felt that their children did not receive an equal chance in school.Our education system is grounded in the concept of GIRFEC – ‘Getting It Right For Every Child’. It is clear that we are not currently doing that for adopted and care-experienced children. In order to ‘get it right’, we must fully understand the needs of the children in our classrooms, and how best to respond to those needs.Adoption plays a crucial role for young people who are in the care system in Scotland. For children unable to remain with, orto, their birth family, adoption offers an opportunity for a permanent family and all that can offer a child. Adoption is a lelong process, but for families it begins with children who are at the heart of the process.The current and ongoing Independent Care Review, which is hoping to overhaul the existing care system in which the adoption process sits, has identied love as being one of the most crucial missing elements of the care system.In adoption, love is central to families. One phrase that prospective adopters may hear is that love is not enough, and any adoptive parent could tell you that loving their children will not automatically heal damage that may have occurred in their early lives.: Robert Swt: Thousands of kids are in care,  a year are adoptedAdoption is often considered to be a ‘happy ending’ for the children involved. This misconception means that the early experiences of children are not considered. It does not acknowledge the fact that more than  per cent of children who go on to be adopted have suffered abuse, neglect or trauma in their early lives.They are also living with the le-long impact of separation from their birth family, which is the unique factor that adopted children face within their group of care-experienced peers who may end up going in a dferent direction in the permanence system – adoption in the best-known form of permanence but this can also include long-term fostering and residential care.In addition to the emotional and attachment challenges faced, we are now increasingly aware of the growing number of care-experienced children who are living with the impact of drugs or alcohol while in utero. Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder is estimated to affect more than  per cent of children in care.It is the leading preventable cause of neurological dficulties and learning disabilities in the UK – and yet many professionals who work with children lack the knowledge and skills to adequately support them.In September this year, Adoption UK Scotland held a parliamentary event to raise awareness of our Equal Chance campaign, which is seeking a change in discourse about adopted children, and an acknowledgement of their needs in schools.: Dr Gary Clapton: Reunions after adoption can be complexThe highlight of this event was the voice of the young people themselves: five young people, from  to  years of age, spoke to a room full of professionals and policy-makers about their school experiences. They shared what worked, what didn’t – what had held them back and what had pushed them to achieve.Our Equal Chance campaign seeks and supports policy changes that will benefit our adopted young people. In Scottish schools, a child within the care system is automatically entitled to additional support and assessment of needs – the same child, who has the same history, and the same needs, loses this right as soon as the adoption order is passed.We want to support relevant government policies designed to raise attainment and emotional well-being for adopted children in school – we know that there are policies in place to better support all children, and we want to ensure that both schools and families are aware of where adopted children fit within these policies, and how they can be implemented to improve experiences for children and families. Recently the Scottish Government announced that they were giving an additional £ million pounds to local authorities to increase the remit of the Pupil Equity Fund to include care experienced children. Adopted children fit within this category, and it is crucial that parents and schools are aware of this to access the support that children are entitled to.At our event, the Minister of Children and Young People, Maree Todd MSP, commented that: “Earlier this year the Deputy First Minister announced an additional £ million over the le of this Parliament to supplement the opportunities for care experienced young people available through the Scottish Attainment Challenge. Local authorities, as Corporate Parents, should identy the ways in which the funding could be best used to improve attainment of their care experienced children and young people, including those that have been adopted.”For some children an equal chance means not necessarily being treated the same as their peers – but being offered the extra support and input that they require. The experience of adopted young people in Scotland is that they are not being given an equal chance. They have already experienced adversity and disadvantages in le, school should be the opportunity for them to reach their full potential. Not all children have an equal start in le. But we can give them an equal chance in school.Fiona Aitken is director of Adoption UK Scotland.

Scotland has been sidelined.”Andrew Marr replied: “So why don’t you have a second referendum ” Nicola Sturgeon responded: “You will have to wait for that statement – that will not be in the too distant future.”: Nicola Sturgeon: decision on Scottish independence vote in ‘not-too-distant future’So far, so unremarkable. The SNP leader’s been producing that “wait and see” line since last year’s snap general election. Even though it failed to convince when trotted out in response to Patrick Harvie of the Scottish Greens during First Ministers Questions last week when he pointed out that waiting for clarity over Brexit might mean waiting forever. Now maybe it’s no bad thing to have folk urging you to move a bit faster towards your constitutional destination of choice. But maybe it’s also a little weird.: Richard Leonard: Scottish independence vote would be worse than BrexitCommentators north and south of the Border assume the Scottish Government must be close to some kind of announcement on a second indyref, given the degree to which Scotland has been visibly carved out of the Brexit process, denied any whf of the dferential deals that proved possible for Northern Ireland, Gibraltar and Cyprus despite Scots voting more overwhelmingly to stay in the EU. \u2028But Nicola Sturgeon and Mike Russell spent the weekend promoting another cause – urging the UK to stay in the Single Market like Norway and Iceland and remain in the Customs Union . Now of course retaining single market membership is a reasonable enough suggestion.\u2028Now of course it’s a reasonable enough suggestion. Norway joined the halfway house after two referenda rejected EU membership so they could keep their recently-won political independence but win single market access for their outward facing economy. Access to the single market is not a great solution but it’s a heck of a lot more popular in Norway than full EU membershipor leaving the single market to plough the lonely free trade furrow advocated by Britain’s hard Brexiteers. But there are cultural reasons why single market access can work for Norway but not for Britain. Firstly, the arrangement means being a “rule-taker.” That may be easier for a small country that was never a full EU member in the first place than once “mighty” Britain where the very idea of “rule-taking” prompts overwrought talk about “vassal states”. Secondly, the acceptance of less-than-perfect deals is an everyday occurrence in Norway because it’s had proportional representation since  and thus daily experience of negotiation and compromise. Westminster’s first-past-the-post system, by contrast, breeds a confrontational “no surrender” approach to international relations which would make Britain a very bad fit with the small, consensual EEA nations. Thirdly, membership of the single market means accepting freedom of movement. This doesn’t particularly bother the Norwegians, who were part of a Nordic Travel Area  years before Schengen and joined that club despite remaining outside the EU to make le and travel easier for citizens and neighbours. Sadly though, freedom of movement is a massively big deal for the millions of Britons who voted to leave the EU. So while single market membership may make sense on paper, there’s absolutely no way the closet Brexiteer Jeremy Corbyn or the Ukip-fearing Theresa Maywill ever consider single market membership because it ends the illusion that control over British borders can ever be “taken back”. So, since neither the Tories nor Labour will ever accept this halfway house, why are the SNP still pushing it  Are they virtue signalling – demonstrating that the Scottish Government can embrace a rational solution to Britain’s Brexit problems evenit cannot be stomached by No   If so, why bother It’s hard to see how much more virtue the Scottish Government can possibly accumulate over Brexit. Scottish voters not living on another planet since  are fully aware that we voted to remain, the Scottish Government published an options document a full year before Westminster, political parties here are fairly relaxed about freedom of movement and even Ruth Davidson could support single market access as long as no one from London was watching. Butthis virtuous solution has no hope of being implemented, why does the SNP spend its only moment of UK-wide media continuing to advocate solutions for the whole of the UK when that makes it almost impossible to start making the case for independence As Britain’s constitutional crisis likely deepens this week, every other party will be laying out its stall – whether that is A Peoples’ Vote, A No Deal Brexit, Theresa May’s deal, a Tory leadership challenge or a general election. But Scottish independence is nowhere to be seen. Of course, everyone accepts that naming the date for another referendum is indeed impossible with uncertainty all around. But it seems that worry about naming a date is also stopping Nicola Sturgeon from making a case – and that’s becoming problematic. Scottish voters are being plunged into a Black Friday-style sale of constitutional options and voters are thinking deeply about the future . Does the SNP believe swithering Scots will hold onto their democratic currency, ignore all the whizzy offers being laid before them and keep their powder dry till the Indy Express finally rolls into town  If it takes too long, swithering voters may have ed to the Union fold.So it’s just as well the Greens have decided to move into the unoccupied political space of the Independence movement. Yesterday, Scottish Greens co-convener Maggie Chapman wrote about the need to get updated, Brexit-framed, modern arguments for independence into the public domain as a matter of urgency. SNP MP Mhairi Black made similar points.Many Yes activists are praying the SNP leadership has got over the snap election and will start talking in detail about the independence scenario it exists to promote. If Oscar Wilde is right and the only thing worse than being talked about is indeed not being talked about, then Westminster is actually winning as an institution by being the sole focus of attention right now. Playing it safe can be laudable – but not being a player at a time like this is not an option.©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4832114.1542656676!/image/image.jpg","title":"scottish independence if uk didn t exist we d invent it pamela nash","story":"Unionists will take heart from new Survation poll, but Brexit still poses a threat, writes Pamela Nash, chief executive of the Scotland in Union campaign group.As soon as the EU referendum result was announced, Nicola Sturgeon predictably used it to revive her campaign for Scotland to leave the UK.Nationalists have not stopped campaigning since, using every twist and turn in the Brexit saga in a desperate attempt to boost support for the break-up of Britain.The SNP has no interest in getting a good Brexit deal or even stopping Brexit – it wants chaos in the hope that Remain voters will swing behind independence in the belief that Scotland could easily stay in the EU. It’s a cynical tactic that EU Remain voters must always remember: don’t let Nicola Sturgeon use your vote to break up the UK.The new poll from Survation, published in The Scotsman today, shows that Ms Sturgeon’s strategy is backfiring.If a contest was held tomorrow,  per cent of people in Scotland would vote to remain in the UK. In fact,  per cent of former Yes voters would now vote for Scotland to remain in the UK.This matches up with evidence that we hear first-hand at campaign events throughout the country.Contrary to SNP spin, there are many voters who backed the Yes campaign in  who no longer support independence.There are several reasons for their change of heart – not least the recent experience of the oil price crash, which would have exposed an independent Scotland to economic catastrophe and proved that Alex Salmond’s White Paper was a work of fiction.But Brexit – whether you support it or not – has demonstrated the intense complexities of leaving a political union.It has proved dficult – and it remains to be seenimpossible – to secure a orce deal with the EU, which in historical terms is a relatively new organisation. Just imagine what it would be like disentangling us from a -year-old union in which we are considerably more entwined.: Nicola Sturgeon: Decision on Scottish independence vote in ‘not-too-distant future’Alex Salmond’s White Paper fancully claimed a orce deal could be in place within  months. The SNP can never again peddle that lie.But more than anything, what we are hearing time and time again is that Brexit has brought home to voters just how precious being part of the UK is. The chaos of the Brexit negotiations highlights the stability and security we enjoy as part of the UK. Few voters want to be out of both the EU and the UK.If in today’s world the UK did not exist, we would need to invent it.So, it comes as little surprise thata second independence referendum was called after we leave the EU, this poll shows that voters would still choose to remain in the UK – with or without a Brexit deal in place.The wording in the poll was chosen deliberately. In , we were offered a yes no option and the no campaign won by around , votes. Ms Sturgeon insisted it was a “once-in-a-generation” referendum.But she used the  EU referendum to revive her campaign – a contest in which the Electoral Commission advised that voters should be offered a remain leave option.The independent experts came to the conclusion that a yes no option question is not the best option as it cannot be considered neutral when reflecting only one outcome in the question.Let’s be clear, there should not be a second independence referendum – it is not wanted and would damage Scotland – butthere was one, the precedent of using a remain leave question with both options in the question has now clearly been set. The Yes campaign will have to become the Leave campaign.: ‘Scottish independence case stronger after Scotland sidelined in Brexit talks’But while the poll makes for encouraging reading, those of us who believe in the UK must not be complacent.Just over a third of voters said Brexit makes them more likely to support Scotland leaving the UK. And while pro-UK parties have  per cent of support in Westminster voting intentions, it is still of concern that the SNP remains the largest single party.In recent weeks, senior Nationalist figures have floated the idea that a majority of Scottish MPs at the next election would be a mandate for independence.It’s reckless and dangerous talk, but it hasn’t been dismissed by the SNP leadership.SNP strategists know they are failing to turn most Scots towards independence, so are exploring other ways to break up the UK. Their underhand tactics cannot go unchecked.That’s why Scotland in Union will be campaigning hard in the weeks ahead to remind voters that whatever your views on Brexit, independence is not the answer.A separate Scotland would not automatically be in the EU and would face a long and painful application process, with absolutely no guarantee of entry.Like any club, there are rules which apply to new members.EU member states are expected to have a budget deficit of no more than three per cent of GDP.The latest official figures put Scotland’s deficit at a whopping . per cent – four times higher than the UK. The only way to get that down is by both hiking taxes and slashing spending on already-stretched public services such as schools and hospitals – meaning deeper, harmful austerity.All member countries must also commit to eventual membership of the euro, making any suggestion of financial independence nonsense as monetary policy would be handed to Frankfurt.Why harm our economy by leaving the UK – which is worth four times as much as our trade with the EU By remaining in the UK, families are better off by the equivalent of £,.It simply makes no sense to walk away from our oldest friends, neighbours, trading partners and allies.That’s why the majority of people in Scotland still want to remain in the United Kingdom.Pamela Nash is chief executive of Scotland in Union©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4832523.1542731038!/image/image.jpg","title":"scottish independence unionists wrong about new poll linda fabiani","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Scotland in Union#s bid to secure an opinion poll to support their vision of Brexit Britain has badly backfired, writes Linda Fabiani.For all their self-confessed attempts to engineer a question which deliberately seeks to conflate independence with Brexit, the findings offer them little comfort.Aside from confirming the SNP’s commanding lead for both Holyrood and Westminster, the poll also shows that Brexit is set to boost support for an independent Scotland.: Poll: % of Scots would back ‘remain’ in new Scottish independence voteAnd the headline finding is clearly an outlier from almost every other independence poll conducted since September , most of which show support for independence at or above the  per cent the Yes vote achieved then.The truth is that independence is the very opposite of Brexit.: Scottish independence: If UK didn’t exist, we’d invent it – Pamela NashInstead of the insular, parochial, backward-looking worldview offered by the Tories – and defended to the hilt by people like Pamela Nash of Scotland in Union, whatever the cost to Scotland – independence is about Scotland taking its place in the world as an equal partner.That is what makes Ms Nash’s suggestion thatthe UK didn’t exist it would have to be invented so risible.: Readers’ poll: Would you vote for Scottish independence in a second referendum To suggest that anyone would opt to join the chaotic, dysal sinking ship that the UK has become under the Tories is stretching credulity beyond breaking point.Does anyone believe, to indulge Ms Nash’s claim a bit further, thatScotland was already independent then people would vote to be governed by the current shambles of a government at Westminster The fact is, as the poll also confirms, unionist scare stories about independence are crumbling one by one.: Nicola Sturgeon: Decision on Scottish independence vote in ‘not-too-distant future’The poll shows that people in Scotland overwhelmingly think an independent Scotland would be granted EU membership – something the Spanish foreign minister has just confirmed his government would not oppose, thereby demolishing a favourite  Project Fear scare story.Then, Scotland was told that the only way to protect our future in Europe was to vote no to independence.

Most people want Scotland to be politically independent, with a strong parliament of its own. Rather, the key question is whether or not it wishes to go so far as leaving the UK.: Poll: % of Scots would back ‘remain’ in new Scottish independence voteWe should not be surprisedthere are some people who would like Scotland to be independent, but as part of the UK – and that when we ask a dferent poll question that focuses on Scotland being in or out of the UK rather than on it becoming independent, some people give a dferent answer.Does this mean that a dferent question should be asked in any second independence referendum  It might be argued the meaning of ‘leave the UK’ in the poll is not clear enough. If we follow the precedent established in , setting the referendum question would be a decision for the Scottish Government rather than the UK government. The obvious thing for the Scottish Government to do would be to ask the exact same question as in , which was tested and approved by the Electoral Commission.The poll includes several questions about what sort of impact Brexit might have on support for independence. As has been found before,you ask people such hypothetical questions, then by the time you ask them about leaving with no deal, you get very substantial movement towards independence. In this case, what was originally a - split in favour of remaining in the UK becomes just -.But beware of hypothetical questions. They invite people to focus on a particular element and in many respects they often tell you more about what people think of the condition they are being asked to take into account rather than their view of what the question is supposed to be about.Presented with such a question, people who do not like leaving the EU will say ‘of course that means we should get out of the UK’. But whether they would actually vote that way is another matter. We should remember there were lots of poll questions before the February  European Council summit to which people responded thatDavid Cameron came back with a piece of paper and said ‘it’s all fine, I’ve got a deal,’ they would vote Remain. But the polls did not move at all when he did come back with his deal. On its own it is far from clear that leaving the EU will necessarily result in increased support for independence. What is more likely to matter is whether or not the economy goes pear-shaped as a result.In the much milder question in the poll on whether the prospect of Brexit makes you more or less likely to vote for independence, the  per cent of No voters say they are more likely to do so are almost counterbalanced by  per cent of Yes voters who say they are less likely. These numbers suggest the impact of Brexit could be relatively small.Indeed, previous polling has shown while some people who voted No in  and Remain in  have switched to Yes, they have been counterbalanced by a similar number of people who voted Yes and Leave who would now vote No.It is thus somewhat surprising that, in the poll, people were more likely to say that Brexit was the more important issue than they were to state that independence was the bigger question. However, this may reflect the fact Brexit is what everybody is talking about at the moment while independence is not in the news.In truth, most Leave voters are unlikely to swing behind independencethere is no Brexit deal. They think that leaving without a deal would be fine anyway. The group that it might help sway are some Remain voters, most of whom strongly dislike leaving without a deal.However, we probably will not know before March whether such an outcome is going to happen. A government defeat on the meaningful vote will not automatically trigger no deal. If the government has not negotiated a successful deal by  January, it has to come to the House of Commons and say what it is going to do – and most MPs are opposed to no deal.In the meantime, this poll suggests in an early general election Labour could lose five of its seven seats in Scotland. Jeremy Corbyn’s hopes of entering  Downing Street rest heavily on making gains in Scotland, but at the moment there is little evidence that he is likely to do so.Sir John Curtice is Professor of Politics at Strathclyde University©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4832162.1542700411!/image/image.jpg","title":"poll 60 of scots would back remain in new scottish independence vote","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Scots would vote against independence by a wide marginthey were asked whether to leave or remain in the United Kingdom, a landmark poll has found.The poll’s release comes as Nicola Sturgeon and Theresa May are set for showdown talks, with the UK speeding towards an uncertain Brexit conclusion.The First Minister will meet opposition leaders at Westminster today in a bid to build a united front against the Prime Minister’s Brexit deal, promising a tense encounter with the Prime Minister in Downing Street.However, the meeting depends on other political forces, with the threat of a possible vote of no-confidence by her own MPs continuing to hang over Mrs May.: No-deal Brexit ‘catastrophic’ for Scotland, says David MundellMs Sturgeon said last night: “Brexit must not be a  choice between the deal the Prime Minister has presented and the no-deal outcome which even members of her own Cabinet now say would be disastrous.”: Readers’ poll: Would you vote for Scottish independence in a second referendum The Survation poll, commissioned by a pro-Union group, found thata referendum were held now,  per cent of Scottish voters aged  and over would choose to stay in the UK and just  per cent would choose to leave, once the don’t knows are removed.: Fight to defeat Theresa May’s Brexit deal a national ‘emergency’, SNP saysAmong voters aged  and over the margin is even wider, with  per cent voting to remain in the UK and just  per cent choosing to leave, again once don’t knows are removed.The findings represent one of the highest levels of support for staying in the UK of any poll conducted since the  referendum.However, polls suggest Brexit could boost support for independence, particularlythere is a chaotic exit from the EU.The margin in favour of staying in the UK narrows to -the UK leaves the EU with a deal and is just -the country leaves without a deal. A total of  per cent of respondents said UK membership of the EU was more important than Scotland remaining part of the UK, compared to  per cent who put the UK first and  per cent who said the two Unions were equally important.Pamela Nash, chief executive of Scotland in Union, the campaign group that commissioned the poll, said: “This bombshell poll shows that a huge majority of Scots want to remain in the UK and are turned off by Nicola Sturgeon’s desperate attempts to use Brexit to break up Britain. Voters know that we are better off as part of the UK and it makes sense to remain with our oldest friends, neighbours and allies rather than ide us in the name of nationalism.“The Nationalists will stop at nothing until Scotland is separated from the UK. That’s why they are weaponising Brexit in the hope of boosting support for independence.“But our trade with the rest of the UK is worth four times our trade with the EU. Why put our economy and jobs at risk ”Ms Nash added: “This poll reveals how the SNP’s tactics have backfired and shows that people in Scotland would vote to remain in the UK with or without a Brexit deal in place.“However, we know the Nationalists won’t stop campaigning, so we need to continue campaigning as well to ensure the voices of the majority of Scots are heard.“Whatever your views on Brexit, independence is not the answer.”The SNP said the findings made clear that Brexit was forcing Scots to reconsider their place in the UK. “It’s clear that Brexit is drawing more and more people towards the opportunities of independence as Scotland’s interests continue to be sidelined by Westminster,” SNP depute leader Keith Brown said.“And a majority are confident that an independent Scotland could take its place at Europe’s top table.“With crucial days ahead as we hurtle towards Brexit, the SNP will continue to stand up to the Tories and fight for what’s best for Scotland’s future.”As the Scottish Government prepares to restart the campaign for independence in earnest once the Brexit deal is settled, the findings will spark a debate about what question voters should be asked in any new referendum on Scotland’s constitutional future.Polling agency Survation used a wording based on the  EU referendum, asking people how they would vote in response to the question “should Scotland remain in the United Kingdom or leave the United Kingdom ”In , the Edinburgh Agreement between the Scottish and UK governments that set the terms for the independence referendum gave Holyrood control over the franchise and referendum question, on the understanding that voters would be presented with a single question.David Cameron, the then-prime minister, is widely believed to have feared a two-question referendum preferred by Alex Salmond, asking voters whether they supported “devolution max” with sweeping new powers for the Scottish Parliament.The existing UK government has said it would not grant permission under the Scotland Act for a new independence referendum.Mrs May insists that voters made their choice in  and, while the Brexit process is ongoing, “now is not the time” for more constitutional upheaval. However, last week the First Minister said she would unveil plans for a new push towards independence “in the not-too-distant future”.Polling expert Sir John Curtice said the results showed most Scots want “the best of both worlds”, with greater political autonomy while remaining in the UK. The Survation poll also confirmed the SNP’s continued strength, with voters set to send more Nationalist MPs to Westminster in the event of a snap election.Support for the SNP is at  per cent, up  per cent from the  general election. The two main Unionist parties would lose ground compared with the last election, with the Conservatives on  per cent, down  per cent, and Labour on  per cent, down  per cent. The Liberal Democrats would pick up one point, putting them on  per cent.Analysis by Professor Curtice suggests that result would give the SNP  MPs at Westminster, picking up five seats from Labour and two from the Conservatives. The Lib Dems would remain on four MPs. Mr Brown said: “People are continuing to put their trust in the SNP to stand up for Scotland.“We command a -point lead over the Tories, who are consumed by the complete and utter chaos of Brexit.“And Labour aren’t seen as a credible alternative. That’s why they’re languishing even further.“It seems this poll was commissioned by our opponents to land a political blow on the SNP, whereas it’s had the exact opposite effect.

It is part of the Year of Young People activities.The youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.Year of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to  years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, #What do you enjoy about Shetland #, #What makes you proud of Shetland #, #What is Shetland famous for #.# Send any ideas, before Friday th July , to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.The SIC#s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.#This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People .”Are they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be doneI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish##.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc###and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of le or some other pointless title.Over the years art has very much lowered its standards signicantly to make and justy it becoming more commercially viable####.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called # limited edition rubbish #.I would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at###atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.No doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and le experience###..despite the fact everybody  looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.Love the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of le.

LoLThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.Based on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear..."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 25 ","story":"Those responsible finally saw sense this week, reversing the ridiculous decision to play both Scottish League Cup semi-finals at Hampden Park on the same day.Celtic, one of the four sides involved, had indicated that a draw should be made to determine which game was moved to Murrayfieldthe original plans were scrapped.But the holders’ game against Hearts will now take place in Edinburgh at .pm on Sunday th October. The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"whalsays new research arrives in lerwick for first time ","story":"The Research leaves Symbister with bunting flying as she heads for Lerwick on Saturday.

He deserves all the support possible.Tomorrow’s match, despite being outside the Six Nations, should still be hotly contested. In the absence of Hogg and Barclay, English-based Sean Maitland and David Denton, and half-backs Finn Russell and Greg Laidlaw who now ply their trade in France, it gives an opportunity for some youngsters to make their mark.Those include Blair Kinghorn and Adam Hastings who have been named in the starting line-up, while Darcy Graham, George Horne and Matt Fagerson may get their chance later in the game.He won’t be making an appearance on this occasion as he plays for Welsh side Scarlets, but I am particularly interested in seeing Kiwi import Blade Thomson in the next three tests. Hopefully he can make an eye-catching debut to match his name.: : : : : : : :Family, friends, work colleagues and a good number of former footballers gathered on Friday to say farewell to Alastair Johnston from Cunningsburgh.When I first met him in the early s he was still an excellent player. He had represented Cunningsburgh, Ness United and ious Shetland select sides, once making a trip to Faroe with a county squad.Alastair was probably a wing-half in his early days, but after the change from -- to modern formations he usually formed part of the central defence.He played alongside the late Ian Manson for Ness, while for Cunningsburgh his long-term partner was Douglas Halcrow. They were part of a team which enjoyed many successes in Southern League football, and also which won the Parish Cup in  and .Cunningsburgh had a number of outstanding players in that era, not least twins Billy and Malcolm Adamson and the late George Adamson, but Alastair was definitely one of the most consistent.Very similar to his -year career at The Shetland Times, he was as dedicated as it was possible to be, someone you could always count on whatever the issue.As former goalkeeper Peter Farmer said after the funeral last Friday, “I played behind Alistair for  years and he was so reliable, the way he read the game.”Football runs in the family. His younger brother Gordon also played for Cunningsburgh and Ness while another brother Jim represented Shetland in  and . Nephews Raymond and James Aitken and Tony and James Johnston did likewise, with the latter becoming the county’s equal most-capped player.When the Times started a works league team in the s Alistair was persuaded to come out of retirement and take part in the very first match, a friendly against Bressay. That was where his we hailed from and I recall him saying that “I better no score a goal or Margaret will nivver spaek ta me again”.He also came with the works team on a trip to Orkney. He was a bit unsure about that and actually got injured in one of the matches, but as far as I recall he had as good a time as anybody where the after-match entertainment was concerned.Alastair and Margaret had three daughters, Wendy and twins Susan and Alison. They were all musically gted while Susan and Alison excelled at hockey.One of his grand-daughters, Sophie Moar, is a top athlete. At the island games in Jersey three years ago she won a bronze medal in the long jump and was a member of the gold medal-winning # metres relay squad. Alastair and Margaret were there to see it and I would imagine that was one of his proudest ever moments. After his retiral in  our paths crossed a few times but unfortunately not all that often. He was always friendly and good company.The last time I saw Alastair was earlier this year when I visited him and Margaret at Bremmer in Cunningsburgh. It was a very dficult experience as by then the dementia had taken its toll, and he was a shadow of the vibrant figure he had been. He still knew me though, which made it worthwhile.Alistair was a tremendous guy. I know Margaret, their daughters and grandchildren, and the other family will miss him greatly, and I would like to give my condolence to them all.: : : : : : : :News came this week that Crystal Palace footballer James McArthur had retired from Scotland duty as he believed it was the only way he could “continue to play at the top level”.There was a time when representing your country was considered the “top level” but sadly that is not a view shared by an increasing number of people in the game.McArthur, who won the last of his  caps a year ago, says he has found it increasingly dficult to manage a number of physical issues. He is only .The Crystal Palace midfielder will continue to turn out for his club in what could be -odd games a season. However, he has deemed the half a dozen or so he could be required for his international side to be just too much.McArthur follows in the wake of a number of Scottish players who have taken this decision, the highest profile being Celtic captain Scott Brown. Others, such as Alan Hutton, are still performing regularly for their clubs.There were also the recent instances where both Leigh Grfiths, Robert Snodgrass and Kieran Tierney asked to be released from the international squad because of perceived “fatigue”.No doubt McArthur, like the others mentioned, has his reasons for arriving at this decision. But I cannot help thinking that players from a dferent era would never have done so.Some, notably Denis Law and current Scottish boss Alex McLeish, have said they have never retired from their country. They would still be availablerequired. Attitudes have definitely changed, and not for the better.: : : : : : : :The Australian Cricketers’ Associationthis week called for the bans to be lted on the three players who were involved in ball-tampering in South Africa earlier this year.The association has laid part of the blame for the incident at the door of Cricket Australia, who it has labelled “arrogant and controlling”.Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft were all “contrite men who have suffered enough”, a review carried out by the ACA stated.Smith, who was captain at the time, and vice-captain Warner are seven months into their one-year bans, while Bancroft, who carried out the cheating, will be eligible tonext month.While the three may have endured both a degree of humiliation – Smith’s tearful confession was felt by some to be meaningful – and financial penalties, lting the ban now would send all the wrong signals.Cheating in sport, however apologetic the protagonists may appear in the aftermath, is an anathema which needs punishing.

SIC has a poor record of flag flying in my opinion from the senior flagstaff. It#s the UK government#sand Scottish Parliaments policy to encourage councils to fly the Union Flagon a regular daily basis. It#s very rare to see a flag flying any time except on the Lord Lieutenants flag flying days list ofwhich is out of date.It is troubling to hear where the British media still blame German militarism and nationalism for WW, asnationalism and militarism were ever missing from the British national outlook. All major European powers fought to gain advantage over neighbours.It is refreshing though to hear the French President tell world leaders, including Putin and Trump, that nationalism is a #betrayal of patriotism#.#By saying #our interests first and never mind the others#, you stamp out the most precious thing a nation has # its moral values,# he said, thereby insisting these sometimes exist.The European Union used to be widely regarded as a moral endeavour. It seems most of our neighbours still see it that way, as something worthwhile which tempers selfish instincts and secures peace.If Brexit goes ahead the prospect of Britain forgetting its responsibilities as a victor, as Churchill put it in, #for the immediate future of the world# looms large. Let us hope some lessons can be recalled.#Patriotism is when the love of your own people comes first nationalism, when hate for people other than your own comes first.# # Charles de GaulleSadly we see Donald Trump, #America First!, Let#s make America great again#. A nationalist doctrine of utter selfishness!We seem the same doctrine of the Alt-right gaining a foothold in the UK and Europe. Remember #The Only Thing Necessary for the Triumph of Evil is that Good Men Do Nothing#,It is a sad reflection of the many, many people which has died due to war and conflict.There is one institute which promotes, encourages and sanctions war and conflict more so than any other establishment within a modern society.We have probably killed and maimed more people in the last  years than at any other time in  years. What has brought this to the fore is technology but also the institutes which have remained silent on such atrocities, this being the backbone of modern societies driven by economics, our banking systems.Never has there been so much money spent on war and conflict, never have so many countries been destroyed by war and conflict, and who stands by the sideline reaping in massive profits as a result, our banks.The Bible says # For the Love of Money is the Root to All Evils # never a truer word said with our modern banking systems.Rather sad that at a time when we remember those that saw the horror of so many European conflicts, we also saw the French and German leaders announce they want to create a #real# EU Army. I presume by #real# they mean, #the ability to kill people#. Not only was it tactless of Merkel and Macron, we surely have enough standing armed forces already in the world. Do we really need another Jane , I feel sure that Merkel and Macron were not thinking along the same lines as yourself .They stated the need for a ‘ real army’without any references to the huge revenues that could be gained from the manufacture of arms.It’s all very well trying to pass their claim off as being for the strength and safety of Europe but with no reference whatsoever to the economic   financial benefits which would bolster the banking strengths of Germany and France. What an oversight !!Too much sauerkraut and champagne probablyto blame.I wondertheir suggestion is in any way due to their much reduced popularity in their respective countries.I would have thought the present EU decision-making structure e.g. nations’ vetoes, is hopelessly incompatible with having its own military, capable of defending Europe against Russia, China and laughably, the US. How much will that cost  It will need massive further integration, possibly, to United States of Europe level , a ghastly spectre that motivated many Brexiteers to vote ‘Leave’. year more than the next seven countries put together at  billion dollars.To say that the E.U. should not work militarily together is preposterous.Europe has been ided by maniacs with delusions of grandeur,their own ego#s and agendas on too many occasions # the last fty years has brought us peace,economic stability and a continent able to feed itself.I am sure WinstonChurchillwould be very proud of that after the hell of World ,he fought like so many others for it and would be appalled at the prospect of Little Englanderism and the new Westminster faith with its no deal brexit nonsense! Hungarian Revolution of , Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia, the Turkish invasion of Cyprus, The Bosnian War, The Kosovo War, Annexation of Crimea, The Ukraine crisis, The Russo-Georgian War and that is ignoring The Troubles in Ireland and countless terrorist attacks. We have a death toll here of tens of thousand and rising! Graham Fleming at least make a stab at historical fact occasionally.John, look at the EU command structure! The most expensive army on Earth would require a  Sate agreement before it could deploy. Then it could not fire a shot. If it hit an killed an enemy how about that enemy#s human rights  Iy takes # The Europen Court # about four years to reach a design!Thank God we are not talking about a European Navy, climate change and all that, sailing ships only.All of these good things I mentioned happened within our European Union,the bad bit you mentioned truthfully# was Northern Ireland, mainly the domain and remit of the British state doesn#t bode well for the future at all,at all.Interesting that the Great War commemoration coincides with Theresa May#s abject surrender to the EU.One big threat from May#s deal is to the UK union itself with the proposal that Northern Ireland be separated from the rest of the UK and be under Brussels laws and regulations.As predicted, the SNP now want the same treatment and will use that as a #grievance# to win support for a second Scottish independence referendum.The current mess will also play straight into their hands by confirming their allegations of #Westminster incompetence#.How on earth could anyone accuse the Westminster government of incompetence Many events over the past four years that have commemorated the sacrice of so many people have been profoundly moving .However I have been a bit upset this year.I have noticedthat local communities were trying to #outdo# each other with their poppydisplays.Well-meant I am sure, but remembrance is not about community #one-up-man-ship#, it is very personal and I am sad that in some places it has been turned into a #best display# competition # a Halloween of who can remember best.

A lot of visitor experiences are going to be marred.\"Adam Gough, CairnGorm Mountain representative, who had told of the need for the slopes aimed at beginners and intermediates, was clearly stunned by the rejection.Asked immediately after the decisionan appeal was likely, he said that a statement would be issued later.CNPA head planner Gavin Miles had stressed from the outset the application had to be determined on planning issues ndash landscaping impacts in particular ndash and not on its commercial merits, which had generated much argument.He said the business case was a matter for Natural Retreats.Mr Miles told the committee the articial slope would not extend the ski area in any signicant way but the footprint of obvious development would increase.He commented: \"Initially the team were very concerned about the landscaping but as more information was given to us by the applicants it was considered that in the long term planting would mitigate against that. There would be an impact in the short term of the dry ski slope.\"Whether it will ever be an attraction in its own right and generate signicant income, who knows, but that is not a consideration of the planning process.\"In effect it is a ersication of business in this area and therefore acceptable andit was to strengthen the stability of CairnGorm Mountain then thats a good thing.\"He said there were some hefty planning conditions attached to control the development.CairnGorm Mountains representative said some  per cent of total visits to the resort were in just three winter months of the year.Mr Gough had told the committee Natural Retreats had explored several options in depth to remove the reliance on winter income including mountain biking and zip-wiring but this plan was the most viable at this time.He said it was imperative the attraction can provide year-round employment in order to retain its best staff. This site was the most sheltered for the ski slope and close to other facilities without impacting on other slopes, he said. It could also be used for tubing and other activities.Mr Gough acknowledged the clamour for better ski uplt at CairnGorm which has been overtaken as Scotlands most popular ski resort.He said: \"We would like nothing more than to be able to upgrade ski infrastructure to improve the snowsports experience for everyone but this has to be a long term process built on solid commercial foundations.\"He said the slope could be in operation for  per cent of the year outwith winter and ice would not be a problem as it was easy practice to break it up.ABA secretary Alan Brattey said history showed articial slopes at Scottish resorts including the Lecht, Glenshee and Glencoe had not worked.He also said a bright green Snowflex slope would stand out like a sore thumb and no consideration had been given by the operator to an alternative by market leader, Neveplast, which could be camouflaged.He said that of just over  votes on Facebook on the application,  per cent were against it.Tessa Jones, of the Badenoch and Strathspey Conservation Group, asked the committee: \"What are you going to say to the world about this peatland destruction \"Committee member Dave Fallows moved the application be refused and he was seconded by Carolyn Caddick.He said he appreciated the efforts to mitigate against the ski slope but said: \"It cant possibly soften in the long term the impact that this makes on the area.\"Mrs Caddick said: \"We are going to see it for miles and miles around.\"Peter Argyle had moved in favour of the application saying he had faith in the planning officers conditions but was not supported.Mr Brattey said after the vote: \"This was very much the right decision and wed like to congratulate the planning committee for deciding to reject this planning application against the advice of their planning officials.\"We very much hope that common sense will now prevail and that the plans for the Ptarmigan Building will be dropped.\"We are left to wonder just exactly why HIE allowed their tenant to take such a madcap plan all the way to the CNPAs planning committee who were very decisive in their rejection of it.\"He said HIE should ert the pound million to new uplt. \"The hill business requires to be funicular proofed as soon as possible,\" said Mr Brattey.Tuesday  Nov  : PM"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118338.jpg","title":"Helping mountain to reach its peak","story":"Gavin MusgroveA pound MILLION vision to revive CairnGorm Mountain has been laid out to release the resorts immense unlocked potential over the next five to  years.US-based consultancy SE Group believes the resort can attract in the region of , winter visitors per year ndash more in seasons when there are peak snow conditions ndash with the right targeted investments.But controversially they appear to have written-off any future for Coire na Ciste which accounts for one-third of the ski area and boasts the best terrain for skiers and boarders at intermediate level and beyond.Instead the report proposes that all the focus for snowsports is on Coire Cas and two state-of-the art six person chairlts should be installed.There is also a role for the funicular which is currently not running at the resort because of safety fears.However, it is seen as having a subsidiary role as snowsports uplt and to be used and maintained more for non-skiers and ski school customers.Vermont-based SE Group carried out its independent review of uplt infrastructure at the resort between February and September, earlier this year.No funding has been allocated.

Importantly that means that visitors will be travelling through the Sleat peninsula, where communities have worked long and hard to build up a viable industry.“In the midst of the important debates about ferries and not least the importance of the MV Coruisk to the Armadale-Mallaig crossing, it’s important to celebrate the huge contribution that RET has made to the island economies.”If CalMac#s league tables of ferry route usage tell us anything, it is that moving the MV #Coruisk# from its purpose-built harbours on the busiest crossing in the north-west remains inexplicable.If the two tables of passengers and coaches highlight anything , it is that CalMac badly needs its two new ferries from the Clyde to be delivered according to their revised schedule and not experience a third delay.It is a mild surprise, as Kate Forbes MSP says, to discover that more people sail between Mallaig and Armadale in Skye than between Stornoway and Ullapool and that more coaches cross the Sound of Sleat than make any other journey on CalMac#s itinerary.It is good news not only for Sleat but for the whole of the island. It is good news which is tempered by the fact that this busy, bustling route is now served only by whatever ships CalMac can spare, when the tide permits them, while its purpose-built vessel, the MV #Coruisk#, which can dock at Armadale in all tidal conditions, is ploughing between Mull and Oban  nautical miles away.If CalMac had the ships, Mallaig Armadale would be dependable and therefore even busier, Mull would have a vessel of its own and almost everybody would be happy.CalMac do not have the ships in large part because two new deep-sea vessels which were commissioned in  from Ferguson Marine Engineering at Port Glasgow show no sign of turning up for duty.One of them is due to operate on CalMac#s busiest passenger route between Ardrossan and Arran. The other is to work between Uig, Tarbert and Lochmaddy, which last year carried almost , people.The delivery date for those two ships has been put back twice. On each occasion, the £ million contract to Ferguson Marine — which is the property of one of the Scottish Government#s friends, advisors and allies, the billionaire tax exile Jim McColl — was topped up by a multi-million-pound handout from the public purse.If all was on schedule at least one of those ships would now be in service, and CalMac would have substantially more leeway in manoeuvring its fleet from one part of the west coast to another. They might even be able to keep the #Coruisk# on the Sound of Sleat.They are very far from on schedule. The new Ardrossan Arran ferry is now supposed to be delivered next summer, and the new Uig Tarbert Lochmaddy ship in spring .Will they be delivered  Or will we experience a third delay, which would certainly plunge CalMac into even greater chaos as its ageing fleet breaks down or requires routine maintenance somewhere in the Baltic Those are important questions. As we reported last week, the chief executive of Outer Hebrides Tourism, Rob MacKinnon, has criticised the Scottish Government for a lack of any #tangible action# to address the islands# ferry problems.The Scottish transport ministry, said Mr MacKinnon, must #pursue all feasible options to increase ferry capacity in both the long and the short term for the benefit of both visitors and islanders#.As we report this week, Labour#s Western Isles# candidate Alison MacCorquodale has added her voice to the many demanding to know the precise terms of the private finance initiative deal which has bound the Scottish Government into using just one ferry for all passengers and freight between Ullapool and Stornoway, with unacceptable consequences.Ullapool Stornoway may not yet carry as many tourists as Mallaig Armadale. But it is the definition of a leline service, with , passengers last year, many of whom found themselves unable to squeeze onto an overbooked #Loch Seaforth#.We should be told how and why one of our biggest and most important ferries came to be owned by Lloyds Bank.We should be toldJim McColl is going to deliver two badly-needed ships at the third time of asking.It is not enough to say, as does transport minister Michael Matheson, that building CalMac#s ferries is #providing vital support to our shipbuilding industry#The way things are going, building and rebuilding CalMac#s ferries will keep Scottish shipbuilding alive well into the next decade. Their higher purpose, and Mr Matheson#s job is to provide vital support to the Hebridean ferry service. That support is urgently required."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/2018-mod-gold-medals-e1539885405814.jpg","title":"thursday at the mod skye and lochalsh gold medal","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThere was a Skye and Lochalsh double in the premier singing competition at this year’s National Mòd in Dunoon.In Wednesday night’s final Ceitidh Campbell from Kyle of Lochalsh won the women’s Gold Medal, while the men’s medal went to Ruairidh Cormack from Portree.Both singers are following in family footsteps in landing the prestigious honour, which is presented by Mòd organisers An Comunn Gàidhealach.Ceitidh’s mother, Barbara Smith, won the Gold Medal when the Mòd was held in Skye in .

This motion was agreed. earlier this week, the chair of the EDI committee, Councillor Allan Henderson said that the council was putting pressure on the Scottish Government to have the route classed as a trunk road. However, during Thursday’s meeting Councillor Cockburn was quick to dismiss the likelihood of this happening: “Who in their right mind would take  miles of the worst road in the Highlands” He said. “After six and a half years we still only have two options… and the delays and the consequences for the wider community have been absolutely shocking.”The SNP member for Wester Ross, Strathpeffer and Lochalsh also went on to question the tendering process behind the work at the bypass, saying: “Was it necessary to shut the road during the day  I believe there was a tender on the table that would have allowed the road to open during the day.”He went on to argue that the council needed to release money straight away to enable design work on the replacement options for the current bypass to begin, adding that it was a matter of urgency due to the risks identied in the  annual sloping report which detailed four very high-risk rock slopes at the Stromeferry bypass.In response to Councillor Cockburn, the council’s head of infrastructure Colin Howell said that the council did receive an alternative tender from a contractor who said they could carry out the required works at night, however, Mr Howell said the cost was signicant and due to concerns about these plans it was decided it would be wise for some of the work to be undertaken during the day.Mr Howell said that while there were ongoing issues with rockfalls and managing slopes, he believed that the council had done a good job. He went on to add that the council were prioritising the high-risk slopes and currently working on the cost and details in relation to stabilising those areas which would be delivered at the next EDI committee meeting.

For anartist of his stature this was courageous, dependent as he was, tosome extent, on commissions from people who, to say the least, wouldnot be subscribers to our paper. But this was an artist who went hisown way in art and who acted as a citizen with a conscience in anIreland where State-imposed censorship distorted not only politicaldebate but also national self-image. For Robert Ballaghcreative work and active citizenship have gone hand in hand all hisle. This is depicted in his double self-portrait ‘Upstairs No.’,one of the many illustrations of his work in this superbly writtenand beautully presented book. It is not a standard autobiographywith chapters set out in chronological order beginning with genealogyand ending with this week’s news. As you would expect from Ballagh,he takes a dferent approach, starting towards the later years andcircling through his days in no particular order before coming backto the present. More than that, he weaves narrative, anecdote andreflection together seamlessly and conversationally showing a skillwith words akin to his skill with brushes. He has a story to tell ofa very ied le, from his unusual family background to his time asa showband guitar player, through his unorthodox beginning as apainter and his development as an artist and an activist. Withfrankness and clarity he tells us how he learned and matured as anartist and his brief commentaries on many of his works areilluminating both of how they were made and the concepts behind them.It makes the reader want to look again and more intensely at thepictures. The Prologue isessentially a dedication to Robert’s late we Betty, his lelonginspiration, mentor and most important critic. The first chaptertells the harrowing story of how Betty, in her serious illness, wasdisgracefully let down by a healthcare system which basically allowedher to die through neglect, as was admitted in legal proceedings. Butthis does not cast a shadow over the book, as her positive presenceis felt throughout, and is celebrated by the author. These days I rarely getthat urge immediately to re-read a book when I reach the end, but Idid with this one. Thankfully the chapters are so well defined thatthey can be read as stand-alone essays or stories. Take just twoexamples: ‘Who Fears to Speak ofEaster Week’ recounts the tremendous people’s commemoration ofthe  Centenary in which Robert played a central part, aculmination of his activism which has included campaigning againstapartheid, for the Birmingham Six, for artists’ rights, with theIrish National Congress opening border roads, in solidarity withPalestine and as an enthusiastic participant in Féile an Pobail inWest Belfast from its commencement.‘Dining at McDonald’s’is a brilliant critique of the dominant and stultying modernistideology and practise in art and an appeal for an opening up. Ballaghattacks “the notion that the artists’ choice imbues a givenobject with special properties which are tantamount to a metaphysicaltransformation of the object that it ceases to be a pedestrianartefactand becomes,by virtue of the artist’s choice, art”. This ideology leads tothe absurdity of much of the ‘installation’ stuff in galleriesthat baffles all but elitist insiders and, as Ballagh recounts, theclaim by loyalist killer Michael Stone that his attack on Stormontwas a piece of performance art. He argues that the bureaucracies mustset aside this ideology and make galleries more open and democratic .For these views and forhis artistic method and, among some I suspect, for his politics,Ballagh has been frowned upon by certain elites. One prominent figurein the Irish art world said of him with dripping condescension thathe is “not a real artist, he is a mere illustrator”. Typically,Ballagh responded with humour and defiance in a self-portrait wearinga t-shirt saying ‘Fuck the Begrudgers’. I cannot recommend thisbook highly enough. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27486  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National Chairperson“The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office”Ive been wondering lately whether anyone in Democratic Unionist Partyleadership circles actually try to reflect upon what republicans, nationalists, and other progressive minded citizens think about the current political situation.Do they even care what others think The evidence suggests not.Several days ago the DUP leader pronounced that her party could and would change the Good Friday Agreementat a whim. There was no hint of irony in her claim – the DUP has spent the last  years opposing the GFA, ever since it was signed.In another extraordinary, but not untypical, outburst she declared her blood red line position on Brexit and, that in the same week as the consultation on dealing with the past was concluding!Of course the DUP leader, and other key figures have form in making offensive and provocative political interventions.Her dehumanising description of republicans as \"crocodiles\" in  comes to mind.Notably, she previously called republican and nationalist Ministers in a ing Executive ‘rogues and renegades.Only the DUP knows whether this leader is naturally predisposed to being rhetorically gaffe prone, or is being deliberately offensive.Perhaps some figures in the DUP do think about wider opinion: the DUP is not a monolith after all.But, those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power sharing.  They oppose equality and rights, and reject reconciliation.Instead they have chosen to join forces with the extremists in the British Tory party to help steer the Brexit train wreck.The DUP leadership is living in a delusional bubble.Meanwhile, the party brand has become indistinguishable from the financial scandals of recent years such as Red Sky, NAMA, Brexit dark money, and financial relationships with Sri Lanka.The ongoing RHI inquiry exposé of how the DUP behaved in government makes a complete mockery of its purported adherence to good governance’.The party MPs have become power drunk through their pact with the Tories, and a serious misconception that they are king makers in Westminster.  Edward Carsons cautionary words have clearly been forgotten or disregarded.  He warnedWhat a fool I was.  I was only a puppet, and so was Ulster… in the political game that was to get the Conservative party into power.’ The DUP has a tactical approach towards everything including maintaining the status quo on its own terms, slowing down and frustrating progressive societal change, and maintaining sectarian dominance within the unionist constituency.The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office.  Its inability and refusal to embrace dference or celebrate ersity is reflected in an institutionalised bigotry against, and intolerance towards the Irish national identity and cultural traditions, and LGBT rights.The partys contempt and sharp practice in government has destroyed wider public confidence in the political institutions, and led to the decisive tipping point of RHI and withdrawal of the Líofa grant scheme in the winter of .As a result of its ingrained arrogance and lack of political humility the DUP leadership is constantly in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarianism, homophobia, and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists, and many others, including sections of civic unionism, do not believe the DUP is serious about restoring genuine power sharing. These citizens want the institutions to be restored, but not at the risk of allowing the DUP to continue practicing discrimination, disrespect, intimidation, bigotry, and sharp practice. They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power on that basis.  And, neither will Sinn Féin.The DUPs behaviour, and the onslaught of Brexit have together brought back graphically into focus the denial of rights which resulted in the Civil Rights Movement fty years ago.A generational realignment has occurred within northern nationalism.Acht Gaeilge, marriage equality, womens reproductive health rights, legacy justice rights, and the demand for a Bill of Rights are the modern day acid test equivalents of one person, one vote.  The current crisis in the north of Ireland is the visceral culmination of  years of DUP push back against the GFA.Intoxicated with its imaginary power at Westminster, the DUP leadership has finally over played its hand. The political institutions could have been re-established by the th February last, but the DUP leaders walked out of negotiations.Instead of selling the deal which they negotiated in February with Sinn Féin, the DUP leader, deputy leader, party chief executive, and its senior talks team bottled out.Since then the party has been convulsed with the resultant internal fall out.  There has been no meaningful contact with Sinn Féin, and absolutely no willingness demonstrated to resume negotiations.Any advocacy of blood red lines is a total anathema to democracy.The wider nationalist constituency is fed up to the back teeth with the subversion of the political process by the DUP, the British Tory government and others in political unionism.It is more impatient than ever for equality, rights and parity of esteem.  The history of  is being replayed. Thousands marching from Duke Street in Derry city on Saturday th October to mark the iconic civil rights march  years before is the latest example of that.  An exciting momentum for change is taking place across Ireland, north and south.  Old orthodoxies are being eclipsed by discussions about new, modern, all-Ireland constitutional and political arrangements. The permanent unionist electoral majority is gone and demographic changes are irreversible.All of this puts the onus back upon both governments to act decisively to address the denial of rights.The Irish government needs to take the lead because for now the DUP has this British government over a barrel.  But thats a short-term situation.  A British general election in the immediate to mid term cannot be ruled out.A new political discourse has begun about the future. All sections of society need to be involved in this and the unionist is critical in all of this.Brexit, the GFA, citizens rights, and an Irish unity referendum are central to that. Progressives should explore common ground and alliances for change.Republicans and unionists need to start to face the same way.  We have to begin looking at each other through eyes of the future.The benchmarks of a rights-based society guaranteeing civil and religious liberties and equality for all, are set.  These are not negotiable.So, whoever is actually in charge of the DUP for the time being has a lot of serious thinking to do...Who now leads the DUP  Do they have the authority to negotiate and stick to an agreement Are they committed to a shared future with republicans, nationalists, and others in the north Unless, and until the DUP can clearly answer these questions for the rest of society, it will remain exactly where it is now – out of power, and facing the inevitable fate about which Carson warned: getting dumped by the British Tories.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27487  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaThe Liberal Party was in government in Britain and had introduced the Home Rule Bill with the support of the Irish nationalist MPs in Westminster.

Leading members of the British landed aristocracy, capitalists and senior military figures jumped on the bandwagon and backed up Unionist leader Edward Carson with threats of civil warHome Rule was brought in.Amidst the political frenzy there were very few Protestants in Ulster who were prepared to oppose Carsonism.

A minister of the Presbyterian Church, Armour stood out from most of his co-religionists in advocating self-government for Ireland. In , he opposed a resolution at the Presbyterian General Assembly condemning Gladstone’s second Home Rule Bill.

Sectarianism in the late s and early s stalked Belfast.While Walker was severely limited in his political analysis he was committed to improving the conditions of his fellow workers.He is an integral part of Belfast’s industrial history and his contribution to the city’s labour heritage deserves recognition.British policy in Ireland and its consequences for Irish society has ided Irish workers along communal lines. It has paralysed the labour movement from effectively challenging partition and championing the strategic aim of Irish unity.Partition is the central fault line at the heart of Irish society and politics.Sectarianism remains a visceral blight in this state.Following partition, it was used by the ruling unionist elite to cement the foundation of the state and prevent unity among citizens on issues of common concern.The fact is Labour was indeed told to wait as the resurgent struggle for national independence grew in momentum just over  years ago.The counter revolution which took place post partition represented a strategic setback for labour and working-class interests in the new free state.It eclipsed the seminal influence which socialist republicanism had on the  Proclamation and the Democratic Programme of the First Dáil.The rights of workers became subservient to the conservative elites, north and south.However, sections of the labour movement were compliant with British policy in Ireland and the imposition of partition.That was personied in the political thinking of Walker and others pre partition.This tendency opposed Connollys core position that \"the two currents of revolutionary thought in Ireland, the socialist and the national, were not antagonistic but complementary\".Walkers debate with Connolly reflected a key contradiction inherent in the Irish labour movement and its relationship with the Irish national liberation struggle, and anti-imperialism generally.That contradiction has existed ever since.Walkers brand of ‘Municipal Socialism’ was in reality a euphemism for self-imposed strategic and political limitations which went on to define the Trade Union movement in the north.As a result, the Irish labour movement, particularly in the north has failed to challenge partition and modern British political policy towards Ireland.Partition has been an abject failure. It was never designed to make the northern state a political or economic success.From the beginning this state has carried within it the conditions of inherent instability.It was built upon institutionalised and structural sectarianism which ensured that a substantial minority was destined never to be treated as equals.The Civil Rights Movement fty years ago exposed the inability of the unionist state to treat the minority as equals.That belligerent opposition from powerful sections within political unionism against reform of the northern state persists today in the form of political unionism, and specically DUP hostility towards implementation of the Good Friday Agreementsince .Refusal by the DUP to embrace a rights-based society and equality, culminated in the collapse of the GFA political institutions in January , and our associated political crisis which has continued since then. Those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power-sharing.The party brand is now indistinguishable from financial scandal and sharp practice in government.As a party, the DUP is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic reforms, social modernity, and standards in public office.Its project is negative and tactical, and entirely focused upon slowing down and blocking progressive change, while maintaining a sectarian hegemony within the unionist constituency.The DUP is in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarian, homophobic and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists and many others, including sections of civic unionism, have concluded that the DUP has had its chance and cannot now be trusted in government.They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power at the risk of allowing it to continue practicing discrimination, intimidation, bigotry, or sharp practice.The enduring political crisis is accentuated by systemic structural weaknesses in the regional economy.The required investment in local public services and protection of workers’ rights are confronted with a combination of Tory austerity and Brexit.Pressures on public services are intensying.The regional block grant, or public expenditure settlement, has been reduced by .%.Real term cuts to public funding are now factored into future budget profiles alongside ·         Actual net cuts in take home pay for public and private sector workers·         Welfare cuts and the universal social charge·         Higher inflation and living costs, adults in working families live in relative povertyAverage wages in the north remain lower than ten years ago.Precarious working conditions, zero hours’ contracts, and the scam of bogus self-employment used by some employers are in common practice.Workers’ rights and protections are being systematically reversed.The onset of Brexit will be a catastrophe for the regional and island economiesIt will deepen an existing race to the bottom by further undermining the potential for economic growth, and new investment.The Brexit agenda, twinned with Tory austerity threaten jobs across all economic sectors, workers’ terms and conditions, and, any potential for sustainable public services in the north.The dawning political and economic reality is that Brexit has changed everything.It has exposed the negative role that partition continues to play in Irish affairs, and the fundamentally anti-democratic nature of the union with Britain.  The British state has been pushed into an unprecedented, existential political crisis.Brexit is a train wreck being jointly steered by the DUP and extremists in the British Tory party.But it also has become a defining moment for these islands.A new generation is questioning partition.There has been a seismic sht in the ambitions and expectations of citizens in the north.A new political discourse has begun about the future of Ireland north and south, and our relationships with Britain and EuropeThe debate on Irish unity and the timing of a unity referendum have moved centre stage.The time has come for a fundamental paradigm sht in British government policy towards Ireland.The Irish government needs to begin preparing constitutional, political and economic transition towards Irish Unity.It should facilitate an open, inclusive national conversation involving all citizens, political parties, social partners, and civic society.That is a dialogue about our collective future on this island which addresses all the concerns, accommodations and compromises relevant to negotiating a new, all Ireland, constitutional, pluralist democracy.Today this new focus upon Irish unity provides Irish trade unionists and workers with an opportunity to influence the debate about future constitutional and political change.Previous moments of political change have required that labour should wait.The emerging challenge for the Irish labour movement north and south is to engage with this emerging discussion.To paraphrase Connolly in his opening contributions to the Connolly Walker debate\"Constitutional change then is almost a certainty of the future.”The labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.I said to the Belfast conference this reality will require Irish trade unionists to take strategic positions on supporting an Irish unity referendum and then to campaign positively for constitutional change.On Monday of this week I reiterated that opinion when I met Patricia King, General Secretary of ICTU in Dublin.Of course, this will be a challenging discussion for the Irish labour movement, as comrades noted both during and after the plenary discussion. But it should not be feared or avoided.Today in modern Ireland there is a battle for hearts and minds about how society is organisedThe status quo has failed us all.Connolly’s vision of a united Ireland which serves the interests of the many instead of the few will not be wished into existence.Labour should not wait again.The Irish labour movement needs to assert itself on the Irish unity debate by introducing a progressive labour agenda to the unfolding discourse on future constitutional and political change.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27491  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaThe writer, newspaper editor and Irish republican Seumas O’Kelly was a native of Loughrea, County Galway. Author of short stories, plays, poems and a novel, The Weaver’s Grave which was his masterpiece, O’Kelly’s le was cut short because of his commitment to Irish freedom. The O’Kelly family of Loughrea were flour millers and merchants and Seumas received a good education. He was a fellow student of James Joyce in University College Dublin. There is a remarkable photograph of the BA degree class of  including Joyce, O’Kelly and George Clancy. Like O’Kelly, George Clancy, a close friend of Joyce, was to die a tragic death. He was Sinn Féin Mayor of Limerick when on  March  he was murdered in his home by the Black and Tans, on the same night as former Mayor Michael O’Callaghan. Seumas O’Kelly was a committed republican from an early age. He is recorded as one of those to the fore in the centenary commemorations of the  Rising in . He was writing for Arthur Grfith’s Irish Republican Brotherhood-funded newspaper The United Irishman from  and for its successor Sinn Féin from . While a full list of attendees is not available it is probable that he was at the founding meeting of Sinn Féin in November . In  O’Kelly was appointed editor of the Leinster Leader in Naas, County Kildare. He founded a branch of Conradh na Gaeilge in the town and was active in Sinn Féin locally. He welcomed republicans to his home during the annual Wolfe Tone commemorations in nearby Bodenstown. O’Kelly’s first book of stories was published in  and his first play was produced the following year. Several of his plays were produced at the Abbey Theatre. Constantly busy with literary and journalistic work, O’Kelly was subject to poor health. He joined Óglaigh na hÉireann when they were founded in  but was unable to play an active military role. His brother was a Volunteer and was jailed in England after the  Rising. The paper Nationality, edited by Grfith, was established in  and O’Kelly was one of its writers. It was the main organ of Sinn Féin during the  and  by-elections. In May  Grfith was arrested and jailed in England and O’Kelly took over as editor of Nationality. Following the  November  Armistice which ended the First World War, British soldiers and loyalists ran riot through the streets of Dublin, attacking suspected Sinn Féin supporters. On the night of  November a crowd of drunken soldiers invaded the Sinn Féin Ard Oig at  Harcourt Street . Seumas O’Kelly was at his desk in the Nationality office and tried to defend himself with his walking stick. The office was wrecked and O’Kelly collapsed. He was brought to Jervis Street Hospital where he died of a brain haemorrhage. Seumas O’Kelly was honoured with a republican funeral to Glasnevin Cemetery, attended by huge crowds.

In  the Women’s Social and Political Union was founded in England and the militant feminists commenced the battle for the vote. In Ireland there had been groups working for women’s suffrage but the campaign really began here on the instigation of Hanna Sheehy Skeffington and Margaret Cousins. Margaret Cousins came from a unionist family in Dublin but she later wrote: “I belonged in my heart from the beginning to the fighters for freedom.” Her husband James Cousins also rejected the unionism of his background and became involved in the Gaelic revival. Margaret came into contact with the women’s movement in England in . On herto Ireland she co-operated with a remarkable young woman who was to make her mark on Irish history. Hanna Sheehy was the daughter of a Fenian, David Sheehy, who took part in the  Rising and was elected as a Parnellite MP in . Hanna was an exceptional student and excelled academically despite the restrictions on women’s access to education she achieved a first class honours MA in . She became a teacher and married Francis Skeffington. In line with their shared feminist principles they adopted each other’s surnames. Francis resigned his post as registrar of University College because the authorities refused to register women on the same basis as men. In  Hanna and Margaret founded the Irish Women’s Franchise League , with the active support of both Francis Sheehy Skeffington and James Cousins. From the beginning they stressed that the IWFL would address the specic needs of Irish women in “a subject country seeking freedom from England” and would “work on independent Irish lines”. Margaret Cousins described the IWFL’s position: “Its policy was to educate by all forms of propaganda the men, women and children of Ireland to understand and support the members of the League in their demand for votes for women, and to obtain pledges from every Irish Member of Parliament to vote for Women’s Suffrage Bills introduced in the British Houses of Parliament, and to include Women’s Suffrage in any Irish Home Rule Bill.” The IWFL campaigned throughout the country and made an impact beyond their numbers of about  activists. Not all militant women agreed with the IWFL’s tactics the republican group Inghinidhe na hÉireann refused to join in lobbying the British parliament, preferring to “organise a women’s movement on Sinn Féin lines, or on lines even broader still”. Despite this dference, republican women such as Constance Markievicz played an active role in the IWFL’s work and Hanna Sheehy Skeffington herself was strongly republican. Markievicz urged young Irishwomen to prepare to fight: “Arm yourselves with weapons to fight your nation’s cause. Arm your souls with noble and free ideas. Arm your minds with the histories and memories of your country and her martyrs, her language, and a knowledge of her arts and industries. Andin your day the call should come for your body to arm, do not shirk from that either.” Markievicz said Irishwomen were “doubly enslaved with a double battle to fight”. Following the  general election the Irish Party at Westminster was in a position to press the Liberal government to publish a Home Rule Bill. But Redmond and his party still refused to support women’s right to vote. The IWFL became more militant and Hanna and Francis founded the Irish Citizen newspaper to further the cause of women’s rights as well as Irish independence, social justice and pacism. When British politicians visited Ireland they were challenged by the IWFL. Margaret ‘Meg’ Connery confronted British Tory leader Andrew Bonar Law and Unionist leader Edward Carson when they came to Dublin. In Belfast Hanna Sheehy Skeffington challenged Winston Churchill. Margaret Cousins joined protests in England in  and was jailed for a month. In June  eight women from the IWFL smashed windows in Dublin Castle and other prominent buildings. Hanna was arrested at the Castle and she and the seven others were imprisoned in Mountjoy. The following month British Prime Minister Asquith visited Dublin and there were more protests. Three English feminists had followed Asquith to Ireland and they were also jailed for their protests. After a hunger strike in Mountjoy by the English suffragists and the IWFL women, all were released except two of the Englishwomen who were subjected to forced feeding. Many meetings of the IWFL were physically attacked at this time by Redmondites who saw the campaign for women’s suffrage as a threat to their political dominance and their relationship with the British Liberal government. In contrast, republicans such as Pádraig Mac Piarais and Thomas MacDonagh were supporters of the IWFL. The IWFL also won the support of prominent trade unionists James Larkin and James Connolly. They were closely allied with the Irish Women Workers Union in Liberty Hall and in  Hanna Sheehy Skeffington was jailed after a confrontation with the Dublin politan Police during the Great Lockout. She was released after a six-day hunger strike. That year also saw the death in England of feminist Emily Davison who ran on to the course at the Epsom Derby and was trampled by a race horse. Hanna Sheehy Skeffington was jailed again in  for campaigning against recruitment to the British Army. Her influence and that of the IWFL was seen in the Proclamation of the Irish Republic of  which enshrined women’s right to vote. Her friend James Connolly told her: “You will be glad to know that in the Proclamation of the Irish Republic we are including equal citizenship for women.” Hanna replied that she knew who was responsible, meaning Connolly himself. “We were practically unanimous, Only one questioned it,” replied Connolly. Francis Sheehy Skeffington was murdered in Portobello Barracks by a British Army officer during the Easter Rising. Hanna embarked on a tour of the United States to expose the truth about the murder and other British atrocities. She continued to play a leading role in the struggle for Irish freedom, as did many of the pioneering feminists of the IWFL. In  the IWFL saw its central aim achieved when women voted for the first time in the general election which resulted in a massive Sinn Féin victory, although women under  were still excluded. The IWFL actively opposed British rule and supported Dáil Éireann. For example in August  Hanna was badly beaten by the RIC who attacked a Sinn Féin meeting at which she spoke in Kilbeggan, Co. Westmeath. IWFL women went on to champion women’s rights in the decades following the Treaty when they faced the very dferent challenges of a partitioned Ireland with conservative anti-women governments North and South. The Irish Women’s Franchise League was founded  years ago on  November .test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27493  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonA wreckers’ agenda is being driven by the DUP and Tory government.

The historic gathering came in the wake of the campaign in support of the H-Block and Armagh prisoners, the epic Hunger Strikes, the intervention of prisoner candidates, North and South, in  and Sinn Féin’s electoral rise in the Six Counties in  and .The party’s performance in the October  Assembly elections – when five republicans were elected to the body set up by British direct ruler Jim Prior – caused alarm to the SDLP and their supporters in the Establishment parties in the  Counties. Sinn Féin’s lead in boycotting the Assembly was followed by the SDLP for fear of losing further support to republicans. The Fine Gael Labour Government, led by Garret FitzGerald, set up the New Ireland Forum in Dublin mainly as a  for the SDLP. In June , the political establishment in Ireland and Britain was rocked by the election of Sinn Féin Vice-President Gerry Adams as MP for his native west Belfast. For long a leading republican activist, Adams advocated the deeper politicisation and popularisation of the republican struggle and the building of Sinn Féin across the  Counties.The British Tory government of Margaret Thatcher was also concerned at the rise of Sinn Féin. In the week before the Ard Fheis in November , Prior told Tory MPs that Ireland could become a “Cuba off Britain’s west coast”. He said he feared Sinn Féin could overtake the SDLP electorally and “we must do all we can to strengthen constitutional nationalism”. When the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis gathered in the Mansion House in Dublin on  and  November, it was set to elect a new leadership. Ruairí Ó Brádaigh had been president since  and he announced that he would not be seeking re-election. He said the four-province federal Ireland plan, of which he had been a strong advocate, had been rejected at the  Ard Fheis and his approach on other issues, including electoral strategy, had been rejected by the Ard Chomhairle.In his address, the new party president, Gerry Adams, dismissed media claims of a ‘Northern takeover’ and said:“We are not a Northern, nor a Southern party – we are an Irish republican party organised throughout Ireland.”The main theme of his speech was the need for republicans to break out of political isolation and “get among the people in the basic ways which the people accept”. In line with this approach, the Ard Fheis voted to contest European Parliament elections with the intention of taking seatsthey were won. This followed the expansion of party electoral strategy the previous year. The Ard Fheis coincided with a by-election campaign for the Dáil seat of Dublin Central, which was contested by Sinn Féin candidate Christy Burke, turning in a creditable performance. There was further controversy after the Ard Fheis, and discomfort for Fianna Fáil leaders in particular, when Gerry Adams was confirmed as the main speaker at the annual Kilmichael commemoration in west Cork. Gerry Adams was elected president of Sinn Féin at the Ard Fheis of November ,  years ago.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27495  ","story":" Robbie SmythOver the last  years Irishsociety has evolved and transformed in many ways.

Ireland north or south was never a concern yet we will all pay the cost for generations to come.Brexit represents a huge threat to the social, economic and political le of this island. The outworking of Brexit could be the imposition of hard border.That is why the people of the north - from all communities and backgrounds - voted to reject it.They knew it would devastate the economy, strip away rights and undermine our political agreements.And that is why, in the immediate aftermath of the referendum result, Sinn Féin embarked on a diplomatic offensive across Europe warning of the dangers of Brexit and putting forward our demand for a unique solution for the north which would respect the majority remain vote.Through intense lobbying in Brussels, Strasbourg, Dublin and London, Sinn Féin led and built support for the idea that our unique position and peace agreements required a unique Brexit solution.Our case for special status for the north within the EU sought to ensure there would be no hard border, that citizens rights would be upheld and the Good Friday Agreement protected in all its parts.As the prospect of a no deal Brexit became more likely, we made it clear the north needed to remain in the customs union and single market in order to prevent our economy being driven off a clf by the Tories and their DUP allies.That was reflected in the backstop which was agreed by the EU and the British government. But as soon as it was agreed the British government, as they always do, began trying to renege on its commitments.Our position remains now as it was then. That backstop must be maintained and protected. It provides the bottom line and is our insurance policy against the worst excesses of Brexit, which we know will be a disaster for this country.The backstop is not perfect and neither is the withdrawal agreement. There is no such thing as a good Brexit after all.There are still issues of concern and clarication required, particularly relating to the issues of rights and representation.Over the course of the last number of days Sinn Féin has met with An Taoiseach and An Tanáiste and have been in contact with Theresa May about all of these concerns.The pro-remain parties represent the majority of people in the north and are fighting on their behalf.By contrast, the DUP are actively trampling the best interests of people and business in the north in their reckless cheerleading for an as yet  Tory Brexit.Sinn Féin will continue to stand with all other parties who advocate for citizens’ rights, our economic interests and our agreements in the face of Brexit.  We will continue to put pressure on the Irish government to act in the interests of citizens, north and south and hold the Taoiseach to his pledge that the people of the north will never again be left behind by an Irish Government.Whatever twists and turns the Brexit debacle takes next, the backstop as agreed must be maintained. It cannot be sacriced in an attempt to save the ailing career of Theresa May or to serve the hard-line agendas of the Brexiteers in the Tory party or the DUP. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27499  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonGUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers# rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.- Declan Kearney MLADimitrios Papadimoulis is a Greek MEP who represents the Syriza party in the European Parliament.He has spent a le time involved in left wing political activism in his native Greece and has been a member of the Syriza central leadership which brought the party from opposition into government in , while the country was still in the midst of its financial and economic crisis and subjected to extreme political and economic pressure by the European Unionestablishment.Dimitrios is ‘laconic and philosophical in the way of Sparta’ – to borrow a phrase he used during a contribution at a recent conference which we attended together in Brussels, organised by GUE-NGL the European Parliamentary group to which both Sinn Féin and Syriza are affiliated.This meeting brought together leadership representatives and MEPs from twenty of the most signicant political parties on the progressive Left in the EU to discuss the future direction of GUE-NGL and future political strategy and co-operation among left wing and progressive parties including the  European elections, and the next term of the EU parliament.During one of our conversations at the conference Dimitrios recalled a story from - years previously, when he was travelling to deliver a speech.Dimitrios told his taxi driver what he was planning to say at the meeting.The taxi man replied:“Remember, you are a politician, not a prophet. Do not promise me things it will take  years to achieve. Make change for me tomorrow.”Dimitrios immediately decided to change his speech. He learned a lesson that day from the taxi driver which has stayed with him ever since.Theories or notions, and even visions for changeremain just that unless they can translate into concrete change in society.People want change which makes a material dference in their lives for them and their families.And thats how it should be.Fair wages high quality education and health services free at the point of delivery and a clean sustainable environment should not be dreams. They need to become realities.So political activists who are committed to transformational change need to be grounded in the real world.They have to understand what they can deliver in the here and now, and then to have a plan to achieve even more.But the progressive Left can only make change when it has the strength to do so.That means setting realistic objectives and priorities, and then devising strategies which work.I said in my opening comments to the conference that Europe is at a crossroads.The political direction, policy orientation, and increasing need for reform of the EU coupled with, and often fuelling the rise of the extreme right wing, now presents an existential threat to the principles of the progressive Left.Social democracy has effectively collapsed both politically and electorally across Europe.There is a need to build a progressive Left alternative, and to popularise a new political narrative or common sense based upon core ideas: To include:·         That economies serve the many and not the few:·         That human and democratic rights are inalienable:·         That the global environment is protected:·         That Europe should act as a force for international peace and solidarity: and·         That racism, sectarianism, misogyny, homophobia and xenophobia are opposed.These ideas should be a common  for expanding the political strength of the progressive Left.However, that potential faces many challenges.Some of these are beyond the control of the progressive Left, but others are not.All of this was under discussion at the GUE-NGL conference.There were many notable contributions.Arnaldo Otegi, the General Secretary of the EH Bildu was in attendance.He had just received the ground breaking judgement from the European Court of Human Rights, which ruled his prosecution was wrong.During Arnaldos presentation he provided a powerful critique of global capitalism and the importance of defending community and social values.Panos Skourletis has been a senior minister of the Syriza government.In a highly signicant move several months ago, he moved from that role to take up the position of Secretary of Syrizas Central Committee.Panos set out an analysis of the situation in Greece and wider Europe and argued that it is time for a common front of left parties and other progressives and democratic forces in Europe.Earlier I argued that unity and cohesion are essential between parties and democratic forces on the left in Europe: and that we must focus on what expands unity, whilst respecting our dferences and uniqueness as parties and national movements.Sinn Féin believes that GUE-NGL has successfully enabled progressive parties from the left to co-operate within the European Parliament, whilst recognising the autonomy of political delegations.This is one of GUE-NGL’s strengths as a parliamentary group and deserves to be consolidated.Unanimity is not required on all issues, all of the time but progressives cannot afford to be disunited.Political sectarianism undermines political strength, solidarity and fraternity on the progressive Left.The collective strength of the progressive Left in Europe stems from the domestic relevance and political strength of its constituent parts.The left will only be as strong in the European Parliament as progressive Left and republican parties are relevant and strong in their national contexts.The success of a real progressive Left alternative,  depends upon securing strategic beach heads of political strength and influence.This is why support for Europes only left wing government in Greece is so politically important.Whilst progressives need to be in a hurry to make change and in pursuit of a social and more democratic Europe, we also need to be realistic and pragmatic.The distinction between strategy and tactical positions need to be understood.Alliances with others are indispensable to the process of changing the overall balance of forces.Rigid or dogmatic ideological positions can prevent agreement upon shared objectives and securing unity among the widest cross section of progressive and democratic opinion.The political discussion and focus upon an emergent European Progressive Caucus embracing the Left, social democrats, and environmentalists is such an innovative and welcome initiative.I proposed to the Brussels conference that a strategic consensus among the progressive Left and others should be based upon support for national independence, social emancipation, citizens rights, and democratic control over the economy.For our part Sinn Féin will contest the European election in  on an agenda which advocates for the creation of a Social Europe.We will be emphasising the need to protect rural and fishing communities the promotion of economic democracy enhanced environmental policy, human rights and social justice as well as defence of the Irish peace process and support for a united Ireland.The onset of Brexit has changed the political and social landscape in Ireland, and also signicantly influenced political discourse within the EU itself.It has swept away all of the established constitutional, political and economic assumptions about the status quo in Ireland and refocused international attention upon the democratic case for Irish unity.During the conference I highlighted the denial of citizens rights and blocking of political democracy in the north of Ireland by the DUP and British Tory government. The point was made that this existential rights crisis, combined with the imposition of Brexit represented the most serious threat to the Good Friday Agreement, and the democratic option for managing change in the north of Ireland.The European Parliament  EU institutions have become strategically important forums within which to promote the democratic aim of a united Ireland and to encourage support for an Irish unity referendum. The level of interest in, and support for constitutional change in Ireland is now at an unprecedented high level across the EU.Sinn Féin will continue lobbying to make the case for a united Ireland a priority for the progressive Left and within other sections of democratic opinion represented in the European Parliament. Irish unity is integral to the vision of a new Europe.Going forward, the progressive Left in Europe needs to focus its collective efforts upon maximising representation and influence in the next parliament.GUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.That is what the shared ambition of a New Europe should mean. Sinn Féin has a central role in promoting that vision.The progressive Left across Europe has much to do.We need to be people in a hurry.The future cannot wait.We need to plan, organise and attract the popular support to make change for all tomorrow: To build a New Europe - a Europe of Equals. test"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1106582.jpg--.jpg?1540373104000\n","title":"allen s meats moves to larger premises in cullybackey","story":"AFTER  years serving the people of Ahoghill Allens Meats has moved to larger premises to meet the demands of the growing business.The butchers shop has relocated to Cullybackey to take over the former Lamont Butchers at  Main Street in the village.Allens Meats needed to acquire larger premises and decided to make the move to Cullybackey after David Lamont retired.Lamont Butchers has been based in Cullybackey since  and Derek Allen and his team will continue to provide the same excellent customer service and top quality produce.Derek said: “The business is growing and we needed more space to enable us to offer a wider range of products.“We would like to thank all our customers in Ahoghill for their support over the last  years.

It is not a reflection of politics or religion and it is not red to reflect the colour of blood.The full motion read: That this Council was disappointed to learn of the decision by Cambridge Universitys Student Union to vote down a motion to promote Remembrance Sunday and therefore records its objection to this decision to ignore such a signicant event in our history.Cllr Henry continued, saying: If this is the way our young people have been taught, what hope do we have We as a nation look to our students in the hope that one day they will be our leaders in many walks of le.He also said: When the young people of Cambridge University voted overwhelmingly to de-emphasise the sacrice of the armed forces, thereby striking out any reference to the British war veterans, remembrance day and the poppy they brought untold hurt and suffering to many families who lost loved ones during the wars.What a despicable way to show gratitude to many hundreds of thousands who gave their all so as those students and indeed everyone of us can enjoy the freedom of democracy that we have today.Our freedoms cost many everything they had.It is easy to judge from a distance when you have the luxury of a safe and comfortable democracy.Cllr Henry requested that the council write to Cambridge University to: express their disgust and revulsion at the decision made by the Students Union. Speaking to second the motion, DUP Councillor Paul Reid said: The poppy is an emblem of remembrance used since .The poppy is not a political symbol, it is not a religions symbol but a reminder of those who fought for freedom.TUV Councillor Brian Collins thanked Cllrs Henry and Reid for bringing this matter to the attention of Mid and East Antrim Council.He said: This is a very emotive subject.To Cambridge Universitys Student Union, shame on you. Many a young man and women left the university and interrupted their studies to go a serve their nation, and many of them never ed to their studies.We have to remember the families. This is just disgraceful.The TUV fully support this important motion.UUP Councillor AP Wilson also supported the motion.He said: We share the disappointment with Cambridge Universitys student union.Cllr Wilson, however said he didnt think Council should get involved in: undergraduate student union politics, saying that: Sometimes there are lots of brains and not necessarily much common sense.He said that Council should do all they can to make sure remembrance was respectful and not party political.Alliance Councillor Paul Sinclair was also concerned about getting involved in student politics.He said: We should reaffirm our support for Remembrance Sunday.After a recorded vote, Sinn Fein Councillors Hardy and McKeown voted against the motion while Councillor Paul Maguire, Alliance Councillor Paul Sinclair and SDLP Councillor Declan OLoan abstained from voting.

Sinn Fein Councillor Patrice Hardy brought forward a motion as last weeks full council meeting, which stated: This Council supports the Right to Work: Right to Welfare groups Peoples Proposal aimed at introducing a simple but vital checklist for social security decision makers.‘This Council supports the aim and will write to the Permanent Secretary of the Department of Communities for the issuance of guidance to all Decision Makers, requiring them to ensure that both due process and impact assessments are undertaken and fully compiled with in the decision making process.Speaking in support of the motion, Councillor Hardy said: For me this is about protecting the most vulnerable in our society.“It is about building protections for the many citizens in the Mid and East Antrim Council district who are in the receipt of benefits. The Right to Welfare Group are calling for a risk assessment to be carried out by social security decision makers and have developed the Peoples Proposal which is a human rights checklist. “The checklist includes the right to due process, including the right to information and representation, presumption of innocence and transparent decision making prior to the appeal stage.”Councillor Hardy spoke passionate about the Peoples Proposal and about the recent benefit changes.She said it is needed because: On average over  financial sanction are issued against unemployed people every month, while  decisions are made on a monthly basis to stop sickness benefits.People are being financially sanctioned first and then appealed afterwards while suffering forced poverty.She gave figures, saying that: , people were forced to use food banks last year, including , children. This isnt good enough.Speaking about children, she said levels of child poverty have continued to increase here.Over a quarter of all children are living in poverty. This is not just a statistic, this is a sad reality. Many children are arriving to school hungry. Every child should have the right to food and every child should be free from poverty. Seconding the motion, fellow Sinn Fein Councillor James McKeown, said: This highlights the disaster that is austerity and changes in the welfare system have brought upon people in our society. He also added: We need a fairer and more professional approach to benefits.UUP Councillor Stephen Nicholl, said: The substance of the motion is absolutely correct. The impact of the changes in welfare delivery are causing a signicant impact in society, especially on those who are the poorest in society.He added: The increasing use of food banks in areas where universal credit has been ruled out, the use of food banks have increased by %.I have seen some horrendous decisions going through. So I think anything that introduces greater clarity and greater consideration of the actualconditions is to be welcomed to try and make this a fairer system.DUP Councillor Billy Ashe said this affected everyone. He commented: We would support this motion. The benefit system is not working for the most vulnerable.He added that the community planning directorate compile a report on this subject that Council can use to influence decision making at a higher level in the future.Council unanimously voted in support of the motion.

But previously she was in charge of maintenance at the Severn Bridge and the Second Severn Crossingand before that looked after bridges and highways across Wiltshire and Avon.She is the first woman to take on the role of bridgemaster at Clton, but says she isn’t tempted to change her title to bridgemistress.An aerial view of the Clton Suspension Bridge, which spans the Avon Gorge and the River Avon.“It is a historic title so it would be unfair to try to change it. I’m happy with bridgemaster, so I wouldn’t want to try to change the course of history!”Trish manages a team of  people including bridge attendants, visitor centre staff, maintenance workers and administration staff, as well as dozens of volunteers who help out with ious projects.“I really enjoy it. It’s fantastic,” she said. “It is a real honour to be looking after such a historic asset. I’ve been in Bristol  or  years now – a long time since I left Northern Ireland – and the bridge has always been a part of my tours when family have been over, so it’s amazing that I’m actually looking after it now. and Santa getting ready for the Twilight Market in Portadown.\"   and Santa getting ready for the Twilight Market in Portadown.\"  Christmas switch-on and twilight market tonight Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"“It is a big responsibility. The bridge itself is over  years old. It is one of the icons of Bristol. We get half a million visitors here every year, so it is my responsibility to make sure the bridge is well maintained, safe to use and that it is there for a long time to come.“It is a historic Grade  listed structure and there are not many historic Grade  listed structures that are still used as a transport asset. We still have four million vehicles cross the bridge every year, so it is a working asset as well as a historical and visitor attraction, so there is a lot to the job and it definitely keeps me busy.”The married mum-of-two admits to being slightly obsessed with bridges, and once even booked a weekend trip to Copenhagen just so she could visit the Öresund Bridge which runs between Denmark and Sweden.Her husband Rob, who works in finance, may not share her passion for bridges, but it seems he’s seen more than his fair share over the years.“When we go on holidays he ends up getting trailed round every bridge,” Trish smiled. “He’s getting used to the bridges by now!”Neither of Trish’s children share her love of engineering either. Her daughter Fiona, , works in marketing, while son Thomas, , is studying economics at university.She says she tried to get them into engineering, without success. But she’s adamant that more needs to be done in the UK in general to encourage young people, particularly girls, to get into science, technology, engineering and mathssubjects.“I think the UK has got the lowest percentage of female engineers in Europe and that’s a sad situation. We’ve probably got about % or less female engineers across the UK, so it is really important that we increase the number of women in engineering. “We need to increase the number of people with engineering skills full stop, but we need to tap in to that whole area of getting girls engaged and interested in engineering,” she continued.“Maths was my big thing. I am one of these geeks really. The problem solving side of things is what I really liked, and still do really, and engineering is perfect for that. There is always a problem you’ve got to sort out, and that’s what gets me out of bed in the morning.“I have done it for  years and I have had a whale of a time and really enjoyed it. It’s not just about getting your hands dirty and the mud and concrete and that side of things, there is so much more to it than that and that’s what we have to try to get across to the youngsters of today.”Trish, whose father Tommy Fee is well known in the Banbridge area for having run\u2028 fitness classes at the local college for more than four decades, has made her le in Bristol and says she has no plans at present tohome to Northern Ireland.“I get drawn back every now and then. I go back to see family and friends. But my husband and kids are here so I don’t think I’ll be moving home just yet, but who knows what we’ll do when we retire.”THE FACTS• The Clton Suspension Bridge opened in . It is a private bridge run by a trust.• The  feet long, ,-tonne structure spans the Avon Gorge and River Avon between Clton in Bristol and Leigh Woods in North Somerset.• The deck of the Grade  listed structure sits  feet above the river.• Its designer, Isambard Kingdom Brunel, was just  when he was appointed project engineer. • Brunel died in  – five years before the bridge he described as “my first love” officially opened.• Today the bridge serves as a crossing for more than four million vehicles every year.• Vehicle drivers have to pay a £ toll to cross the bridge, and the money goes towards the upkeep of the historic structure.• Trish Johnson, the first female bridgemaster, took over the role in October ."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8537099.1529312918!/image/image.jpg","title":"new park ride facility at fane valley welcomed","story":"Local Alderman Junior McCrum has welcomed the new park and ride facility being built adjacent to Fane Valley in Banbridge.

After an introduction to the abattoir, the group was given a comprehensive tour of the kill floor and lairage.In the chill area, the group members had the opportunity to see dferent grades of lambs coming through the plant that day. Gary outlined what the ideal lamb is for Linden Foods to allow them to process for their customers’ needs, with discussion on how farmers can market lambs that meet this specication. The group was joined by William Chesneywho explained the grading system and what the grader is looking for when assessing each carcase as the lambs were weighed and graded at the scale, prior to entering the chill.William and Gary both reinforced the importance of weighing and handling lambs regularly to assess their market readiness. In particular, they emphasised the importance of not allowing lambs to becoming overfat. This not only restricts the potential market outlets, but is uneconomical for the farmer.The farmers were guided through the slaughter area where each stage of the slaughter process was explained. The visit finished with a walk through live lamb reception area where Gary was able to demonstrate the type of live lambs that produce the carcases Linden require for their customers. There was good discussion on the use of electronic identicationand especially feedback to the members on inidual lambs. Members stressed that, where they had invested in electronic readers and on farm software packages using EID to become more efficient, they were not receiving enough feedback information from the abattoir. Gary agreed that more information on inidual animals would be of benefit to the farmers. Linden Foods have invested in the hardware and software to allow inidual animal feedback to farmers linked to tag numbers and are keen to develop put this service in place for suppliers.The group members were impressed by the skill or the operators on the slaughter and processing lines and the efficiency of the overall processing system. The high level of animal welfare standards demonstrated was impressive in such a busy but efficient working environment.

Playing over  characters between them, Jo and Marty are still being stopped by fans eager to catch another viewing of the production such was its success during a run at the Roddy’s in August.“We wanted to bring the play back as we have such a successful relationship with the Balmoral Hotel, especially in the run-up to Christmas,” explained Brassneck Director Tony Devlin. “This will be the fourth production we have brought to the hotel. There has been huge demand for aof the show, as a lot of people didn’t get a chance to catch it first time around. We thought it was the next natural step to bring it to the Balmoral.”Jo spoke of how from the first night the play was staged “we soon realised very quickly that this was something special.”“The audience response was incredible after opening night,” she said. “People are still stopping us saying ‘When are you coming back, when are you coming back ’”“I think it’s a perfect way to finish the year especially after all the celebrations for Féile,” explained Marty. “One of the loveliest things was the audience reaction we got when we travelled to Coalisland.

Only Northern Ireland will legally be defined as part of the customs territory of the European Union. The North Antrim MLA believes this is of immense constitutional signicance, in that it transfers a part of the UK into the customs territory of another in circumstances where it cannot escape without the consent of that other, namely the EU.He said: \"Moreover, and in consequence, the EU Customs Codewill apply to Northern Ireland, but not to Great Britain. So, EU customs legislation - over which we would have no say - would apply only to Northern Ireland. EU tarfs and laws would be our lot, along with exclusion from any UK trade deals with other countries.\"In his letter to Attorney General Geoffrey Cox, Mr Allister wrote: \"It seems to me that this, when read with its supplementary references, means that this leaves Northern Ireland, uniquely as a part of the UK, part of the customs territory of the EU. \"Whereas, all of the UK, until otherwise agreed, will be part of a single customs territory, only Northern Ireland will legally be defined as part of the customs territory of the EU.

Theyre wrong about the draft agreement,\" she said. \"Its not perfect, but it is certainly a baseline to protect our economic interests and agreements.\"Its now very clear right across Ireland, north and south, that the key voices from business, agriculture and other sectors are coming out and facing down the very negative politics advanced by the DUP and Tory Brexiteers.\"Issuing a direct message to Mrs Foster, Ms McDonald said: \"Anyone who wishes to protect Ireland, north and south, needs to get off their Brexiteer high horse, face reality and understand that the current agreement is what Brexit looks like. If I were Arlene Foster I would wake up and smell the coffee, reassess my position and insist that the internal party wranglings within the DUP and Tory party cannot be allowed to drive any part of Ireland over the clf.\"Ms McDonald continued: \"Brexit isnt a passing phenomenon - this is for keeps - and we are still in very dangerous and choppy waters. \"All of us, irrespective of our party political persuasion, have to behave like adults. This is grown-up politics and its about protecting peoples livelihoods and jobs and the entire island of Ireland. \"So rather than adopting the reckless strategy that they have, the DUP now needs to listen to wider society and come on board with the rest of us who are absolutely determined to protect Ireland and Irish people, north and south. \"Now is the time for cool heads to ensure that the bottom lines around no hard border, the protection of the Good Friday Agreement and crucially the protection of citizens rights are met. \"This is vital to protect everybody who lives and works on the island of Ireland,\" she added."},{"url":null,"title":"64 of northern ireland people obese or overweight and women are lonelier","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It is our business to understand custom arrangements, the global SPS food safety regime and the world of compliance and regulation. Armed with all this knowledge and experience, we are well positioned to assess the merits of this deal.In this context, NIFDA has welcomed the draft withdrawal agreement and sees it as a signicant step forward. Like many other Northern Ireland business bodies, it is our considered opinion that it now provides a way to deliver a smooth exit and an orderly transition to the future relationship with Europe, bringing a degree of clarity which has been lacking for so long. Critically, it ensures we avoid a no-deal Brexit, which would have been disastrous for Northern Ireland, particularly for the agri-food sector, on which our economy is so reliant.We simply could not absorb increased customs, tarfs and regulatory costs on trade between Northern Ireland and the EU which would inevitably occur in a no-deal scenario.While we of course know too well the concerns raised by our members in this regard, we have also noted analysis by the Government itself which was recently reported by the BBC. This analysis estimated that in a no-deal scenario, the agri-food sector in Northern Ireland would take the brunt of the damage, with NI goods exports falling by up to £.bn annually compared to the proposed backstop scenario. Anything close to that magnitude would clearly have major implications for business and jobs here.While we accept that this agreement may not be perfect, and further clarication on certain aspects will be required, we are firm in our belief that it is vastly preferable to a no-deal scenario. It offers us an effective insurance policy in the interim period until any new trading relationship is agreed. A UK-wide solution that avoids a hard border and allows Northern Irish firms frictionless access to markets in Britain, Republic of Ireland and the European Union could be immensely beneficial to the local economy. Importantly, it offers our members and the wider Northern Ireland economy the best chance of surviving and thriving in a post-Brexit world, which surely should be everyones aspiration.We would therefore urge all our political leaders to join with the local business community to support this deal and work together to ensure that the interests of our economy and society take priority over party politics. They should view the deal as a potential opportunity for Northern Ireland to trade freely within the UK and with all its future trading partners, as well as the EU and all its future trading partners - thereby delivering the best of both worlds. This could give Northern Ireland an unprecedented competitive advantage over other parts of the UK or EU, which could help transform our economy.If there are any concerns about constitutional issues associated with this deal, surely economic prosperity and stability of this nature offers the best opportunity for continued peace and protection of the status quo.Brian Irwin is chairman of the Northern Ireland Food and Drink Association"},{"url":null,"title":"diane dodds my party cant support deal that handcuffs us to europe","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We are not a party of no deal. However, the deal before us would irreparably damage the economic and constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom. This is a seminal moment for our nation. We respect everyones right to examine the Prime Ministers draft deal, to interpret it as they see fit and to challenge our views where they feel it is appropriate. However, our position on the proposed deal is in line with what we have said both in private and in public for many weeks. This should come as no surprise to local representatives of business including agri-food.The draft agreement would establish signicant dferences between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom. In legal terms, Annex  to the Protocol would mean Northern Ireland remaining in EU single market rules for goods, including food standards, while Great Britain is not. Economically it would mean vastly increased checks on food and agriculture products entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain. Practically this creates new barriers for businesses, including supermarkets seeking to fill shelves across our province. Others can choose to frame it dferently but in our eyes such a solution cannot be described as anything other than a border in the Irish Sea. While this paints a picture of immediate disruption - even when UK and EU rules are aligned - the greater unknown of this plan is how that disruption could evolve and growand when the rules between sides erge. Although this deal may give certainty to trade on day one, that certainty is far from guaranteed for months and years down the line. There is no legal guarantee on preventing ergence within the UK internal market during the operation of the backstop. Commitments to best endeavours are not enough.Keeping Northern Ireland in the EUs state aid framework also raises the potential for dferences in support and incentives provided to businesses in dferent parts of the UK. Hospitality Ulster have highlighted fears that the plans could halt Northern Irelands campaign for cutting tourism VAT and abolishing air passenger duty. It is also clear that a new Joint Committee would have the power to restrict the maximum level of future support provided to farmers in Northern Ireland. The deal on the table fails to deliver the referendum result in every part of the UK. It leaves our province subject to the rulings of the European Court of Justice. It creates a democratic deficit whereby Northern Ireland would become subservient to EU legislation with zero representation. In real terms, Dublin legislators would have influence over the rules governing us while elected representatives in Belfast or London would have none. This violates the principle of consent. It also extends the role of the devolved institutions and North-South bodies and grants a Joint Committee signicant input into local affairs. This collectively amounts to a breach the Belfast Agreement. The wording of the draft withdrawal agreement also ensures that Dublin and Brussels hold an active veto on whether the backstop ceases to apply in Northern Ireland in the future. Both options - the review mechanism or extension to the transition period - fail to allow the UK to unilaterally move away from the arrangements should it wish to do so. This could leave us in an indefinite limbo and make it harder to leave the backstop than to leave the EU itself. The ability to supersede the backstop in whole or in part also expresses a danger that Great Britain may be able to leave the backstop but Northern Ireland may have to remain. We would be handcuffed to the EU with Brussels holding the keys. Thats not taking back control.We are not alone in our resolve to oppose the risks this deal presents to the Union. Departing Cabinet members hold to our view that this agreement would break up the United Kingdom. Labour has described it as a de facto border in the Irish Sea. The parliamentary debate in the coming days should not be framed as a binary choice between a bad deal or a no-deal. We believe there is widespread cross-bench support for a deal with the EU - but not this deal. We will not, as some have suggested, step back from our commitments to defend the security of the Union and protect the long-term economic interests of Northern Ireland. Ultimately neither can be guaranteed by this deal and for that reason the DUP cannot in good conscience support it.

When asked how long they expect recruitment and training to take in order to speed up the security process, both the airport and the private contractor responsible did not respond. The airport said it was working to resolve the issue \"as quickly as possible\" but recruitment, training and security clearance of staff took time to implement.Once again. Avoid Belfast International Airport at all costs. Queues of over an hour just to get through security. Worst managed airport I have ever been through in my le. An utter shambles! @belfastairport @Ryanair @BBCTalkback @UTVNews @TourismNIreland pic WHJxquIS— Michael MckeeNovember , Reports of long queues have dogged the airport for months. A new company took over at the beginning of the month and the airport had said this would help to resolve the problem. That company, Wilson James, said it had inherited a staff shortage which continued to cause problems. It has begun a recruitment campaign and upped pay levels saying it was confident the measures would deliver a \"higher calibre of service and provide passengers a more seamless journey through the airport\".Over the past couple of days social media users branded the security process \"a joke\" and a \"shambles\". Some said it was the best advertisement the City Airport or Dublin Airport could have while others said they had missed flights because of the delays they faced.In a statement Belfast International Airport said: \"We understand our passengers frustration with security queuing times at Belfast International Airport and we apologise for the inconvenience this has caused.  \"We have experienced signicant issues with security staffing levels over the past six months which have impacted upon the operation.  Our new security provider, Wilson James, took over this contact on November  and have an ongoing recruitment drive with  vacancies currently available at enhanced rates of pay.\"We are working hard behind the scenes to try to resolve these issues as quickly as possible but the recruitment, training and security clearance of staff will take time to implement.  We would ask all our passengers to arrive two hours before their flight and fully prepared for the security search process as this will speed up processing times for everyone.”Security provider Wilson James said it had inherited a staffing shortage from the previous provider which continued to impact the service delivery. \"However, we are pleased to confirm that the recruitment process for  employees is already underway and candidates are moving through a rigorous security vetting process to ensure that aviation security standards are maintained,\" a statement added.\"To complement our recruitment strategy, we are also pleased to confirm that last week we agreed an improved pay deal which will raise pay rates across the whole of the security contract. We are confident that this priority on our employees will deliver a higher calibre of service and provide passengers a more seamless journey through the airport. \"We recognise that this is the beginning of our new partnership with Belfast International Airport and look forward to working with them to improve the passenger experience.\""},{"url":null,"title":"watch northern irelands first sea bin mops up waste in bangor harbour","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The truth is that SNP plans just make a no deal Brexit more likely.”Ms Sturgeon also admitted she has not yet found common ground with Labour over an alternative Brexit deal after meeting UK party leader Jeremy Corbyn.The First Minister held talks with Mr Corbyn in Westminster to try to coalesce around another way forward but said “we’re not there yet”.The SNP leader said she had met all opposition leaders and they were united in planning to vote down Mrs May’s deal, but claimed the next step was to agree on an alternative, citing a People’s Vote, single market membership and a customs union as options.She said: “What we talked about was our unity of purpose in thinking the prime minister’s deal is a bad deal and voting that down, unity of purpose in not allowing this to be presented as a bad deal or no deal.“No deal is not an option and there’s no majority for no deal.“What I wouldn’t say is we got to the stage today where there’s an agreement that can be coalesced around one of those but, to be frank, that’s the responsibility of the opposition.”Jeremy Corbyn cannot continue to court both sides of this debate – it is time to decideSir Vince CableFacebookTwitterMs Sturgeon did not hold back from criticising Mr Corbyn over a lack of leadership and expressed frustration Labour had stopped short of prioritising a second vote that could stop Brexit.However, she also said she could get behind Labour’s position on a pushing for a vote of no confidence and a general election instead of “wringing my hands”.She said: “I don’t think his position on Brexit has shown a lot of leadership even until very recent days but we’ve got to look ahead now.“I’m not saying I can sit here and tell you I can guarantee I can get to a position where me and Jeremy Corbyn are on the same page, but I feel a responsibility to have a go at that.“I would relish a general election – this is the most incompetent shambolic government in my letime, so I would relish that.”Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable said opposition parties must now “step up momentum” for a People’s Vote, labelling Labour “missing in action”.“They claim to want a general election before a People’s Vote, but are making no moves to get one,” he said.“Jeremy Corbyn cannot continue to court both sides of this debate – it is time to decide.”Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said it was only Labour that seemed intent on not pursuing a reversal of Brexit.He said: “The Labour leadership must now come to its senses and work with Plaid Cymru and the SNP to find a way out of this Brexit madness.”A Labour Party spokesman said the meeting between Ms Sturgeon and Mr Corbyn was “constructive”.He said: “They discussed their common opposition to Theresa May’s botched Brexit deal and determination to work across Parliament to prevent a disastrous no deal outcome.”"},{"url":null,"title":"its now or never to remove may jacob reesmogg tells tories","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Rees-MoggFacebookTwitter“I think it is now or the Prime Minister will lead the Conservatives into the next election,” he told reporters at a Westminster news conference.“You find MPs privately who will say to you they think that is a really good idea in any number and I would be quite surprised.”His warning came as Downing Street confirmed Mrs May will meet European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker for talks in Brussels on Wednesday ahead of a special EU Brexit summit on Sunday.In a move likely to be welcomed by Brexiters, Number  also confirmed that the Government would look at potential technological solutions to keep the Irish border open.Mrs May’s official spokesman confirmed that references in last week’s draft agreement to “alternative arrangements” for the border could involve technical measures of the kind previously promoted as the “maximum facilitation” solution, or Max Fac.Last week, senior ERG figures were confidently predicting they would get the  letters of no confidence from MPs needed to trigger a vote in Mrs May’s leadership.But with Brexiteers apparently ided over whether it was the right time to mount a challenge, the prospect of them achieving their target appeared to be dwindling.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  However, Mr Rees-Mogg warned that they needed to consider whether they really wanted to carry on with her at the helm.While party rules would permit a fresh challenge in a year’s timethere was a failed attempt now, he said that in practice it was doubtful that would happen.“Basically,there is a vote of confidence it is not just for a year,” he said.“Getting the  letters has shown to be quite dficult, so the idea that in a year you just repeat the process and then she would go at that point, I don’t think that is realistic.”Askedhis attempt to unseat the Prime Minister had been exposed as a “Dad’s Army” operation, Mr Rees-Mogg replied: “I’ve always admired Captain Mainwaring.”\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Theresa May will meet European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker in Brussels on Wednesday Senior ministers sought to rally round Mrs May, with Justice Secretary David Gauke warning that any move to oust her would be “dangerous for the country”.He told BBC Breakfast: “The idea that at this point, in the middle of a very delicate negotiation, that is hugely important to the future of this country, that we should remove the Prime Minister, essentially leave us leaderless, for certainly several weeks, possibly months, would be hugely irresponsible.“I don’t think people should be talking about removing her at this point. I think that would be self-indulgent and dangerous for the country.”The latest threat to Mrs May followed a shot across the bows from the Democratic Unionist Party, who prop up her minority Government in the Commons.On Monday night, the party joined Labour in voting against the Government on a Budget measure while abstaining in two other isions in apparent breach of their “confidence and supply” agreement.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  The party’s deputy leader Nigel Dodds made clear the DUP was ready to continue voting against the Government and called on Mrs May to ditch her proposals and “work for a better deal”.Mr Dodds said that the agreement with Conservatives committed the DUP to pursue the shared objectives of strengthening the Union and seeking a Brexit that benefits all parts of the UK.While the DUP had “kept to our word” on the agreement, the resignation of several Conservative ministers showed that Mrs May’s deal “does not represent those shared objectives”, he said.He added: “The Government will require DUP support to deliver its domestic agenda. We will continue to use our influence for the good of everyone across the United Kingdom.“If the Government can look beyond a Withdrawal Agreement, which is uniting people from across the political spectrum against it, and instead work towards a better deal, then an outcome can be delivered that truly works to benefit all parts of the United Kingdom.”Both Brexiteer Boris Johnson and Chancellor Philip Hammond are due to attend the DUP’s conference at the weekend, according to Co Fermanagh newspaper the Impartial Reporter.In another cause for concern for the PM, Mrs May’s Spanish counterpart Pedro Sanchez said Madrid will vote against the withdrawal deal at the summit on SundayGibraltar’s future is not considered a bilateral issue between the UK and Spain.In a bid to sway opinion, Mrs May has insisted that her draft Brexit deal puts Northern Ireland in a “fantastic position” for the future.In an opinion piece published in the Belfast , the Prime Minister claimed the region’s constitutional status within the UK had been guaranteed in the agreement.Mrs May acknowledged that there had been a lot of focus on the Irish border “backstop” and said she “understood and share some of the concerns that have been expressed”.But she said the backstop was an “acceptable insurance policy” due to provisions in the deal."},{"url":null,"title":"mps kickoff in the house of commons chamber as they unite over football","story":" Hi

But then hopefully they’ll come back to it when they are adults.“To sit down in  years and watch it with their kids to show them what they were like as children, that would be pretty special I think.”Other budding film-makers can see behind the scenes and find out how Bryan made the film at www.robotattackmovie."},{"url":null,"title":"two orca whales spotted by a fisherman off the coast of dublin","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The two local authorities are planning to construct a greenway and cycle path to facilitate cyclists and walkers. From the route corridors published in May  and following an appraisal exercise, the chosen route is a mixture of the ‘red’ and ‘green’ route corridor options. The main route is as follows:.Quay Trail from existing greenway behind Sainsbury’s supermarket, Derry to the entrance of Foyle Hospice on the A .Entrance of Foyle Hospice along A on left-hand side towards Thornhill College .Thornhill College to Culmore village, turning right on to Culmore Point Road continuing adjacent to the River Foyle.Coney Roadpast Culmore Country Park, turning right on to Canning’s Lane in Muff .Turning right on to Kilderry Lane and continuing to the R.Connection on R back towards the Community Hall and also in the direction of the Muff Community Parkgoogletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshIn Muff, the route will also include an additional link to the village centre from further up Canning’s Lane on to Kilderry Lane, coming out at Main Street opposite Borderland.The North West Greenway Network programme manager, Jonathan Henderson said: “Almost  people attended the consultation events which were held in May and we received over  written submissions. A key outcome from the consultation process is that people are on the whole supportive of the project concept and are keen to see both local authorities construct infrastructure which encourages cycling and walking between the two locations. The rationale for the chosen route has been explained in the Stage  Preferred Route Corridor Selection Report which will be available at both events as well as online from  November.”Ronan Gallagher, Communications Manager for the project, added: “One of our key objectives is to build infrastructure that will encourage people to cycle and walk to and from their destination in Derry or Muff, but particularly between the two locations. Once completed, not only will we link Muff to Derry, but students at Thornhill College and several primary schools will be able to cycle and walk to school in a safe, segregated environment.”At both events the general public will have an opportunity to leave comments on the proposals. For those who are unable to attend, plans and a comments card will be available at www.nwgreenway. After these events, both local authorities will proceed to lodge formal planning permissions in both jurisdictions and will engage with landowners along the route to agree accommodation works.

been given to Carryduff girl Cara Mailey.The nine-year-old has a form of dwarfism which means that living in a standard-sized world can present challenges for her.Born with achonlasia, Cara dared to dream big and applied last year to have a special den created for her by the team from the popular CBBC programme The Dengineers.The plucky and determined child is now the proud owner of a colourful sweet-themed garden den that is ideally sized to suit her height mdash and her sweet tooth.Despite the production team swamping the Mailey family home in June to carry out the work, the show was only broadcast on Sunday morning.Cara found herself a star attraction at St Josephrsquos Primary School, in Carryduff on Monday.ldquoA lot of people have been telling me I saw you in the newspaper, I saw you on TV, giggled Cara.She has made great use of her den since then.ldquoI play in it most of the time, I sometimes do my homework there and bring in my friends to play or go in just get some sweets and bring them into the house, she told the Recorder.ldquoHaving the den makes me feel a lot happier and safer as usually I would be climbing up stuff to reach things but now I can pick them up and donrsquot have to climb up to get them.Cararsquos infectious personality shone through in the programme as did her determinism to try out everything despite her stature.Her love of sweets are shown in the denrsquos decor which has Gummy Bear windows, a roof made of strawberry laces, a Coca-Cola-shaped door, a lolly-pop-themed dance floor so Cara can show off her moves and several sweet dispensers that are positioned at reaching height for her.One of the highlights is a height-adjustable desk that Cara can change to suit as she gets older.Cara lives with her mum Trish, a P teacher at Cedar Tree Integrated School in Crossgar, dad Sean and two year-old brother Noah.She shares the same condition with her mum and Noah.Mrs Mailey is delighted that Cara has this special space to play in.ldquoI had never had anything like it when I was younger, she said. For Cara all of the toys or bikes for her age group are all too big or tall for her, so this is brilliant.Mrs Mailey said Cara came up with the idea of having a sweet-themed den after attending a birthday party at Aunt Sandrarsquos Candy Factory in Belfast last year.ldquoCara decided herself that she wanted to apply for the Dengineers and I honestly didnrsquot think she had any chance of getting it as there were over , applications from throughout the UK, said Trish.ldquoCara did a phone interview with the producers, then a Skype interview, then they came over to spend a day with her and it was all hush hush until we got the call to say she had got it.Her parents had to keep the news a secret until presenters Lauren Layfield and Joe Traconi surprised her with the news in May after she won bronze in the m sprint at the National Dwarf Games in Birmingham.Trish added: ldquoA team of four came over in June on a Monday as the den was created by designer Mara Tulip and the big reveal day on the Friday. They were the nicest team and Cara was their number one priority throughout it all.ldquoAppearing in this programme has given Cara a lot of confidence.

It is also impacting on residents being able to park outside their homes, particularly in the Irish Street, Fountain Street and Saul Street areas.Cllr Sharvin believes the combined voices of the business community and residents can see the charges reduced to their previous level to ldquosupport the economical sustainability of Downpatrick town centre.He is also encouraging people to complete the online survey or pick up a paper copy from the council offices at the Downshire Civic Centre.Cllr Sharvin confirmed he has also asked council officials to survey the condition of its three car parks in Downpatrick, suggesting the surface in Irish Street is ldquoparticularly poor.Downpatrick councillor, Dermot Curran, has also expressed concern about the impact of the increased charges and believes the increasing concern is exactly the kind of issue a tradersrsquo group in the town should be addressing.He added: ldquoThe town needs a thriving business organisation to help with its continued economic regeneration and to discuss issues like increased parking charges. Such a body would provide the business community with a much-needed voice on a range of important issues.The series of roadshows to discuss parking charges moved to The Lodge in Castlewellan and the Newcastle Centre last night and takes place next Tuesday, November , at Ballynahinchrsquos Market House between .pm and .pm, before later moving to The Hub in Saintfield between pm and pm..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Symbolic lantern walk rekindles time WWI ended  ","story":"A SPECIALLY designed beacon was lit in Killyleagh on Sunday night to mark the th anniversary of the end of the First World War.Local man Martin lsquoTinarsquo Charters, , one of Northern Irelandrsquos last survivors from the Second World War, lit the gas beacon of light at the front of Killyleagh Castle to mark the moment the guns finally fell silent.Mr Charters was accompanied by two local schoolchildren, Zac Gordon, from St Maryrsquos Primary School, Killyleagh, and Louise Craig, of Killyleagh Integrated Primary School.The cross-community event was attended by more than  people at the end of Remembrance Sunday.The eveningrsquos events began with a lantern walk from Shrigley to Killyleagh.

It has also argued that the current application represents the ldquobest value for money.ldquoThe RNLI applies the highest standards and practices to all its applications for its facilities. The site chosen, from what was available, is the one that represents the best location and value for money for the Institution.That assertion is one that has been challenged by the LEYC who has said in its letter to members: ldquoWe also believe that the cost of the new site will be considerably more expensive overall with higher ongoing maintenance and cost and therefore a waste of donations.The LEYC also claim that the RNLI have changed their mind over the site of its proposed new station: ldquoWhen we originally discussed the proposed site with the RNLI they told us that they preferred to build as part of a bigger development as originally it was submitted as part of a bigger development plan. They later changed this to saying that the newer site would give them more visibility and potential footfall despite it being obvious that the original site was much more public facing.The LEYC also asserts that the original site it refers to would not require as much dredging as what is being proposed by the RNLI. In its letter however the LEYC stated that ldquowe are supporters of the RNLI and any objection we have is only to the proposed siting of the boathouse and should not be interpreted as any fallout with the local volunteers who we respect and support.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Our new security provider, Wilson James, took over this contact on  November and have an ongoing recruitment drive with  vacancies currently available at enhanced rates of pay. “We are working hard behind the scenes to try to resolve these issues as quickly as possible but the recruitment, training and security clearance of staff will take time to implement. “We would ask all our passengers to arrive two hours before their flight and fully prepared for the security search process as this will speed up processing times for everyone.”A spokesperson for Wilson James said: “Wilson James took over the security contract at Belfast International Airport on  November .“Wilson James inherited a staffing shortage from the previous provider which has continued to impact the service delivery. However, we are pleased to confirm that the recruitment process for  employees is already under way and candidates are moving through a rigorous security vetting process to ensure that aviation security standards are maintained.“To complement our recruitment strategy, we are also pleased to confirm that last week we agreed an improved pay deal which will raise pay rates across the whole the security contract. “We are confident that this priority on our employees will deliver a higher calibre of service and provide passengers a more seamless journey through the airport.

ICTS said it had provided an “excellent service” and claimed the inadequate service provided to customers over the summer months was beyond its control.Meanwhile, George Best Belfast City Airport, which has officially opened upgraded terminal facilities following a £ million infrastructure investment, says its new security search area has reduced average queuing times to just six minutes.• See Morning View in tomorrow’s News Lettertry catch     .               ..

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community.

Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day.

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

An initial pre-application notice was issued for the scheme last year, but now the developer behind the scheme – Neptune Carleton – has submitted an outline planning application for the ambitious project. If the plans, which could include , homes on the large site at Blaris, get the go-ahead, it would be one of the largest residential property developments to be built in Northern Ireland in recent years.

Since Wednesday evening, several cabinet members have resigned, opposed to what they see is a softening of Theresa May’s position on leaving the EU. Essentially, for Northern Ireland’s business community in particular, it would remain part of the same customs territory as the rest of the UK and the entire area would be subject to \"level playing field\" commitments requiring the UK to follow EU rules in areas like animal welfare, environmental and workplace protections. Northern Ireland would be in a deeper customs relationship with the EU than where in the UK, and more closely tied to EU market rules. But what do Northern Ireland business groups think   Aodhan Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium “While it will take some time to go through the  plus pages of the agreement, on the face of it this document provides some reassurance to our industry and the NI consumer. “It provides solutions to customs, tarfs, an innovative solution on VAT, support for the Peace Process and a possible longer transition period. There certainly is some work to be done by both the Westminster Government and  the EU on the checks and administration for goods coming in to Northern Ireland from GB. “That will need to be light touch and be mitigated in further agreements, hopefully to an absolute bare minimum. However this agreement must pass through Parliament. We have always said the backstop is better than no deal.”   Carolyn Fairbairn, CBI director-general “After  months of debate, this agreement by Cabinet is progress. It moves the UK one step away from the nightmare precipice of no deal and the harm it would cause to communities across the country. Securing a transition period has long been firms’ top priority and every day that passes without one means lost investment and jobs, hitting the most vulnerable hardest. “Time is now up. This deal is a compromise, including for business, but it offers that essential transitional period as a step back from the clf-edge. \"More clarity on the final relationship is needed, and uncertainty remains high, but this is an important step forward. “Transition and the backstop are not the intended permanent solutions for either side, but should pave the way for more work on the future deal. This must secure frictionless trade, ambitious access for our world-beating services, and a say over future rules. “The UK has had many months of discussion and ision. A long journey still lies ahead but now is the time for decisions. And the first decision is to avoid no deal.”  Retail NI chief executive, Glyn Roberts and Hospitality Ulster, Colin Neill  “This is a complex and detailed document which needs considerable analysis and further clarication from the UK Government. “We will be consulting our respective memberships on this document and we will set out in greater detail our views when we have completed this process. “Both our organisations have always sought a deal that ensures no delays in the supply chain, which promotes bridges rather than borders and above all , ensures that Northern Ireland businesses have full and free access to the EU and UK single markets. “Retail and Hospitality are two of Northern Ireland’s leading sectors of industry and our voice needs to be heard as this draft deal moves toward a vote in the House of Commons”  Michael Hall, managing partner, EY Northern Ireland “Business will clearly welcome last night’s announcement in that there is now better clarity on the terms of a deal however many will also be reluctant to put contingency plans on hold until there is a stronger signal on whether this will hold politically in the UK and Europe. “The backstop guarantee is a positive development for NI firms operating on an all-island basis, not least the restatement that both sides intend to work towards a free trade agreement longer term, which should not be overlooked. “The scale of political uncertainty and the volatility which this creates can be seen in the signicant currency fluctuations we have witnessed in the past  hours. Firms should not take this lightly and as such, factor these continued unknowns into their scenario planning. “On the positive side, Northern Ireland businesses have continued to expand and employ more people in the period since the Brexit referendum, which we remain hopeful they will continue to do as we look towards a further period of uncertainty. “By focusing on business fundamentals and contingency planning, firms will arm themselves so that they are ready to act when the road ahead becomes clearer.”  FSB NI policy chairman, Tina McKenzie “Businesses have been calling for months for agreement to be reached between the UK and EU negotiators, so it can only be welcome that a text has been agreed and approved by the Cabinet. “We are acutely aware of the political machinations which are ongoing, however it must be remembered that without an agreed withdrawal agreement, the UK will crash out in March , without a transition period, nor agreement on citizens’ rights, nor any plan to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland. “While the exact nature of the backstop is being robustly debated, it must be remembered that the backstop will only take effectthe future relationship fails to deliver a frictionless border, after December . “We believe that the Withdrawal Agreement is a signicant step back from the clf edge which would result in a chaotic no deal Brexit that would be deeply damaging and dangerous for our small firms. “We would encourage all political actors to keep this in mind as we move forward.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/shore_1.jpg","title":"alternative london the place to be seen in the city","story":"Posted on Monday  November  by Ulster Business From London’s thriving bohemian hub and street art capital to a food, drink and nightle must-visit... John Mulgrew explores Shoreditch and beyond Once just the purview of the artistic and trendsetting, Shoreditch has fast become a location worthy of a trip in itself when visiting London.Nestled in the East End of the city, Shoreditch offers up a buzzing cultural environment, lots of independent places to eat and drink, and boasts one of the city’s best markets. Now, those in the north west always feel a little hard done by when it comes to connectivity outside Northern Ireland.In this case though, Flybmi now connects City of Derry Airport regularly with London Stansted. From there, it’s a regular train into Liverpool Street station, and then onwards using the tube or bus across the city.Andyou’re visiting Shoreditch, it’s hard to miss Boxpark. Sitting close to the tube station, it’s an array of black-clad shipping containers, with a host of retailers and places to eat. A bite at posh chip shop Poptata helps fuel the day.Journalists often prefer the freedom to explore a city at their own pace – picking up things along the way, without being ferried from place-to-place. But a food-focused tour from Alternative London brought out areas that might have otherwise been missed.Shoreditch is famous for the sheer volume of graffiti and art strewn around the area, but getting an insider’s view on the changes taking place in the area – including paid-for advertising now adorning some of the spaces reserved for artists from the area, or a Banksy – really helps take in as much as possible.Christiaan Nagel’s mushrooms, which can be found in several roof-top locations, led us to teashop T, taking in a salt-beef bagel at Beigel Bake on Brick Lane, followed by the modern, family-run self-styled home-style Indian restaurant, Gunpowder. The aloo chaat is a signature, with punch, depth and zing, while an almost unavoidable venison and vermicelli ‘doughnut’ is worth the visit alone.A brief half in the grade II listed Ten Bells, which has links to Jack the Ripper, was followed by a familiar trip to Old Spitalfields Market. It has a dense, tight offering of top-end food stalls, from Asian steamed buns at Yum Bun, to Portuguese custard tarts and fruit tea at Yi Fang.An unmissable food destination sits across from the market. St John Bread and Wine is one of Fergus Henderson’s London outlets. It’s a casual, laid back and sparse affair, which allows you to same some of the best British cooking available. You can stop by for a very reasonably priced, and one of the restaurant’s signature dishes, such as Welsh Rarebit, devilled kidneys on toast or, my choice on this visit, blood cake and egg. Think richer, chunkier black pudding, crispened in a pan with a rich-orange hued yolk. There are plenty of spots to socialise in and around Shoreditch, with some of London’s better beer bars included. The Craft Beer Co has a location on Old Street, while there’s a Brewdog and the Draft House, hidden in the Bower development.Arriving back to the hotel in the evening, don’t expect dull or leless environment at the Hoxton. The downstairs is thriving during the day, with the usual spectrum of aluminium-clad Apple Macs, but at night, especially at the weekend, it’s very much a nightspot in the area.Butyou’re after a decent night’s sleep, there’s very little sound making its way to the bedrooms from the ground-floor buzz.Leaving the hip surroundings of Shoreditch, and heading to the rather more touristy affair of Leicester Square, the Hotel Indigo is offers a grand view of the London skyline.The new rooftop bar is a superb vantage point to overlook the square, and pick out the city’s most famous structures. Then there’s the National Portrait Gallery – which sits just a short distance away from the Hotel Indigo.During the trip there was a Michael Jackson ‘On the Wall’ exhibition – one for Jackson fans, certainly – but the gallery itself, which is free, is worth a visit for everyone . It also hosts a ‘Friday Lates’ event – opening into the night, and with a small pop-up bar for visitors.Not far away, the Japan Centre offers up a myriad of everything the country has to offer in regards to food and drink in particular – from freshly made miso, to a ied and wide-selection of sake, it’s a stop worth making for anyone keen on trying to replicate the flavours they’ve had while visiting the country.Meanwhile, Shoryu Ramen – located very close to base camp at the Hoxton – offers some of the best casual noodles in the city. Starting off with cleanly flavoured salmon sashimi, followed by the garlic kick of the Dracula Tonkotsu – a heady allium-rich version of their -hour pork broth.For those in and around what is one of the city’s most tourist-heavy locations, Granaio is a reasonably recent addition.It’s a fairly familiar format – Italian classics and a wide-ranging menu, which will keep the majority of visitors content, at a reasonable price, considering the location. A beef tartare was solid, and a ribeye cooked correctly on the inside, despite a lack of charring on the outside.The theatre obviously plays a large part in the attraction to London, but the Immersive Gatsy experience turns a chunk of a Long Lane building into an interactive re-telling of F Scott Fitzgerald’s the Great Gatsby. It’s dferent, but impressively choreographed, and something alternative to spending a huge wad of cash on a West End show.A crisp sunny day before heading back on the train to Stansted offered a chance to try Hawksmoor. The steak restaurant now has nine locations in the UK, and focuses on dry-aged beef and all that comes with it.A Sunday lunch of rich, pink rump of beef comes with a Yorkshire pudding, stunningly crunchy roasties and a roasted bulb of garlic, and shallot – leaving them soft and packed full of umami.

These aspirations are higher than predecessors. Harder to reach than MillennialsGen Z are incredibly tech savvy and have always lived in a world of interconnectivity. Most of Gen Z are connected for more than  hours a day. No wonder they are often referred to as the ‘always on’ generation.

Here Emma Deighan scours some of the top NI venues to see how they are catering to the corporate Christmas Arguably the most anticipated social event in the work diary, the Christmas ‘do’ has evolved over the years.And many of Northern Ireland’s top hosts agree and have widened their offering in response.Event managers and venue owners say everything from the format of the Christmas party to its timing have changed to accommodate the demands of employees today. How, when and where we celebrate are top priorities.Take the evening do, for example. For many, that age-old three-course setup doesn’t cut the convenience factor, prompting my employers end the work day early to take advantage of lunch dates. It’s a favourable move that delivers on two fronts – it offers time-poor workers the relief of a shorter day but doesn’t infringe on family obligations.Owner of Bishop’s Gate Hotel in Derry and former president of the Northern Ireland Hotel’s Federation, Ciaran O’Neill agrees. “Christmas has changed over the last number of years for our industry with more businesses looking for lunches, as opposed to the traditional party nights of old,” he said. “We do still have ‘big nights’, but these tend to occur on Fridays and Saturdays.”Ciaran says he has also noted an increase in smaller party sizes over the years.“We are seeing less private large events and more small groups dining with us. Employees are arranging ‘get togethers’ with colleagues or teams that they work directly with.”Bishop’s Gate, which has become Derry’s hospitality jewel attracting the AA Hotel of the Year- accolade, among many other awards, pairs an historic setting with parties for Christmas.The Bullitt Hotel in Belfast is setting the scene for the experience-savvy hipster workforce – and this Christmas Bullitt’s ‘experiences’ reflect the discernment of its guests.General manager at Bullitt, Michael Sullivan has seen a spike in ‘experience’ events, upgrading the turkey feast to a cooler, more casual event.“We have had a number of enquiries for informal gatherings in our Good Room event space, with a festive lunch to follow. The Good Room is the perfect space to blur the lines between work and play for intimate company get togethers ahead of a more traditional Christmas do,” he said.“We’ve also had enquiries for private gin and whiskey tastings and can also organise a number of unique events and team-building activities for groups, from candle-making to chunky knitting workshops for a truly memorable Christmas party.”This December Bullitt has a range of packages to suit private and shared s – from sit-down meals in its restaurant Taylor and Clay to VIP packages in its Baltic Bar or secluded enclaves above in Babel – its rooftop bar. And its ‘Tipsy Tea’ is geared towards the day-time revellers. Prices range from £. to £. a head.“Bullitt has brought something new and exciting to the traditional Christmas party market, with a range of novel spaces set within cool, contemporary surroundings. We like to think that we’re helping to shake up the scene somewhat by offering something a little dferent,” Michael said.If you want to push the boat out with your corporate squad, Titanic Belfast is ready for boarding. Its play on Belfast’s shipbuilding heritage and the fateful Titanic is always a crowd pleaser. Laura Cowan, head of sales at Titanic Belfast said: “We host bespoke private Christmas party nights, which are tailored to our clients’ needs across all of the Titanic venues – Titanic Belfast , SS Nomadic and the Titanic Exhibition Centre. “These can range from private dining, iconic tailored experiences, drinks receptions and gala dinners.
