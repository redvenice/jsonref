They just need to be better than Everton.” Aye, it ain’t hard. You’d think Everton would be on a high from beating Arsenal but instead they currently look incredibly mediocre.Holgate gets into it with Ayew because Everton are making up for a lack of quality with plenty of needle.Down the other end ... Palace win a corner, which is sent into the box by Gallagher. The ball is cleared to Guehi about 15 yards out but his shot is deflected wide. Down the other end, Gray decides it is time Everton have a shot at goal, so does so from distance but it is straight down Guaita’s throat. Ayew sprints down the right and sends in a fine cross for Edouard to attack but he does not connect with the ball and Everton manage to clear after a little pinball in the box.Gomes is on the deck after getting a finger from Kouyate in the eye. One of those that looks innocuous but really ruddy hurt. Palace have been completely transformed under Patrick Vieira since the former Arsenal man replaced Roy Hodgson in the summer. The team have gone from the kings of tedium to become an attacking threat, but they do not have a striker suitably prolific to make the difference in the box. Christian Benteke has four goals to his name but plenty more chances missed. If Vieira can get the Belgian to re-find the composure he enjoyed at Aston Villa, it could complete this Palace side, otherwise he could be desperately asking for money to spend in January. Everton are unlikely to splash much cash in the winter window, too. Investment at Goodison Park has slowed this season - there was little spent over the summer and that has showed in their form. Demarai Gray has rightly earned praise for his efforts but there have been few others to impress this season for the Toffees. They come into this off the back of defeating Arsenal at home, which should give the team a morale boost and could make this outing a far more entertaining affair. Let’s hope for a classic!"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/06cef68e7117ee793718ca845ae0efafa2f7755b/0_234_2984_1790/master/2984.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctcmV2aWV3LTMucG5n\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=4f296612bdf2bb489a1e2c68158c4ac0","title":"f1 abu dhabi grand prix formula one max verstappen lewis hamilton title live updates","story":"I’ll leave you with Giles Richards’ race report. Next season should be alright! Ta-ra! I do wonder if this was Masi’s rationale, and if it was – a massive if – I understand it. But the integrity of the sport, words that feel as ridiculous to write about F1 as they do football, cricket, boxing, tennis and all the others – needs to come above everything. It does feel a bit like they hollered “Next goal wins!” with Hamilton 352-0 up, which works better in the playground than in elite-level sport. But I’ll be reserving judgment until we know all there is to know. So please just stop!”“Yes, finally, a bit of luck for me ... it’s insane ... I also want to say a big thank you to Checo ... he was driving his heart out as well today, it was great teamwork, and he’s an amazing teammate.“To my team, I think they know I love them ... and I hope we can do this for 10, 15 years together. There’s no reason to change, I want to stay with them for the rest of my life. I hope they love me. But yeah, it’s insane, I’m so happy.“Also Christian, but also Helmut, trusting me to be in the team in 2016. Our goal was to win this championship and now we have done that.”And Hamilton: “Firstly big congratulations to Max and his team .. I think we did an amazing job this year ... my team, everyone back at the factory, all the men and women we have here, who worked so hard all year. It’s been the most difficult of seasons and I’m so proud of them so grateful to be part of the journey with them ... “We gave it everything, this last part of the season, we gave it absolutely everything, we never gave up, and that’s the most important thing.“Of course, I’ve been feeling good, great in the car this past couple of months, particularly at the end.“If I’m honest, you know, we’re still in the pandemic and I just wish everyone to stay safe and have a good Christmas with their families ... and yeah, we’ll see about next year.”“The national anthem. You one day hope they play yours. And then when you stand here and they tell you you’re the world champion, it’s something incredible. “Especially also my dad and the special moment we had here. All the things come back through your mind - travel, all the years you spend together travelling for that goal. And we’re here, together, and everything comes together in the last lap. Insane. These people, my whole team, my friends, my best family friends, the people who I grew up with go-karting, the ones who pushed me to where I am today. They were all here, most of them were here ... it’s just insane ... I lost my voice, but I don’t know it just sounds amazing, honestly.“It’s incredible to see all this orange there, but all over the world they’ve supported me ... and I hope I can do this for a very long time of course with the support of my great fans.“I think of course I was nervous for today but on the other hand it’s just another race when you want to do well. The outcome can determine whether you’re first or second. Throughout the whole race I just tried to keep pushing. Tried to keep believing, even if it didn’t look like it, and sometimes miracles happen.“Lewis is an amazing driver, an amazing competitor, he made it really, really hard for us, of course the two teams went against each other and we had some tough times but I think that’s all part of the sport, and its emotion ... everyone wants to win and it could have gone either way today.“Of course, next year we’ll come back and try it all over again.” “Understand that a very large part of your readership is unhappy with the last call from Masi. But Toto’s complaint (and that of most of your readers) boils down to that it’s unfair Lewis has to defend his title in active racing, rather than finish behind the SC. And a lot of times this season, Mercedes  Hamilton were lucky with how calls went (Even this race itself: Lewis going off limits and gaining advantage and not getting punished the same way Max did in last week’s race). But Mercedes  Hamilton don’t have a God-given right to win the title, they have to take it to the finish line. Asking the FIA to deliver the title to Hamilton on a silver plate is a bridge too far. Red Bull did not cause the SC situation, and went all in by going to softs, so in the end won it on tactics. It’s like Masi response to Wolff when he was screaming his complaints: ‘Toto - it’s called car racing’. Hamilton should do the honorable thing and have Toto pull his protests.” Again, I see both sides, and cited what Masi said myself. However, the rules have to come before the car racing bit, i think – and whether those were correctly applied is something we don’t yet know (in my opinion). Mercedes won’t be commenting further until all this is resolved, but ultimately their problem might be one of remedy. Let’s say they can prove Masi made an error and didn’t apply the rules: are they really going to take the trophy off Verstappen? That seems extremel unlikely. My response here is also very yes but – sportsmen are different to the rest of us, and their appraisal of events differs to ours. I’m not sure it’s possible to compete at elite level, especially not if you do something dangerous, while seeing things from the perpsective of anyone but yourself. My response is very “Yes, but.”I’m not trying to fence-sit here, but I do see both sides. I feel like perhaps Masi decided the sport needed the big finish, but until we see a full explanation of what went on and why, it’s hard to completely sure. Did not finish: Latifi, Giovinazzi, Russell, Rakkonen, Mazepin.He praises Hamilton as a great driver and competitor, saying they had issues but that’s what happens, and he’s looking forward to doing it again. Essentially, he says all the things he needs to say, but it doesn’t take much imagination to consider what he really wants to say, or how he’s really feeling. “I love you!” Verstappen says. “I love you!” Verstappen replies and what on earth are we seeing. Horner tells Verstappen he needed the rub, and he got it!

Video: Enda O\u0027DowdAngeline Ruddy, deputy principal of Moville Community College: ‘It’s on our children’s lips, it’s on our staff’s lips... There’s no getting away from mica’. Photograph: Enda O’DowdAt Moville Community College, everybody is talking about mica.“There’s not an English essay that’s passed to a teacher that doesn’t have a mention of mica in it somewhere... and every time you mention humanitarian issues it’s the first thing to the forefront,” says deputy principal Angeline Ruddy.“It’s on our children’s lips, it’s on our staff’s lips,” she says. “There’s no escaping it. There’s no getting away from mica.”The presence of the mineral in construction blocks – which makes them crack and eventually crumble – has caused structural damage to an estimated 7,500 homes in counties Donegal and Mayo, as well as smaller numbers in other counties.Mica has impacted the entire community, says principal Anthony Doogan, and the school community is no different.At Moville Community College approximately 20 per cent of staff and 25 per cent of pupils – about 20 staff and 100 families – are living in “mica homes” even more have siblings and parents who are affected.“I have five siblings, and four of them are affected by mica,” says Ruddy. The one who isn’t lives in the US.“Where I live, in a half mile radius, 20 houses are affected. It’s everywhere we go.”Her children “know nothing else but a mica household” as they go about their daily routine, mica is “like an app running in the background for every one of us.“‘Is the house safe tonight?’ is a regular question my children will ask,” she says. “I have cracks that are now the width of a two-euro coin, which means my gable is starting to move away from the wall of my house. I don’t know, really, if we are safe any longer.”Others tell a similar story. Special needs assistant Barry Moore’s home is crumbling his daughter was riding her bike around the house when “a lump of plaster fell off... it was near enough to scare her, and me.”“You’re lying at home at night and you hear the walls moving. It’s scary, to think you’re living in a place that is meant to be your safe place and you’re hearing the walls cracking.”Five of the special needs assistants – nearly half of the special needs staff – have mica homes, and so do some of the students they support. A hoist used by one child is attached to a crumbling mica wall, while foster parents have bought two mobile homes to house their children with complex needs.“They need routine, they need to know what happening... they’re going to be moved into two mobile homes behind their house and watch their house getting knocked down,” says Moore.In school, he says, you can “see the children who have mica, or whose houses have mica. They are, like their parents probably are, nearly obsessed with the fact they have mica.“As staff you’re trying to accommodate and support children... but they’re going home to houses that aren’t safe and that are causing them grief and stress.”Guidance counsellor Sineád McCarron’s home also has mica she warns of “what’s coming down the line... this is just going to explode, really, in terms of the amount of support the students need.”As principal, Doogan has significant concerns about the physical and mental health of students and staff – not least through heightened levels of anxiety – and about the impact on students’ attendance and life chances the effects, he estimates, will persist for the next five to 10 years.The anxiety of students and parents “is having an impact on their work rate and their effectiveness at their studies at school,” he says.“Every secondary school in the country”, he emphasises, has seen the effects of Covid “We’re at the beginning of this cycle for mica and in two years’ time, when there’s a large number of houses in this community which need to be demolished and rebuilt, there will be severe anxiety and perhaps worse felt by a lot of our students.”There is also “clear evidence” of an increase in absenteeism due to illness – “they’re living in draughty rooms, the rooms are colder, the rooms are causing them health issues that they wouldn’t ordinarily have” as well as students from mica homes who have left school altogether.Brother and sister Shaun and Aoife Noone describe how their home is “falling down”: “If I put my hand in the wall I could just pull away some of the side of the house,” says 17-year-old Shaun.They have moved out so that their home can be demolished and rebuilt. “I don’t really have a study room so that’s affecting my study, because I’m doing my Leaving Cert now, and it’s harder to focus and settle down and get work done,” he says.“I feel disadvantaged, it’s unfair that most people would stress or be anxious about exams but I’ve got the pressure of my house on top of that, so it’s a bit hard on the mind as well.”Aaron Price (13) and his family have also moved out. “It was a lot to handle trying to go to school and do homework and trying to empty the house.”The Government this week announced a €2.2 billion scheme to rebuild mica homes in Donegal and Mayo, capped at €420,000 per home and with a sliding scale of rebuilding costs from €145 per sq ft for the first 1,000 sq ft to €110 for the next 1,000 and €100 thereafter.It has been criticised by the mica campaigners in Donegal as falling short. “Apparently a new scheme was decided but it’s stupid, apparently each square metre gets less money, that doesn’t make sense,” says Aaron.“We need 100 per cent, and I know we probably will never get that, but if it was in Dublin, this would already be fixed.“It’s not our fault, we spent a lot of money on building our house... why should we have to spend more and more money rebuilding our house?”The adults have done the figures each of those spoken to by The  is facing a shortfall of between €60,000 to €80,000. “If council houses are being built at the minute they are built on a rate of €150 a square metre,” says Moore. “What was being offered would work out essentially for our house at €127 a square metre, which would leave us paying €65,000 on top of what we would get.“My other half is a psychiatric nurse, we’re no millionaires, we’re working-class people and we live in an average size house in Donegal which is the average in the country for a one-off build, 2,500 sq ft.“If they had dropped the sliding scale part... 145 euro per square foot, that’s it, and then your rent and then your storage, I would say 90 per cent of people would have been happy and celebrating, but they put in a scale that doesn’t exist in any builder’s pricing.”“The cost to me right now is €79,000, and that’s just for the build,” says Ruddy. “My house is 2,600 sq ft... that gives a total of €315,000 of a grant. The builders have come back to me with €395,000.“I can’t borrow because I have a mica home... 100 per cent redress is so far from it, I don’t think I’m even getting 80 per cent redress.“My children are at the stage where I should be starting to save for their college. Am I going to build their house and deprive them of education? We’re facing these choices.”“People bought the material in good faith... yet they are being victimised to the extent of having to spend 40, 50, 60, €80,000, whereas other areas were given 100 per cent redress,” says Doogan.For him, it is about the value placed on people from this area, not least given that the school itself is still “nowhere near completion” 20 years after it opened. “We bailed out the banks for €64 billion, and they’re saying three or four billion is a huge amount of money, but it’s less than five per cent of what we gave to the banks.“The people up here paid their taxes to pay for the bank bailout, and people here, like me, paid their taxes to pay for the pyrite redress in Dublin and Leinster. People round here are saying, ‘is there a different law for us?’”McCarron, too, is clear: “How can we help people look after their wellbeing and instil value systems of fair justice when our own Government continues to let this happen?”“They’ve let us down,” says 15-year-old Aoife. “If this was happening in Dublin, I feel it would be a different story, because we’re that far away and we’re rural they say ‘ah, them Donegal ones, they live in big mansions, they can afford it’. We can’t. We need our houses fixed.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"from the minute the trial started until it was over it was all about him mother of nadine lott","story":"A collage of family photographs of Nadine Lott and family members. Photograph: Nick BradshawClaire Lott often finds herself arranging memories of her daughter, Nadine. Simple ones. The girl whose laugh prompted the laughter of others. The woman who would never leave home without make-up, even if only for a run, and who was devoted to her own daughter, Kya – “the love of her life”.Or the memories of the woman who, with a heart-shaped birthmark, literally wore her heart on her sleeve.In October 2019, two months before she died, Claire brought Nadine to Rome to celebrate her 30th birthday. There, as the summer waned, they sat and talked about “anything and everything”.“Nadine would tell you everything,” Claire remembers. There, she confided that she was at a point in her life where a relationship was not a primary concern for her. “She said: ‘I’m actually so happy in my life now, I don’t need anybody.’“She loved her job, her car, her apartment, she was so proud of everything she had achieved. She had been approached to do some modelling. Everything was right.” Life was filled with promise.But these memories are often overshadowed by darker thoughts from the three days when her daughter fought for her life, savagely beaten by her former partner, Daniel Murtagh, to the point where she was unrecognisable.“You try to put those away,” her mother explains.Less than two years after the attack, she sat and she listened in Court 19 of the Criminal Courts of Justice as the Chief State Pathologist, Linda Mulligan, detailed each of the 64 injuries to her daughter’s “tiny” frame.The evidence, including details of the blood spattered kitchen, was heard within “touching distance” of the man who had carried out this brutal, primal attack. “This is my daughter you are talking about. It was so cold and factual,” she says.‘The Monster’Next Friday marks the second anniversary of Nadine Lott’s death. She died three days after the grotesquely violent attack in her Arklow home at the hands of Murtagh, her former partner. Kya, then just six, witnessed it all.During the “total carnage”, Kya had screamed at and begged her father to stop and “not to kill her mummy”, but Murtagh had carried on. Kya had seen the devil at work, Claire Lott later told the court.His name is never uttered today in the Lott household. “We don’t mention him ever,” she says. “If he has to be mentioned, he is referred to as ‘The Monster’. He is never referenced by name. We don’t consider what he is doing, where he is, what he was. He is gone,” she says.In June 2012, Nadine travelled to Australia with friends on a year’s working holiday. Her mother was “heartbroken” to see her go, but would not have tried to discourage her. Her daughter did well there as a beautician.She had few boyfriends before she had the “dreadful misfortune” of meeting Murtagh in Darwin, the capital city of Australia’s vast Northern Territory. Initially, she told only her confidante and younger sister Phoebe (26) about the Clondalkin man. She told her mother later.Claire characterises their relationship as a “holiday romance”.“We wouldn’t have known anything about his background as she met him in Australia and his family is not from around here.“We are very trusting as a family and we rely on each other a lot and Nadine had a very trusting nature. She probably inherited that because we would have trusted at face value initially what we saw and that was to our detriment,” says Claire ruefully.In June 2013, Nadine returned home. She had become pregnant shortly after meeting Murtagh. The window-fitter followed her home a few months later and, when their daughter Kya was born, they moved into an apartment together.Things did not work out, however.“They lasted a very short time together. It was a holiday romance and when they got home the holiday was over and Nadine was pregnant. When he came home it dwindled very quickly,” says Claire.“They had had a baby together and she wanted to have the perfect family unit. She was doing what she could to make that work but within months it was all over.”In 2016, Nadine made a last attempt to save the relationship: “She didn’t have feelings for him, but I think she thought: ‘We have a baby together, we will try one last time.’ And she really did try,” she says.However, it ended when Murtagh failed to turn up at the house which Nadine had, with difficulty, rented for them. “She said she wasn’t upset about him and didn’t care about him. It was more a pride thing, she had been let down and everybody could see it.”Despite going separate ways, Nadine still wanted her daughter to have a relationship with her father. “Nadine wanted him to have a relationship with Kya more than he wanted to have a relationship with Kya,” Claire believes.Nadine’s biggest achievement in life was Kya and the mother she became, her mother says. Nadine’s birthing partner in November 2013 was her sister Phoebe, not Murtagh. Phoebe, not Murtagh, took the first photographs of mother and baby.During all of the time, Claire recalls that her daughter “never, ever, ever” told her that she loved Murtagh. “Even after having Kya, she never once said: ‘I love him.’ She always just said: ‘He is funny.’“He was a very insignificant part of our lives.”ControlJust under two weeks before the brutal assault, Nadine told Murtagh in a WhatsApp message not to “threaten” her and that “nothing is ever going to happen between us again, I want to make that clear.”With hindsight, Murtagh clearly had tried to control her daughter, Claire believes: “At the time we wouldn’t have looked at it as controlling. But he was trying to have everything on his terms.”He would promise to visit Kya and not show up. Money for Nadine had to be handed over personally: “He had to be in control. We always felt he wanted to see Nadine more than he wanted to see Kya. Kya was just his way of seeing Nadine.”Murtagh disliked Nadine seeing anyone else, even though they were not together: “Nadine did have to keep things from him even though they were no longer together. She would just say: ‘It’s easier, I don’t have to put up with the grief.’“Nadine was dating a Turkish guy and the next day she got a text to say: ‘So you were out on a date. I think I’ll go and get my hair done with a Turkish barber,’” Claire recalls. “He was letting her know that he knew she had been out with this guy. That was regular.”Despite her feelings, Nadine never criticised Murtagh in front of Kya. “Nadine never gave out about him if he never came to Arklow or never turned up. Nadine would make an excuse for him, she would do anything to make it easier for Kya to accept.”Murtagh had not been violent before the fatal attack, her mother insists: “Nadine was very open. Even if she would not have admitted it to me as her mother, if she was trying to protect me she definitely would have said it to Phoebe or her friends.”It never entered Claire’s mind that she would face such carnage when she went into her daughter’s apartment after a frantic phone call from a neighbour: “We literally thought Nadine would be sitting there with one stab wound. And he would have run and she would have been upset. That’s what I went up to deal with and what I was preparing for.”The Lotts will never know exactly what happened after she returned home from a family night out in a local Arklow pub. Murtagh had been babysitting Kya, having earlier attended her school recital and nativity play. Consequently, he was staying the night.At about 4am, Nadine’s friend and neighbour Amela Kulenovic found Murtagh “vicious with rage” and making a “growling noise” as he rained blows on his ex-partner as she lay on the living room floor. He was “going ape” and “like a wild animal”, Kulenovic later told gardaí.Before the attack, Nadine had changed into her pyjamas, neatly folding the dress worn on the night out. “I have so much in my head but I’ll never know what happened. I have a million opinions, a million scenarios and a million sounds,” her mother says.Murtagh fled after the attack, driving away in his Volvo. Thirty kilometres away, in Laragh, he crashed into a ditch, suffering minor injuries. A motorist stopped to help, only to be told by Murtagh that he had “killed my wife because she was with my friend”.InjuriesToday, Claire Lott believes that the “extreme and grotesque” injuries inflicted on Nadine’s face – which had separated flesh from bone – were utterly deliberate. “Without a doubt,” she says.Pointing from her neck to the top of her head, Claire goes on: “When I saw Nadine, everything was focused from here up. Everything was destroyed beyond recognition. Not only did she not look like Nadine, she didn’t look human either.“For all of that to have happened before she had even got into hospital and before the swelling had started to take place. Her head and face were destroyed. It was just a mess,” she says.Gda Supt Declan McCarthy, who headed the murder investigation, said he had never seen such violence in his 40 years of service, a view echoed by doctors. Her injuries were so catastrophic that she never regained consciousness.Claire brought some of her daughter’s belongings to put beside her hospital bed – a photo of Nadine, her wash-bag, her perfume and pictures of Kya: “I wasn’t sure what sort of damage was going to be there when she woke up.“Pictures help with memories and I thought if she had all these pictures around her, she would get comfort when she wakes up,” says Claire, who believed her daughter would recover consciousness, despite the injuries and the need for 42 pints of blood.“As a mother you hope against hope. Visually, you are seeing one thing but you just hope that the injuries are almost superficial and deep down there can be a healing and she would come out of it. I just wanted her back, it didn’t matter what form I got her back in.“I knew it would be a long recovery. I thought we were in for months of recovery before we even got to healing. I thought we were going to need plastic surgery. Those were the thoughts that were going through my head.“Even when they were taking her down for the last brain scan, I still was sitting in the chair thinking: ‘Come on Nadine, show them there is a little bit of you there. Just give them something that they can work with.’” She died on December 17th, 2019, at 3.16pm.‘His show’Today, Claire Lott\u0026nbspbelieves her daughter’s identity got lost during the trial: “From the minute the trial started until it was over, it was all about him. We referenced it as ‘his show’. He felt like he was running the show.”Her daughter’s voice, she says, was not heard until a victim-impact statement was read at the sentence hearing in October, when Murtagh received the mandatory term of life imprisonment for murder.“That’s why it was so important for us to do it as a family,” she says.Claire Lott attended every day of the three-week trial, bar the two days when Murtagh’s final video interview with gardaí was played to the jury. “I stayed at home with Kya. I didn’t want to be there to listen to him boasting about what he had done,” she says.In it, the 34-year-old boxer told of the “pounding” he inflicted, sitting forward in his chair as he did so, punching his fist into the palm of his other hand. He told, too, of how he used a tyre pump charger, with its wire wrapped around his knuckles for a solid punch.He lied throughout, she says, about his claims to gardaí that Nadine had been seeing someone else and when he claimed they were “kind of back together for the past three months, on and off”.“He never thought he would get convicted of murder, he thought he would be found guilty of manslaughter. At no point did he actually believe or did his family believe that he would be found guilty of murder.“He honestly believed that the jury would be on his side. I think he is so self-centred and egotistical that he thought people would believe what came out of his mouth,” she says, noting that he had called Nadine his “future wife” in his last interview.“She was neither his girlfriend nor his wife. They were amicable for a child and that was it. In her texts to him, she was being as nice as she could be but it didn’t mean she even liked him,” Claire insists.Nadine’s mother was repulsed by Murtagh’s demeanour in the courtroom, especially when he would blow kisses down to his mother from the dock before he went into the cells each evening.There has never been an apology from him.“One day we were leaving court and we had just seen the most graphic pictures of Nadine’s blood and drag stains all over the apartment. And his mother shouted up to him: ‘I love you.’ How can a woman sit and look at what is being done to another woman and then portray her love?”“That made it even harder for us because I, Phoebe, Tanith, Kyle, David, none of us could look up at Nadine and shout: ‘We love you. We will see you later. We will call you at seven.’ They thought this was okay to do.”Pain and griefToday, Nadine is talked about every day by the Lotts, to keep her memory alive for Kya.Hundreds of people attended a vigil for her in Arklow, her hometown: “She would never pass anyone without saying hello, she would always help someone out if needed help, she would never see anyone stuck,” Phoebe says.This month, the Lotts’ priority is to give eight-year-old Kya, who is looking forward to Santa, the best memories of Christmas possible, even though December is the month when she had to say “goodbye to her mammy”.“But the reality is that Kya will say herself that not a day goes by that she doesn’t think about that night. She says ‘Why my mummy’ and tells us how hard it is to be the only person in her class who doesn’t have a mummy,” Claire says.“We talk about Nadine like she is still here. It’s almost like she will walk in the door. Like she was here yesterday and is coming back. Then you are driving the car and you get this overwhelming pain and grief like you are actually going to go insane.“And then your brain switches off and even if you wanted to keep the crying going you can’t. You live in 2019 and in those couple of weeks before Nadine passed where everything was fine. That’s where you live.”The Nadine Lott Trust Fund has been set up in Nadine’s memory and as a secure fund for Kya’s benefit throughout her life. Contributions can be made through Bank of Ireland in Arklow, or through Pádraig J Hyland \u0026amp Co Solicitors, Arklow.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"gym chain owner loses 200 members following covid cert introduction","story":"Gym owner Dirk van der Flier: ‘It’s hard to judge the impact as this is usually a very quiet week. It varies from place to place. I thought it would be a lot worse.’Gym owner Dirk van der Flier has had approximately 200 cancellations or membership freezes following the Government decision to introduce Covid-19 certs for attending gyms.There has been a widespread opposition among gym-goers to mandatory vaccination certs which were introduced at short notice on December 7th.The Leisure, Health and Fitness Association, which represents 370 facilities, is predicting a decline of up to 40 per cent new membership next month – which is traditionally the busiest month.Mr van der Flier owns Gyms Plus which has premises in Ballsbridge, Rathfarnham and Swords in Dublin, Ashbourne in Co Meath, Cork city, Drogheda in Co Louth and Naas, Co Kildare.“We have had people who have cancelled their membership. We have had people who have gone on freeze,” he said.He said the cancellations have to be seen in the context of Gyms Plus having between 13,000 and 14,000 members across its network.However, he stressed that it is early to get a definitive picture of how it will impact gyms.“It’s hard to judge the impact as this is usually a very quiet week. It varies from place to place. I thought it would be a lot worse,” he said.Mr van der Flier said the Covid pass came as a bit of a shock to some of his members when it was implemented at short notice on December 7th as not all members listen or see the news.“It’s hard to know what the demographic is. The problem with fit people is that they think they are invincible anyway,” he said.He also believes there is an attempt by outsiders to agitate and stir up gym members against the Covid certs.“You should see the lengths of emails I get quoting this act and that one. They are written by somebody with a solicitor’s mind. People feel empowered to have a crack at this.”‘No hard evidence’A small gym owner and personal trainer from north Dublin has said he will not ask his clients for Covid-19 certificates.The man, who asked not to be named as he fears it will affect his business, said the Covid passes have failed to stop the transmission of disease as were their original intention.“There is no hard evidence to suggest they have mitigated the spread of Covid, but for some reason they have spread the Covid certs to gyms” he said.“Leo Varadkar has said that it has encouraged more people to come forward to get vaccinated. It’s been used more as a coercive tactic rather than it was originally supposed to be which is a safe place to dine in.”He stressed that Health Surveillance Protection Centre (HSPC) have recorded very few outbreaks in gyms.He acknowledged that vaccines do help prevent serious illness and death, but that his members were healthy people who looked after their bodies.“Working in this industry, I know that a disproportionate amount of the unvaccinated population would be gym users who would give an extra bit of care to their personal health. They might take a more holistic approach to their health.“Despite what anybody says, the vaccines are a new medicine. It is understandable that some people are a little bit hesitant and they want to see how things go.”He also says that a lot of young people, especially teenagers, use leisure facilities . “The younger you go down the age bracket, the more likely you are to find unvaccinated people.“The only reason they are being introduced into gyms is to coerce people into getting vaccinated who are not vaccinated.”Waterford gym goer Val Kearney said he does not support Covid-19 certs in gyms though he is vaccinated himself.“I’ve been back to being a gym user since they reopened the most recent time around. As far as I’m aware there hasn’t been a Covid scare. All members have been fantastic, wiping down equipment before and after use. There’s been no issues from staff either, in terms of not wanting unvaccinated members on the premises,” he said.Leisure, Health and Fitness Association chief executive Karl Dunne said many gym owners were in the “line of fire – there is a lot of pent-up anger”.Gardaí were called to two gyms where members refused to comply with the new Covid-19 regulations.“We had one incident where a guy threw a pen at reception staff in anger,” he said.Negative messagesMany gyms have been targeted on social media, he added, and bombarded with negative messages.Several anti-vaccination gym goers contacted the Adrian (Kennedy) and Jeremy (Gibson) Opinions Matter podcast to voice their disapproval of the Covid-19 certs.Biancha, who did not give her surname, said she was not anti-vaccination, but did not trust the RNA vaccines which are currently being administered.She is doing antigen tests every two days and has tested negative on all occasions.She suggested that unvaccinated people should be allowed separate days to go to the gym.“All these people who aren’t allowed in because they are making a choice, that is discrimination,” she said.“Some certain ethnic groups used to not be allowed in a pub. That’s discrimination. We are talking about principles here. I’m mentally very down not being able to go the gym.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"nphet is the beast government created but can it be tamed","story":"Chief Medical Officer Dr Tony Holohan with   Prof Philip Nolan,   Rachel Kenna and Dr Ronan Glynn. Photograph: Colin KeeganCollins The words coming out of Dr Tony Holohan’s mouth could not have been clearer: do not leak this information at all, and absolutely do not breathe a word before the Minister for Health, Stephen Donnelly has been told.It was last Thursday afternoon and Nphet was wrapping up a meeting in which it agreed to recommend a series of additional restrictions in the lead-up to Christmas.Going to “great pains”, Holohan declared: “This cannot leak before Stephen Donnelly sees it, and Stephen Donnelly can’t see it until late because he is in the Dáil. He almost said I beg you, he said I am pleading with you, do not.”Extra safeguards were put in place.This time the official letter which is sent from the Chief Medical Officer’s office to Donnelly would not even be sent digitally by email. Instead, in the gloom of the winter night, an official was dispatched from the Department of Health to hand-deliver it to Donnelly, who had been on his feet in the Dáil all evening.By the time that official stepped out into the rain, however, most of the details were already being reported by major news outlets. The information was out before the letter had even been put to paper.There was “absolutely huge annoyance about this,” a Government source said. The thinking was, “this is not the way to do business.”What followed the next day was a showdown between public health and Government, the likes of which had not been seen since the infamous Level 5 bombshell that dropped in October 2020.As people and businesses the length and breadth of the country fretted over the clearly imminent restrictions, the Minister for Justice, Helen McEntee, appeared on the country’s biggest radio show, RTÉ’s Morning Ireland, to discuss a scheme for undocumented migrants. She was tackled on the letter and asked what the Government’s plan would be.“It is not helpful that I am talking to you and I haven’t seen the letter,” she said twice.Even McEntee, a mild-mannered and level-headed politician, could not hide her evident frustration. Political insiders knew there was something brewing because, as one person put it, “that would not be Helen’s style”. She wasn’t alone.A meeting of the Cabinet Covid-19 subcommittee was hastily convened on Friday.‘Showdown’The point of the meeting was to discuss the advice with Holohan, but it descended into what multiple sources have described as a “showdown” in which politicians either “read them the riot act” or “exchanged angry words”, depending on who you talk to.Tánaiste Leo Varadkar was said to have been “clinically brutal” in his criticisms. The Minister for Finance, Paschal Donohoe, was angry too, along with McEntee and Minister for Arts Catherine Martin.Ministers wanted to know why they were effectively the last to hear these matters of huge significance and they wanted to know why this kept happening.There were other gripes festering: the previous evening Dr Cillian De Gascun appeared on RTÉ’s Drivetime programme. He was asked about whether schools might reopen in January. He answered haltingly at first but then said he would be hopeful it could happen.Added to the mix was a letter addressed by Holohan to parents around the country where he wrote about a “very high incidence in the as-yet-unvaccinated 5-11 year old age group” which was “a cause for some concern”.Ministers have often complained about feeling bounced into situations in a very public way by Nphet before they have had a chance to consider the implications, and this was the major bone of contention again.The upshot of the confrontation was that Nphet members were to be asked to route their planned interviews through the Government press office. All week, a narrative has been allowed to form that members of the public health team would need to get their permission slip signed before they could go on the radio or TV, raising the spectre of the team being silenced.But that is not how they see it.Free to talkSources on the team say they don’t believe they have been silenced and that they feel free to talk on radio whenever they please. They say it is the Government’s fault if it mishandled the communications of what its actual plan was – to provide Nphet members with the Government position before they go on air and to have clarity on who will be appearing where.“It is all a little bit of a manufactured storm. The Government are creating a problem that does not exist.”Sources say that if the Government wanted to make the overall message more coherent and ensure conflicting messages aren’t going out in public then they should have “built a change over time” instead of “having a hissy fit.”Some people on Nphet are undeterred others are confused most just plan on getting on with their jobs as they were.Pragmatically, many people on the team can understand why the issue came to a head.“I can see their issue. It is not okay to be on Morning Ireland not having seen the letter,” one figure said.On the other side of the fence, there is still aggravation. Government figures say that while Nphet meetings have been “leaky” for quite some time, they believe it has gone “to a whole new level” in recent weeks.There has been much chatter about uncovering the leak. On the Nphet side, members say that if anyone in Government has a suspicion about a serial leaker then they need to take that person aside and confront them because other members of the team feel their reputations are being affected by what is happening.It is clear there is paranoia in all quarters and a tug-of-war to re-establish where the power lies.Nphet has been referred to on more than one occasion as being the most powerful group of people in the country. Although it existed in different forms before 2020, it rose from relative obscurity to become one of the biggest beasts in the political jungle.Passenger seatThe question has been asked: how did Nphet become so dominant? And why is it that the Government always seems to be in the passenger seat when it comes to the big decisions?The answer is: because the Government made it so.In the very early days of the pandemic, on March 3rd, 2020, as the caretaker administration grappled with a decision on whether the St Patrick’s Day parade needed to be cancelled or not, the then minister for health, Simon Harris, said that any decisions made by the Government would be guided by public health and by science – “not by politics”.It became apparent within days exactly how serious the situation was and by March 19th the first major piece of legislation allowing for sweeping restrictions was brought before the Dáil. During that debate, Harris said that the requisite steps would not be taken “on the basis of a whim I or any of the other members may have”, but on the basis of “the best medical advice from the Chief Medical Officer so that we can do that and do it quickly. If the Department of Health and the Chief Medical Officer believe these powers are necessary in the time of a public health emergency, then I am with them all day long.”He added that “every decision that has been made by the National Public Health Emergency Team, which is chaired by the Chief Medical Officer, has been implemented in full.”At the end of April, five weeks into lockdown, Harris was asked about an imminent plan for the reopening of society.“We will follow public health advice first, second and third,” he said.From the very beginning of the pandemic, the power and centrality of Nphet was endorsed, emphasised and encouraged by Government.From a cursory reading of the minutes of the very first Nphet meetings, it is clear that its members did not see themselves as being the primary decision-makers. They talked about being a forum for advising on strategy and about how everything was deliberative until the Government made the final decisions.“No one knew what they were doing, the only people who had some semblance what they were doing was public health,” a source familiar with the situation said.“Even that was on a wing and a prayer. The Opposition were also part of the collective effort too. It is easy to blame the Government for allowing Nphet to take on a directive role but so did the Opposition. They were both in on it.“The Government didn’t have a choice because they didn’t have the knowledge, but it suited them as well politically to hide behind it and blame Nphet.”Simon Harris was regarded as having a close and effective relationship with both Tony Holohan and those in his office.The arrival of Stephen Donnelly as the new Minister for Health appears to have changed that dynamic.ProblematicHis critics inside the department paint him in a problematic light as someone who has struggled to maintain proper communication with the CMO and his team. They say there used to be clear lines of communication but now it has “triangulated”, with the Department of Taoiseach stepping in to take charge on occasion. Others say he went into the role ready to “interrogate” Nphet advice, “to question it, and to say no” when it was warranted.Regardless of any personal views, it is clear the new Government brought about a change in the relationship with Nphet at a time when we had learned a lot about the pandemic – and a lot about the cost politically, economically as well as socially.The relationship between Government and Nphet existed in two different worlds: the early and dark days of the pandemic when no one knew what was happening and the later days when the country had to find a way to live with Covid-19.This is still the world we are still living in and, despite plans to disband Nphet in October (which was apparently news to Holohan and his team), rising case numbers and the threat of the new Omicron variant mean we will be hearing from the public health team for some time to come.Ministers clearly have no Plan B for how to grapple with the coming weeks in relation to taking advice, and no alternative to Nphet. Some insiders believe that if the plan was to get the team to quieten down then this will backfire.This is because Nphet is the beast that the Government created and its expertise will be needed in the coming weeks if a more transmissible variant is about to take off. The Government knows it, and Nphet knows it too.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"covid 19 4 667 new cases reported as state very eager to offer boosters to people in 40s","story":"Simon Harris said there are also plans for a vaccine programme for children.

Photograph: Piero CruciattiAFP Undeterred by health woes, sex scandals and advanced age, former Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi is doggedly pursuing a promise he once made to his mother: that one day he would become president.Parliament will choose a new head of state early next year and the 85 year old is the first to put himself forward for a race that could transform the Italian political landscape but has no official candidates.Substantial obstacles lie in his path, but he is promoting himself with the gusto that helped him win three parliamentary elections and become Italy’s longest-serving post-war premier.“I’ve met him twice in the last two weeks and he was totally fired up,” said a lawmaker from Berlusconi’s Forza Italia party, who asked not to be named.He was temporarily barred from public office after a conviction for tax fraud in 2013, and is still on trial in the latest of a series of instances for bribing witnesses in an underage prostitution case tied to his infamous “Bunga Bunga” sex parties of more than a decade ago.Divisive personalityAnalysts believe such a isive personality will find it hard to muster the broad support needed to elect a president, who serves as the problem solver in Italian politics and is regularly called on, as the incumbent Sergio Mattarella has been, to resolve government deadlocks.Cross-party consensus is especially important at present, as almost all the main parties have laid their differences aside to join Mario Draghi’s national unity coalition, created to help Italy overcome the coronavirus crisis.Enrico Letta, leader of the centre-left Democratic Party (PD), has already ruled out backing Berlusconi.He said the election of the president “has to be based on a large majority . . . otherwise the government will immediately fall apart”.Despite the political hurdles, Berlusconi is ploughing ahead with his unofficial campaigning, presenting himself as an experienced elder statesman of European politics.Candidates for president do not usually declare themselves in advance of the election in parliament. However, Berlusconi’s name has been put forward repeatedly in the media, and he has not tried to dampen speculation that he wants the job.Sharp U-turnAsked about his presidential prospects at a conference in October, he said: “I think Silvio Berlusconi can be useful to the country . . . I won’t back down and I’ll do what my country needs.”In November, he sent an anthology of his speeches and policy priorities to almost all the nearly 1,000 parliamentarians who will elect the president, committing himself to a list of liberal values in an effort to broaden his appeal.In an abrupt U-turn, he also praised the flagship citizens’ income welfare scheme of his arch political enemy, the Five Star Movement, which he has previously likened to the Communist Party.A winning candidate needs two-thirds of votes, but if no one reaches that target in the first three rounds, the bar is lowered to 50 per cent of votes plus one.If all the lawmakers in the centre-right block voted for him, and that is a big “if”, Berlusconi would still need at least 50 more votes to make him head of state – which he would have to secure from a pool of 113 unaffiliated lawmakers.With the maths looking difficult, some analysts believe that Berlusconi is simply hoping to gain leverage to put himself in a position to act as a kingmaker.As Lorenzo de Sio, head of the Italian centre for electoral studies at Rome’s LUISS university, put it, “he has no bargaining power if he himself is not considered plausible”. – ReutersStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Atomic icebreakers and floating power plants to help Kremlin develop Arctic shipping routeMinority nations feel squeeze as Putin\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquopower vertical\u0026rsquo crushes republics\u0026rsquo autonomyHistory of bloodshed and tragedy haunts stunning region shared by Muslims and ChristiansOil wealth and new mosque and churches help keep Tatarstan on Kremlin\u0027s sideOfficials claim West wants to \u0026lsquoGermanise\u0026rsquo and instil special identity in strategic regionNato monitors heavily armed Kaliningrad as locals long for borders to reopenAttack on renowned Memorial rights group deepens opposition anger and international alarmSaint Petersburg Letter: Russia\u0026rsquos old imperial capital celebrates 200 years since birth of Crime and Punishment creatorEnergy giant hopes vast forests will offset carbon costs and ease green transitionCircassian heritage trampled and property rows continue as Winter Olympics city boomsKremlin criticised as most Russians reject vaccination and hospitals face huge strainKremlin changes tack on global warming and looks to vast forests to offset emissionsRussia and Japan co-operate on Sakhalin despite row over nearby Kuril islandsIndustry and struggling communities fear wildlife support could stifle Far East developmentCity with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warming"},{"url":null,"title":"welcome meme party internet skewered no 10 non event","story":"Two-thirds of the British public now say they have a bad opinion of Boris Johnson, according to the latest polling by YouGov. Which can only mean the other third have not been paying attention. Just to bring you up to speed, in case you fall into that category: the Prime Minister knew absolutely nothing about a Christmas party that definitely didn’t happen in Downing Street on December 18 last year.“How could it have happened when Christmas parties weren’t allowed due to Covid?” I hear you cry. Well, quite, that is precisely why it didn’t. Just as Owen Patterson did not commit any breaches of lobbying rules and just as Bill Clinton did not have sexual relations with that woman. Nothing whatsoever to see here. Just a nice baby girl, born to Johnson’s wife Carrie this week. Can’t we just focus on that?But here’s the curious part: although this party didn’t take place, Allegra Stratton, Johnson’s former press secretary, was filmed laughing about it anyway in a video that was leaked to ITV News. Which was somewhat unfortunate for all those who had insisted it never took place. Obviously Stratton had to resign from her current job, for laughing about a party that didn’t happen. The country, meanwhile, has kept itself busy sharing jokes and memes about what has inevitably now been called Christmas partygate. One wag on Twitter suggested Labour refer to the Tories from here on in as simply “The Christmas Party.” Another said of Johnson’s apparent non-attendance at the party that didn’t take place:Yes, it has been a rich seam to mine, and if we didn’t laugh we’d be crying as we asked ourselves in disbelief how a man who seemed so trustworthy at the outset, so clearly guided by a strict moral code, could have let us down so badly.

They firmly believe Johnson, as should we all:Some even expressed their support by comparing him to their favourite television comedians, such as Kathy Burke...But if, despite all the copper-bottomed assurances that no party or parties took place and no rules were broken, at least we know the very best officers have been assigned to the case.

Not the one by Edward Gibbon, but rather that by Evelyn Waugh. In particular I have been thinking of a strange scene at the end of the novel where Waugh suddenly introduces a serious note to his comedy.In his first novel Waugh already exercises his trademark gleeful malevolence towards the fate of his characters. All are picked up and spun through the most vicious cycles. But there is also a curious character, a sinister architect, who towards the novel’s close suddenly says something wise. Professor Silenus is watching a ride in an amusement park when Paul Pennyfeather comes upon him.Silenus explains the fairground attraction they are watching. For five francs the punters go into a room with tiers of seats, and in the centre is a great revolving floor that spins everyone around quickly.At first you sit down and watch the others. They are all trying to sit in the wheel, and they keep getting flung off, and that makes them laugh, and you laugh too. “It’s great fun.”Pennyfeather wonders whether this is much like life.“Oh, but it is,” says Silenus. “You see, the nearer you can get to the hub of the wheel the slower it is moving and the easier it is to stay on.“There’s generally someone in the centre who stands up and sometimes does a sort of dance. Often he’s paid by the management, though, or, at any rate, he’s allowed in free. Of course at the very centre there’s a point completely at rest, if one could only find it.”I’m sure I don’t need to extrapolate to readers why this passage has been on my mind. This week has included an especially horrible turn of the wheel. And the fairground attraction of Boris’s Number 10 suddenly seems to have lost all of its amusement value. It can even turn a party into a portion of the horrible, destructive game.Earlier this week the front pages blazed out images of the weeping Allegra Stratton, made to carry the can for Number 10.Stratton was hired away by Number 10 a year ago from her highly successful career in the media. She never even spent a day in the job she was hired to do, but was instead shunted aside (some say on the insistence of the Prime Minister’s wife) and given the booby prize of the Cop26 summit. Now she has been thrown off completely.When the footage was leaked showing her laughing with others at Number 10 over how to answer certain questions it was especially ugly because so many people in the media and politics had worked with Stratton, yet helped speed this cycle along.They pretended that Stratton had been laughing at the public, when she had been doing no such thing. But the outrage spin-cycle is so attractive. Everybody wants to be a part of, and make it go faster and faster until it throws them off in turn.To a great extent it is not just Number 10 but the whole political and media world in this country that is now stuck on this destructive ride with not a still point anywhere. Every hour we see another bizarre turn. Sometimes it takes out someone in politics.Sometimes it takes out someone in the media.Last week the BBC’s media editor Amol Rajan was clinging onto his job because some tweets of his from a decade earlier resurfaced. A few days later and the Prime Minister’s former girlfriend Jennifer Arcuri is being sued by the broadcaster Andrew Neil. Sometimes the wheel throws off one person. Sometimes people manage to cling on. It is all very distracting, certainly.And that is what brings to mind the speech of Professor Silenus. He feels, indeed hopes, that he might be near the still point himself. But there is a problem with getting there. Professional men get in the way, he says. Worse is that “Lots of people just enjoy scrambling on and being whisked off and scrambling on again. How they all shriek and giggle! And then there are those who sit as far out as they can and hold on for dear life and enjoy that”.How that sums up much of Westminster today – MPs and hacks who just enjoy the game and enjoy holding on as others go to the wall. But in the process they forget why anybody would want to get into this game in the first place.You might say, as Silenus does, that “you needn’t get on it at all, if you don’t want to.” And that, at times, seems like the easier and more attractive option. Yet the ride this country is on is not an amusement.If our country is to succeed in the coming years we are going to have to build as well as destroy, to develop people as well as fling them off. To find still points as well as the amusement. But nobody seems to want to think of that, so on it goes.     More from NewsCovid latest news: Alert level increased to Level 4 ahead of Boris Johnson national addressIn defence of boredomDonald Trump’s Florida roadshow greeted with rows of empty seatsArmed forces to get new guidance on how to use \u0026#39inclusive language\u0026#39More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"armed forces get new guidance use inclusive language","story":"The armed forces are to be given new guidance on “inclusive language” after the Defence Secretary said he is “unhappy” with the current advice.Military personnel from all three services had been told to avoid using phrases such as crippled with debt or blind drunk.The MoD said its Inclusive Language Guide 2021 was a “practical toolkit” to help servicemen and women understand why “certain words or use of language is hurtful or non-inclusive”.A senior defence source told the : The Defence Secretary and Chief of the Defence Staff (CDS) have been clear that the UK armed forces must modernise to tackle the threats of the future. That includes our approach to our people who are critical to that task.“The Defence Secretary is unhappy with the current approach set out in the guide. A revised version will be published in the coming weeks.The guide will be taken down from the MoD website while changes are made.The guide, produced by the MoD\u0027s Diversity and Inclusion Directorate, denies being an attempt to police language or restrict your personal style of communication, but was created to help staff speak more powerfully, precisely and respectfully, according to the Mail on Sunday.It recommended avoiding phrases such as deaf to our pleas in case it offended the disabled.The 30-page pamphlet said the words woman and female “mean different things but are often used interchangeably”, adding: “Referring to women as females is perceived by many as reducing a woman to her reproductive parts and abilities.“Not all women are biologically female, and the conflation of ‘female’ to ‘woman’ erases gender nonconforming people and members of the trans community.”“The women in the platoon” is said to be a more inclusive phrase than “the females in the platoon”.The guide includes more inclusive ways to address disability, race, gender, age, religion, sexual orientation and social mobility.The MoD wants personnel to put the “person first” when speaking to others, only referencing characteristics when they are relevant and doing so in specific ways.References to race or disability should only be used when relevant to the context of any discussion, the guide states, adding it is important to ask how others self-identify.As far as possible neutral language should be used at all times.  The recommendations aim to be non-confrontational. The guide advises personnel challenging others on their language to be polite and prepared to “explain the logic” behind their views.Equally, those being challenged should not take it personally and should support junior peers to raise challenges with more senior colleagues, according to the guide.Dom Fairlie, chair of the Civilian LGBT+ Network shOUT, told ForcesNet: “We need to normalise that it\u0027s OK to get it wrong sometimes, as long as it\u0027s not done with intent.Those within the LGBT+ community are really not offended if you genuinely stumble, we all do from time to time, so it\u0027s okay to correct yourself and not be embarrassed by it.The  understands there are no plans to disband or redirect the MoD’s Diversity and Inclusion Directorate, which was responsible for the guide.The news came as the new CDS, Admiral Sir Tony Radakin, said the push for greater ersity in the military is not about being “woke”, but addressing the “woeful” lack of women and ethnic minorities in the forces.In his first speech in the post, Adm Radakin said: “This is not about wokefulness. It is about woefulness. The woefulness of too few women.“The woefulness of not reflecting the ethnic, religious and cognitive ersity of our nation.“And the woefulness of not following our own values, whether respect for each other or the simple integrity of claiming expenses.”More from NewsCovid latest news: Alert level increased to Level 4 ahead of Boris Johnson national addressIn defence of boredomDonald Trump’s Florida roadshow greeted with rows of empty seatsScottish Tory leader struggles to defend Boris Johnson over Covid lockdown quizMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"covid boosters over 30s race limit omicron stepped christmas","story":"Covid booster jabs will be offered to 30-year-olds from Monday as the Government launches a desperate dash to jab “as many people as possible” before Christmas.In a massive push to protect millions more people in the face of the new omicron variant the NHS has announced the booster will be available to everyone aged 30 to 39 three months after their second dose.More age groups are expected to be included in the coming weeks, with ministers determined to “massively expedite” the booster roll out.The  understands that several billion more pounds is to be poured into expanding the roll-out.Data shows that a third jab gives up to 75 per cent protection against infection from omicron, as well as decreasing the chances of severe illness if infected.It comes as government modellers warned the new omicron variant could cause more hospitalisations and deaths than last year’s peak, despite Plan B restrictions of mask-wearing and working from home being imposed.On Saturday the UK recorded 633 omicron cases, the biggest single daily increase since the variant was detected in the UK in November. The confirmed number of cases for the country stands now at 1,898.The Government on Saturday night made it clear it wants to dramatically speed up the programme as the best protection against omicron, with ministers considering calling in more military medics to help deliver boosters in areas where the roll-out is being held back by capacity as opposed to demand.A Government source said: We\u0027re looking at what we can do to massively expedite the booster programme. We are trying to get as many people a booster before Christmas as physically possible. It doesn\u0027t solve everything but it obviously would slow things down.Extending the top up jabs to those 30 and over, which follows updated advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, means another 3.5 million people will be eligible from Monday with the rest of the 7.5 million people in that age range qualifying in the coming weeks.Sajid Javid, the Health and Social Care Secretary, said: “The Covid-19 booster programme is accelerating rapidly and more than 22 million people in the UK have already received their top-up, securing vital protection ahead of Christmas.“This is our national mission - the most recent data shows boosters are the essential defence against omicron and we are doing everything in our power to get jabs into arms as quickly as possible.“We are now expanding the offer to over-30s – so please come forward as quickly as possible to get boosted and help our country get ahead in this race with the variant.”More from NewsCovid latest news: Alert level increased to Level 4 ahead of Boris Johnson national addressIn defence of boredomDonald Trump’s Florida roadshow greeted with rows of empty seatsArmed forces to get new guidance on how to use \u0026#39inclusive language\u0026#39More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"return shirking home","story":"Here we go again. As from tomorrow, millions of people will once again be working from home. ‘Go to work if you must,’ said Boris Johnson on Wednesday, ‘but work from home if you can.’ For swathes of workers, the news they can once again switch the frosty commute for the warm bath of remote working will feel like Christmas came early, but not everyone is so impressed: ‘Small biz will collapse’, Lord Sugar succinctly tweeted. WFH is supposed to be the new normal, a flexible utopia of happy shiny employees working harder, better and smarter at kitchen tables across the land. But it simply isn’t working out that way in many sectors – sectors which are critical for the smooth and efficient running of the country.The most obvious and shocking example of this is the testimony of former Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) employee Raphael Marshall about the department’s handling of mass evacuations from Afghanistan in August. More than once, Marshall said, he found himself alone in the office, and ‘staffing shortages were exacerbated by some staff working from home, which hampered communication.’This was one of the biggest foreign policy crises in living memory: a time when thousands of desperate Afghans were pleading for their lives and British soldiers on the ground were doing an extraordinary job under the most difficult conditions imaginable. In other words, this was a time when any conscientious and well-managed department would have been working round the clock. Working from home? Shirking from home, more like.The catastrophic mismanagement of the petrol crisis a few weeks after the Afghanistan debacle was also partly due to the fact that so many officials in the Department of Transport were remote working. At times like that, and also during the fiasco over granting visas for 5,000 foreign HGV drivers, Zoom meetings simply don’t cut it. You need people in the room so they can brainstorm how to solve problems. Otherwise information gets misplaced and responsibility dodged.A similar pattern, albeit under less extreme circumstances, can be seen across many government departments, with public service inefficiency bringing a deluge of complaints. More than 500,000 driving licences were delayed over the summer after industrial action by the Public and Commercial Services Union, some of whose staff were reluctant to return to the office even when told that they could. People applying for passports are advised to ‘allow up to 10 weeks’, more than three times the clearing period pre-coronavirus. Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) checks, designed to weed out certain public sector applicants with criminal records, have at times taken twice as long as usual to process.Latest HMRC figures show that they are clearing only just over a third of postal cases and inquiries within their 15-day target. And in some parts of the country, planning searches are taking up to 14 weeks. These searches are neither especially complex nor specialised, and in normal times efficient councils can turn them round in a week or two. Delays affect not just homebuyers and mortgage lenders but commercial projects too.It would be bad enough if it was just the public sector affected. But everyone has their own stories of private sector incompetence too: not just in the early days of the pandemic last year, when every organisation was feeling its way and trying to adjust to an unprecedented situation, but still to this day. Dante Alighieri gave his Inferno nine circles of hell, but were he alive today he would surely add a tenth featuring automated answering services and their repeated insistence that his call was important to them.Research both here and abroad has found that working from home has negative effects on productivity. A Cambridge University study published last month showed that during restriction periods people spend less time on work-related activities than usual, with parents of young children unsurprisingly accounting for the biggest difference. A University of Chicago study found that productivity of those working from home fell by up to a fifth, especially among women (who take the brunt of household and childcare tasks.) And Japan’s Research Institute of Economy, Trade and Industry (RIETI) says that the average productivity of employees when working from home compared to in their workplaces is 68 per cent - a drop of almost a third.Cary Cooper, Professor of Organisational Psychology at the University of Manchester, says that ‘even before the lockdowns, we had the technology to move to remote working and there were very good reasons why we didn’t.’ Offices exist for a reason. They’re designed to encourage and facilitate work, and in doing so minimise the kind of distractions common at home: housework, shopping, social media, cooking, children, housemates, delivery drivers, pets.A positive company culture is much harder to maintain by remote. Video meetings are a pale facsimile of real-life ones: concentrating on a screen makes them tiring, the inability to sense others’ body language and non-verbal communication makes them limited, and the awkwardness of dialogue patterns when only one person at a time can have the electronic conch of the framed window makes them unwieldy for any more than three or four people. The chance encounters and spontaneous conversations that lead to great ideas and foster better relationships are reduced to zero. WFH involves more time and expense spent on communication and co-ordination, cutting into uninterrupted work hours.It’s for reasons such as these that Netflix boss Reed Hastings says: ‘not being able to get together in person is a pure negative.’ It’s even worse for people who’ve joined organisations in the last 18 months, and will have met few or maybe even none of their colleagues in person. How are they supposed to do their jobs efficiently? How can they have been trained properly without the ability to go and ask questions of a colleague a couple of desks away?Researchers at the Rotterdam School of Management in Netherlands found that world-class chess players have in general been making worse moves when playing online from home than when physically facing opponents over the board: and work tasks often require the same skills as chess moves, such as strategy, analysis, pattern recognition, option evaluation and decision-making under time pressure.The concept of the work-life balance, which WFH was thought to aid, has always been predicated on the separation between work and life: you go somewhere separate to work, and when you leave that place so too is your work done until the next day. The erosion of the work-life balance is usually couched in terms of work taking over life - and indeed in the wake of the pandemic there have been calls from unions for the government to follow the French example and allow workers to ‘fully disconnect’ and have no legal obligation to answer office communications outside working hours.But of course the work-life balance can work the other way too, with life taking over work to the detriment of the latter. In his testimony, Marshall referred to ‘a deliberate drive by the FCDO to prioritise ‘work-life balance’. FCDO employees, including senior leaders, are often told that working more than eight hours a day suggests that they are inefficient…. Whilst a healthy ‘work-life balance’ is important in moderation, in my opinion the FCDO’s approach has undermined organisational effectiveness,’ he said.No-one’s claiming that WFH is the only reason for poor performance, of course. Covid has seen millions of workers signed off sick at one stage of the pandemic or another, and for businesses relying on physical supply chains there have also been problems arising from Brexit border issues and the closure of the Suez Canal. But one of the first rules of any efficient organisation is ‘control the controllables’, and there are few things more controllable than the whereabouts of your employees.‘Working from home’ used to be a term of sarcasm, with air quotes around the phrase and a knowing smile. The suspicion is that in some cases it remains at least partly so. At the start of the pandemic, the Queen told the nation that ‘while we may have more still to endure, better days will return… We will meet again.’ Those days will return, but only if those meetings are in offices rather than just in pubs.More from NewsCovid latest news: Alert level increased to Level 4 ahead of Boris Johnson national addressIn defence of boredomDonald Trump’s Florida roadshow greeted with rows of empty seatsArmed forces to get new guidance on how to use \u0026#39inclusive language\u0026#39More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"first picture royal navy trident","story":"Man found dead at nuclear base in unexplained tragedy is named as sailor, Royal Navy engineering technician Stephen Cashman has been named as the serviceman who was killed in \"unexplained circumstances\" at the Faslane nuclear naval baseTributes have been paid to Stephen Cashman following his death at Faslane nuclear naval base Image: MODByTim HanlonNews Reporter:,  Dec Updated:,  Dec | comments A Royal Navy serviceman who died in unexplained circumstances at the Faslane nuclear naval base was a -year-old Trident submariner, it has been confirmed.Engineering technician Stephen Cashman died on Thursday at the Clyde base and it has led to an investigation by Police Scotland.

Political staff and officials would frequently drink after work until the early hours of the morning, and order takeaway food to Ms Coffey’s office at the Department for Work and Pensions- while hospitality and office parties were banned under Covid regulations. While most DWP staff worked from home throughout the pandemic, a “core team” of her private office staff - who have desks in a small area outside her office door - continued to work from the departmental HQ, close to Westminster Abbey. At one such occasion during last year’s festive season, Ms Coffey handed out Christmas presents to her team. It comes as Whitehall was in ‘outright panic’ that more details of lockdown-breaking parties would surface in the coming days. The Mirror has been told aposgatheringsapos in Ms Coffeyaposs office throughout the pandemic were an open secret, with one source saying even during lockdown, there were parties all the time. Bottles of wine and beer were routinely found between staff members’ salads and sandwiches in fridges at the department, to be drunk at the informal, late-night soirees. A DWP insider said: “There is a constant flow of booze in the office.”  While the parties were not ‘organised’, staff meetings would often “evolve” into drinking, which would carry on until the early hours of the morning. Before the pandemic, Ms Coffey was reportedly the host of notorious late night karaoke sessions in the Houses of Parliament, which would regularly take place in her Commons office. The DWP told the Sunday Mirror there was “no karaoke” at the gatherings during the pandemic, but did not deny that late night drinking and mingling took place. A DWP spokesperson said: Throughout the pandemic, DWP officials have followed government guidance while continuing to deliver vital services for millions of people. “Staff worked from home where possible but a core team working directly to the Secretary of State regularly worked from the office, in accordance with the COVID- rules as they evolved. “The team regularly worked late into the evening and on a number of occasions they ate takeaway food and drank some alcohol. No karaoke took place. On one occasion close to Christmas, the Secretary of State gave gts to her core team, as she does every year. Ms Coffey faced fury earlier this year after the Mirror published a video of her singing aposIaposve Had the Time of My Leapos at a karaoke party at Tory party conference, the day before slashing Universal Credit for thousands of struggling families.Last week, the Mirror revealed a Christmas Party with drinks and canapés had been held at the Department for Education while Tier  rules were in place.And today, it emerged that staff at the Treasury held a boozy celebration to mark Rishi Sunak ’s spending review in November .Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Conservative PartyThe TreasuryDepartment for Work and PensionsBoris JohnsonAlcoholPoliticsChristmas party\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Mr Zahawi could not guarantee that all schools will be open everywhere next term - but said he would do everything in my power to keep children in class.Ministers have repeatedly said that closing schools again would be a last resort after repeated lockdowns caused massive disruption to childrenaposs learning.Asked whether he could guarantee no schools would be shut, Mr Zahawi told the BBCaposs Andrew Marr Show: We are absolutely working to make sure that all schools are open, that theyaposre protected. I will do everything in my power. We are still learning about this iant.  We know that a booster works. Get boosted, protect yourself, protect your community and letaposs get through this and transition this from pandemic to endemic. Last month, Mr Zahawi insisted that closing schools was absolutely the last possible option. But fears are mounting about the spread of the new Omicron iant, with reports of at least two outbreaks in schools.Mr Zahawi confirmed on Sunday that there are cases in hospital with Omicron and warned that tens of thousands of Brits could end up needing hospital treatment.The Education Secretary also failed to rule out extending the vaccine rollout to primary age children following reports health officials are gearing up to offer jabs to young kids. He said: There is no plan at the moment to vaccinate primary school children for the reason that the Joint Committee on Vaccinationis still looking at the evidence as to what level of protection it would offer.The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agencyis expected to announce that jabs are safe for children, while the JCVI is examining whether to recommend vaccines for kids, according to the Sunday Times. The European Medicines Agency approved the Pfizer jab for  to -year-olds last month. The MHRA said: Pfizer has stated that they are applying to the MHRA for an extension to their Covid- vaccine authorisation that would allow use in five to -year-olds. Further details on the timing of this submission would be for Pfizer to provide. We are committed to providing safe, timely access to treatment for UK patients, and will continue to prioritise our Covid- evaluations. This includes any decision on use in under-s. Any such decision would be subject to our robust regulatory standards. In the meantime, we are looking at the data from other countries to ensure that when an application is received, we are making the best decision for children in the UK. It comes after a damning report by Ofsted found that nearly every child in England had fallen behind at school due to Covid. It warned that loneliness, boredom and misery had become endemic - and some children had developed physical and mental health problems due to the disruption. Chief Inspector Amanda Spielman said there were children who sadly are safer in school than out of it as she warned that further shutdowns risk more cases like Arthur Lanbinjo-Hughes. The six-year-old was abused and killed at home in Solihull last year.

Why  No one knows. Or, at least, no one is willing to say. For as far back as anyone can remember, a stream of out-of-touch, often privately educated, Education Secretaries, have signed off on the idea that teaching student’s th century literature, at Level , is just what students need to secure them a decent job in the workplace. Students who don’t pass their GCSEs are forced to repeat what they’ve already failed at. Forced to engage with books written in a language they will never use. Trying to explain to young students who already feel like they have failed, why Jane Eyre is so important to them, is borderline abuse. At a time when young people are turning away from books and literature at an alarming rate, no one in government seems bothered or interested in providing students with something a little more relatable. Last week I had to face one such group. The futility and unfairness of it struck me mid lesson. I had no argument as to why they should engage with Dracula.  Why reading Stoker would be of use, interest, or benefit to them unless they had an express desire to go into further education. Which the vast majority don’t. Starting off a lesson with the words, ‘Today we are going to be looking at Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde’ will mean within two minutes % of a GCSE class will have shut down. Do the powers that be think there is no other literature available to young people  Using contemporary texts by authors like Kit de Waal or Lisa McInerny, would at least give students and teachers a fighting chance. If educators were permitted to teach English using contemporary literature that told of the lives and challenges of iniduals who looked and sounded like the students they were teaching, on subjects like county lines, gangs and drugs, or any other aspect of st century teenage le, more students would engage. It’s what they are familiar with. What takes up much of their time. And using a language they use themselves exploring issues and situations they can identy with. A large section of the materials we currently use to teach our young students are entirely ineffective. In fact, they are worse than ineffective. Relying on these texts throws unnecessary, unhelpful barriers in the paths of students. It damages their already damaged faith in themselves and a system that is supposed to support, nurture, and encourage them. If you don’t believe me, ask them yourselves. @StephenTuffin is a lecturer in Swindon Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Conservative PartyEducationSchoolsPoliticsChristmas partyGCSEsRochester and Strood\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Senior MPs, including a Tory former health minister, gave the Prime Minister  days to answer questions about the guest list for the party on December , and details of a party alleged to have taken place in his flat on November . The cross-party group of MPs and peers - including Tory Dr Dan Poulter - today called on Cabinet Secretary Simon Case’s probe into the parties answer key questions within  days. Mr Case was last week tasked with investigating “the facts” of the party on December  in Number , details of which were first revealed by the Daily Mirror. The probe has since been extended to cover the party at the Department for Education, as well as a further gathering alleged to have taken place in the PM’s Downing Street flat on November . But Number  has resisted putting a timescale on his probe, with the PM only saying it would report back as quickly as possible. Today, in a letter coordinated by the All-Party Parliamentary Groupon Coronavirus, a cross-party group of MPs and Peers called on the PM to admit to “any other gatherings in Downing Street in contravention of Covid rules such as that alleged by Mr Cummings to have occurred on th November  ”And they demanded to know the guest list for the December  Christmas party, who organised and sanctioned it, and what knowledge of it the Prime Minister had at the time. It follows new polling, which suggests that % of people no longer trust the UK government to handle the nation’s pandemic response with % saying the scandal would negatively impact compliance with Covid rules. The polling, from from Best for Britain, the APPG’s Secretariat found % of  Tory voters thought it made people less likely to follow Covid restrictions - while % of Leave voters had also lost confidence in the government. Layla Moran MP, Chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Coronavirus said: “We’ve heard first hand of the pain and loss people have endured during this pandemic. “To know that at the same time, those in Number  were partying and laughing about their rule-breaking, is absolutely sickening. “This investigation must be thorough. If the Prime Minister was aware of this party it is a resignation matter.” Naomi Smith, Chief Executive of Best for Britain said: “Our polling shows the real world dangers of a government that plays fast and loose with the trust of the British people. “This investigation cannot be a whitewash, with fewer people now expected to observe Covid guidelines, answering these questions is a matter of le and death.”  The letter in full Prime Minister,As the UK faces the new Omicron iant this winter, it has never been more important for the public to trust the UK Government’s response to the pandemic and observe all restrictions in place to save lives and protect the NHS. Therefore, the growing evidence supporting allegations of a social gathering at  Downing Street in contravention of Covid restrictions is deeply concerning.Your belated announcement of an internal investigation into this breach of Covid rules is welcome, but we remain concerned at the scope and the timeline of this investigation. For this reason we the undersigned ask you, to guarantee in writing that within the next  days, the investigation will provide answers to the following questions which are in the urgent public interest:Who attended the Downing Street party on th December  Who sanctioned and organised the event  Was the Prime Minister aware  And when did he become aware  Will the Prime Minister guarantee that all evidence is shared with the politan Police as soon as it becomes available  Were there any other gatherings in Downing Street in contravention of Covid rules such as that alleged by Mr Cummings to have occurred on th November  A Christmas party in Downing Street at a time when the public made enormous sacrices, including spending Christmas in isolation and far from sick and even dying relatives, would not only represent a flagrant breach of the rules, but a breach of the trust of the British people as well. At this crucial time in the pandemic, the public must have full trust in the UK Government’s ability to safeguard lives. It is vital that this investigation urgently restores public trust in the UK Government’s pandemic response and all public health measures in place.

And Tehran signalled two weeks ago it might accept the payment in Covid jabs and medicines which would count as humanitarian aid. In an exclusive interview Nazanin’s husband Richard Ratclfe said: “All countries need vaccines. If the offer was worth more than £million Iran could be interested. “Andwe settled this debt Nazainin could be released the next day. It would be an amazing Christmas present for her to be home.” But as things stand Richard and daughter, Gabriella, , will spend their sixth Christmas without Nazanin despite his  day hunger strike outside the Foreign Office last month. Richard added: “Nazanin has been very blue these past few days, as the realisation has hit her that we are drting again. “But Gabriella has had a happy time decorating the tree and helping me put up lights. After the intensity of the hunger strike, it is also nice to have some good times.”  Nazanin, , has been detained in Iran since April,  and was sentenced to five years over spying charges. She now faces another one year jail term. Britain claims she is being held hostage with other dual nationals as the two countries wrangle over money. Ministers admit the cash is owed for battle tanks never delivered but keep coming up with dferent excuses not to pay it. In March Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said the UK’s refusal to cough up was “a stain on Britain’s honour”. Now he says the money can only be paid“a practicable and legally-viable means” can be found. Foreign Office minister Lord Zac Goldsmith said last month to pay would be ransom money. He added: “Payment of any money becomes payment for a hostage. That is not in our current, medium or long-term interests.” Richard said: “His comments were legally illiterate and irresponsible for the message it sent to Iran. “Ministers cannot throw out words like “hostage” and “ransom” when they just want to deflect Parliamentary scrutiny. “My fear is that the debt is also leverage for the UK side - using it to push Iran into the nuclear deal or something  - and Nazanin has become a bargaining chip for both sides.” Middle East minister James Cleverly refuses to talk about negotiations saying he “will not comment further as discussions are ongoing.” Foreign Secretary Liz Truss had meetings with Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian on th November and another with his deputy Bagheri Kani three days later without any resolution.  In  Iran ordered , Chieftain battle tanks and  repair vehicles costing £million from Britain. Only  tanks were delivered before the  Iranian revolution overthrew the Shah and pitched the country into the hands of Islamic clerics and Britain banned arms sales. When new Iranian leader Ayatollah Khomeini asked for a £million refund to make up for the missing weaponry Britain refused to hand it over. Yet in  the international court in The Hague ordered Britain to repay the money which is still sitting in an independent trust in the UK. Iran now wants £million in interest which Britain will not pay either. Britain has argued the money cannot be repaid because Iran is under UN sanctions - yet that did not stop America coughing up a similar sum to release four American prisoners in . And former Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said: “We are a country that pays its debts.”Mrs Zaghari-Ratclfe’s family have said she was repeatedly told that her arrest was linked with the debt that the UK owes. Richard has now been on two hunger strikes - the first two years ago outside London’s Iranian Embassy - but he is not about to embark on a third. He said: “They put a real strain on the family, as well as on my body. So none planned for a while, and hopefully none needed.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON NHSMiddle EastUnited NationsForeign OfficeJames CleverlyAyatollah Ruhollah KhomeiniZac GoldsmithJeremy HuntNazanin Zaghari-RatclfeLiz TrussPrisonsIranChristmas partyDebtHandsTribunals\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Boris Johnson announced on Wednesday that England would move to the Governmentaposs Plan B measures.Epidemiologists fear the iant could cause , deaths by April and that the NHS could be overwhelmed as Omicron looks set to overtake Delta as the dominant iant within days. UK Health Security Agencyadviser Dr Susan Hopkins warned of a looming wave of infections - and said more measures may be needed. She said: Itaposs inevitable that weaposre going to see a big wave of infections. What we are not yet clear on, and which is what we are basically making sure people go out and get their vaccination for, is how much that will affect hospitals.  So, what do the latest Covid curbs mean for you  Hereaposs the latest. Working from home People in England are being urged to work from home where possible from Monday. This is aimed at reducing contacts. The furlough scheme has not ed, however, as no businesses are being shut down at this stage. The advice is to work from home aposwhere you canapos. Face masks New rules brought into force on Friday mean that anyone aged  or over must wear a face mask to enter a wide range of indoor venues. These include places such as cinemas, casinos and bowling alleys. The full list:community centres , youth centres, members clubs and social clubs libraries and public reading rooms shops public transport polling stations and premises used for the counting of votes places of worship crematoria and burial ground chapels visitor attractions and entertainment venuespublic areas in hotels and hostels indoor areas of sports stadiumsPubs, bars and nightclubs are exempt. There is also an exemption for singing, which applies to, for example, congregations and choirs. Technically, a person could avoid wearing a face mask by singing, but the Government has warned protestors attempting to abuse this rule will be stoped. Daily testing for Covid contacts From Tuesday, double-jabbed people who come into contact with an infected person will be told to take daily lateral flow tests for seven days instead of isolating. The new advice applies to all cases of Covid, regardless of whether it is the Omicron iant or other strains. Unvaccinated adults must continue to self-isolate for  daysthey are a contact of someone with Covid.This means strict rules forcing people identied as close contacts of Omicron cases to isolate for  days are being scrapped. Care homes From Wednesday, there will be a new restriction on care home visits. Care home residents will be asked to pick three people to visit and one essential care worker. Covid passports From Wednesday, England could be facing the introduction of mandatory covid passes proving your vaccination status to enter some venues, including nightclubs.So a punter could have proof of double jabbed status or, under the new pass rules, a text message or email from the NHS showing a lateral flow result to get into a venue.Firms failing to check Covid passes properly may be fined £, and up to £, for repeat offences.But Boris Johnson is facing a major backlash to the plan as Tory backbenchers look set to vote against the plan. The PM may get the changes though parliament with Labour support but given he is under major pressure over the Christmas parties plan, the rules could be watered down.  What about Christmas  So far, there are no limits on travel, household mixing and meeting groups of people. Downing Street has also rejected calls to put new restrictions on hospitality venues, so your Christmas party can still go ahead. What about a aposPlan Capos  Officially, there is no Plan C. The Prime Ministeraposs official spokesman said on Friday there were no plans to go beyond what weaposve set out already.But Omicron could change things, and Health Secretary Sajid Javid is under pressure to bring in more stringent measures before Christmas.Further measures could include hospitality check-ins, tougher isolation rules, face masks in all indoor venues and further vaccine passport rules.

Let’s assume the officer found groups of ying sizes, including one room with - people, participating in a Christmas quiz, with alcohol, which led to drinks later and mingling between offices. On  December , London was in Tier . Under paragraph  of Schedule  to the “All Tiers” regulations, no person could participate in a gathering indoors of two or more people. The officer would have considered possible exceptions. The first relevant one is a “permitted organised gathering”, under paragraph . But that could only workpeople participated alone or in household groups. That doesn’t seem to apply here. The second is that the gathering was “reasonably necessary for work” under paragraph . Maybe the civil servants would say that they needed the quiz for morale, or had to stay at work to run the government.  The officer might think: well, what is “reasonably necessary” for an office is a bit subjective. But the government told us exactly what they thought was “reasonably necessary for work” – their own guidance at the time said “you must not have a work Christmas lunch or party, where that is a primarily social activity”. So that seems to exclude the work exception. The final question is whether No.  was somehow exempt from the Covid regulations. Lawyers have been debating this. I’m not convinced. I think the “crown property” exemption was about government buildings, not people. And I doubt that people could say they were doing their duties as crown servants and therefore exemptthey were doing things which the government had advised everyone not to do – and which broke the law. As for the Prime Minister – he appears to have been taking part in a social gathering indoors of more than one person, so may well have breached the regulations too.

Some staff who worked on the  autumn spending review had office drinks while England was under lockdown restrictions.It comes as Boris Johnson battles mounting revelations of rule-breaking festivities in Downing Street in the run-up to last Christmas.The Times reported that around two dozen civil servants were present for the drinks on November , .

The Treasury did not organise an in-person departmental party last Christmas.  “They’d all been working really hard,” a source told the Times. “They had to be in the office anyway that day. It wasn’t a formal party but perhaps in hindsight it wasn’t the most sensible thing to do.” At the time non-essential shops, leisure and entertainment venues were closed as well as pubs, bars and restaurants, and people were urged to stay at home except for limited reasons including workit could not be done from home.The Times said Chancellor Rishi Sunak was not at the event and that it is understood he was not aware of it at the time.Downing Street said it has cancelled any plans to hold a Christmas party this year.

Susan Forde, will marry partner, Rob, in just over a weekaposs time and had been looking forward to the big day after it being repeatedly pushed back because of the pandemic. But she and her partner have been left distraught after scaffolding was erected around the Church of St Mary Magdelene in Melton, Leicestershire, ruining the couple’s picturesque location.“I never thought I would get married, but I met Rob and that all changed,” Susan told Leicestershire Live.“I’m a believer in God and want to get married in a church. I have been to Stapleford Hall a lot over the last  years and just fell in love with it. This was the only place I could imagine getting married at.  “When you’ve invested so much time and emotion into this over so many years, it’s upsetting that my dream has been ruined.” The appearance of the scaffolding and associated works came at short notice and has left the couple from Oadby angry at those in charge of the church and Stapleford Hall. After investing thousands in their wedding and delaying it multiple times, they say they’ve been badly let down. Rob said: “We had paid so much over the years, money which has gone into the upkeep of the place and this is what we get in   “It’s disgraceful.”  “I’m angry they’ve behaved like this,” said Susan. “Why couldn’t they hold back until after our wedding  It would have been just a matter of days, that’s all.” The Churches Conservation Trust, which owns the Church of St Mary Magdalene, said the scaffolding was needed out of urgency.A spokesman said: “As a charity, we have been fortunate to receive a grant from the Government’s Heritage Stimulus Fund to carry out urgent repair work to the tower pinnacles and parapets of the west tower, which has become heavily fractured due to weather erosion and unstable,“This funding opportunity is time-limited, and we are obliged to carry out the repair works as soon as possible. “We are very sorry for the distress caused by the appearance of scaffolding at the church. We realise the huge impact this must have had on the iniduals involved and for this, we are very sorry.” Stapleford Hall was keen to point out how urgent the works were. A spokesman added: “As the work was deemed as essential emergency repairs, Stapleford Park is pleased that this amazing church is being safeguarded for the future. “We sympathise greatly for the couple and can confirm that no element of the wedding ceremony or reception has been affected due to the nature of the works to the exterior of the church.” With so much changing so quickly, keep on top of what is happening with the Mirroraposs news updates by email.

It’s a major part of our day,” said Susan. “There’s a picture of the church on our order of service. We’ve got people coming from Ireland and Leeds for the day and all of them want to see the church.” “This isn’t going to be the same. It’s so disappointing.” “We’ve been treated shoddily and are not happy,” said Rob. “We believe more could have been done to avoid this happening.” The Churches Trust said they did everything they could. A spokesman said “We were in touch with the Stapleford Estate as soon as we were aware of the works needing to take place at the church to enable them to liaise with the couples and we offered options of rescheduling or refunds. “In the meantime, our contractors are doing what they can to make the church as presentable as possible despite the scaffolding.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON LoveMarriageWeddings\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The NHS is reportedly planning to roll out jabs to children as young as fivethe plan is approved by regulators.According to leaked documents, parental consent will be needed for kids aged between  and -years-old, and the environment in which they receive their jabs will need to be appropriate. Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi did not rule out the move, saying that there was no plan at the moment to extend the jabs rollout to younger children. There have already been reports of cases of the new Omicron iant in schools, including one in Kent. Over the summer, SAGE experts warned that children were driving adult infections around the country.  In September, NHS England began rolling out vaccines for children aged between  and -years-old.Now, health officials could go even further and offer jabs to younger kids, with a decision likely to be made in the coming weeks, according to The Sunday Times.The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agencyis expected to announce that jabs are safe for children, while the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisationis examining whether to recommend vaccines for kids. Mr Zahawi said the JCVI is still looking at the evidence as to what level of protection Covid- vaccines would offer primary school children. He told Sky Newsapos Trevor Phillips On Sunday: There is no plan at the moment to vaccinate primary school children for the reason that the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisationis still looking at the evidence as to what level of protection it would offer those children.  He added: The most important thing is to boost the most vulnerable - that is absolutely the priority. Mr Zahawi said he would do everything in my power to keep schools open - but could not rule out future closures. Asked to rule it out, he told the Andrew Marr Show: We are absolutely working to make sure that all schools are open, that theyaposre protected. I will do everything in my power. We are still learning about this iant. We know that a booster works. Get boosted, protect yourself, protect your community and letaposs get through this and transition this from pandemic to endemic. Under existing rules, vaccines are administered by the school immunisation service, with heads responsible for ensuring parents and children get information leaflets, consent forms and invitation letters. Parents are asked to give consent, although some older children are able to overrule their parentsthey are deemed competent to make their own decisions. This is unlikely to occur in very young children. Earlier this week, Professor John Edmunds, a member of Sage, called for jabs to be rolled out to five to -year-olds as soon as a licence is given. He said: This wave of the epidemic that we’ve had since June — the Delta wave — has been driven really by school-age children. Every child who is infected will expose an adult. They all live at home with adults. So from that, transmission can occur. The European Medicines Agencyapproved the use of the Pfizer vaccine for children aged - in May and for children aged five to  in November. An MHRA spokesperson said: Pfizer has stated that they are applying to the MHRA for an extension to their Covid- vaccine authorisation that would allow use in five to -year-olds. Further details on the timing of this submission would be for Pfizer to provide. We are committed to providing safe, timely access to treatment for UK patients, and will continue to prioritise our Covid- evaluations. This includes any decision on use in under-s. Any such decision would be subject to our robust regulatory standards. In the meantime, we are looking at the data from other countries to ensure that when an application is received, we are making the best decision for children in the UK. Due to the fast spread of the new Omicron iant, booster jabs will be available to millions more people in England this week.The national booking system will open to everyone aged  to  from Monday so they can make appointments to get a booster three months on from their second coronavirus jab.The move comes amid concerns the UK is facing a major wave of infections in January, with scientists warning up to , people could die of Covid- in the next five monthsfurther restrictions are not introduced. Experts from the London School of Hygiene  Tropical Medicinesaid tougher measures may be needed to prevent Omicron from causing a high number of hospitalisations and deaths.The scientists, who advise the government, said the new Covid- strain could cause between , to , deaths in England over the next five months.

People can make their booking two months on from their second dose - a month in advance of becoming eligible to receive the jab.  There are around . million people aged  to , and . million of those are eligible from Monday. Dr Emily Lawson, head of the NHS Covid- vaccination programme, said: Following the updated guidance from the JCVI, which shortened the interval between second and booster doses, NHS staff are redoubling their efforts to protect the public from the virus. The NHS vaccination programme, the biggest and most successful in health service history, will from tomorrow offer top-up jabs to everyone aged  and over three months from their second jab.

Anecdotal reports follow a large outbreak of the Covid iant in the UK.The Centers for Disease Control and Preventionhas been part of a concerted effort to understand Omicron after it was classied as a iant of concern by the World Health Organisation last month, WalesOnline reports. The strain spreads far faster than previous iants, although so far few hospitalisations have been reported.In itsMorbidity and Mortality Weekly Report , researchers at the CDC have put forward a preliminary symptom profile for Omicron.The report states that a cough is the most common symptom, afflicting  percent of those infected. The authors of the CDC wrote: “Many of the first reported cases of Omicron iant infection appear to be mild, although as with all iants, a lag exists between infection and more severe outcomes.” “Symptoms would be expected to be milder in vaccinated persons and those with previous SARS-CoV- infection than in unvaccinated persons.  “Characteristics of the cases described in this report might also not be generalisable because case findings might be associated with inidual characteristics. The details of the report draw on the cases of  infections attributed to the Omicron strains. Only seven percent of subjects presented with ‘asymptomatic’ infection or ‘unknown’ symptoms, with  percent of cases deemed symptomatic. “Evenmost infections are mild, a highly transmissible iant could result in enough cases to overwhelm health systems,” wrote the authors where in the report. The report lists cough , fatigueand congestion or runny noseas the three most common symptoms. Shortness of breath , diarrhoeaand loss of taste or smellall featured at the bottom of the CDC’s list.

Chanting aposWe love you Arthur, we doapos, the caring Birmingham City supporters united in their mission to make sure the six-year-old was remembered by all. Fans got together at the Bullring Tavern from noon, then began their march at .pm, laying a wreath and other tributes along the .-mile route to the match against Cardf City, reports Birmingham Live. Posters and hoardings were put up along the route from Digbeth to St Andrewaposs saying Gone But Never to be Forgotten.  There were blue and white balloons and blue smoke poured into the air in a touching celebration of a le cut way too short. Cardf City fans clapped Blues fans as they arrived at St Andrewaposs, where floral tributes and teddies were laid for the little boy. Arthur was tragically murdered by his stepmother Emma Tustin, who routinely beat, isolated, starved and force fed him salt laced meals.  He was also made to stand for up to  hours a day at their home. She is serving at least  years in jail while his father, Thomas Hughes, , was handed a -year term for manslaughter. Birmingham City Football Club produced a special match day programme in memory of young Arthur. For every copy sold on December , the club will donate £ to a local children’s charity.  Fans and well-wishers also took to social media posting their messages of love for the little boy after a heartbreaking video was shared in court where Arthur could be heard sobbing aposnobody loves me.apos Birmingham City supporters posted photos of the hoardings and posters lining the streets of the route, saying: A Little tribute to Arthur. Lot of frantic effort but well worth it. GONE BUT NEVER TO BE FORGOTTEN. Brilliant work by those that made this possible.  Birmingham City bosses have also renamed their family zone Arthuraposs Area, which has gone down well with fans. Chris O’Brien tweeted: “Well done Blues. The Peoples Club. Arthur will always be part of the Blues family. Wish he could see all this love he has had and will have.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Football fans\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The display, which s every December, is expected to peak some time during the night of December  and will be visible into the early morning of December . Meteors are pieces of debris that enter Earthaposs atmosphere at speeds of up to km per second, vaporising and causing the streaks of light we call meteors. Geminids are very bright, moderately fast, and are unusual in being multi-coloured. They are mainly white, some yellow and a few green, red and blue, partly caused by the presence of traces of metals like sodium and calcium - the same elements that are used to make fireworks colourful.  The shower is known to produce more than  meteors an hour at its peak, although light pollution and other factors mean that in reality the actual number visible is far fewer. The source of the shooting stars is a stream of debris left behind by the asteroid  Phaethon, making this one of the only major showers not to originate from a comet.  Skygazers will be able to see the display with the naked eye so there is no need for binoculars or a telescope. It is best not to look directly at the radiant as this can limit the number of meteors people can see. Instead, people should look just to the side in a dark area of sky for a better chance of seeing the display.

In , in line with lockdown restrictions, they were forced to spend the day apart without their usual royal routines.If restrictions allow, The Firm will head to Sandringham later this month to join the Queen for her first Christmas without her beloved husband, Prince Philip.If they do, itaposs likely theyaposll all join together to attend the morning service at St Mary Magdalene - chatting to well-wishers afterwards. Prince George and Princess Charlotte joined their family for the church service for the first time in , stealing the show as they mingled crowds. However mum Kate admitted she had a huge regret from the special day - her outfit choice. Kate colour coordinated the familyaposs outfits as normal, matching her green accessories to her daughteraposs smart coat. While fans around the world loved their style, it turns out that Kate really regretted her outfit choice for the day, and even told one well-wisher she really shouldnapost have worn it. She looked gorgeous in a heavy grey Catherine Walker coat, with a green hat, bag and heels.But during a quick chat with -year-old fan Rachel Anvil, she admitted it was the wrong choice for the weather. Rachelaposs mother told the: Kate was talking to my daughter about clothes and how she was feeling too hot, she said aposI really shouldn’t have worn thisapos.I’m there talking to Charlotte about dolls and my daughter’s talking about fashion with Kate. It wasn’t fake it was a genuine discussion, it was about a minute but it was tailored to my daughter, it was like speaking to a friend. They are totally dferent with the public. Charlotte charmed well-wishers at the church service, chatting and smiling at her mumaposs side. She also stopped to hug Gemma Clark, who has cerebral palsy, in her wheelchair while holding a pink flamingo. The -year-old had travelled from Long Sutton in Lincolnshire with her family. She said: “It was amazing. I’ve been waiting for this day for a long time. I’ve never seen the Royal Family before. She gave Kate some roses and Charlotte an inflatable flamingo and said she seemed pleased with the gt. “She said aposThank youapos, Ms Clark said, adding that the flamingo was called Felicity. “But Charlotte may call it whatever she likes now.” “It was a birthday present,” she explained. My sister bought me it for my birthday and I truthfully didnapost like it but we have adventures with her.” She said George and Charlotte were “brilliant”, adding: “This is my first time at Sandringham and I would love to do it again.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Prince GeorgeKate Middleton, Duchess of CambridgePrincess CharlotteRoyal FamilyCerebral palsyAccessories\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

He said winning the case at a civil court last month was perfect revision for his undergraduate law degreeJack Simm has won his first court case while still at university Image: Jack Simm   SWNSByBen TurnerChiara FiorilloNews Reporter:,  Dec | comments A law student has used his revision textbooks to sue his landlord over his unfit university halls, winning his first-ever court case at the age of .Jack Simm sued his landlord for an alleged breach of contract over his flat being like a construction site when he first moved in September . The undergraduate student, who was then a fresher and is now in his second year at the University of East Anglia , spent a year fighting the case and has now won. He said winning the case at a civil court last month was perfect revision for his law degree. Before his one-hour hearing, Jack referred to statutes and case law that he had learnt in his studies to build a -page legal claim for a refund on his deposit and first monthaposs rent - amounting to £. Jack successfully sued the company behind Velocity Student accommodation for breach of contract following a string of problems with the accommodation.  The student, who is also a rugby player at the university, said: Itaposs the best bit of revision Iaposve ever done. Funnily enough while the case was going on I was studying contract law so I flipped open the textbook and went over the notes.I was in a real situation with real consequences. I was thrown into the deep end.Winning shows that I can do it. Itaposs given me a massive confidence boost.Jack argued that his landlord was in breach of contract as the first-year accommodation in Norwich, Norfolk was not fit to be lived in. He claimed there was no heating or Wi-Fi, dust everywhere and builders still working in the accommodation, which Jack did not visit before arriving as he joined UEA through clearing just days before the start of term.  Jack left the halls and stopped paying his rent after just a week as the landlord didnapost recty the issues - and then started building his legal case. The undergrad from Newcastle said: We drove down and arrived at this place and it looked more like a construction site than a place to live. In my room the floor was covered in dust and there were loud noises from people hammering away. It was freezing at night with no heating. A smell was coming out of nowhere. We gave the landlord a week to sort everything out and at the end nothing had been resolved so I moved out and handed my keys in. Jack added: Other people are more lenient and they just get taken through the long grass [by complaining]. I thought aposIaposm not being taken for a fool.apos The most taxing part was making sure the case was tight. I kept tweaking the case right up until the court date. On November , Newcastle County Court ruled in Jackaposs favour and ordered that he be paid £ to cover his deposit and first monthaposs rent. The court also ordered the landlords to pay £ in court fees. The accommodation was developed by the Freedman Project LLP and managed by a company called Estateducation. The respondent in the case was Freedman Project LLP - landlord for the purpose-built student accommodation at , Velocity Student - , St. Mildreds Road.Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON University of East AngliaEducationCourt case\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

It was reported that Meghan bought the Queen a singing hamster, which led the monarch to burst out laughing, remarking: It can keep my dogs company. Meanwhile, not only did Meghan impress the Queen during her first Christmas at Sandringham, she also impressed her future brother-in-law, Prince William, with her gt choices.  According to the biography Finding Freedom, she nailed his gt - a spoon with the words aposCereal Killerapos on it. The authors wrote: Meghanaposs biggest challenge was finding the perfect novelty gts to amuse her new extended family. At least one of her gts was a huge hit—a spoon for William that had aposcereal killerapos embossed on the shallow bowl end of the utensil.

Like Meghan, the Duchess of Cambridge was no doubt similarly nervous to Meghan when she spent her first Christmas at Sandringham in . However, rather than hitting the High Street or furiously searching online for a gt for the Queen, Kate came up with an idea for a more personal homemade present - and it appears it went down very well with Her Majesty. Speaking in a documentary to mark the Queenaposs th birthday, Kate revealed what the thoughtful gt was. She explained: I can remember being at Sandringham, for the first time, at Christmas. And I was worried what to give the Queen as her Christmas present. I thought back to what I would give my own grandparents. And I thought, aposIaposll make her something,apos which could have gone horribly wrong. But I decided to make my grannyaposs recipe for chutney. I was slightly worried about it, but I noticed the next day that it was on the table. “I think such a simple gesture went such a long way for me and Iaposve noticed since sheaposs done that on lots of occasions and I think it just shows her thoughtfulness, really, and her care in looking after everybody.

After months of lockdowns and uncertainty, millions of families were unable to celebrate with their loved ones.That’s why the Sunday People decided this year to lighten the load for one lucky family with a prize giveaway worth over £,, including everything for the perfect Christmas – from a scrumptious dinner to amazing gts.And out of the thousands who got in touch, Emma French, , was chosen as the winner. The mum of two was overjoyed at the news after enduring the same struggles many families have faced in the pandemic. Administrator Emma says: “During the first lockdown I was working from home. My husband Darren was furloughed and took on the role of teacher. “It was stressful but we weren’t the only ones, obviously.” Like countless others, plans to see her extended family over Christmas fell through.  Emma, of Norwich, says: “My sister lives up north and was coming down. Then at the last minute it wasn’t allowed. It was heartbreaking.” That wasn’t the only heartbreak the family faced last year. When Emma’s uncle in Scotland died of leukaemia in the summer, the pandemic put further strain on the loss. Emma says: “He was locked down for his entire illness, then when he passed away we weren’t allowed to go to his funeral. It’s just a build up of woe isn’t it ” Darren, a printer, was also one of Britain’s grafters who had to deal with the precariousness of furlough. Emma says: “It was obviously a pay cut, and his work weren’t topping it up. “It was quite dficult.”  Emma avoided furlough but had to work from home. The family living room became both her office and a classroom to daughters Amelia, , and seven-year-old Matilda. Like many parents, Emma’s experience of teaching while trying to work proved a challenge. She admits: “It was horrible. They’re in dferent years so had dferent sets of homework and dferent online classes.” But learning she had won our giveaway has been the icing on this year’s cake. And no one is more excited than Amelia and Matilda. Emma says: “I haven’t said what’s coming, they just know there’s some treats for them. “It’s like a weight has lted. We were panicking because we haven’t bought food or anything. “We were planning on some kind of Christmas miracle. “We’re really, really chuffed, and the girls are so excited.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Sunday PeopleLeukaemiaChristmasCoronavirus lockdownSunday People Christmas appeal\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Join the Secret Elves for celebration inspiration - and brilliant gt ideas and reviewsSpread the cheer!Invalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The Duke of Sussex made the disclosure in an emotional letter to the family of a fallen comrade, who are fighting to have their son’s name on the national Armed Forces Memorial.The parents of decorated soldier Nathan Hunt had turned in ­desperation to the Duke of Sussex to get their son the lasting honour.Nathan served with Harry in Afghanistan in  but took his own le in  after suffering from severe mental health problems thought to be linked to his military service. In an official letter bearing his ­distinctive logo, Harry said he wishes he could help... “had I been in the same role I once was”.  Although Nathan was a serving warrant officer when he died, defence chiefs have ruled that his name should not be added to the memorial.The family told the Sunday People that Harry’s letter begins by thanking the family for writing to him and sharing what they were trying to achieve in memorialising Nathan’s le.They said Harry then writes that it was an honour to serve alongside many exceptional men and women, and that he was proud to have met Nathan as one of them. Harry adds: “I deeply empathise with what your family is going through and so wish I could assist formally, had I been in the same role I once was.” Before stepping down as a working royal and moving to Calornia with we Meghan, Harry was Captain General of the Royal Marines. After  years in the Army he launched the Invictus Games in , an international sporting event for ­injured personnel and veterans. The prince took part in expeditions with the Walking with the Wounded charity and followed in his mother’s footsteps by becoming a patron to the Halo Trust charity, which helps clear landmines. Last February it was announced that he would give up his position with the Royal Marines along with other honorary military titles. But he remains patron of Invictus and other good causes – and his public support for war-damaged veterans has resonated with many survivors of the Iraq and Afghan conflicts.  The family says Harry told them Nathan’s dedication and service is “indelible” and that he will forever remember Nathan as a hero. They say he wrote: “Grief can be a long and burdensome road. “Please know you and your family remain in my thoughts.”Derek Hunt, , and we Maria, , wrote to Harry last month explaining that the Ministry of Defence had twice refused to add Nathan’s name to the memorial in Staffordshire, despite his record for bravery.Harry and Meghan met the Hunts in  during a ceremony to mark the th anniversary of the First World War.  Harry hugged Maria at the event and he and Meghan said how sorry they were to lean of Nathan’s death.Derek, from Lincoln, told how he was deeply moved by Prince Harry ’s letter.He said: “I think the letter shows how much Harry cared about Nathan. He described Nathan as a hero and I think he is very sympathetic to our cause of trying to get Nathan’s name on the memorial. “I didn’t expect a response but after the article appeared in the Sunday People and we sent a letter, someone from his office contacted us and said that Harry would be responding. “I know he has had a tough time in the UK but I don’t care about any of that. You can see from the letter that Harry still cares about the armed forces andhe was able to he would use his influence to help get Nathan’s name on the memorial.” Colonel Richard Kemp, a former infantry commander, added: “Most retired soldiers and officers never forget their service and those they served alongside and will often do whatever they can to help each other after they have left the forces. “Prince Harry is no exception, as this letter shows. Harry deployed on two tours in Afghanistan and fought to do so against great pressure from the Government and resistance from within his own family. For this and his hard work for wounded soldiers – including creating the Invictus Games – he was deeply respected and admired by servicemen and veterans.” Nathan served alongside Harry in  in Helmand as part of a bomb search team in a desert reconnaissance unit while attached to the prince’s Household Cavalry regiment. He was a Royal Engineers Warrant Officer when he died aged . He was found hanged at home in Lincoln on January , . His parents insist Nathan should be included on the memorial, alongside , killed in action or from disease since the end of the Second World War.  Derek said: “Nathan risked his le almost every day in Afghanistan and his actions saved the lives of many soldiers. But it took a toll. He was mentally wounded and those wounds took his le. He was a casualty of war. “The very least the Ministry of Defence could do would be to add his name. Prince Harry appreciated the sacrice Nathan made, it’s just a shame that the MoD can’t do the same. I can’t understand why they are being so heartless. “I don’t want Nathan to be forgotten. I want his daughter to be able to visit the wall, see his name and say, ‘That’s my daddy’.” The names of three other soldiers who served in Afghanistan and died after taking their own lives are on the memorial in Staffordshire. A psychiatric report produced after Nathan died said he had experienced “traumatic exposure” in Afghanistan and had “some elements of PTSD.”  But defence chiefs have ruled that “on the balance of probabilities’ Nathan’s mental health and subsequent death was not linked to his  years of military service. During his six months in Afghanistan the soldier received a Mention in Dispatches. The citation for his award described him as “a superb example of leadership, professionalism and a fantastic ambassador to his corps.” The MoD said: “Every suicide is a tragedy and deeply felt within the defence community. Our thoughts remain with the family and friends of WO Nathan Hunt. “Careful consideration is given to each case and the decision not to include WO Hunt’s name on the Armed Forces Memorial does not detract from his service in the Army.” It added: “We are eternally grateful for his service.” Hero braved bombs peril When he served with Harry in , Nathan had one of the most dangerous jobs in the Army. His role was to search for home-made Taliban roadside bombs in Helmand. One wrong move could have resulted in death or serious injury. Then a Lance Sergeant, Nathan always insisted that he should be the main searcher because of his experience, even though others in his team were also trained to detect bombs.  During his six months in Afghanistan he found numerous homemade devices and carried out searches of roads and tracks while being watched and occasionally attacked by the Taliban. The citation for his Mention In Dispatches, reads: “Lance Sgt Hunt has shown exemplary behaviour and a very good example to all. “He demonstrates selfless commitment time and again, putting himself at greater risk to provide the security for the squadron in the face of a very lethal and hidden enemy.” During his  years of Army service, Nathan, a married father of one daughter, also completed tours of Iraq, Northern Ireland and Kosovo.  taken their lives since  Up to  soldiers and veterans are believed to have taken their own lives since . In reality the number of deaths is probably higher because no government body officially records the grim toll. That means no one knows why so many have killed themselves. Many of those who died were suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder and had been medically discharged from the Army after serving in Iraq and Afghanistan. Other veterans developed mental health conditions such as depression and severe anxiety.  Soldiers who served with distinction on the front line struggled to cope with le on civvy street. Many lost their jobs, watched their marriages crumble and turned to drink. It is not surprising that the regiments which suffered the highest casualties in Afghanistan – such as the Rles – also have the highest rates of suicide amongst veterans. The Sunday People began its Save Our Soldiers Campaign when it became clear that veterans with mental health problems were being failed by the Government. Although the access to mental health support for veterans has improved, the number of suicides continues to rise. So far this year at least  have died.  Former Army Warrant Officer Jim Wilde, a founder of Veterans United Against Suicide, said much more needs to be done to reduce suicide rates amongst veterans. He said: “There have been at least  deaths this year but the real number is probably far higher. Many were veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars and went on to develop mental health issues. “The fact that the MoD has no idea how many veterans are taking their lives every year is shameful. “Once the size of the problem is known people can set about trying to find a solution. Until then many more members of the military community will take their own lives. “Sadly, this is a time of year when our losses increase due to a sense of isolation many veterans feel.” *If youaposre struggling and need to talk, the Samaritans operate a free helpline open   on  .

Andrew is understood to have had “little or no discussion” with the Queen, Prince Charles or Prince William – despite Her Majesty paying his hefty legal fees. Sources say the Duke of York has been “less than forthcoming” over how he will battle allegations from Virginia Giuffre. Insiders suggest preparations have been coloured by reported infighting between Andrew’s UK solicitor Gary Bloxsome and his newly hired Hollywood hotshot lawyer Andrew Brettler, due to a “severe clash in personalities”. The Duke is accused of sexually assaulting Ms Giuffre on three occasions in , when she was allegedly trafficked by the late Jeffrey Epstein.  The claims come as the trial of his alleged fixer Ghislaine Maxwell continues in New York. Virginia, , is suing for damages in a separate action in the US. The Duke, , has always strongly denied any wrongdoing and vehemently denies the claims. He said in a  BBC interview: “I can absolutelycategorically tell you it never happened.” Andrew’s team must deliver final submissions on Monday. A judge will rule whether a trial is held. One impeccably placed source said: “Everyone from the very top has been left in the dark. The fact there has been little or no discussion with senior members of the family is just mind-boggling.” Buckingham Palace had no comment.

Caitlin Platts, whoaposs currently in supported living accommodation in Middlewich, Cheshire, has spent most of the last two or three years moving around hostels or living on the streets. The -year-old, who grew up in foster care, said she went aposoff the railsapos after turning  and began using drugs - mainly cocaine as well as amphetamines and ketamine - which left her aposfinancially ruinedapos. She has now been clean for the last few months and has been offered a council flat in Nantwich after months of bidding via the Cheshire Homechoice social housing service.After being unable to afford utensils and furniture, Caitlinaposs friend Ella Blake put out an appeal for help on a Community Facebook group, askinganyone had any spare items like pots or pans, Cheshire Live reports.But the response was beyond what Ella expected, with people donating a television, kitchen furniture, a wardrobe, bedside drawers and curtains as well as Christmas cards and presents.  The scale of the communityaposs kindness has overwhelmed Caitlin, who initially didnapost even realised Ella had written the post. She said: I was really amazed, I didnapost expect anything like this, I really didnapost. I was just thinking Iaposd be moving into a flat with nothing in it. Iaposm just so, so thankful for what everyone has done. It has given me a bit of hope in people. No-one has ever done this much for me in my entire le. Ella, who works as a carer, said theyaposd been friends for a couple of years and spotted she was moving near where she lived in Nantwich when Caitlin posted the news on Facebook. Ella initially searched Facebook Marketplace before she had the idea of seeking help on the Nantwich Community page. The -year-old said: I donapost think she even knows the extent of how kind people have been. Theyaposve sent her Christmas presents, perfumes, toiletries, a massive TV and kitchen furniture. Sheaposs been on a bit of a journey without a doubt. Hopefully all the trouble and turmoil is coming to end. I think everyone just wanted to give her a bit of a fighting chance. Caitlin has lived a tough le up until this point, growing up in Derbyshire with her mum, dad and three siblings. Her parents struggled with drugs themselves and when Caitlin was seven, social services took the children into care.  My mum and dad were heavy drug users and Iaposve got three other siblings. I donapost think they could cope, especially with being younger parents as well, Caitlin said. We just ended up getting put in care. My mum had no choice. One day we had social workers at the door. We had to pack our stuff and go within an hour. That was it, I didnapost know where we were going. She spent the rest of her childhood in childrenaposs homes, getting aposmoved aroundapos a lot, while she attended school and college. At , she moved into Cotswold House in Winsford - a supported accommodation for homeless people - as she had nowhere  to go. But when she turned  she started struggling with drug abuse and spent a lot of her time living on the streets, including around the Crewe area. When I was  I just went off the rails. I think, because social services werenapost involved anymore, I just felt like I could do what I want, she said. Caitlin eventually ended up at The Limes in Middlewich where she is currently getting help with her drug issues. She is due to sign for her new flat on Monday , said she is looking forward to the next stage of her le. Iaposm just really excited because Iaposve never had my own tenancy before. Obviously Iaposm not going to get as much help as I do here with managing my own tenancy but I think Iaposll get the gist of it, she said. Sheaposs hoping to find employment through the Job Centre as soon as she can and will continue to receive drug rehabilitation treatment. Ella said many of the items given by the community are being stored in her lounge, which she described as currently looking like an aposunderground IKEAapos. She said: Itaposs nice to see that no-one is judging anyone for the circumstances theyaposre in. Instead of putting people down, theyaposre getting behind them and helping out. Nantwich is a wonderful town for the sense of community and the way everyone has really come together for a complete stranger is amazing. It is certainly humbling without a doubt. With everything going on in the world, the fact that the community still works together like this is incredible.

Large parts of the country will see the mercury get as high as C on Sunday, thanks to a blast of sub-tropical air coming up from Europe.The warmest weather will be in the south east and south west of England, dropping as low as C in the north of the country and into Scotland. And despite the milder t emperatures today, there are two Met Office warnings in place for the very north of the country until Monday. The first warns of potentially dangerous winds hitting northern parts of Scotland from pm on Sunday until am the next day, with a large area subject to a second warning between midnight and noon tomorrow.

To the south though, across England and Wales skies tend to brighten and there will be some sunny spells developing, with  or  degrees in many places - well above average for the time of year.

Night sweats are when you sweat so much that your night clothes and bedding are soaking wet.At a briefing convened by South Africaaposs Department of Health, GP Unben Pillay listed the symptoms that Omicron patients were reporting, ChronicleLive reports. The GP said that he is also seeing patients with the iant presenting with a dry cough, fever, fatigue, and a lot of body pains. He suggested that vaccinated people tend to do much better.The UKHSA has also said it believes the booster Covid jab is essential in protecting against Omicron, though it is too early for certainty as to how the vaccines work against it.However, there are many encouraging signs that the current vaccines will provide some protection against the new strain of the virus.  Early data suggests booster jabs against Covid- do provide an extra layer of protection against the illness. If the iant does undermine vaccine performance, extra protection against the virus might require four or more jabs, possibly with new vaccine formulations — sharpening questions over whether boosting will need to continue indefinitely, states an article published in the journal Nature. The Omicron iant has also further clouded forecasts of how booster campaigns will affect the pandemic’s trajectory.The new Omicron iant of coronavirus is continuing to spread across the UK with cases recorded in the North East. The World Health Organisationhas declared Omicron a iant of concern and Prime Minister Boris Johnson has imposed new measures this week to curb the spread.Face masks will be compulsory in many indoor venues, working-from-home advice has ed and a NHS Covid pass will be needed to get in to nightclubs and venues.It comes as cases of the Omicron Covid iant have been confirmed in Northumberland, Newcastle and Middlesbrough.According to figures released on Friday evening, there were three cases recorded in Northumberland, two in Newcastle and one in Middlesbrough - all based on positive tests from the week ending November .UK Health Security Agency- which released the data - said it expects there to have been more than one million cases of the new iant in the UK by the end of December, and for Omicron to be the dominant strain of Covid within a fortnight.Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Boris JohnsonNHSWorld Health OrganisationDepartment of HealthPoliticsCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The sole earner in the family is Mark, who gets £, every four weeks from his job at a Co-op store. Last month, however, the family did not receive their Universal Credit payment as, according to the Department for Work and Pensionsassessment period, it resulted that Mark was paid twice in a month.Due to the issue, they will get no payment between October  and December , Wales Online reports. Since Cardf Council uses the same system as the DWP to monitor wages, their council tax has also gone up. Lynette, , said: We feel very upset and very anxious. Itaposs not helping our mental health. I dread the post coming. Weaposve really struggled in the last couple of weeks. Weaposve managed to pay the bills but everything  has been a struggle day by day. The DWP and the council said a householdaposs Universal Credit payments and council tax y from month to month depending on earnings. Lynette added: Our first Universal Credit payment was in July. Itaposs around £ a month, but because my husband gets paid every four weeks and Universal Credit is monthly, the DWP claimed he was paid twice last month. One of my husbandaposs wage payments was October  and the next was on November . They were both put together and the implication was that he was actually getting £, a month. I tried contacting the DWP but they said there was nothing they could do. It was such a shock. Weaposre getting kicked in the teeth left, right and centre. The DWP didnapost even tell us [initially]. I had to check the payment on November  and it said we were not getting anything that month. In a panic I rang the DWP to be told we wouldnapost be getting anything for November.  The family usually benefits from a council tax reduction but Cardf Council upped the rate from £ to £ a month after Mark was judged to have had an increase in earnings last month, even though he received the usual four-weekly amount. Lynette said she applied for the council tax benefit to be reinstated next month. The family also said they feel under pressure because Lynetteaposs mum had to go into a nursing home due to dementia and the council said they will have to move house as the tenancy is in her mumaposs name. Lynette was told she cannot take over the tenancy as it was already taken over when her father died and it passed to her mother - and the law states this cannot happen more than once. The woman said: Weaposre not living. Weaposre existing day by day, waiting to know when and where we have to move. My husband works in Fairwater, and this area is all myself and my daughter have ever known, but weaposre told we could be moved anywhere in Cardf. It seems as soon as we get over one hurdle thereaposs another. A DWP spokesperson said: Universal Credit adjusts to a household’s earnings to ensure people receive the right level of support. Mr Davies received more than £, in wages during the couple’s last assessment period and, as a result, their payment was reduced. ButMr Davies earns less over the next month then the couple will see an increase in their next payment. A council spokesperson said: Eligibility for a council tax reduction is assessed on income received each month and the amount of reduction applied to a household’s account can y from month to month depending on earnings received. So, a household expecting their income to decrease one month, can expect the amount of council tax reduction they are eligible for to increase. The council’s money advice team is available to help residents experiencing money problems and can offer advice with budgeting, income maximisation, claiming grants and discounts as well as practical support. The Mirror has contacted Cardf Council for further comment.

The head of a London hospital said staff are worn out and quite frightenedStaff are traumatised and worn out, hospital chiefs have warned Image: PAByChiara FiorilloNews ReporterRod Minchin:,  Dec | commentsOver-stretched and traumatised nurses are refusing to be redeployed to Covid wards, hospital bosses around the country have warned. After spending months on the frontline of the pandemic, staff have been exposed to trauma and stress, with little psychological support.Now, as the new Omicron strain threatens to put further pressure on the NHS, there are fears that the number of hospitalisations and deaths could rise this winter. Yesterday, scientists from the London School of Hygiene  Tropical Medicinesaid Omicron could cause between , to , deaths in England over the next five monthsfurther restrictions are not introduced.However, a hospital chief from the Midlands said critical care is already at  per cent bed occupancy. He said the hospital was planning to expand into other areas as a contingency plan, but this will not be possible as staff who worked in previous Covid waves are now refusing to be on the frontline again.  He explained: It was voluntary before and now they’re saying no. We are getting people, from a critical care perspective, downing tools. So we can’t expand further.The head of a London NHS hospital told The Sunday Times : I’ve got a lot of staff who have said they’re not going back on to Covid wards and I think you’ve got to pay attention when people are saying that.People are pretty worn out and quite frightened about being redeployed into Covid wards again. They don’t want to go there again. A study carried out by the University of Bath found that staff felt overwhelmed during the pandemic and do not want to go through the same stress again. According to the study, NHS doctors are angry at being treated as Covid cannon fodder rather than heroes.  It is the first research to capture the views of more than , doctors in the UK and Ireland responding to Covid- since early . It has been authored by researchers from the Universities of Bath and Bristol, UWE Bristol and the Royal College of Emergency Medicine and paints a bleak picture of the multiple challenges doctors are facing. Despite working at permanent maximum capacity, the medics told researchers of their frustrations at those not following public health advice, and towards the Government for failing to support them. One senior doctor said: I feel, at times, that I am considered totally expendable and that,I die or become ill, not only will it have been preventable with political will, I will simply be an inconvenient statistic. Iaposm not a Covid hero, Iaposm Covid cannon fodder. A junior doctor said: Knowing the Government was failing in so many ways to support us... failed Test and Trace, failed PPE procurement, weak messaging, permitted non-compliance with mask-wearing and distancing, set a poor example . We as healthcare providers were alone and utterly unsupported, apart from the weekly round of applause that was a pointless gesture and felt like a kick in the teeth.  Jo Daniels, a clinical psychologist who led the research, said nurses have been through trauma with no respite or support. The researcher said: Some of the stories frontline workers told us about for this research are truly devastating: last moments spent trying to set up an iPad in time for a young mother to say goodbye to her children wrestling to intubate agitated patients family members watching loved ones die remotely via video-link. Added to this is the scale - the sheer number of frontline workers for whom these experiences have just become normalised - these results are truly shocking. We are seeing increasing levels of staff attrition, absenteeism, poor psychological health, and loss of le, yet frontline doctors are expected to just carry on. Despite the popular media narrative of healthcare workers being our Covid- heroes, many simply do not feel that way in terms of how they are being supported. Professor Edd Carlton, from the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, said: What is most worrying is that Covid- has compounded issues that were already commonplace pre-pandemic and now are putting a tangible strain on doctorsapos own physical and mental health. As the NHS attempts to recover, this research shows that there needs to be a renewed focus on properly supporting doctors to protect their health and wellbeing so that they can be there for all of us when we most need them. The study, Itaposs Been Ugly: A Large-Scale Qualitative Study Into The Dficulties Frontline Doctors Faced Across Two Waves Of The Covid- Pandemic, is published in the journal International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health.

If they have any of these ailments, they should think about staying home during the festive period. Boris Johnson has not banned Christmas parties this year but people should still be cautious and be aware the coronavirus pandemic is still ongoing.Many of the symptoms are similar to cold-like conditions which people should be on the look out for. Tim Spector, from the Covid Zoe app, said those with cold-like symptoms should work from home and avoid parties at Christmas to curb the spread of coronavirus. He told Times Radio, the UK should be “much more open-minded about who we are testing” and “get more people to isolate at least for a few days with cold-like symptoms”.“At the moment, we’re estimating that somewhere between one and three and one in four colds are actually due to Covid,” he said. “And so that’s quite a high rate of people that are currently not even bothered to get a lateral flow test, or getting a PCR test, going to parties and spreading it around. “Sothat transfers to Omicron then we’re going to be compiling that problem much faster than we would need to.”The Liverpool Echo added: “We want to tell people thatyou don’t feel well that day, don’t go out, don’t go to work, work from home, because the start of that snfle, the start of that sore throat, that headache could be a mild dose of Covid that is just breaking through your vaccine.“So I think everyone needs to be much more aware of a whole range of symptoms and not wait for the loss of smell or taste which may never come, not wait for fever, not wait for that persistent cough.” Many of the ailments are fairly unrecognisable and are similar to a common cold. The symptoms to be aware of include: . A high temperature. This means you feel hot to touch on your chest or back. A new, continuous cough. This means coughing a lot for more than an hour, or three or more coughing episodes in  hours. A loss or change to your sense of smell or taste. This means youaposve noticed you cannot smell or taste anything, or things smell or taste dferent to normal.  . Night sweats when you sweat so much that your night clothes and bedding are soaking wet, even though where you are sleeping is cool. . A blocked or runny nose . A sore throat. Headaches . Muscle aches . Sneezing . Pressure in your ears and face The ten symptoms do not mean you have the virus and could simply be a cold. But people area advised to pick up a lateral flow test or go for a PCR testthey are in any doubt they have the virus, particularly since the Omicron strain which is more infectious.

Wildine Aumoithe, from Miami, Florida, was recently given the Guinness World Record title of the shortest non-mobile woman in the world. The -year-old has the rarest form of dwarfism, known as, SADDAN dysplasia, and her parents were told that she wouldnapost survive  hours after she was born. However, Wildine defied the odds and celebrated her th birthday earlier this year and was recently given the title of the worldaposs shortest woman. She said: It feels amazing to have a Guinness World Record title, I am really proud of it. I am also the first Haitian-American to hold the shortest woman record which makes it even cooler. Despite my condition, I have as much of a normal le as I could. I have never let it hold me back and miss out from doing things in le. My friends have always treated me as though I am the same as them and I have never faced any bullying due to being a little person which I am so grateful for. When my mum, Wilda, was six months pregnant with me the doctors told my parents that I was going to be born with dwarfism. My mum told me that she cried when she heard the diagnosis because she was scared as she didnapost know what dwarfism was and I was her first child. After I was born, at first the doctors thought I had achondroplasia, but after further tests, I was diagnosed with SADDAN dysplasia because of how short I was. SADDAN dysplasia is the rarest form of dwarfism and I wasnapost expected to live past  hours.  After I made it past that, I was even sent to a hospice for the first six months of my le because I wasnapost expected to live. Eventually, Wildine was able to go home with her parents and her mum has been her primary carer ever since. Wildine was able to walk when she was younger, however, she now uses a wheelchair as she has bowed legs and therefore is unable to walk. She said: I can sit on the floor and move around but I canapost walk anymore as since I am getting older, so are my bones. My mum has to help me with all my daily needs. She doesnapost work so that she can be with me all the time to help. This world was not made for short people, this world was built for people who are ft tall and above.  It can be hard sometimes because make a lot of modicationsI want to go and even in my house. Everywhere I go I have to figure out how itaposs going to work for me. In our house, my bed is modied for me, and so are my drawers and a desk for me to work at. I have four wheelchairs that help me get around, but I need help from my mum with my daily needs and to reach things. Wildine has attended school her entire le and is extremely outgoing. She says that she is a social butterfly and makes friends very easily. Wildine added: I am a very confident person and I have a big personality.

When I go out in public I do get stared at a lot and people always ask me why I am so short, but I just tell them that I am a little person and thataposs all there is to it. My friends are really supportive and they look out for me whenever I am with them. They donapost treat me any dferently because of my condition.I have experienced the same thing that everyone  experiences.

She asked how her hair was, and he answered honestly - to him, it was gross, last it smelled, was greasy, and needed washing much more often. The woman was furious at her partneraposs description of her hair, before going on to say that he was just jealous because he was bald. What do you think about the manaposs honesty  Let us know in the comments...Taking to Reddit, the man said: My girlfriend has really long curly hair. Itaposs very pretty but she only washes it once a week. She still showers every day but only washes her hair on Sundays. I think this is very gross. It doesnapost start to look greasy until the last two days and by this time she puts it up when weaposre out in public so you canapost tell, but she wears it down when weaposre home and I donapost like the look of it.

The other day I told her I didnapost like that she doesnapost wash her hair more and that it looks gross. She got offended and told me I didnapost deserve an opinion on her hair because I donapost have any. Soon after sharing his story online, the man was inundated with comments from other Reddit users who said he was in the wrong for complaining. One wrote: Curly hair requires a dferent kind of care than straight hair and washing it too often can damage it. She has obviously worked out a routine that works for her and her curls. You get no say in the matter. Your insecurities about germs are a you problem, not hers. And an oily scalp has nothing to do with germs. Don’t lose your hair over something like this. While another said: It is actually very reasonable to wash your hair infrequently. I have long curly hair, itaposs grown much healthier and fallen out a lot less washing it maybe twice a week. Those oils are good for your hair and scalp. Especiallyshe has curly hair, overwashing can make your hair dull and frizzy.Do you have a story to share  Weaposd love to hear all about it.

The -year-old always had an image in her head of how she wanted to look, and sheaposs spent years achieving her dream appearance.But the dancer, who earns a fortune on OnlyFans each month, hasnapost had the best reaction to her new look, which has resulted in people calling her a demon and caused one person to run away and hide.One pal even told her they thought she looked prettier before. Kierstyn has spent £, on extreme body modications including facial tattoos, fangs, piercings and breast implants She said: “I always knew I wanted to look like this, I have had this vision in my head since I was young and have finally fulfilled it,” Kiersyn, who has over , followers on TikTok . “The way I looked before compared to now, I feel so much happier. “Before I had no self love or even understood who I was, now I feel I understand myself the most and have the most self love and confidence. “When some people see my eyes they stare and point and say nothing, others give me ugly looks, and some will straight up get in my face and say they hate it. “The craziest reactions are from people online hiding behind a screen. “They love to say, ‘you look like a demon’ or ‘you were so much prettier before,’ or ‘you must not have had a good childhood’. “But I also get people who are so sweet and say they love it and want pictures with me. And earlier this year she decided to have her most drastic bit of work done - tattooing her eyeballs. Kiestyen, from Houston, Texas, first became interested in body modications aged  and eventually got inked a year later in . In addition to tattoos, she has also spent around , on fang and breast implants, as well as piercings in her nipple, tongue, both nostrils and bridge of her nose. She said: “My family and friends weren’t surprised about my modications because it’s something I’ve always wanted but they were shocked when I tattooed my eyeballs. “I did it as a way of showing my dference and to see how shocked and offended people can get when they don’t understand something that’s not the norm of society.” Since her first inking aged , Kierstyn has had many more including a complete arm sleeve consisting of ious tributes to her family.  She also has a dream catcher, a geisha girl, scorpion and a complete arm sleeve in black, which she says helped her through periods of suffering body dysmorphia. She said: “In  I got a moth on my throat, a rose dagger on my shoulder and Hebrew writing on my neck. “This year I’ve had a butterfly on my forehead, a dagger with roses on my face, a bat underneath my breasts and my eyes tattooed. “My latest tattoo is on my stomach of butterflies and strawberries to complement the bat. “My favourite tattoo would probably be the butterfly on my head because it was such a bold move. “I’ve never wanted to fit in, Iaposve always been the odd one out.” Kierstyn has no plant to stop anytime soon and is looking to get the other side of her face inked in January . She added: “I’m not sure what I’m going to get yet and the goal is to be fully tattooed head-to-toe before next Christmas so we’ll see hopefully I can do it. “The only advice I can really give to anyone wanting to mody or tattoo themselves is: do it out of love, do it out of the fact that it will make you happy. “We should only do things that bring us joy, for me that’s what modying myself does, so I want that for othersthat’s what they chose, nothing but love and happiness.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Cosmetic surgeryPlastic surgeryPeriodsTattoos\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\" to FREE email alerts with news to brighten your daySubscribeInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The Kicking Donkey is an aposelegant yet relaxedapos country pub that stocks a wide range of real ales, and has a full menu that of course has a Sunday roast, as Lancs Live reports.Many reviews of the pub in Ormskirk, Lancashire, praise the food - saying the homemade gravy is delicious and that the meat is cooked to perfection, but one diner wasnapost as impressed. They left a review online saying they were apostotally disgustedapos that Yorkshire puddings werenapost included with the roast, and were only available as an extra - costing £.. What do you think of the price  Let us know in the comments...In a one-star review on Tripadvisor, a guest named Steve wrote: Went there for a Sunday roast. In all my le I have never been in a restaurant for a roast beef dinner and told it does not include a Yorkshire pudding. It costs an extra £. andyou want gravy with that, it also costs an extra £.. Totally disgusted. We will never be going back there. First visit. Never again. Steve was not alone in his criticism of the restaurant, as another diner named Larry said the food was bland, plus he also took exception to having to pay for Yorkshire puddings.  He wrote: Roast dinner was bland, hardly any taste. You want a Yorkshire pudding or more gravy, fine, but you need to pay extra. Dogs allowed in eating areas, not great idea - so not for me. Tried it, but no more. But now the restaurant owner, commenting online as Matt F, has hit back at the critics on Tripadvisor. To Larry, he wrote: Hi. Thanks for the feedback, very sorry to hear that your experience with us wasnapost all it could be.  We would have been more than happy to swap your meal for something  or knock something off your billweaposd been aware that it wasnapost to your satisfaction. As to dogs, well, Iaposm afraid itaposs a country pub, kind of goes with the turf. We would have been happy to move you to another tablewe had known you were uncomfortable with their presence. Once again, sorry that you didnapost enjoy your meal. Should you ever try us again, ask for me and Iaposll make sure that everything is as splendid as we can manage. For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newslettershere. And to Steve, he said: Hi Steve. Sorry to have upset you so much. The reason we charge for Yorkies and extra gravy is that theyaposre both home-made from scratch. This takes time and effort, we donapost have the manpower to make a yorkie for every meal, so we make a batch and when theyaposre gone, theyaposre gone. We charge for extra gravy because we put plenty on anyway. In the past, people have asked for extra and then it comes back untouched. I believe that the staffaposs work should be reflected in their pay, and so we do need to charge for things like this. They cost us money to make. Itaposs a disappointment to hear that you wonapost dine with us again, but I felt at the very least you were owed an explanation.Do you have a story to share  Weaposd love to hear all about it.

Eventhe tenants are good at chipping in with the chores or have introduced the dreaded cleaning rota, the general standard of budget rented accommodation is normally below par. So one house decided to take matters into their own hands and give the supplied rug on their living room floor a good scrub, claiming it had never been cleaned. They filled the bath tub with water and cleaning products and left the rug to soak overnight - and were staggered by the results.Sharing the process on TikTok, user @ annachiowo posted a number of videos online documenting the step-by-step. She wrote: Cleaning our uni house rug thataposs clearly never been washed. Sheaposs a cool rug, but so old and dusty. The students add a number of cleaning products to the hot water before adding the brown patterned rug. After just a few minutes the water starts to turn brown as years of dirt start to come free. Half an hour later the water is completely black and a layer of grime appears around the back tub. After an hour, they drain the water and start to rinse the rug. They can then be seen wiping the water away and the colour beneath is several shares lighter. As they rinse the rug using the shower hose even more brown water can be seen escaping. They then take the unusual step of getting into the bath to stand on the rug, possibly to squeeze out any excess water and grime. One jokes: Rug got me acting up. Itaposs then time for another soak, and this time they leave it overnight. When theythe next morning the water has turned a disgusting brown colour. So we left her in overnight. So much gunk left on the side as it was draining. They then wash the tassels on the side using shampoo and conditioner, which even they admit probably wasnapost needed. Was this necessary  Probably not, but very satisfying. They then take the rug outside to dry in the garden, but received several messages from people saying it would never dry.  However a short sit on the radiator and the rug was good as new - and the pattern was even clearer than ever. It shows a beautul green dragon surrounded by flowers and leaves. They wrote: Not as much colour as we hoped, but the detail is beautul. In the final clip the students show off the rug in their living room, and it looks so much brighter - Mrs Hinch would be proud!

Mari Thomas was gutted when she lost her phone, as while it wasnapost too expensive it had huge sentimental value to her, as the Liverpool Echo reports.She tried to retrace her steps but it was no use so ed to her car, dejected, but was in for a shock as she found a note on her windscreen. It turned out someone had found the phone and left it for her at a nearby restaurant, before explaining its location in a note left on her windscreen. What do you think about the kind act  Let us know in the comments...Mari said: When I thought Iaposd lost it, you panic, donapost you  You just think, aposWhat are you going to do without it apos Itaposs not a very high-tech phone, but itaposs a decent one. To me, itaposs worth everything, because I rely on it so much. Mari had spent the day in Manchester with her husband, son and her sonaposs fiancé, buying Christmas gts - but the day was almost ruined when Mari realised sheaposd lost her phone, along with the hundreds of pictures stored on it. She continued: Those pictures are not just valuable to me but to their families as well, because we put them up on the Facebook page.As Mari approached her car, she spotted a note on the windscreen - and at first she thought her day was about to go from bad to worse. She added: I thought Iaposd parked in the wrong place and was having a telling off, to be honest.

A kind stranger took it upon themselves to leave a trail guiding Mari to her lost phone, safely stored in the Hungry Horse restaurant. She continued: I honestly couldnapost believe it that somebody had gone to the bother of writing the note in the first place, and then taking it to somewhere where I could pick it up just by going in and collecting it. I was so grateful, because like everybody , on your phone, youaposve got so many photos and memories that youaposd never get backyou lose your phone. I just want them to know that I appreciate so much what they did for me. Not many people would do that.

Instead of exchanging gunfire, soldiers traded gts and goodwill, all in the middle of No Man’s Land – the ­fragile space that separated the British and German front lines. They even got into the festive spirit with impromptu football matches. Letters to loved ones back home captured the emotion of that Christ­mas Day in  when, briefly, the slaughter was set aside. And the largest ever collection of those letters and photos has been ­gathered together in one of this year’s most moving books, Christmas Truce by the Men Who Took Part. Author Mike Hill says: “It’s all about people to me, that’s what attracted me. It’s an extraordinary human story.” Nearly , British soldiers died during the war, which began in July . As they went into battle, they had been comforted by the assurance that it would “all be over by Christmas”. But, bogged down in the horric trench warfare that would define the conflict, it soon became clear that was not the case. So it is unsurprising that soldiers wrote how they had initially feared that the Christmas Day “truce” might be a trick. Private Thomas Nash, of the East Lancashire Regiment – stationed on the Franco-Belgian border – wrote: “About  o’clock noon the Germans ceased firing… two or three came unarmed out of their trenches, and began to walk towards us saying that they wished to speak to us. “Two or three of our chaps went to meet them, but an officer called them back, suspecting a trap. However, more unarmed Germans came towards us, and our chaps then went out, also unarmed, to meet them, our officers warning them to take every precaution in case of treachery. “A few men were left behind, their rles ready to fireanything happened. I was amongst those who went out. There would be about  or  Germans, and about  of us. “We shook hands and fraternised, exchanging Christmas greetings, cigarettes, cigars etc, several of the Germans exchanging their watc­hes for our jackknives.”  The wonder of warring soldiers laying down their guns to shake hands for Christmas was not lost on the troops. Letters written by Capt John Stansfeld, of the nd Battalion, Gor­don High­landers, show he rushed to get his pocket camera when he realised the remarkable events taking place. Of the scene at Fleurbaix in northern France, Stansfeld wrote: “We found both sides sitting in their trenches, a mutually arranged truce going on. About a mile from us, they were fighting as usual! “Everybody was delighted at the rest and we all got a chance of looking at our trenches and spotting their weak points from the German side – of course nobody went within  yards of the enemy’s lines. “I waved for one of the Germans to come across. But beyond shaking hands and laughing at one another, we could not say very much as we were both ignorant of the other’s language.”  Stansfeld told of taking photos with Germans – knowing he would be in “awful troubleit was known, as we are not allowed to take photos”. For those who could afford one, the Vest Pocket Kodak camera – nicknamed The Soldier’s Kodak – offered a chance to record their adventures serving King and country. Surviving snaps show troops posing together and swapping presents from meagre rations. Concerned that battle scenes caught on film by soldiers could provide intelligence for the enemy – or lead to negative publicity on the home front – a ban on the use of private cameras had been issued by Army chiefs shortly before Christmas . But some either did not get the message or thought it worth the risk. Author Mike said: “There were photographs of the Boer War in the late th century. But the dference here is the accessibility for ordinary people to have cameras. The powers-that-be quickly realised it might not be a good thing.”  As well as trading tobacco, watches and other trinkets, soldiers from both sides joined together in festive singing and dancing. Colonel George Lawrence, commanding the East Lancashire Regi­ment, even proposed a New Year’s Day football fixture. He wrote home: “I saidthey would have an armistice on New Year’s Day we would play them at football between our lines. “At pm our doctor thought he would go and see the Germans, so boldly walked down the road to their trenches and talked to them. “They were very full of the football idea of mine on New Year’s Day. I saidthey would like another armistice then I would turn out a team and play them among the shell holes. “Happily, there won’t be any obstacles like dead Germans lying about unless they try on another attack before then.”  But the match never took place, with a dejected Lawrence writing: “The Germans were not for it, and have been sniping all day.” Mike said while the enduring image of organised matches along the trenches has passed down the decades, they were more likely gentle kickabouts. But he adds that not all the accounts are correct. He added: “Photos that circulate on social media purport to be of games between English and German soldiers but they’re matches between British soldiers and taken much later.” Animosity between the armies heightened in the spring of  after the first horric gas attacks, making later Christmas truces less widespread. But in the century since the guns of the Western Front finally fell silent in , the Christmas truce has remained a touching testament to humanity in the midst of unimaginable horror. Mike said: “It does symbolise the spirit of Christmas. While we shouldn’t forget there were practical real-world reasons why people wanted to get out of the trenches, there was a lot of very human things that went on. “Shaking hands, giving gts, drinking together. It’s all the more touching given what transpired in the next four years.” - Christmas Truce by the Men Who Took Part, by Mike Hill, £ from Fonthill MediaMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON ChristmasWorld War IBritish ArmySoldiersArmed forcesSunday People\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Join the Secret Elves for celebration inspiration - and brilliant gt ideas and reviewsSpread the cheer!Invalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Yet she says even she was shocked by the emaciated state of the animals her team saved last week.They moved in after campaigners uncovered an operation to traffic street pups and stolen pets  miles from western Java to Surakarta – where , dogs are killed every month for their meat to be used in satays or stews. Police intercepted a truck at an illegal slaughterhouse in the city at night – and Lola was part of a team of vets and handlers waiting to take in the animals.The -year-old Londoner wept as she told the Sunday People : “It was horrendous. I’ve been to markets, dog meat farms and I’ve met a lot of mistreated animals – but these were truly bags of bones. “One, sadly, had not survived the journey. They’d been travelling for  hours and it was so hot the dogs could barely breathe. They were bound in hessian sacks, soaking in their own mess, and hung in pairs over bamboo poles. “Many had wounds from where their mouths had been wired shut. I’d say % were under a year old.” Police arrested a man suspected of coordinating the shipment of hundreds of dogs every month – killing on average  dogs every day. But it was only the country’s second large-scale raid of its kind.  Lola – who lives in Bali with husband Derek, , daughter Leila, , two-year-old twins Mia and Eloise, and four rescue dogs – says the case has only strengthened her resolve. She works for the charity Humane Society International, heading up its End Dog Meat campaign. HSI estimates that  million dogs are killed for meat across Asia every year. Lola said: “It can be sad and harrowing. Whenever we go away on rescue missions it’s important to come back and hug my dogs very tight.” She has faced “intimidating and sometimes scary moments” in her work across Thailand, Indonesia and Korea. But she said: “People in markets are wielding the equipment they use to slaughter animals –I feel scared, then I think about how the dogs must feel.”  Lola became a vegetarian at seven after seeing a photo of caged chickens and had a makesht “campaigns office” in her bedroom as a child. She said: “I started writing to companies that tested products on animals. I wrote to restaurants that sold veal, ­airlines that flew cats to laboratories – anything I could think of.” At , Lola volunteered at a chimp rehabilitation centre in west Africa. She studied zoology at university, then did a master’s in wild animal biology. Landing a job at the World Society for the Protection of Animals at , she encountered the horric reality of a dog meat market in South Korea.  She said: “Once you’ve seen it, you can never unsee it. This nureongi – a Korean yellow dog – was in a cage with six others and we made eye contact. “I stroked her fur and she licked my hands. It was a devastating moment, there was nothing I could do for her. I made a promise to dedicate my le to ending the dog meat trade.” Just months later, Lola left London to work on the ground in Asia. She moved to Indonesia in  after three years in Singapore. She founded the Change for Animals Foundation, her dedication winning her a prize at the Daily Mirror’s Animal Heroes Awards in .  Lola revealed: “That market in South Korea where I saw the nureongi doesn’t exist any more. It’s been shut down, which is incredible. The sad parts are worth it for the brief moments of victory – like saving  dogs. In those moments, we’re winning.” Last week’s rescue was coordinated by Lola, for HSI, four other charities that make up the Dog Meat Free Indonesia coalition and Sukoharjo police. If convicted, the suspect faces up to five years in jail and a fine of around £,. Tarjono Sapto Nugroho, head of investigation for Sukoharjo Police, said the force receives “many complaints” about illegal dog meat traders. He said: “Dog meat consumption is considered culture by some, but cultures evolve and so must we.”  Despite a national government pledge to crack down on the trade, only isolated regional governments there have so far taken the initiative. But DMFI hopes two recent police stings mark a turning point in the campaign for a nationwide ban. Last month a dog trader caught in Kulon Progo district was jailed for  months and fined around £, after being intercepted transporting  dogs. Karin Franken, of Jakarta Animal Aid Network – part of DMFI – warned there is also a public health danger. She said: “Rabies is a grave concern in Indonesia. Where dogs are slaughtered and sold in restaurants, it jeopardises the health of the community.” The rescued pups, currently being nursed back to health at a shelter in Jakarta, will be transported to one of HSI’s rescue centres in Canada. Lola said: “A lot are still traumatised but some are already up and playing with toys and being dogs again. “The lows are low. But the highs like that make the fight all worth it.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON AnimalsDogsAnimal crueltySunday People\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Calling all dog lovers!to TeamDogs for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories.Invalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

driveway and the green spaces along the B are ldquorammed with vehicles which have flocked to the region.At a meeting of the community council on Monday , Mr Paterson shared his concerns and requested that action be taken to tackle the issue, described by one councillor as ldquohellish.ldquoWersquove always had issues with camping, wersquove even had some trees chopped down by people camping there, litter, people urinating and defecating either on my property or at my entrance which is pretty unpleasant as you can imagine,\" he said. ldquoAnd it just seems to have reached a real pitch in recent times.ldquoI know itrsquos been very bad for some while now at the likes of the Cauld and the golf club used to have a lot of problems with people parking there as well.Mr Paterson has spoken with Police Scotland about the issue and it was suggested to put up bollards or reflector posts around the bend to discourage people from parking on the verges.Tweeddale East councillor Robin Tatlersaid he would look into solutions.He said: ldquoI absolutely sympathise with you. I can understand that this must be absolutely hellish.ldquoIn the short term we need to do something immediately about trying to discourage people from parking in inappropriate places and Irsquom more than happy to take that forward to the community action teamwith the police.ldquoI think in the medium term we need to be trying to encourage people, when there are peak times, to not park there but to park down in the town.Also at this weekrsquos meeting was Emma Guy from Enduro World Series , who formerly worked as project coordinator for the Tweed Valley Tourism Bid..removeShe said: ldquoIrsquom well aware of this issue and some of us [from Tweed Valley Tourism Bid] did try and tackle it on the ground about a year and a half ago with putting signs up near the Cauld.ldquoSo around the event at the beginning of October we had shuttles so people wouldnrsquot park in these hotspots, we cordoned off areas, we spoke to the golf club and we had marshals in place to police any bad behaviour, so tat worked quite well.ldquoOur kind of feeling is that this is an ongoing problem and it does need solutions, there needs to be some kind of visitor infrastructure investment and certainly in my role with the Tourism Bid we were pushing really hard for that.ldquoFrom an EWS point of view, with regard to events, we worked quite hard to manage that problem because we know how disruptive and how unpleasant that can be.ldquoIn my role with EWS we would support and put our weight behind any proposals to the council to SOSEto try and alleviate this.Tweeddale East councillor Shona Haslam, of the Conservatives, added: ldquoIn terms of the long term [solution] obviously wersquove got pound million coming into mountain biking infrastructure into Innerleithen and pound million for a town the size of Innerleithen is pretty signicant.ldquoSo, wersquove got the Mountain Biking Innovation Centre that is moving forward in the background, obviously therersquos a lot of commercial stuff in there that wersquore not allowed to talk about, and there is the bike park as well.

Nothing about school le post-fire post during COVID seems as rewarding or real as it once did but, be in no doubt, the young people celebrated here today are every bit as worthy of celebration and congratulations as their predecessors and perhaps even more so given all they have had to overcome and deal with to win the prizes we celebrate in this article.Perhaps you can take heart that this yearrsquos Peebles High School prize giving offers something more permanent than fleeting moments of adulation and applause.

She graciously stated that she was glad pupils are ldquoable to get back to that now and other people are enjoying it. While Amy is not pursuing music further , she explained that ldquoitrsquos not something I want to stop doinghellip It was probably one of my favourite subjects, probably the one I was most relaxed aboutthat makes sense. It was always a nice environment to be in and I think that helped me enjoy it a lot more. Amy then admitted at the risk of sounding ldquoclicheacute, that the music department concerts were the highlight of her years at the school.

I also love the idea of travel and going on adventures to make some memories.The class asked Abbie to reflect on and offer advice to her first year self, and she responded with ldquothe list is longhellip the main thing Irsquod say is not to be so hard on myself and to accept that set backs are important for learning just as much as success. Carrying on the theme of advice Abbie was asked what she would say to this yearrsquos head team and she told them to ldquoembrace everything because the year will be over before you know it. Therefore, just make the most of every opportunity and most of all enjoy yourself and have fun working with your peers.ByRosie DykesEuan Macrae: Geoffrey Simpson Award for Head PrefectEuan Macrae was awarded the prestigious Geoffrey Simpson Award for his efforts as head boy. Euan had to show certain skills such as leadership and teamwork in order to effectively guide the school. In an interview with Euan, who is now studying Medicine at University, he highlighted how the school fire and COVID had affected his work ethic during his final few years in school, and how this has impacted the lives of not only himself but also his year group going into exams and beyond. He explained that ldquowersquod never sat proper higher exams which would have set us up for the bigger exams that we were going to have to sit further down the line so the damage from that is probably still lasting. The class asked Euan who his hero was, he very honestly answered with his grandfather, saying that he had always looked up to him due to his intelligence and bravery. When asked who his favourite teacher was at school, Euan passionately discussed how Miss Dunlop, who taught history, influenced his high school experience as ldquoshe had the entire class focused on what she was saying and she never even had to raise her voice. I soon realised that learning could be actually so much fun as well as informative.ByLouise RussellRachel McManus: Tweed Reads PrizeCampbell Hunter was a much-loved member of the Peebles community. He made fantastic contributions to the Tweed Reads organisation and thrived under the leadership role. He was kind, compassionate and showed a real love of encouraging the younger generations to explore and enjoy reading. Campbell worked tirelessly alongside the other members of Tweed Reads and valued the importance of learning, community and service. Campbell was such an important part of the community, and his astounding contribution to Tweed Reads only proved how far he was set to go outside of school.The Tweed Reads prize is named after Campbell Hunter, not just to honour his memory but to honour everything he stood for and his contributions to the Tweed Reads club. The prize is awarded to the few who epitomise Campbellrsquos wonderful leadership qualities and share his values of learning and community. The Campbell Hunter prize for  goes to Rachel McManus who consistently worked creatively within the confines of COVID regulations and was always relentlessly positive.When the class asked Rachel about the prize itself and how she felt to have won it, she described Campbell as ldquoa huge part of Tweed Reads in his last few years of high school and had a real passion for helping young children in the community develop their reading skills and form a love for reading. Rachel says she feels ldquohonoured to have won the Campbell Hunter prize through Tweed Reads and she hopes to continue her involvement with the organisation in coming years.When asked in an interview how the fire and pandemic affected her work ethic within school she replied it had ldquoa massive impact on students. She then went on to congratulate the school saying it has ldquoworked hard to ensure that pupils were still able to have a good amount of teaching with being online and there was always support available should anyone have needed it. Rachel closed her answer by admitting that ldquoit was hard to concentrate on work at home, so you really had to push yourself to stay motivated and keep on top of the workload.Rachel was asked how she felt the award carried on Campbellrsquos legacy. She responded saying that it demonstrates all of the commitment he put into Tweed Reads and his caring nature over his home community.She added: ldquoIn my sixth year of high school I heard many stories of Campbell from Tweed Reads leaders who had worked alongside him. They always said how much commitment he had to the charity and how much he cared about truly representing the ethos of the charity so therefore I feel that the Campbell Hunter prize is a true legacy of all the hard work and dedication that he put into the charity.ByRosie Dykes"},{"url":null,"title":"new-caledonia-votes-stay-france-referendum-marred-boycott","story":"Voters in the French island territory of New Caledonia have voted overwhelmingly to stay part of France, in a referendum boycotted by pro-independence forces and closely watched around the South Pacic.French President Emmanuel Macron hailed the result as a resounding confirmation of Francersquos role in the Indo-Pacic, and announced negotiations on the territoryrsquos future status.

plans for  homes were based on costs that had not been updated for over a decade.And the local community council said work which had already been promised before previous housing was built had not been carried out ndash leaving the roads and pedestrian networks around the area at breaking point.Dunbar community councillor Jacquie Bell told the planning committee at its online meeting on Tuesday: ldquoThis proposal has infrastructure holes like Swiss cheese, questions that need resolving and time constraints when we need time to review.The committee was asked to approve Taylor Wimpey plans for  houses and  flats at Hallhill, Dunbar, in the final phase of a wider development in the area.Among contributions agreed between the developers and planners was pound, towards a bridge or crossing for the East Coast Main Rail Line which will be needed as part of the infrastructure of the estate.: Bid to sell alcohol from Hallhill Sports CentreEast Lothian councillor Jeremy Findlay, a committee member, raised concerns that the contribution was based on a cost for the crossing which had not been updated since .But while planners admitted that it was likely the cost for the work now would be far higher and the council was likelyto face some shortfall, they insisted the contribution had been calculated using an index to cover inflation.Councillor Lachlan Bruce asked: ldquoIs it usual to use decade-old figures for determining contributions for infrastructure for a development to go ahead He was told it was not normally the case but recalculating the cost of such a complex project could take years.Mrs Bell said that the community council had concerns which had grown in recent years as housing in parts of the estate had been built and families moved in.She said concerns about one access route, Hospital Road, had been dismissed in  by the Scottish GovernmentReporter who said it would not be used.She said: ldquoIt is now collapsing and heavily used.: Fate of rail underpass depends on housing decisionAnd she said ongoing concerns over the junction onto the A from the estate remained unresolved, adding: ldquoThe junction urgently needs an upgrade so it is galling to see developer contributions go to junctions  miles away.Mrs Bell said pedestrians were in conflict with vehicles on the roads around the estate and urged the committee to consider a continuation of a decision on the planning application until more answers could be sought.Councillor Findlay moved a motion for a delay to the decision, citing a need to update the contributions being requested for the East Coast Main Line crossing but was defeated by eight votes to three.The committee then approved the plans by  votes to one with only Councillor Findlay against.A further application for  houses at Windygoul in Tranent was unanimously approved during the virtual meeting of the committee.The application was part of a wider development in Tranent and received no

He started juggling with knives and balancing on one leg while standing on a giant ball!He was playing with our senses, he knew exactly how to build suspense and stretch our belief in what we thought was possible. You could hear the silenced hush of awe in the audience watching his performance.Awe is something we all need on a regular basis. In fact,you look at the science, it has a huge impact on our ability to think, investigate, make discoveries and inventions.It stimulates our curiosity and makes us feel more connected, for example to nature, to our community, to history or whatever small wonders we experience every day.John Muir often talked about being awestricken by the natural wonders he experienced. They often overwhelmed his senses and this fed his passion to protect the landscape he revered, resulting in the formation of the national parks in the USA.But his sense of awe enthralled him as a child, as he explored the shore and fields around his home town of Dunbar.Thatrsquos the thing our sense of awe is not confined to grand sights. There are everyday wonders we encounter, and pausing for a moment to feel that sense of being ldquoawe-stricken has such a huge impact on our well-being.Scientists will tell you awe will transform your mind, make you feel humble and more empathetic. Itrsquos an uplting spiritual experience, and I donrsquot mean religious, although awe is an important part of all religions.But you donrsquot have to be religious to be spiritual. And I think being able to feel amazed by the things around us is a spiritual way of being.And at Christmas-time especially, I often feel the ironic contradiction of a celebration that has at its heart a powerful spiritual message, but which has been hijacked to promote the needs of mass consumerism.The pressure to buy at this time can hit hard, especially when paying the bills and putting food on the table is a daily concern for so many. Povertyrsquos cold fingers are creeping into our homes as we try to keep warm. Yet, especiallywe have children, we want our family to feel included and blessed at this time. Who doesnrsquot How hard it is to resist the powerful messages thrown at us that fulfilment and happiness can be bought with the latest updated stuff you buy in shops that the phone you got last year is old now, you need a new one those shoes have the wrong label, you just have to have this because everyone  does. The list could be endless.Unfortunately, you canrsquot buy a sense of awe in the shops. No, wait, actually itrsquos fortunate!

The consumerist message is so powerful and universal that itrsquos dficult to opt out.But this is where cultivating our sense of awe can be so uplting, at a time when we feel so much pressure. What really makes us happy is relationships, not stuff. A thoughtful gt is part of that of course, but the awe is in the thought put into it.I think feeling a sense of awe is closely linked to being able to truly appreciate what we have and can experience.That includes the gts of kindness and generosity of people, as much as the blazing sunset or frost covered spiderrsquos web we saw a few days ago.

So how can the information be called \"confidential\" when childrens details will be spread throughout local authority departments  Moreover, we have seen in the past the details of \"confidential\" research being leaked into the public arena and this latest initiative will turn out no better.Full marks to the local authorities which have refused to take part in the census, a decision which seemingly reflects the mood of the public regarding this assault on our privacy. It also prevents the survey being viewed as a Scotland-wide project which devalues any information gained. Nicola Sturgeon should bin this unnecessary money-wasting and time-wasting census now and draw back from her Governments obvious obsession to control every aspect of our lives.Bob MacDougall, Kippen.THE ISSUE OF CONFIDENTIALITYTHE front-page headline last Sunday was about the Scottish Governmentrsquos health and wellbeing census for schoolchildren not being confidential. The article ulged thatthose analysing the results saw something which suggested a pupil could be at risk, they could alert the local authority. The analysts would not be aware of the pupilrsquos identity. Only the appropriate people in the local authority would have the information. The headline conveyed a dferent impression.This type of \"confidentiality\" is not unknown. Most of us like to think that when we vote in elections our choice is confidential. In fact, should \"those in authority\" wish to find out who we voted for they can do so. I have no recollection of you ever bringing this to peoplersquos attention. It is perhaps being selective in reporting potential breaches of confidentiality.We are all aware of recent cases where children have been abused and murdered by family members. In some of these cases warning signs were there but not picked up by the relevant authorities. Will anyone really take comfort from the fact that neither the victimsrsquo nor the perpetratorsrsquo rights to privacy were breached Douglas Morton, Lanark.SNP INCAPABLE OF LEARNINGTHE SNP is incapable of learning even from its own history. Recycling parts of John Swinneys failed Named Persons Act in another guise just displays this trait.It is even more on show in the endless cycle of new dates for Indyref, which is also a rejected idea.The SNP does not have the breadth of talent to innovate new policies that are genuinely in the interests of the vast majority of Scots. Taking the Greens on board has narrowed options rather than expand them. The headlong rush to carbon neutrality sooner than is practicable will also bear this out.Under the SNP Scotland is demonstrably going backwards. When any governments best defence of failures is to point out that whilst we might be bad, our neighbours are worse , then we are scraping the bottom of the barrel.

Their world seemingly is defined by parochialism and so any enterprising Scot looking towards the massive market south of the jurisdictional Border, must be vilied.Boris Johnson doesnt float my boat either but Ms Maddox is out there promoting a Scottish brand and business, and helping drive her local economy.

That seems unlikely to continue. The deterioration in the quality of education, as measured by unbiased international assessment, means that youngsters in this country are being denied the opportunity to achieve their full potential, whether here or where.This represents a shameful waste of talent among Scotlandrsquos youth and is a shocking indictment of  years of SNP Government maladministration.Bob Scott, Drymen.QUESTIONS OVER ASYLUM SEEKERSJOHN Milnechastises me, but I make no excuses for using the words \"pretend asylum seekers\".If they were genuine they would not pay more than pound, and get into rubber dinghies to cross the Channel. They would instead use the money to buy a ticket on a ferry or use the Channel Tunnel. If they were genuine they would not burn their identication documents or pose as unaccompanied children.These \"pretend\" asylum seekers entered Europe and passed through several \"safe havens\" to get to the UK the land \"flowing with milk and honey\" and free housing. If they feared for their lives, as they now claim, why did they not claim asylum in the first EU country they entered  Once granted asylum status they would then be free to travel to the UK or where.Clark Cross, Linlithgow."},{"url":null,"title":"michael-settle-politicians-rightly-spooked-omicron","story":"Our politicians and the scientic experts are not mincing their words.Following a Cobra meeting between the UK Government and the devolved administrations, Michael Gove, Englandrsquos Levelling Up Secretary, emerged grim-faced and admitted the projected numbers of infections meant Britain was facing a ldquodeeply concerning situation.Nicola Sturgeon warned Scotland - and presumably by extension the rest of the UK - could be facing a ldquopotential tsunami of infections in the coming days and weeks.On Friday, the UKrsquos daily number of Covid cases reached its highest level in almost a year at , as experts warned the speed of Omicronrsquos spread meant the new iant could become the dominant strain as early as next week.The UK Health Security Agency saidthe new strainrsquos growth continued unabated, there would be more , cases a day by the end of the month.In London, % of new cases have the Omicron iant, which was only reported two weeks ago. Its rate of spread is doubling every three, or even two, days.Professor Eleanor Riley, an infectious disease expert at Edinburgh University, said Omicron was spreading so quickly people were ldquovery likely to meet an infected person unless they were ldquoliving the le of a hermit.The most graphic illustration of just how transmissible the new iant is came this week from Jason Leitch, Scotlandrsquos national clinical director, who explained: ldquoIf you have a room of  people and a single unknown Omicron case is in that room, you could in the days after that find ,  or  positives.Professor Neil Ferguson, the leading epidemiologist from Imperial College London, said the UK was already experiencing a ldquovery explosive wave of infection from Omicron, which could lead to ldquoquite an explosive wave of hospitalisations, depending on the severity of disease caused by the new iant. He suggested the peak would arrive ldquosometime in January.While it must be stressed the data remains patchy and more time is needed for precision, the projected numbers are scary. Yesterday, the rest of us got to see what ministers have seen.Government advisers from the London School of Hygiene  Tropical Medicine said a best case scenario for England would see a peak of more than , daily hospital admissions they are currently at . The most optimistic projection from now until April  is a total of , hospital admissions and , deaths.Tougher measures like restrictions on pubs and restaurants, the closure of some entertainment venues and restrictions on indoor gathering could help control the Omicron wave, reducing hospital admissions by , and deaths by ,.But under a worst case scenario with no extra measures, daily hospital admissions could hit ,, double the January  peak, and over the period to April , the total could top , with as many as , extra deaths.Given these numbers, it is no surprise our political leaders are not ruling anything out. And Downing St, having just announced Plan B measures for south of the border, may soon be forced to consider a Plan C of increased restrictions, including the wider use of vaccine passports as seen on the continent.Last week, Boris Johnson suggested there might be the need for a ldquonational conversation on mandatory vaccines but within  hours Sajid Javid, Englandrsquos Health Secretary, publicly dismissed their use, branding it ldquounethical. Which suggests itrsquos not going to happen unless the PM wants to lose a swath of frontline ministers.On Tuesday a dramatic Commons showdown looms as MPs debate and vote on the new regulations for England.It has been predicted the PM could face his biggest backbench rebellion with more than  Tory MPs defying their leader. Knowing some Cabinet ministers are equally unhappy at the new restrictions, the question is: will any resign Embarrassingly for the PM, his only route to getting the new regulations implemented is on the back of Labour votes another sign of political weakness.And yet the dire situation Omicron now poses could concentrate minds and instil enough fear in would-be rebels to make them hesitate as this weekend the whips go about their business in the art of gentle - and perhaps not-so-gentle - persuasion to change minds.Indeed, Gove, noting how even the double-jabbed could become infected with Omicron, insisted such facts meant fresh action was needed. ldquoIrsquom confident people will examine these proposals seriously, soberly and thoughtfully, andhellipconclude, on balance, it is right to act, he said.One Government adviser, Professor John Edmunds, accepted that the new restrictions, such as working from home, would economically impact businesses like cafes and pubs but insisted they were a ldquonecessary evil.The early analysis that two jabs are an ldquoinsufficient barrier against the latest iant is worrying but, thankfully, three give % protection. However, the problem is only around a third of the British public have had their boosters.The equation of increased transmissibility plus two-thirds of people with inadequate protection equals a dire situation.Even, as everyone hopes, the scientists conclude Omicron is milder than the Delta iant it is replacing, the sheer number of infections could mean coronavirus-stricken patients will quickly overwhelm our hospitals.The race is on to inoculate as many of the five million vaccine refuseniks as possible and to accelerate getting booster jabs into peoplersquos arms.On Friday, , booster jabs were reported, the second highest daily rate, taking the rolling average to a record high of ,. But there is a long way to go in a short space of time.January  could prove to be this countryrsquos most trying time with Covid.

It would almost be better to have a regulation and a furlough scheme.#Sharing doubts over what number of people and what premises they attended actually constituted a #party#, he added: #Given that it#s best according to the authorities to avoid party situations then from a business point of view, we need support.#We need some clarity followed by some support.#The BID chairman#s comments came as leaders of all four UK nations are set to meet to discuss the rising levels of the new Omicron iant of COVID-. Earlier this afternoon, Ms Sturgeon warned that “dficult decisions” might have to be made in “days to come” amid this “surge”. Aware of the potential economic and social impact that further pandemic restrictions might have, she said that a lot would depend onfinancial aid could be agreed with the UK treasury.In the wake of this announcement and in the anticipation of further developments in the coming days, both Orkney Islands Counciland NHS Orkney have said they are prepared to respond to any new or righter restrictions which may be announced.Asked to respond to the First Minister#s announcement, an OIC spokeswoman said:  #The council is continually assessing its response to the pandemic and holds fortnightly incident management team meetings.#It was highlighted in this morning#s meeting that more announcements were likely to be coming from the First Minister.#Now that these announcements have been made this afternoon, they will be considered by officers, including our Safety  Resilience team and where necessary urgent matters will be escalated to the Incident Management Team or Senior Management Team as required, to ensure that that the council continues to support the response to the pandemic quickly and effectively.#The situation is of course fast moving and members of the public should expect further updates in due course —  but meantime we urge all to take very regular lateral flow device tests and to follow the guidance in respect to hand hygiene, face coverings and social distancing.#In a joint statement, NHS Orkney#s chief executive Michael Dickson and director of public health Louise Wilson explained that the guidance around parties has already been in force within their staff since November.They said: #The rapidly changing national picture is to be expected as we begin to understand the Omicron iant.#The guidance issued last night by Public Health Scotland regarding deferring Christmas parties was already in place here at NHS Orkney, we asked all our staff to show caution around Christmas events and to consider alternatives to reduce risk in early November.#Additionally, we have reminded all staff to work from home wherever possible and of course we are all continuing with our regular lateral flow tests and have all mitigations in place.#As the First Minister stated “our best form of defence is vaccinations”, we’d encourage anyone who is yet to be vaccinated to get in touch with ourselves, you can do this by calling   . We are well underway with our vaccination boosters and aim to have all booster vaccines administered by the middle of January with all appointment letters out before Christmas.#From tomorrowall household contacts of confirmed cases, Omicron or not, need to isolate for  days regardless of vaccination status or a negative PCR result. Non-household contacts can end isolation after receiving a negative PCR resultdouble vaccinated and have no symptoms.#These changes to isolation for household contacts of COVID- will have an impact across the community, and NHS Orkney has robust business continuity plans to help us deliver our key services.

Separatist activists expressed disappointment or resignation.They had urged a delay in the vote because of the pandemic, and were angry over what they said were French government efforts to sway the campaign. So they called on their supporters to stay away from voting stations.And they did. Official results showed % of those who took part chose to stay in France. Overall turnout was just % mdash less than half the numbers who showed up in a previous independence referendum last year, where support for breaking away was .%. vw,vw,px, px\"People queue outside a school in Noumea to vote in the referendum ldquoTonight we are French, and we will stay that way. Itrsquos no longer negotiable, said Sonia Backes, president of the Southern Province region and a fervent loyalist.The vote was monitored by the UN and regional powers, amid global efforts towards decolonisation and growing Chinese influence in the region. New Caledonia, colonised by Napoleonrsquos nephew in the th century, is a vast archipelago of about , people east of Australia that is  time zones ahead of Paris mdash and hosts a French military base.ldquoTonight France is more beautul because New Caledonia decided to stay, President Macron said in a national televised address.He did not address the boycott. Noting that the electorate ldquoremains deeply ided, he pledged ldquorespect for all Caledonians, including those who voted to break away. vw,vw,px, px\"A woman signs before voting at a polling station in Noumea Sundayrsquos vote was the third and last in a decades-long decolonisation process, which stemmed from violence in  that led to the French government handing New Caledonia broad autonomy under the Noumea Agreement. The process was aimed at settling tensions between native Kanaks seeking independence and those who wanted the territory to remain part of France.The process does not end with the referendum. The state, separatists and non-separatists now have  months to negotiate a new status for the territory and its institutions within France.ldquoWe are reaching a new stage, Mr Macron said, calling for negotiations on new structures to handle health crises, boost the economy, improve womenrsquos rights and protect the environment from climate change mdash a major concern in this island territory.A tropical storm warning also dampened enthusiasm for the vote. Lines snaked out of some polling stations, as winds whipped palm trees lining the streets of the regional capital, Noumea. But turnout at others was barely a trickle.The question put to people in the archipelagorsquos  voting stations was: ldquoDo you want New Caledonia to gain full sovereignty and become independent  Masks and social distancing measures were required.The campaign and voting day were unusually calm because of the boycott. vw,vw,px, px\"Voters in Noumea began queuing at .am In the first such referendum in , .% of voters supported independence, and .% favoured it in a second vote held in . While support for a ldquoyes vote seemed to be growing, the regionrsquos first coronavirus outbreak in September threw the political debate into disarray. Until then, New Caledonia had been one of the few virus-free places left in the world.By November, the archipelago had reported  Covid- deaths, and the regional senate decreed a year of traditional Kanak mourning. Independence activists felt they could not campaign out of respect for their dead, and demanded that the referendum be postponed.But pro-France groups insisted the vote should take place as scheduled to end uncertainty over New Caledoniarsquos future and to boost its economic prospects. Pro-independence activists announced they would refuse to take part, accusing the government in Paris of imposing the referendum date and violating neutrality by publishing a document seen as casting the consequences of independence in a negative light. vw,vw,px, px\"French police and gendarmerie units have been deployed across Noumea France is trying to cement its presence in the Indo-Pacic region after it lost a multibillion-dollar submarine contract because of a partnership Australia formed with the US and the UK. The secretly negotiated submarine project, announced in September and aimed at countering Chinese ambitions in the region, was a huge blow to France. New Caledonia hosts one of two French military bases in the Pacic.Mr Macron said the vote sent an important message to the Indo-Pacic region while it undergoes ldquorecomposition and faces ldquostrong tensions.The UN has supported New Caledoniarsquos decolonisation process and sent electoral observers to monitor Sundayrsquos vote. The Pacic Islands Forum also sent a delegation to observe the poll.We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

There were no help groups, no mental health care, back then.“We went to my grannys to live for a while and then we came back to the house, the three of us, and that was it. It was a case of paddle your own canoe, really.“My dads going out to work every day as a painter and decorator and we were two young boys going out to school.“Its really just about capturing that time and the values he taught us as kids without ever really knowing he was doing it - or us realising what he was doing. The behaviours, we just kinda copied him.“Thats what I realised as I started to right this thing, that this is what it was...”Ironically, it was his grand daughters prompting that convinced him to put pen to paper in the first place.“About a year ago, my eldest grand daughter said to me - grandad, remember all the old stories you used to tell us when we were kids, about our grandad, racing the pigeons. She told me one of them, almost word for word. I thought, I really must capture those for posterity, for the family. RETIREMENT “Obviously, when retirement and lockdown came into play I had a lot more time on my hands so I sat down at the laptop to fiddle about and to write these wee stories.“As I started, this thing just took on a le of its own and became something completely dferent which was kind of a surprise to me, but a very pleasant surprise, as I really enjoyed writing it.”And I really enjoyed reading it, this simple tale of a hard-working father and his two sons making their way in the world.But the real stars of the book are the pigeons to whom Frankie cleverly lends human traits, such as the ability to talk - characters like Proud Boy, Warhorse and Bootsy.And, of course, Princess Sofia, who we come to learn resembles Frankie’s own mother.The trials and tribulations of the loft in attempting to win the biggest prizes in the sport resemble the struggles faced by Frankie’s family in an era when times were tough.But this isn’t a depressing tale rather, it is an uplting story of how families and, by extension, close-knit communities bandied together to overcome adversity. With a healthy dose of pigeon racing nostalgia thrown in for good measure.“Whilst some of the pigeon names and details have been changed the book is based on true le events,” continues Frankie.“It was never my intention to get the book published, I only started writing it as something to give the grandkids. “I really dont care about the business side of things – its just nice that people can read about my father.“I suppose people are quite surprised about the book but there’s more interest there than anything which is great.“Depending on the feedback who knows, there might even be a second one.”‘The Penzance Smash,’ published by Austin McAuley is out now."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1639060616576.jpg--covid_19___thu_9th_december_figures.jpg?1639060617000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20211209newscovid 19 thu 9th december figures","story":"The NI Department of Health dashboard shows four further coronavirus related deaths and  new positive test results.

I am really encouraged by the increased number of first doses delivered in recent weeks.”The Health Minister added that the public cannot rely solely on the booster programme to combat Omicron.“We all have a vital role to play in not spreading the virus,” he said.“We need to keep making safer choices in our daily lives and to regularly use lateral flow tests to help protect each other.”People are asked to be patient in the event of queues at vaccination centres.Most ReadCountry music singers Aidan Taaffe and ‘Cowboy’ Larry Taaffe, along with third brother Michael Taaffe, all accused of raping same womanCommunity ‘heartbroken’ after boykilled in Glenavy road traffic collisionProperty: superb city living in east BelfastAward-winning dog groomer who battered wedding guest branded ‘Jekyll and Hyde’ character by judgeTroubles survivors call on Sinn Fein to condemn Gerry Adams ‘Tiocfaidh ar la’ Christmas videoTop VideosPlayVideo: Two-year-old Belfast girl shouts at her mum for laughing as she tries to sing a song from FrozenPlayPolice chiefs refused to pay overtime to officers assigned to Noah Donohoe search operationPlayTake a look inside the former Tesco store in Belfast’s city centre which will be an event space over ChristmasLatest CoronavirusFive more cases of Omicron in Northern Ireland, bringing total to Jon TongeOpinionIf Boris survives the current crisis, don’t bet against a second termLindy McDowellOpinionWould you really ban a friend from Christmas dinner for being anti-vaxx Booster jab travel certicate and app update expectedRalph HewittOpinionTaking a lateral flow test is not a big deal ... people seem to forget we’re in midst of a pandemicLatestManchester United players and staff ‘test positive for coronavirus’Five more cases of Omicron iant reported in Northern IrelandBrendan Rodgers cheered by Leicester’s resilience in drubbing of NewcastleUK Covid alert level raised following rapid increase in Omicron casesRaheem Sterling grateful for opportunity after he hits  Premier League goals,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

She said: #We are proud of our work promoting the UK to the rest of the world. Last year we reached more than  million people globally, so it is important the language we use reflects the ersity of our audience. As a global organisation, we are committed to being as inclusive as possible.

We will be asking when we can get supplies of this vaccine in Northern Ireland.“If I lived in Hungary or Serbia, I wouldn’t be having this discussion — because those vaccines are readily available there.”First Minister Paul Givan will tomorrow line up with his DUP colleagues in Stormont to oppose a policy that less than two months ago he himself publicly listed as a Covid- related contingency option for winter.The plan, which is signed by the First and Deputy First Minister, lays out options for measures the Executive agreed it could take “to slow the spread of the virus” should the pandemic deteriorate.It included the potential to deploy Covid status certication “in higher risk settings” — yet in the Assembly tomorrow Givan and the DUP will reject the Executive-backed proposal, describing it as a “step too far”.The autumn winter plan states thatcase numbers rise sharply orhospital pressures become unsustainable, it would legislate for certication “ considered appropriate and necessary”.But since its publication the new iant Omicron has emerged — with three cases discovered last week — and hospital occupancy as of Friday was at pc.Among the most vocal politician on vaccine passports is DUP MLA Paul Frew.He believes vaccine passports “will cause deep resentment in the community, increase distrust and hesitancy”.While he has insisted that he is “not anti-vax”, Mr Frew has posted messages on social media saying that he was “totally opposed to government coercion and discrimination”.It follows more than a year of mixed messaging from Stormont’s largest party, with many accusing the party’s MLAs and MPs of confusing the public and undermining the response to the virus.SDLP leader Colum Eastwood has said the attitude of some DUP members throughout the pandemic “has been a disgrace”, adding that “they have actively undermined the public health message at every opportunity”.Most ReadCountry music singers Aidan Taaffe and ‘Cowboy’ Larry Taaffe, along with third brother Michael Taaffe, all accused of raping same womanCommunity ‘heartbroken’ after boykilled in Glenavy road traffic collisionProperty: superb city living in east BelfastAward-winning dog groomer who battered wedding guest branded ‘Jekyll and Hyde’ character by judgeTroubles survivors call on Sinn Fein to condemn Gerry Adams ‘Tiocfaidh ar la’ Christmas videoTop VideosPlayVideo: Two-year-old Belfast girl shouts at her mum for laughing as she tries to sing a song from FrozenPlayPolice chiefs refused to pay overtime to officers assigned to Noah Donohoe search operationPlayTake a look inside the former Tesco store in Belfast’s city centre which will be an event space over ChristmasLatest Northern IrelandWalk-in booster jabs available for over-s in Northern Ireland after increase in Omicron casesFive more cases of Omicron iant reported in Northern IrelandFive more cases of Omicron in Northern Ireland, bringing total to Health trusts spent £, on agency staff over three days, figures showMemorial service marks th anniversary of Balmoral furniture company bombingLatestWalk-in booster jabs available for over-s in Northern Ireland after increase in Omicron casesManchester United players and staff ‘test positive for coronavirus’Five more cases of Omicron iant reported in Northern IrelandBrendan Rodgers cheered by Leicester’s resilience in drubbing of NewcastleUK Covid alert level raised following rapid increase in Omicron cases,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Primark shops in the Netherlands have been hit by restrictions in trading hours, in Germany customers need vaccine passes, while its five shops in Austria have all closed. But in the months ahead things are unlikely to get worse than they were at the same time last year, when most of the chain’s shops were closed. Between December and April sales are expected to be “signicantly better” than in the same period a year earlier, AB Foods told shareholders. The business also has several other wings, including grocery, sugar, ingredients and agriculture businesses. These have all traded in line with expectations since the start of the financial year in September. “We are experiencing the impact of widely reported port congestion and road freight limitations and our businesses have been working hard to overcome these dficulties,” AB Foods said. “We have seen an escalation in the cost of energy, logistics and commodities and we have been implementing plans to offset these through operational cost savings and, where necessary, the implementation of price increases.”  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Niamh Hawes hasbeen taking part in Miss Bikini Ireland for the last year and achieved a top  spotDerry NewsDerry girl lands top  spot inMiss Bikini Ireland overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The man is being treated for abdomen would in Altnagelvin Hospital.Derry NewsMan in critical condition in hospital following Derry stabbing overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Primark shops in the Netherlands have been hit by restrictions in trading hours, in Germany customers need vaccine passes, while its five shops in Austria have all closed. But in the months ahead things are unlikely to get worse than they were at the same time last year, when most of the chain’s shops were closed. Between December and April sales are expected to be “signicantly better” than in the same period a year earlier, AB Foods told shareholders. The business also has several other wings, including grocery, sugar, ingredients and agriculture businesses. These have all traded in line with expectations since the start of the financial year in September. “We are experiencing the impact of widely reported port congestion and road freight limitations and our businesses have been working hard to overcome these dficulties,” AB Foods said. “We have seen an escalation in the cost of energy, logistics and commodities and we have been implementing plans to offset these through operational cost savings and, where necessary, the implementation of price increases.”  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Niamh Hawes hasbeen taking part in Miss Bikini Ireland for the last year and achieved a top  spotDerry NewsDerry girl lands top  spot inMiss Bikini Ireland overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The man is being treated for abdomen would in Altnagelvin Hospital.Derry NewsMan in critical condition in hospital following Derry stabbing overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Specsavers is encouraging avid readers to have regular eye tests so they can continue to indulge their hobby. Presbyopia is the gradual loss of our eyes’ ability to focus close up as the lens becomes less flexible. A natural part of ageing, it usually becomes noticeable around the age of . The condition is common and typically isn’t a cause for concern. But some struggle to adapt, and find they need to hold their book at arm’sto read the page or direct a light on it to see the words more clearly. For most people, the answer is a simple eye test which will identythey need reading glasses, multi-focal glasses or contact lenses to make words clearer – and le easier. Maeve Walsh, director at Specsavers Crescent Link in the Waterside and Ferryquay Street in the city centre, says: “It can sometimes be dficult for people to assess themselves whether they have presbyopia, which is why we always encourage regular eye tests, usually every two years. “As we age, it’s completely natural for our eyesight to worsen and it shouldn’t be something we worry about, providing our eyes are in good health. “My advice to those with presbyopia would be to carry your specs with you at all times and get into the habit of having them close by. This will help with activities like reading, and will also ensure you’re not straining your eyes, which can sometimes cause other problems.” To find out more about presbyopia, or to book an eye test visit:https:www.specsavers eye-health presbyopiaandwww.specsavers stores derryorwww.specsavers stores crescentlink Top five signs you have Presbyopia .

Reporter: Staff Reporter Dec   addthis, Lynch’s, the local family retailer which operates a number of Spar and Eurospar stores and supermarkets, have opened their third local supermarket bringing their total store number to eight across the North West and Mid Ulster. googletag.cmd.push Lynch’s Eurospar, Greysteel is the third outlet from the retailer to open under the popular Eurospar brand and has allowed management to more than double the number of jobs available, now employing  locally. Acquiring what was previously a Centra store on the site, company director Paul Lynch says the community needed a larger format supermarket brand that would not only bring a host of fresh and local produce and ranges, but would be convenient and complemented with services vital to the local area. Paul said: “We have invested around pound, to bring our supermarket experience to the Greysteel area and are so proud to open the doors. “We have more than doubled the size of the space which allows optimum navigation throughout the aisles, where shoppers will find an increased iety and range of fresh and local foods including our own meat offering and pre-packed ranges. “Importantly, we have continued the on-site partnership with Nicholl Fuels to offer locals a -hour fuel service with pre-pay pumps and we have  parking spaces to allow shoppers to conveniently load their cars safely.” The team has also retained important services including the Post Office, ATM, Lotto and PayPoint and added even more amenities and initiatives to bring value and choice to the area. The deli now serves an extended range of hot and cold food to go alongside Barista Bar coffee and Spar bakery, and shoppers can take advantage of the many deals available including the current  Deals of Christmas campaign which drops the price of big name items and festive essentials every week in the lead up to Christmas. Paul continued: “Eurospar also price matches over a thousand branded products to Tesco each week, so paired with our consistent schedule of value deals, we’re bringing a huge amount of savings for shoppers.” As is the Lynch and Eurospar ethos, the team in-store will implement outreach initiatives with the local community, sponsoring and supporting local clubs and organisations, while also fundraising for charity partner Cancer Fund for Children. Paddy Doody, sales and marketing director at Henderson Group, which owns the Eurospar brand in Northern Ireland added: “We now have  Eurospar supermarkets in Northern Ireland, each one bringing a wealth of convenience in a large format supermarket to their areas. “The Lynch’s are experienced independent retailers and know how to engage with their local communities, with an incredibly high bar set for customer service. “Its fantastic to see the Eurospar brand thriving under our independent retailers and we wish Lynch’s the best of luck with their new business.” The new supermarket in Greysteel joins Lynch’s portfolio of stores including Eurospars in the Skeoge area of Derry and Draperstown in Magherafelt, plus Spars in Dungiven, Claudy, Newbuildings and Trench Road in Co Derry, and Clonoe in Coalisland.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Niamh Hawes hasbeen taking part in Miss Bikini Ireland for the last year and achieved a top  spotDerry NewsDerry girl lands top  spot inMiss Bikini Ireland overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The man is being treated for abdomen would in Altnagelvin Hospital.Derry NewsMan in critical condition in hospital following Derry stabbing overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Niamh said: “I want to model full time which is one of the reasons I entered the competition. I model around Derry and Belfast and one of the photographers I work with in Derry sent me a link online to enter the competition. “The next day the organiser of the competition, Greg, rang me and told me I was accepted and walked me through the next steps. “It was my first ever show and I had no experience in runway modelling. I wanted to enter because I thought it would be a great way to get experience of runway modelling and performing in front of crowds. It’s also a great way to get more exposure all around Ireland and beyond.” In a normal year, without Covid restrictions, the competition normally has three stages A photoshoot workshop, a fitness workshop and then the finals. This year, due to Covid, there was one photoshoot workshopin October last year in Dublin and the fitness workshop was cancelled as it wasn’t possible to do with social distancing. The finals which were originally supposed to be held in December  but they were delayed to January this year as a result of lockdown. This was then delayed again to allow for a more normal setting for the finals. Niamh continued: “The finals took place this weekend, December , so it’s been a long road. “The competition is full of challenges and tests to see that the winner is fit to head off and represent Ireland at swimsuit USA in America. “So, throughout the competition the photoshoots and workshops and working with other brands is all a test for howprofessionalyou are and how well you can work with photographers, brands and other models. “It’s also about a healthy body and lestyle so they’re looking for someone who is passionate about physical and mental health. “For example, one of our challenges throughout was promoting our sponsor, Beauty Belle, on social media s and doing weekly posts. Then, the big challenge at the final to test how confident you are in front of a crowd. “I absolutely loved the experience and I’m so grateful for it, the final reallywasa night I’ll always remember. “I was terried when I was travelling to Limerick but when I got there and out on stage I was really in my element and it confirmed this is exactly the kind of thing that I want to continue doing in the future. “I love the rush I get being out of my comfort zone andthatswhat modelling does for me, nerves are good. “I was disappointed that so many of the opportunities throughout were held off or not able to happen because of Covid, I would’ve really liked to spend more time with the other girls and get to know them more as they were lovely and made the whole experience. I was one of two girls from the North, I didn’t get to see much of them. I was also really pleased with placing top six at my first ever show, I would’ve just been happy to complete it. The whole experience really boosted my confidence. “I really want to say a big thank you to The Beauty Edit makeup shop inFoyleside, my personal trainer, Peter Ward, and my friends and family who supported me especially my Mammy, Shauna and my best friend, Erin who travelled to Limerick with me. “Over the next year, in preparation for Miss Bikini  , I will be taking up any opportunities I can to grow my confidence and to grow as a person and grow my . I will be training so I can be the best candidate possible next year. “This year, I did the show for the experience and fun but it’s made me realise how much I want the title now and I don’t plan on letting anything distract me from it in the next year.” To support Niamh’sjourney for the next year, follow her on Instagram at:niamh.hawes  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Niamh Hawes hasbeen taking part in Miss Bikini Ireland for the last year and achieved a top  spotDerry NewsDerry girl lands top  spot inMiss Bikini Ireland overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The man is being treated for abdomen would in Altnagelvin Hospital.Derry NewsMan in critical condition in hospital following Derry stabbing overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

I am calling on the Education Minister to introduce regulations to cap unorm costs and provide statutory guidance to schools to ensure school unorms are made affordable for families. “A recent poll of parents showed that % were concerned about the rising costs of unorms and PE gear, while % said they getinto debt to cover the costs. Unorms and PE gear are costing parents hundreds of pounds, per-child, every year. This is unacceptable and must be addressed. With the cost of living rising, urgent action is needed to support families and I am calling on theEducation Minister to legislate to ease the burden of school unorm costs. Sinn Feacutein will continue to work to ensure school unorms are affordable for all families.”  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Niamh Hawes hasbeen taking part in Miss Bikini Ireland for the last year and achieved a top  spotDerry NewsDerry girl lands top  spot inMiss Bikini Ireland overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The man is being treated for abdomen would in Altnagelvin Hospital.Derry NewsMan in critical condition in hospital following Derry stabbing overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Since April of this year, there have been  donors and families who have enabled  patients to receive a le-saving transplant in Northern Ireland. Statistics have shown that % of people in Northern Ireland support organ donation, but only % have signed the Organ Donor Register. Mayor Warke said: Making the decision on whether or not to become an organ donor is a big decision and a personal one for each inidual. Its important that we all take the time to think about our own choice, and to share that choice with our family and friends. Christmas is a time for giving, and one of the greatest gts that any of us could give is the gt of le. The statistics around organ donation are really quite incredible. One organ donor can save the lives of up to nine people, and with around  iniduals currently on the waiting list in Northern Ireland, every single donor makes a huge dference to potentially saving someones le. Its vitally important to remember that loved ones will always be involved before any organ donation can go ahead.

Mayor of Derry, Alderman Grahame Warke and Bishops Donal McKeown and Brian Forster feature in the emotional film produced as a tribute to the pandemic. The film tells the story of the restrictions placed on families and friends, who never really got an opportunity to say goodbye to loved ones.  The film featues very sensitive and emotional tribute paid to a loved one who passed away by the recital of the poem Goodbye by Thornhill pupil, Tieghan Doherty, at the end of the film.  Joseph McCarthy, the writer, director and producer of Grief, thanked everyone involved in the production of the film and Derry and Strabane District Council and Derry Credit Union for supporting it.  He added: “Paddy Simpson, from Brunswick Moviebowl who screened the film and was very supportive of Grief, deserves a special word of thanks, as do Charles Bradley and Joe Parke from Bradley and McLaughlin Undertakers, Bishop Forster, Bishop McKeown and Mayor Warke.” The film can be viewed on YouTube by means of several links on Black North Productions’ Facebook page and has had over  views in less than a week. Next up for the local film company will be their anti-bullying film, Summary Justice, which deals with the ongoing issue of bullying in schools and will involve local pupils, parents, several teachers and the principal of Saint Saviours College, where most of the action takes place.   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Niamh Hawes hasbeen taking part in Miss Bikini Ireland for the last year and achieved a top  spotDerry NewsDerry girl lands top  spot inMiss Bikini Ireland overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The man is being treated for abdomen would in Altnagelvin Hospital.Derry NewsMan in critical condition in hospital following Derry stabbing overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Mayor of Derry, Alderman Grahame Warke and Bishops Donal McKeown and Brian Forster feature in the emotional film produced as a tribute to the pandemic. The film tells the story of the restrictions placed on families and friends, who never really got an opportunity to say goodbye to loved ones.  The film featues very sensitive and emotional tribute paid to a loved one who passed away by the recital of the poem Goodbye by Thornhill pupil, Tieghan Doherty, at the end of the film.  Joseph McCarthy, the writer, director and producer of Grief, thanked everyone involved in the production of the film and Derry and Strabane District Council and Derry Credit Union for supporting it.  He added: “Paddy Simpson, from Brunswick Moviebowl who screened the film and was very supportive of Grief, deserves a special word of thanks, as do Charles Bradley and Joe Parke from Bradley and McLaughlin Undertakers, Bishop Forster, Bishop McKeown and Mayor Warke.” The film can be viewed on YouTube by means of several links on Black North Productions’ Facebook page and has had over  views in less than a week. Next up for the local film company will be their anti-bullying film, Summary Justice, which deals with the ongoing issue of bullying in schools and will involve local pupils, parents, several teachers and the principal of Saint Saviours College, where most of the action takes place.   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Niamh Hawes hasbeen taking part in Miss Bikini Ireland for the last year and achieved a top  spotDerry NewsDerry girl lands top  spot inMiss Bikini Ireland overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The man is being treated for abdomen would in Altnagelvin Hospital.Derry NewsMan in critical condition in hospital following Derry stabbing overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Now, more than  years on, Marie-Claire revisited the project to see how Irish identity has changed. The book contains the personal reflections of  contributors from a iety of sectors, backgrounds and viewpoints on their identity and what it means to them to ‘be Irish, The contributions come from the ranks of the famous and not so famous, people at the centre of things and people at the margins, people who live in Ireland and those who live abroad, the Irish and not-Irish-but-interested. Contributors include Lisa McGee, playwright and writer of Derry GirlsDr Teresa Lambe, co-inventor of the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine General Martin Dempsey, former chair- person of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in the US Mervyn Gibson, Grand Secretary of the Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland Merlin Holland, Oscar Wilde’s only grandchild well-known broad- caster Eamonn HolmesNorthern Irish jockeyAP McCoy singer- songwriter Ryan McMullan Irish Olympian, Sonia O’Sullivan and many more. Speaking on the book and her decision to edit it now, Marie-Claire said: “Having both lived and travelled outside Ireland, I became aware of how strong the sense of identity was amongst the Irish. I was also conscious that change was sweeping across the Island of Ireland and I was curious to discover just how robust or fluid Irish identity was during this time of profound change.” “Above all, the reflections in the book show that there are many ways of being Irish.

Now, more than  years on, Marie-Claire revisited the project to see how Irish identity has changed. The book contains the personal reflections of  contributors from a iety of sectors, backgrounds and viewpoints on their identity and what it means to them to ‘be Irish, The contributions come from the ranks of the famous and not so famous, people at the centre of things and people at the margins, people who live in Ireland and those who live abroad, the Irish and not-Irish-but-interested. Contributors include Lisa McGee, playwright and writer of Derry GirlsDr Teresa Lambe, co-inventor of the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine General Martin Dempsey, former chair- person of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in the US Mervyn Gibson, Grand Secretary of the Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland Merlin Holland, Oscar Wilde’s only grandchild well-known broad- caster Eamonn HolmesNorthern Irish jockeyAP McCoy singer- songwriter Ryan McMullan Irish Olympian, Sonia O’Sullivan and many more. Speaking on the book and her decision to edit it now, Marie-Claire said: “Having both lived and travelled outside Ireland, I became aware of how strong the sense of identity was amongst the Irish. I was also conscious that change was sweeping across the Island of Ireland and I was curious to discover just how robust or fluid Irish identity was during this time of profound change.” “Above all, the reflections in the book show that there are many ways of being Irish. We can be Irish by birth, Irish by ancestry, Irish by geography, Irish and British, Irish by accident, Northern Irish, Irish by necessity, Irish and European, Irish by association, Irish by culture, Irish and American and Irish by choice. “The collection is a tribute to the honesty of the contributors, and I would like to record how much I appreciate their commitment. “It started as a passion project for me, a topic I was genuinely curious. “Themore I spoke with the dferent contributors and read their stories, the more I was convinced of the books signicance as a snapshot of Irish identity today.

Its clothing perfectly suited to the GAA fan looking for something slightly dferent, without club crests and sponsor logos.Fergal, along with his twin brother Fergal and friend Paul Hughes – Chairman of Derrytresk– is happy with how their brand has progressed. Originally, they had planned to launch for Christmas, but a change saw them get the ball rolling in April, in time for the twins th birthday celebrations.“It gave us something to focus on and one of the jumpers has  on the back, to signy the year we were born,” Fergal told the County Derry Post.There was always an interest in designing and a clothing brand was never far from his thoughts. During his playing days, hed never be far away when new kits were being deigned. A retro jersey released as part of Slaughtneils gear range had his fingerprints on it.“We are from a farming background, it is not the sort of thing youd associate us with...getting into fashion,” Fergal jokes.“But, its always something we have been interested in. I just think a lot of the GAA gear is based on playing members and wanted to do something dferent to appeal to our non-playing members as much as players.“A lot of it will carry club badges and sponsor logos, whereas not everybody wants to wear that kind of product to go to games.”Still playing for the clubs recreational team, he coaches the U footballers and hurlers. There is a pride in pulling into Emmet Park and seeing the Gael Foacutersa range, across dferent ages and colours. Interchangeable caps. Beanies. Shorts. Sweatshirts. T-Shirts. Half-zips. From black to white and green to mango, there is something for everyone. “I am not necessarily going to pull on my club gear, but I still want to pull on something that will associate you with the GAA,” he explains of their brands unique selling point.The name – Gael Foacutersa #WeAllBelong – was spun out of that inkling he had all those years ago.“I always had it in my head, thatI ever did start up a brand, that Gael Force would be the name I would go with,” Fergal explains.“We wanted to keep the Irish slant on it as well. It is very important to the club and community.”And so, Gael Foacutersa – True Gael – was born. After some scribbling with the lettering, the logo eventually came to le by accident. “The plan was to launch it on the lead up to Christmas”, Fergal adds. “Then we thought, the idea is there and well get something out there. Me and Francis, it was our th birthday in April, wed give ourselves a date to work to, to have the product launched.“We are very thankful for the support we have got from everybody. You now notice now the orders coming in, even from other counties, so it definitely seems to be going the right way.”Nestled deep within the brand is the importance of knowing that the game is much more than being part of the squad and taking to the field. It is about identity. A sense of belonging and inclusivity. Being part of a community of like-minded people with a mutual love for traditions and heritage.“So much of our young children and adult lives have become about the constant need to train, to diet, to play, to watch, to support, to belong but ultimately to win,” Gael Foacutersa outline in the story on their website.“Gael Foacutersa is about getting away from these pressures and the responsibilities of the game.We want to take it back to the basics. It’s about the enjoyment of it all and putting smiles on peoples faces.“The Gael Foacutersa range offers high-quality, comfortable and eye-catching men’s and ladies leisurewear. It aims to reinforce the customer’s sense of identity. To be more than just about the game. It’s about being part of something bigger.” googletag.cmd.push For the full range, check out their website: www.gaelforsa.ie  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Niamh Hawes hasbeen taking part in Miss Bikini Ireland for the last year and achieved a top  spotDerry NewsDerry girl lands top  spot inMiss Bikini Ireland overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The man is being treated for abdomen would in Altnagelvin Hospital.Derry NewsMan in critical condition in hospital following Derry stabbing overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

At a media briefing, he stated there were inherent internal contradictions in the bans and said, Weve seen these before where you ban flights except for your own citizens. Is it that some passport holders will have the virus and some wont  Does the virus read your passport  Does the virus know your nationality or where youre legally resident  Our concern here is that we apply public health principles, not political principles to selecting measures that are used to control the spread of disease. He made the comments in the wake of tightening border restrictions across dozens of countries in response to the Omicron iant. WHO Director-General, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, also called on countries to take rational and proportional risk-reduction measures. He said, Blanket travel bans will not prevent the international spread of Omicron and they place a heavy burden on lives and livelihoods. Dr Ryan suggested other ways to manage risk: There are ways that you can de-risk travel in terms of having increased testing, more testing before departure, more testing on arrival, quarantine until negative testing. There is a whole series of things that can be done that will manage the risk of importation of disease or even exporting disease to another country which fall short of blanket bans. The idea that you can put a hermetic seal on most countries is just frankly not possible. We all know that, weve seen that happen before. And certainly there has to be consistency. If [the bans] are being applied, they have to be consistent.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Niamh Hawes hasbeen taking part in Miss Bikini Ireland for the last year and achieved a top  spotDerry NewsDerry girl lands top  spot inMiss Bikini Ireland overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The man is being treated for abdomen would in Altnagelvin Hospital.Derry NewsMan in critical condition in hospital following Derry stabbing overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

They also provide underage hurling via St Patricks, an amalgamation with their parish neighbours St Colms Drum.When Derry won the All-Ireland title in , the countys most successful era, Richard Ferris was part of the winning formula and scored a goal in their opening round against Down that season. Joe Irwin won an Ulster medal with the county and Eunan Rafferty was also on Derry teams in that era.The clubs recent underage development work has provided Michael Mullan to Derrys Ulster minor winning team of , with Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Dara and Ruairi Rafferty part of the group who repeated the feat two seasons later on their way to the All-Ireland Final.Current senior captain Tiarnaacuten Woods has represented Derry at minor and U level, with McHugh and Ruairi Rafferty – who have played senior hurling with Kevin Lynchs – having also played the wee ball game for the county.On the camogie field, Una Rafferty and Aoe Kelly have represented Derry at minor and U level respectively. It has all comeas a result of the work being done at the club.“It is great to have Richard Ferris back involved again,” Shane adds. “He has set up a winter programme in place for the players in first to fth year , with the older players getting looked after under the senior  with their strength and conditioning.”The current senior group has benefited from the influx of youth as they have one eye on the Derry IFC Quarter-Finals later this month.McGonigle paid tribute to those who have sat on club committees down through the years and it has been bolstered with new blood coming on board in recent years to help with the clubs progression. Another great development has been an influx in new coaches coming forward at primary school level. Every bit helps. Like many other clubs across Ireland, Drumsurn reaches deeper into the locality. They are more than just GAA. Its a social hub that knits everyone together, regardless of age. It offers an identity.On top of their day to day club activities and s. Fitness classes, male and female, are a valuable facet of the club, while they also host Irish dancing and bowls.The club has also recently formed a mental health committee and have put in place a full winter program to complement this initiative. There are also plans for Irish language classes. There is never a dull moment. The clubs heart beats strong.“We as a club are very community focused,” Shane stresses. “In the past year we have brought the Action Cancer big bus for two days and also provided a defibrillator in a cabinet for our communitys use.”Since moving to their current premises, Billy Doran Park, in , they have added a training pitch and a club gym.The Club Committee set out a three-phase ground development plan in . The first phase of a new kitchen plus internal and external toilet blocks was completed in  with the changing rooms refurbished in .Phase , currently going through planning, includes a walking track, new floodlights and ball-wall. It all leads into Phase , a floodlit G pitch.“Our proposed ground developments are going to cost in excess of pound,,” McGonigle points out. “For a club of less than  members, this is a massive undertaking.”Drumsurn have set themselves a target of having phases two and three complete for their Centenary Year in .“Unfortunately, as with many other aspects of le, Covid has put a stop to conventional fundraising activities for the moment,” Shane outlines. “So we decided to set up Drumsurn GAC Competitions as a way of raising some much needed funds.” For more information and details on how to enter Drumsurns competition, visit www.drumsurngaccompetitions    *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Niamh Hawes hasbeen taking part in Miss Bikini Ireland for the last year and achieved a top  spotDerry NewsDerry girl lands top  spot inMiss Bikini Ireland overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The man is being treated for abdomen would in Altnagelvin Hospital.Derry NewsMan in critical condition in hospital following Derry stabbing overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Pic by Inpho Photography.Reporter: Daragh Ó Conchúir Dec Email: sport@derrypost  addthis, All-Ireland senior camogie semi-final Slaughtneil - googletag.cmd.push Oulart-the-Ballagh- First-half goals from Wexford legends Uacutena Leacy and Ursual Jacob and eight points from play by the Kehoe twins, Shelley and Stacey, ended Slaughtneil’s bid for a fth consecutive AIB All-Ireland senior club camogie final appearance, as  champions Oulart-The Ballagh held the former three-in-a-row victors at arm’sin the second half to prevail at Donaghmore Ashbourne by - to -. Oulart have another giant to slay in next Saturday’s decider at Nowlan Park as titleholders Sarsfields lie in wait following their - to - victory over Drom  Inch yesterday. On this evidence, they look more than capable of doing so, their wealth of experience and scoring power capable of accounting for any outfit on a going day, with apart from the aforementioned, the likes of skipper and another ex-Model County hero Mary Leacy, Ciara Storey, Anais Curran and Aideen Brennan all involved. A ruthless first-half showing with the wind laid the groundwork for the victors, as it forced their Derry opponents to discard their tried and trusted system of restriction. This meant that even as they had the elements in the second half, more gaps existed than they would normally allow and they were capitalised upon by Oulart.

Oulart have another giant to slay in next Saturday’s decider at Nowlan Park as titleholders Sarsfields lie in wait following their - to - victory over Drom  Inch yesterday. On this evidence, they look more than capable of doing so, their wealth of experience and scoring power capable of accounting for any outfit on a going day, with apart from the aforementioned, the likes of skipper and another ex-Model County hero Mary Leacy, Ciara Storey, Anais Curran and Aideen Brennan all involved. A ruthless first-half showing with the wind laid the groundwork for the victors, as it forced their Derry opponents to discard their tried and trusted system of restriction. This meant that even as they had the elements in the second half, more gaps existed than they would normally allow and they were capitalised upon by Oulart. Given the final margin, the opening nine minutes were hugely signicant, at the end of which the red and blacks led by - to -. After Shauna Sinnott pointed almost from the throw-in, Stacey Kehoe and Jacob slotted a pair apiece before Uacutena Leacy planted just the latest in a career of major goals, making no mistake after Shelley Kehoe drew the cover with a run through the middle.

I, like many other families, cycle with my we and three small children and this space and environment to enjoy that time together safely and without fear of accident or injury is a blessing, said Cllr Lewis.ldquoNewry Mourne and Down Council proudly supports active and healthy communities and this cycle lane connects the local council to Stormont in a collective effort to improve the health and wellbeing of residents through the promotion of cycling and the enjoyment of outdoor leisure.Cllr Lewis also congratulated his Slieve Croob colleague, Cllr Andrew McMurray, who has been proactive in ensuring the district is marked on the map in terms of provision of safe cycle routes.He also revealed that Cllr McMurray has challenged him to a timed lap of the new route when it opens and hopes the event will raise money for a local charity, while the duo have a bit of fun along the way.Cllr Lewis said he has asked the Department for Infrastructure to consider the needs of those who need access to agricultural land that runs adjacent to the new pathway and cycling route, during construction and when it is completed.ldquoLand along this particular route is utilised for barley, potatoes and grazing, with the ground rotated each season which means that the fields are regularly in use throughout the year, he explained.ldquoPolice regularly pull in farmers driving along this stretch of road requesting that they facilitate traffic flow by waiting in a lay-by, allowing the build-up of traffic behind them to pass.Cllr Lewis said he has asked the government department consider how itrsquos going to accommodate agricultural or slow-moving traffic, suggesting that the original lay-by structure in the area needs to be maintained and protected to allow for safe access.He added: ldquoThese issues certainly arenrsquot impediments nor am I seeking to cause an obstruction.

I am contacted about cleansing issues on a daily basis and while working with council staff a solution is found, butrobust processes and procedures were in place, this should be routinely completed and no major issues should arise.Cllr Sharvin says he is also keen to see greater attention on cleaning play parks, explaining that currently there is no formal process to do so and operates on adhoc basis.ldquoGiven the increase of use play parks during Covid and the councilrsquos objective to increase healthy living in our communities, itrsquos vitality important that we clean and maintain our play parks on a regular basis. Council officials have agreed to replace surface safety tiles at our play parks and I hope this programme will continue to be rolled out, he said.Cllr Sharvin said that following the recent workshop, council officers are to compile a report which will be discussed by councillors..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29November2021-ADMakeItLocal.jpg","title":"District’s battering from Storm Barra  ","story":"DOWN District was pummelled by Storm Barra yesterday with gale force winds and driving rain coinciding with a spring high tide to wreak havoc.Thunder and lightning was added into the heady weather mix with the storm conditions bringing down a number of trees along the coastline.

He and his we, Charlotte, live near Edinburgh and have three sons, Angus, Jack and Hector.His introduction to rowing came only six years ago when he took up skf racing. He competed at the  world championships in Strangford Lough where he won a silver medal and went on to win two gold medals at the  world championships in Stranraer.Clive admits to being highly competitive and that after winning world titles he was looking to take another step forward.A TV documentary about explorer Ben Fogle and Olympic rower James Cracknell rowing across the Atlantic fired his imagination and he signed up for the Talisker Atlantic Challenge in January  along with his medal-winning team-mates, Ian Baird, Duncan Hughes and Ross McKinney, plus a friend, Fraser Potter.They formed a team, Five in a Row, and then set about putting their project together, which involved the not inconsiderable matter of raising pound, to cover their costs.They managed to get the money and then obtained a boat, which, they were delighted to learn, had been rowed by three Scottish brothers in a previous Atlantic Challenge race.Clive says: ldquoIt was tough going, but we managed to raise the money. The boat is excellent, but we tried to lighten it as much as possible in order to make easier. Even so, we are putting in enough food and water to last a minimum of  days, plus our clothes and sleeping gear.The boat will also carry navigation and safety equipment, plus satellite phones to keep in touch with their loved ones and other competitors.During the voyage, three crew members will be rowing at any time, while the other two are resting, and safety harnesses will be worn at all times.ldquoWersquove trained hard and prepared well and I know that racing two kilometres in a skf race bears no comparison with what lies ahead, but wersquore all looking forward to the race, Clive added.Clive and his team-mates are hoping to raise pound, for the Reverse Rett charity, which supports children with Rett Syndrome, a neurological degenerative disease.Anyone wishing to make a donation is asked to go to visit https:www.justgiving fundraising ross-mckinney.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29November2021-ADMakeItLocal.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C  December 12%2C 2001  ","story":"SAINTFIELD ndash Saintfield is in line for a new multi-million pound hotel development which is set to create up to  jobs.

pop royalty and real-le royalty, George Lowdenrsquos guitars are known to be the best in the world.The Prince of Wales recently made known his knowledge of and fascination with Georgersquos guitars and Ed Sheeran reportedly likes to keep one handy in nearly every room of his house.With Niall Horan of One Direction and Dubliner singer songwriter Dermot Kennedy becoming the latest owners of the bespoke guitars, Georgersquos company, Lowden Guitars, has just announced its latest collaboration with Sheeran.To celebrate the release of his most recent album, Sheeran has teamed up with George, who founded the firm in , to design and create a signature guitar worthy of music royalty.The Sheeran by Lowden Equals Edition guitar will also be available to the public to purchase, with a limited edition run of , available through Lowdenrsquos global dealer network.Itrsquos the second joint project with Sheeran, following on from their range of more affordable guitars.The latest achievement comes in the wake of George recently meeting the Prince of Wales at a Windsor Castle reception to mark Lowden Guitars winning the  Queenrsquos Awards for Enterprise.He also launched a new range of limited edition guitars to mark his th birthday over the summer which features specications chosen by George.Itrsquos all a far cry from when the renowned luthier first began to hand-make guitars for his own use.He could never have known that his determination to make the best guitar would see his name travel around the world and be spoken of by royalty.ldquoTherersquos quite a lot of things that have happened that I never could have imagined. When I started out, I had no formal training in the manufacture of guitars, explained George.ldquoIn a way, that gave me the confidence to take some risks, innovate and produce an instrument that has a completely unique voicing.He found the Prince of Wales to be very interested in the guitarsrsquo manufacture and may have even suggested a new development.ldquoWe had a great chat and he asked quite a lot of questions about the wood, all kinds and how we found it, said George.ldquoHe was also very interested in dieback ash, asking aboutit would be a very good way to use the trees as a lot have perished due to this disease.ldquoIt wouldnrsquot be the best toned wood you could find but Irsquove been thinking more about that since and wondering whether we could use it for guitar necks or not so we might do a little experiment to seeit works.From creating coveted instruments for top Irish and UK guitarists in the know, Lowden Guitars have become an international sales success mdash hence the Queenrsquos Award.George explained: ldquoThe company is far bigger than I ever envisaged. In some ways itrsquos good but I never tried to expand the company and get the kind of growth we have enjoyed. It just kind of happened over the years as organic growth which has been great.His guitars tend to sell by word of mouth from musician to musician and the actual experience of playing a Lowden and relishing its distinct tones at first hand.ldquoWherever in the world where we sell, we are still quite a niche, upper end company so the guitars are at the highest price level in all of the countries, said George.ldquoItrsquos a natural process where people see the guitars for the first time. They go into a shop and then over a period of a few years the reputation builds within that country. Our presence also grows and then we move into more specialist guitar shops, so it all takes time.ldquoI remember as a teenager I was mad keen to get a Gibson  which I saw in Matchettrsquos shop window in Belfast all those years ago and I couldnrsquot afford it.ldquoIf something is really good, and the young player comes in and plays it but canrsquot afford it, it goes into his or her mind and later on they find a way to afford it.George says the Covid pandemic has not impact on sales, although it has had other consequences.George said: ldquoIt didnrsquot impact on us for sales as our order book remained very firm but it was more to do with making the guitars as we had to completely re-organise the factory for better social distancing which was very expensive.ldquoWe had to close down the factory for a while in order to do that and more with people having to isolate it proved challenging..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29November2021-ADMakeItLocal.jpg","title":"Magpies fly high in Breffni Park  ","story":"DOWN kingpins Kilcoo qualied for an Ulster semi-final after a good performance at Kingspan Breffni Park on Saturday evening, defeating Cavan-based Ramor United by  points.The Magpies, reigning Ulster champions, will meet Glen of Derry in the last four in what will be a massive clash in two weeks time.It was tit-for-tat early on but the home side got a massive confidence boost in the fth minute via a well taken Sean McEvoy goal, their most impressive performer on the night.Kilcoorsquos response was emphatic though, firstly Ceilum Doherty stuck over a nice point and then that man Jerome Johnston done what he does best and fired to the net to put his side into a lead they would never relinquish.Further scores from Ryan McEvoy, Shealan Johnston and Doherty again sent them in four up at the water-break.The second period of the first half turned out to be poor affair with both sides missing good scoring chances.

McCollam fired over another point in the th minute and pointed a free at the very end while trying to it in on the Downpatrick area to poach a late goal.McCloskey didnrsquot score in the second half and being out of general play resulted in his normally reliable free-taking also taking a hit.At the other end the outnumbered Downpatrick forwards had to survive on scraps as well but they could always rely on their free-takers.Goalkeeper Pearse Smyth landed two points from inside his own half, while Tom McGrattan converted three frees and landed a point from play as well.McGrattan was the star of the game and he capped a brilliant inidual performance with two late plays that effectively took his team into the final.With the game in the balance at - each in the rd minute, McGrattan jinked his way along the sideline under the stand to win himself a free.It was an acute angle, but the Portaferry clubman arrowed the sliotar between the uprights.Then less than a minute later he played a beautul cross-field pass into the path of mid-fielder Finn Turpin, who stepped inside the defender and hit the roof of the net from  metres out.St Patrickrsquos were through to their first ever Danske Bank Mageean Cup final where they will play St Patrickrsquos Maghera at the Dub Arena on Friday week, December .But back again to that breath-taking first half.After five minutes, the teams had each scored three points. By the tenth minute, Jack McCloskey had cut through the Red High cover and shot to the net off the base of the right hand post.Within three minutes Downpatrick were a point up. McGrattan went around the left side of the Ballymena defence at full pace to rle to the roof of the net for one of the best goals that you will see at any level.Aodhan McGarry responded by pointing from a side-line and the water-break broke the action at - each.McGarry started the second quarter scoring with a fine point but a run of three successive scores from Finn Turpin, McGrattan and Oisin Coulter edged the Red High ahead again.However, three frees from Jack McCloskey and a point from Ronan McCollam put Ballymena in the lead by - to - at half-time.By the second water break Downpatrick were - to - ahead, mainly through frees and St Louisrsquo were now looking for scores from distance.The next  minutes went scoreless. In hindsight Ballymena snatched at a couple of scoring chances that might have put pressure on the eventual winners who pumped a lot of ball in high on the north Antrim defence with no .Eventually sub Tom McFerran brought the teams level and McCollam from the left wing gave St Louisrsquo the lead. The gauntlet had been thrown down for the Red High.Oisin Coulter landed a much-needed Downpatrick point in reply and they held firm until Tom McGrattan delivered the match-winning scores.It is scant consolation for Ballymena that they played their part in a fine display of schoolsrsquo hurling, but a number of players stood out including Daire McMullan, Connor Dickson and Dara Martin in defence and McCollam and McCloskey in attack until tempered by Downpatrickrsquos packed back line.Defence was ultimately the winning of the game, but they would not have got across the line without Turpin, Oisin Coulter and especially the mercurial Tom McGrattan.As a hurling disciple of the great Bro Charles in the s, I was a proud man leaving the Dub on Friday evening.For the generations of hurlers who climbed to the top of the hill on Saul Street each morning over the past  or  years, winning a Mageean was just not on the radar.This team is only  minutes from achieving what for us was the impossible.St Patrickrsquos: P Smyth - frees, J Ruddy, R OrsquoNeill, D Coulter, S Mageean, D Mallon, C Lenaghan, T Connolly -, F Turpin -, M Dorrian -, A Connolly, T McGrattan - , O Coulter -, R McGrath, S McCarthy.Subs: F MacManus for A Connolly , LMcCabe for S McCarthy , F Casey for R McGrath ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29November2021-ADMakeItLocal.jpg","title":"Road officials set to carry out survey at Ballynahinch school  ","story":"PLANS by roads officials to carry out a survey on the main road outside Ballynahinch Primary School have been welcomed by Strangford MLA Peter Weir.The work will be carried out to assess the potential for a new pedestrian crossing and while pleased that the survey is to take place, Mr Weir is disappointed that there are no current plans to also introduce a temporary mph speed limit at the Dromore Road as part of a province-wide Department for Infrastructure initiative.Mr Weir mdash who has met with school principal Mr Michael Moore mdash said the safety of children who have to cross the busy road was of paramount importance and a real issue of concern for parents and residents.The former Education Minister said he was ldquodisappointed that the school had not been included in the Roads Departmentrsquos part-time mph speed limit scheme.ldquoI believe that the Department needs to give a clear commitment that Ballynahinch Primary School will be included in the next roll-out of the scheme, said Mr Weir.ldquoThe Dromore Road is busy and is also a bus route.

In my opinion, such an appointment is crucial and could benefit the town and the business community a great deal.ldquoThe night time economy is one area that needs to be improved not only in Downpatrick but where, but rapid progress this in the current Covid climate may not be possible.ldquoHowever, there is no reason why ideas to regenerate our night time economy cannot be discussed now to lay plans for the future, he continued.Cllr Curran said every high street is dferent, with many people keen to see them become vibrant shopping hubs at the heart of local communities, explaining that the work of the Stormont task force could not be more timely.He added: ldquoAnything that can be done to increase footfall in our town centres in the future will be more than welcome.The call for evidence document is available at https:www.executiveoffice-ni.gov.uk consultations call-evidence-high-street-task-force, while responses to the call for evidence can be made to highstreet@communities-ni.gov.uk..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/12366892.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Monaghan.DAERA officials have also confirmed, late last night, the presence of Avian Influenza in two wild birds retrieved from the Belfast Waterworks site earlier this week.Disease control zones have been put in place around all infected premises to mitigate against onward disease spread.Under the new housing measures, all bird keepers in NI will be legally required to keep their birds indoors or otherwise separate from wild birds, and to follow strict biosecurity measures.This applies to owners of pet birds, commercial flocks or just a few birds in a backyard or hobby flock.Announcing the decision to introduce a housing order, Minister Poots said: ldquoI took the decision to introduce the new housing measures in order to try to prevent an incursion of avian influenza into the poultry flock in Northern Ireland.ldquoIt is now a legal requirement for all poultry and captive bird keepers to keep their birds housed or otherwise separate from wild birds.ldquoThis decision was based on sound expert advice and in consultation with industry.ldquoThis decision to house is an additional step to the Avian Influenza Prevention Zoneintroduced on November , and is another necessary precautionary measure requiring all bird keepers to keep their birds housed.ldquoThese housing measures build on the strengthened biosecurity measures that were brought in as part of the AIPZ.ldquoSince my decision to introduce the housing order, we have now discovered avian flu in two wild birds in Belfast ndash that tells us unequivocally that the disease is already here and in our wild bird population.ldquoKeeping it out of the commercial flocks is now down to our poultry sector and the measures they take to keep the disease out.ldquoAdhering to, and a constant review of, all biosecurity measures is the best weapon we have to avoid an incursion.ldquoMy officials will continue to liaise closely with stakeholders and colleagues in GB and the Republic as the situation develops.To assist all bird keepers in complying with the new rules, a Biosecurity self-assessment tool has been developed that is available on the DAERA website.If avian influenza were to enter NI, the disease would have a signicant and devastating impact on our poultry industry, international trade and the wider economy.Poultry and captive bird keepers are advised to be vigilant for any signs of disease in their birds and any wild birds, and to seek prompt advice from their vetthey have any concerns.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Contributors include Lord Trimble, Graham Gudgin, Ray Bassett, Mike Nesbitt, Jeff Dudgeon and News Letter editor Ben Lowry. There is a foreword by Baroness Hoey. As of late , the book is available for £. through Blackstaff Press and Amazon Later concessions include the On-the-Runletters of comfort for hundreds of IRA volunteers an “amnesty” in relation to the use of forensic evidence on decommissioned weapons and the bodies of the disappeared Royal Prerogative of Mercy pardons prosecution indemnities for witnesses giving evidence at tribunals such as the Bloody Sunday enquiry and the lack of investigations into the people involved in the , bombings and , shootings of the Troubles which did not involve deaths.For some , people who were “only” injured there is to be no justice. Given the anticipated paucity of future prosecutions, except for Army veterans, we are already close to a full amnesty in all but name.Few dare to speak that name, or its iants: drawing a line, a statute of limitations, and putting the past behind us, as happened in both parts of Ireland in the s. But many of the politicians involved privately admit to wanting one. Influential public figures in Northern Ireland who have openly supported an amnesty or iants include influential Catholics and nationalists: John Larkin QC who as Attorney General proposed a stay on prosecutions former Assistant Chief Constable Peter Sheridan Dennis Bradley of the Consultative Group on the Past the former Director of Public Prosecutions, Barra McGrory. The former Lord Chief Justice Sir Declan Morgan called for further inquests to end after five years. Another notable advocate of an amnesty is Sir Desmond Rea, first chairman of the Northern Ireland Policing Board.Jeff Dudgeon is a human rights activist and former Ulster Unionist Party councillor, who has advised the party on legacyIn  Secretary of State Peter Hain introduced the Northern IrelandBill which provided for a “judicially based” amnesty for OTRs and others. The Conservative Shadow Secretary of State, David Lidington, called it “an amnesty in all but name” although Hain replied saying, “an amnesty is when you let people out”. The deal in the Bill had been agreed with Sinn Féin, but when it transpired that it might apply to members of the security forces it foundered. The OTRs had to await another, secret operation put together by Tony Blair and Gerry Adams, involving  “letters of comfort” notying IRA members that they were not wanted by the police for questioning. After the existence of these letters emerged during the trial of John Downey in , the Police Service of Northern Ireland revealed that  of those who received letters were suspects in  murder cases. The Commons’ Northern Ireland Affairs Committeeinvestigated the scheme and concluded that it had “distorted the process of justice”.After years of largely futile discussion, Northern Ireland’s political parties continued to disagree on how best to deal with the legacy of the Troubles. In an attempt to break the impasse, the Northern Ireland Officein March  proposed “a new independent body focused on providing information to families and swt examinations of all unresolved deaths from the Troubles an end to the cycle of reinvestigations that has failed victims and veterans for too long ensuring that Northern Ireland veterans receive equal treatment to their counterparts who served overseas.”The NIO tacked on a reconciliation aspect, but nobody will be reconciled by one-sided, victim-focused justice. The mantra of “truth, justice and reconciliation” is a  god. Impartial professional historians alone can retrieve whatever can be established of the truth, while lack of evidence for prosecutions means that formal justice for the , families whose relatives were killed is impossible.Throughout two decades of legacy recommendations, initiatives and proposed legislation, there has been an accelerating use of the courts to advance the republican narrative, assisted by legal aid. This development has come to be termed ‘lawfare’, and its potential for expansion is limitless. It may be better than warfare, but it is politically debilitating for Northern Ireland. One wing of government, however, is not wedded to normal constitutional stability. We are told the Belfast Agreement brought peace, which is a myth that needs examined. The war ended because the IRA chose to end it, seeing a more promising path. Their demand for ‘all-party talks now’ within a ‘peace process’ proved to be remarkably perceptive. That process is continuing, and in their view can end only with the demise of Northern Ireland. Unionism, in contrast, is about maintaining the status quo and minimising concessions. This is conservative territory which is generally unappealing to the young and woke.The courts, especially in Belfast, remain open to judicial reviews, demands for the re-opening of inquests, civil suits for damages, challenges on convictions, requests for new public inquiries, all alongside Police Ombudsmaninvestigations and Strasbourg cases. The value and cost of all this activity needs to be questioned, but it will take a brave government to put in place legislation to curb the lawfare industry.A civil war was averted in the  years from . No credit is given for that, certainly not to the security forces and their dead. Sadly, young people for the most part have little empathy for those families. Solidarity when shown is largely within the republican community who use law to achieve the ends once reserved to war.During the printing of The Idea of the Union in July, the NIO published a Command Paper “Addressing the Legacy of Northern Ireland’s Past” which proposes an end to pre- criminal investigations. This has appeased veterans in the short term but at the expense of a great deal of outrage from all sides. Without, as proposed, also closing down inquests, civil suits, private prosecutions and judicial reviews, a no-prosecutions policy will do little to reduce the hurt over unfairness, the clogging of the courts or the enormous cost. The basic problem will remain unless lawfare is limited. It can be done, but the NIO will have to steel itself, face down Strasbourg challenges and accept that to rule is to decide. There is no alternative coming from the local political parties.The proposed alternative “truth recovery” bodies have the potential to be as toxic as continued criminal investigationsthere are no cost caps or time limits. The notion of reconciliation is a dead letter evenregularly touted by the NIO. What is possible is a narrowing process. It appears to be under way and has to be supported so far as it goes.Without a grand settlement, which is unlikely given the political nature of the process, the legacy debate will grind on. Nationalist lawfare cannot lose as the legal iants still remain limitless.

By the time of the  World Cup, when the Northern Ireland heroes qualied for the Mexico finals, I did know that there was a dference between Catholic and Protestant, but only because I had by then become interested in politics, and had begun to read about such things.This ignorance of the tribal ide was a common experience among children whose background was middle class Protestant, and I suspect more common than it was among Catholics of a similar background, because church going levels were far, far higher among Catholics than Protestants until quite recently.In , before the Troubles had begun, already under half of Anglicans and Presbyterians in NI were weekly churchgoers. Among Catholics in NI, it was well over %. This experience is one way of illustrating how wrong Mary McAleese and the late Fr Alec Reid were to say that Protestants were brought up to hate Catholics .But even in , while I had become aware of the ide between Catholics and Protestants, I had not come to think of any such ision among the players the Northern Ireland football team, nor did I — or any of my school friends — spend so much as a moment thinking about the religious background of the other sporting names who gave us such joy in those increasingly distant days, from Alex Higgins to Barry McGuigan to Dennis Taylor..As I became older I thought more and more about how dficult it must have been for NI players of a Catholic backgroundin the s. Tensions were high in the province in the aftermath of the hunger strikes and in the run-up to the Anglo Irish Agreement and republicans were waging a campaign to destroy Northern Ireland.So many of the key figures in the NI team over the decades were from a nationalist background. I have no idea what their political affiliations were,any, and no desire to find out. But there is something particularly admirable about someone who showed loyalty to the Northern Ireland team when they might privately have wanted an all-island team.My thoughts ed to the subject this week when I was asked on the BBC Radio Ulster Nolan show to discuss comments by the former NI manager Michael O’Neill and others that the British national anthem, God Save the Queen, might not be the best song to be played before Northern Ireland games. It is a concern that unionists should take very seriously. It would be awfulfootballers and fans from a Catholic background started to drt away from the NI team — as some have always done but so far in relatively small numbers.I mentioned on Nolan that the News Letter facilitated a debate bout changing the anthem away from GSTQ more than a decade ago. The idea attracted strong opinions among NI fans, both for and against.My own view is that the national anthem is less than ideal for any one of the four home nations because it is the anthem of the UK, rather than any one of its countries.However, finding a specic anthem for Northern Ireland would prove tricky, both in getting something that had musical merit and in finding wording that was acceptable to a broad base of fans.The debate about whether or not to use the national anthem or an NI-specic one is quite separate to the suggestion by the football agent Gerry Carlile that both God Save The Queen and the Republic of Ireland’s national anthem, Amhrán na bhFiann , be played at Northern Ireland games.That would be completely unacceptable, because it would strike at the heart of what the NI team is about — which is a team that represents the northern jurisdiction of this island, the existence of which republicans themselves finally came to accept in .The mere fact of the Northern Ireland football teamspresent a considerable challenge for republicans, because those teams have very widespread and instinctive support, even among people in NI who are apolitical. They are, indeed, one of the last representations of Northern Ireland that are openly embraced.Think of what has happened with the centenary. Republicans have in effect thwarted any celebration, Beyond the front page of the News Letter, barely any local institutions have dared to so much as say Happy th! — not even ones that have Northern Ireland in their name, While London has slightly stepped up its support for the centenary at the end of the year, the anniversary is still largely invisible. If the football team is undermined, another plank of Northern Ireland le will be removed.• Ben Lowryis News Letter editor.

High levels of vaccination among the population will greatly reduce the pressures on the NHS.They make another lockdown much less likely, and further lockdowns are to be avoided at all costs, given the huge social and financial damage that they cause.But the change in the Covid certication requirements in Northern Ireland from Monday are not widely understood and have not been sufficiently publicised. There has been a misapprehension that the old cards, given to people when they got their jabs, are not sufficient as proof.Last night the government said that such cards were sufficient. It would be utterly unfairotherwise. Older people who have been conscientious in getting jabbed often have no access to apps and might not have applied for a letter, which is a cumbersome process. It is fair to ask for proof of jabs in certain circumstances but not fair to make that proof too onerous.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Only the six counties of the newly formed Northern Ireland were to be permitted to remain within the United Kingdom. Their devolved Parliament, which had been opened by King George V the previous June , was given the power to vote them out of the all-Ireland settlement, based on dominion status, which the Treaty embodied.   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

They formed a column headed by Lloyd George himself the others, drawn from his Liberal  Unionist coalition cabinet, were Austen Chamberlain, F.E.Smith, Lord Birkenhead , and Winston Churchill.Another column listed the signatures of three of their Irish counterparts, headed by Arthur Grfith, the founder of Sinn Fein in , and followed by the charismatic Michael Collins, the chief organiser of the IRA’s terrorist campaign against Britain, waged from  until July  when a truce was agreed between the two sides. The third Irish signatory, Robert Barton, a Unionist landowner turned Republican and an intimate friend of Collins, was the Sinn Fein delegation’s economic adviser. Never before had British and Irish representatives put their names to a formal agreement of this kind as complete equals. After the signing, which took place at . am, the two sides shook hands for the first time. Trust had replaced the deep suspicion with which they had first regarded each other. Irish leaders, who a few months earlier had been denounced as rebels and murderers, had come to enjoy the respect of the British delegation. Michael Collins had undergone an astonishing transformation from terrorist leader to statesman, gaining the admiration of two prominent members of the British team, Churchill and Birkenhead.Final agreement on the terms of the treaty had been reached in two intense negotiating sessions in the Cabinet Room at No , which ended two months of wrangling. The first session, which lasted over five hours, began at pm on December . Lloyd George employed all his formidable political skills to secure a breakthrough in all but one of the key areas that had hitherto defied resolution.The Irish gained the full fiscal and financial autonomy they craved. The British got what they wanted on defence: the use “in time of war or of strained relations with a foreign power [of] such harbour and other facilities as the British government may require”, combined with the permanent retention of what came to be known as the Treaty Ports , major strategic assets which Neville Chamberlainwas to abandon in a further Anglo-Irish Treaty in  to Churchill’s fury. Since the start of negotiations in October, the words of an oath of allegiance which Irish elected representatives would in future be required to swear had been through endless drafts. It was at last settled with a suitably convoluted rigmarole to spare the Irish republican conscience as much strain as possible: “I will be faithful to His Majesty King George V, his Heirs and Successors by law, in virtue of the common citizenship of Ireland and Great Britain, and her adherence to and membership of the group of nations forming the British Commonwealth of Nations.” This was the first time on which the customary reference to Empire was dropped from an official document.There remained just one make-or-break issue: Northern Ireland, with its devolved powers over local matters entrusted to it by Westminster earlier in . Sinn Fein were determined to get it into their independent state. Lloyd George was happy to give them all the help he could. In November, he had piled pressure on Sir James Craig, the Northern Ireland prime minister. In letters and conversations he tried, with all his accustomed craftiness, to get Craig to accept that he had a patriotic duty to remove the last barrier to peace in Ireland by joining a sovereign all-Ireland Parliament in place of Westminster, while retaining all the devolved powers that Westminster had provided.The Unionist members of the British delegation did not demur. Not for the last time, Ulster Unionists found that they could not rely on their English Unionist allies in high places . Austen Chamberlain said that separate arrangements for six of the nine Ulster counties were “illogical and indefensible”. He thought “the greatest moral pressure” should be put on Northern Ireland to bring it into a settlement that was “vital to the Empire”. His party chairman, Sir George Younger , believed “Ulster should take some risks and forget some of the past arguments against unity in Ireland”.These Unionist calls for compromisewere made against the background of a sustained press campaign, led by The Times, criticising Ulster Unionists for their intransigence. “Ulster blocks the way to peace” was the newspapers’ regular refrain. Craig described it as “ a press campaign against Ulster without parallel in the history of Great Britain.”But the Northern Ireland premier was unmoved. He told Lloyd George that a single parliament for Ireland was “precisely what Ulster has for many years resisted by all the means at her disposal”.Lloyd George tried another tack in November, concentrating his cunning this time on the leader of the Irish delegation, Arthur Grfith. Here he had much greater success than in his attempts to manoeuvre Craig into an all-Ireland parliament. At a private meeting with Grfith on November , he got the leader of the Irish delegation to give a personal written pledge that,Northern Ireland refused to accept an all-Ireland settlement, it would remain under the British Parliament, “but in this case, it would be necessary to revise the boundary of Northern Ireland. This might be done by a Boundary Commission ... to make the boundary conform as closely as possible to the wishes of the people.” What went unrecorded in the paper was the clear impression given by Lloyd George that Northern Ireland would lose so much territory that it could not survive as a separate entity and a united independent Ireland would as a result come into existence.During the course of the long afternoon session in Downing Street on December , Lloyd George reminded Grfith of what they had agreed.Proof was needed. A frantic search was made of the prime minister’s wardrobe, and “eventually an insignicant pocket cast up an envelope and a piece of paper.” On the strength of this written undertaking to establish a Boundary Commission whichwould undermine Northern Ireland, the leader of the Irish delegation agreed to sign the Treaty himself, but said that he could not commit his colleagues.At this, Lloyd George assumed a magnicently melodramatic air. He had told Craig in Belfast to expect news of the outcome of the discussions in Downing Street the following day. That could of course have been done by telephone, but Lloyd George now conjured up an elaborate plan to send the news in writing to Belfast in an attempt to force a decision out of the other two Irish delegates.“Here are the alternative letters which I have prepared, one enclosing Articles of Agreement reached by His Majesty’s Government and yourselves, and the other saying that the Sinn Fein representatives refuse to come within the Empire. If I send this letter it is war, and war within three days. Which letter am I to send  Whichever letter you choose travels by special train to Holyhead, and by destroyer to Belfast. The train is waiting with steam up at Euston ... to reach Sir James in time we must know your answer by ten p.m tonight. You can have until then, but no longer, to decide whether you will give peace or war to your country.”With these impassioned words ringing in their ears, the Irish delegates ed to their Knightsbridge hotel for anguished discussions amongst themselves, but promised to be back in Downing Street by the pm deadline. In fact, it was nearly .pm when they ed.Nothing more was heard about the special train waiting at Euston. Grfith announced calmly, “Prime Minister, the Delegation is willing to sign the agreements, but there are a few points of drafting which perhaps it would be convenientI mentioned at once.” The most important concerned the Boundary Commission redrafting increasedthe likelihood that Northern Ireland would collapse. At Iam on December , an agreed text was handed to the Downing Street typists.In England, reaction to the treaty was ecstatic. The Times led the way: “These are fitting peace terms to mark the close of an age of discontent and distrust, and the beginning of a new era of happiness and mutual understanding.” In Ireland, discontent intensied and took a new form: the long quarrel with Britain was replaced by distrust and ision within Sinn Fein, which led to a bitter civil war the following year. In Northern Ireland, IRA terrorism increased, generating sectarian stre in  parts of Belfast came to resemble the battlefields of the First World War. The Boundary Commission recommended only minor changes, and its report was shelved. Englishmen looked away. “The country”, said Austen Chamberlain, “wants peace and is tired of Ireland and Ulster.” English politicians hoped they would never have to think seriously about Irish affairs again. For nearly  years they had their wish — which meant that that they were fatally handicapped by ignorance when the Ulster crisis of  erupted.l BIBLIOGRAPHY—D.G.Boyce, Englishmen and Irish Troubles: British Public Opinion and the Making of Irish Policy -and “ How to Settle the Irish Question: Lloyd George and Ireland -” in A.J.P.

He was also unhappy with aspects of his care after his discharge.Mr Drsquos surgery was carried out on the presumption that he had Crohnrsquos Disease according to the Ombudsman, but surgical findings suggested complex chronic appendicitis.The Ombudsman found that neither of these conditions needed the extensive surgery that Mr D was given. The Ombudsman also found there was no complete record of how his condition was monitored following his surgery and that his post-operative bleed might have been detected sooner.The Ombudsman also concluded that the clinicians were aware of the patientrsquos Aspergerrsquos Syndrome but did not clearly communicate the information about his diagnosis and treatment to him. The Ombudsman also found that the patient was not seen by a mental health clinician as requested by Mr D because it was not arranged.MORE NEWS:The Ombudsman did not uphold the complaint regarding Mr Drsquos care post-discharge.Nick Bennett of Public Services Ombudsman for Wales said: ldquoThis regrettable case highlights yet again the importance of one of the key principles of prudent healthcare formulated by the Welsh Government ndash lsquodo only what is needed and do no harm.rsquoldquoPhysicians responsible for Mr Drsquos care should have employed a lsquowatch and waitrsquo approach in which his condition would probably have settled without surgical treatment.ldquoInstead, Mr D, a vulnerable inidual, faced completely avoidable trauma of unnecessary surgery and post-treatment complications ndash a trauma which saw him seek mental health support. I anticipate that my findings will be extremely distressing for him. This is reflected in my recommendations in this case.The Ombudsman recommended that Cardf and Vale University Health Board provides Mr D with a detailed apology and a redress payment of pound,. Mr Bennett also recommended that the physicians and nurses involved in Mr Drsquos care have relevant training in the management of Crohnrsquos Disease and chronic appendicitis as well as the care and management of patients with Aspergerrsquos Syndrome.It was also recommended that the nursing team consider the importance of conducting and documenting post-operative observations and of preparing accurate and relevant care plans.The Ombudsmans report says Cardf and Vale University Health Board has accepted the findings and conclusions of the Ombudsmanrsquos report and has agreed to implement the recommendations.A spokesperson for Cardf and Vale University Health Board said: \"As a health board we would like to reiterate our sincere apologies to Mr D for the concerns identied in the report.\"We are implementing the recommendations from the Ombudsman and an improvement plan has been developed to monitor the delivery of all recommendations within the agreed timescales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"Comments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityPollsters Yougov surveyed a sample of people from Wales and the rest of Britain, asking them whether they would support or oppose banning people who have not been vaccinated against coronavirus from visiting public places.Such places would include events and non-essential shops, Yougov suggested.The poll comes as some countries attempt to ramp up vaccination rates by either threatening new restrictions or making jabs mandatory.Political leaders in the UK have downplayed the prospects of such restrictions being introduced, but other European nations have already begun taking steps to curb freedoms for unvaccinated citizens.The Yougov poll found that in the Wales and Midlands area, nearly two-thirds of peoplesaid they would either strongly support, or tend to support, banning unvaccinated people from non-essential public places.Just one in four peoplesaid they would oppose such restrictions on the unvaccinated.The regional results largely match the total response from Wales, England and Scotland, which showed  per cent would support a ban and  per cent would oppose it.MORE ON CORONAVIRUS:Yougov uses sampling data to measure public attitudes to current events and issues. In this case, some , people across Britain, including  in the Wales and Midlands region, responded to the survey. While the sample cannot give a  per cent accurate record of public opinion, it does provide a helpful indicator of which way the wind is blowing when it comes to any future Covid policies on vaccinations and restrictions.A few days ago, Germany announced it would be reimposing some restrictions across the nation, as well as bringing in tough new measures aimed specically at unvaccinated people..removeMany leisure and entertainment venues will only be accessible for people who have either been vaccinated or who have recently recovered from Covid, and the German parliament will also consider a general vaccine mandate which,passed, could come into force as soon as February next year.The nation follows neighbouring Austria, which last month brought in lockdown-style rules for people who have not been vaccinated. Around  per cent of people in Austria have been fully vaccinated ndash one of the lowest rates in western Europe.By comparison, some  per cent of people in the UK have been given both jabs, and booster vaccines have already been administered to . per cent of those people who are currently eligible.Asked on Fridayvaccines could ever be made mandatory for the general public in the UK, a spokesman for Downing Street told reporters: \"Wersquove set out our policy on this and wersquove said itrsquos not something that we would look to introduce.\"And earlier this week, Wales health minister Eluned Morgan said such rules were\"not something the Welsh Government has considered\".While health is devolved in Wales, policies regarding vaccines have remained largely the same across the four UK nations, led by common advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation .However, England has taken the additional step of making vaccines mandatory for health and social care workersndash a measure which hasnt been introduced here in Wales. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

But to pray for the serenity to accept the things we cannot change can be a tall order. For example, a le-changing illness or accident or the ending of the marriage of a family friend, it’s heartbreaking, but there’s nothing we can do about it, we can’t change it, and all the antagonism in the world solves nothing.I have a close relative who within a month was diagnosed with breast cancer, had a mastectomy and then was told she had early stage dementia. Adam Harbinson.There is nothing she can do to change things, but can she accept it  Well, without sounding uncaring one could say, what is the alternative However, to accept something we cannot change does not mean that we welcome it, how could we  No, what I’m suggesting is that to accept it, as my close relative appears to be doing, means that we don’t rage and fume, ‘Why me ’ And then we go about blaming everybody and anybody. The inescapable fact is that le isn’t fair good things happen to bad people and bad things happen to good people. When good things happen to good people they say, ‘God is good,’ I usually nod and add, ‘Yes, all the time.’ Isn’t that so, for wasn’t it Jesus who said, ‘He gives sunlight to both the evil and the good, and he sends rain on the just and the unjust.’ That’s how it is, but it’s not generally understood.When my we died a few weeks before her th birthday it seemed that half the world was praying for her recovery and so I asked every church leader I knew why this should be. I can tell you, I got some bizarre answers, like you didn’t pray hard enough, there’s a secret sin in your le, and then the really silly ones, ‘God picks the best fruit first’, until I spoke to an old Elim pastor, who gave me the only answer there is. He said, ‘I don’t know.’So accepting the things we can’t change can be dficult,it was easy we wouldn’t have to pray for serenity. But bitterness, blaming and anger help no one.Jesus  \"       \"  ]]Most PopularMasked men armed with a hammer break into Larne home...NewsLarne painter accused of ‘aggressive commercial practice’ is...NewsTeenage girls robbed at kne point at Ballymena bus stop...NewsBoy dies after road collision near Glenavy...NewsAccepting what we cannot change...NewsMost Popular                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleYour Northern IrelandRecommendedMore from Northern Ireland WorldAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessArchiveSubscribeEventsPlace your AdReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-kTUwUJ sc-dqBHgY ciFbrr\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"    News\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsCoronavirusTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsHealthBusinessEducationEnvironmentPeopleRead ThisFootball\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      FootballIrish League FootballSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportMotorcyclingIce HockeyOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleFood and DrinkTravelHomes and GardensCarsFamilyRetroOpinionYour NI\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Your NI​Antrim and NewtownabbeyArmagh Banbridge and CraigavonBelfastCauseway Coast and GlensLondonderry Derry City and StrabaneLisburn and CastlereaghMid and East AntrimMid UlsterFermanagh and OmaghNewry Mourne and DownArds and North DownMust ReadContact usAdvertise My BusinessFollow us      "},{"url":null,"title":"rare horse drawn caravan is up for auction ","story":"Advice: What should I dosomeone ’s mail is delivered to my address    Masked men armed with a hammer break into Larne homeNewsCoronavirusTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsHealthBusinessEducationPeopleEnvironmentRead ThisFootballIrish League FootballSportMotorcyclingIce HockeyOther SportWhats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyleFood and DrinkTravelHomes and GardensCars FamilyYour NIRetroOpinionAdvertise My BusinessNewsPeopleRare horse-drawn caravan is up for auctionA rare piece of history - a vintage horse-drawn caravan - is to come under the hammer at Wilsons Auctions.By Valerie MartinThursday, th December , : pm  \"       \"  The rare horse-drawn caravan which is for sale through Wilsons Auctions.The caravan, which was built in the mid to late s, is one of only a handful remaining in the world so this is an extremely unique opportunity for someone to acquire a piece of history at auction.Also known as a Romany Gypsy ledger caravan   do, the asset is property of the estate of the late Mr Jack McNeill and comes from a letime of appreciation.It is thought that the wagon was brought from Wales to Ireland by a Mr Lovell and his we during the First World War. Soon after they arrived in Belfast it is believed that Mr Lovell died from Black Flu and before he died, and about to be left alone, Mrs Lovell accepted compensation for the damage that the wagon had suffered in the sea crossing and gave up ownership.The vintage horse-drawn caravan has been lovingly restored.It was the custom at that time in some Romany communities that the do was burned when the owner died, hence making this type of caravan particularly rare. This wagon luckily escaped as it had passed out of Mr Lovell’s hands.In  it came into the ownership of Mr McNeill. He completely stripped down, repaired, and repainted the original wood and metal employing the skills of craftsmen such as signwriter   restorer Mark Stead and wheelwright Cecil Watson. Where replacement was necessary, he sourced only authentic materials. Whilst in the restoration process, a museum stated that they estimated therewere only five remaining in the United Kingdom. It is estimated that this number has decreased still further since then.The wagon was transported to Bray, Co Wicklow in  where it had a starring role in the feature film of Charles Dickens’ ‘The Old Curiosity Shop’.Wilsons’ Plant, Machinery and Commercial Manager Richard McFetridge said: “I am delighted Wilsons Auctions have been entrusted to auction off such a special, historical asset. This horse drawn caravan has been meticulously cared for over the years and is a testament to its owners. I have no doubt this extremely rare wagon will be highly sought after and look forward to the outcome of the auction.”Bidding on the wagon will open on Wednesday, December  at pm.

The consultation with key stakeholders will run for a period of  weeks.”The issue first arose inFebruary  when the council received a request from Abbeyville Residents’ Association for five Irish language street signs which was turned down after councillors voted in favour of a policy retaining street signs in English only proposed by Glengormley DUP councillor Alderman Phillip Brett and seconded by Glengormley Ulster Unionist councillor Ald Mark Cisgrove.Ald Brett stressed the importance of the council having a policy on the issue so thatthere were future requests, these could be dealt with “smoothly”.Ald Cosgrove said that given the facts and figures presented to members over the number of Irish language speakers in the borough, the request would be “preposterous” and street signs would look like a “dog’s dinner”.According to the  census,.% of residents in Antrim and Newtownabbey had some knowledge of Irish. In , it was reported that  people in Antrim and Newtownabbey spoke Irish as a main language.However, in September , the council was forced to do a u-turn after being challenged in the High Court by a resident who sought a judicial review over a “deeply held concern that the policy adopted by the local authority was unlawful”. Read hereThe borough councilinsisted that its policy was “not a ban in any way on the Irish language” and a new, “more detailed policy would be drafted for the council to consider”.Commenting on last week’s decision, SDLP group leader Councillor Roisin Lynch said: “I was disappointed that councillors decided to support this deeply restrictive policy. It is a shameless and deliberate attempt to slow down and stymy efforts for dual language signage.“There can be little doubt that this onerous policy is designed to obstruct efforts to progress the visibility of Gaeilge in our local communities. I am particularly disappointed that Alliance Party councillors backed a policy designed to restrict the growth of the language.“It is of vital importance that the Irish language is given the visibility it deserves and that anyone who wishes to see bilingual signage in their area has access to a fair and transparent process. This is a slap in the face to those in our communities, including myself, who know that we need to break down barriers to the visibility of the the Irish language, not create new ones.”Antrim and Newtownabbey Mayor Councillor Billy Webb commented: “This is not an Irish language policy. This is a multi-lingual policy. We are a erse community.“The policy is going out to consultation. We were looking for one third of residents of a street to instigate an application and then  per cent plus one in the actual vote. That is a normal and true democratic process. The DUP was looking for two-thirds.”Michelle Weir, Local Democracy Reporter--A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this article.
