She also co-founded and served as the senior vice president of the financial services firm, NOW Corp.She also founded a children’s beverage company called Nourish, is CEO of legal consulting firm Sage Works and, under the pseudonym Selena Montgomery, has written many romantic suspense novels and has sold more than 100,000 copies.Stacey Abrams, Minority Leader of the Georgia House of RepresentativesFrom 2007, Abrams became the first woman to lead either party in the Georgia General Assembly and the first African American to lead in the House of Representatives.As Minority Leader, she worked with Republican Governor Nathan Deal’s administration to reform the HOPE Scholarship Program and co-sponsored the legislation that preserved the initiative by decreasing the scholarship paid to Georgia students, as well as funding a low-interest loan program.  Stacey Abrams seen here announcing she has qualified to run for governor in Atlanta in 2018Despite having similar policies, as Vox explained, the difference in the policies of Stacey Abrams and Stacey Evans comes down to their different handling of the HOPE Scholarship Program.‘This dispute has several ins and outs, but the basic shape of things is that Deal proposed swinging cuts to the program that once guaranteed free in-state tuition to any Georgia high school graduate who maintained at least a B average.‘Abrams cut a deal with Deal that reduced the extent of the cuts but still pared back the program substantially. Evans stood strong in opposition,’ Vox reported.Georgia Primary 2018Stacey Abrams is running for Governor of Georgia in the 2018 Georgia gubernatorial election and she will be up against Stacey Evans in the Democratic primary in what has been dubbed ‘the war between the two Staceys.’Both Staceys have similar policies on health care, education and their opposition to President Donald Trump. The Democrat representative for Georgia will be announced on May 22, 2018, in an attempt to damage Republican control over the state.Despite Georgia being far from a swing state, Hillary Clinton was close to winning in the state during the 2016 election, more so than Ohio or Iowa, and this has given the Democratic Party hope of electing a governor there for the first time since Roy Barnes in 1998.This being an important election, it has garnered media attention along with GOP contender Michael Williams breaking news with his idea of touring Georgia with a ‘deportation bus’. But he is unlikely to make it to the runoff election in July 24, with the Republican nomination thought to be won by Casey Cagle or Brian Kemp.Stacey Abrams pollsPolls conducted for FOX 5 Atlanta reveal Stacey Abrams is leading the race for the Democratic nomination for Governor with 58.2 per cent, with Stacey Evans at 19 per cent and 23 per cent left undecided.

In 2015, she reportedly told the journalist Piers Morgan that she had not always sought showbusiness success.‘As a kid, I wanted to be either the president or a news broadcaster like you,’ she told him.          The actress married Prince Harry after meeting him in London in 2016. She has now become the Duchess of Sussex          Meghan Markle is expected to become a British citizen but she has harboured dreams of becoming President of the USMeghan is still a U.S. citizen because the process to become a fully-fledged Briton is expected to take three years. She is expected to retain her U.S. citizenship, as dual citizenship is permitted. Presidential candidates must be U.S. citizens.Meghan has cultivated a warm friendship with former U.S. president Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle, while chat show host Oprah Winfrey, who is one of the most influential women in America, was given a prime seat at St George’s Chapel Windsor, opposite the Royal Family.A royal historian says Meghan would find it difficult to enter U.S. politics while still married to Harry. ‘It is a pretty strong rule that members of the Royal Family keep out of politics,’ he says.Share this article    The newly married Duke and Duchess of Sussex, Meghan Markle and Prince Harry, leaving Windsor Castle after their weddingBut Harry could, of course, give up official royal duties. His mother, Princess Diana, was said to have considered moving to America.And the claim appears to have caused consternation at Kensington Palace yesterday, with the Duchess giving her official spokesman permission to take the unusual step of issuing a public denial.‘This conversation you describe with an associate is fictitious,’ the spokesman insisted.I am, though, not the only one to hear rumours that Meghan still holds political ambitions.Former Times editor Sir Simon Jenkins says: ‘Her friends and associates affirm that she is a political animal.‘Such is her fame, she could perfectly well follow a route taken by a certain Ronald Reagan. She might lead for the Democrats against a Republican Ivanka Trump. All I can say is, why not?’Meghan’s best friend is Jessica Mulroney, whose father-in-law, Brian, was prime minister of Canada for nine years.Meghan has strong political views and attacked Donald Trump in 2016 for being ‘isive’ and ‘misogynistic’. She might have to reach an accommodation with her new chum George Clooney, who is said to hold political ambitions of his own. Perhaps he could be her running mate."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/23/01/4C898F2700000578-5759713-Auctioning_under_the_name_ClaireOliver87_the_listing_included_th-a-28_1527035182950.jpg","title":"Official royal wedding gift bag sells 21 400 eBay","story":"    Included in the listing was a bottle of Windsor Castle spring water, a fridge magnet, an over-sized chocolate coin, a tin of shortbread biscuits, a spectator badge, a spectator wristband, a parking sticker, the order of service, a postcard, a map and day briefing, entry card letter and finally the tote bag itself          Auctioning under the name ClaireOliver87, the listing included the entire contents of the gift bag as well as the paperwork received on and prior to the dayThe guests arrived at 9am to see 600 VIPs including the Queen, Prince Philip and Prince Charles as well as the Clooneys, the Beckhams, Elton John and Oprah Winfrey turn up for the A-list wedding of the decade. And as 120,000 well-wishers fought for space outside the castle these privileged 1,200 were able to get great views of the newlyweds as they kissed outside the chapel and paraded past in the royal Ascot Landau carriage. But within hours of the event finishing dozens of their free hessian gift bags were being auctioned off to the highest bidder.Many of the sellers had clearly planned to do it in advance because they photographed the items outside St George\u0027s Chapel to ensure they looked genuine on eBay.           Bids for items have now reached more than £1,000 even though they were handed out for free by Meghan and Harry  Guests invited by Meghan and Harry to see them marry are already cashing in by selling their gift bags on eBay for £400 or more          Guests arriving in the grounds of Windsor Castle passed tables where bags were handed out to each guest but some have taken advantage of this generosity          The canvas bags had the happy couple\u0027s initials on the side and are being sold on the promise buyers will be getting a piece of royal wedding historySo why WERE the Beckhams and Clooneys (not to mention Chloe...Why did George and Charlotte suddenly go missing?

He\u0027s got a wonderfully dry sense of humour. Prince Harry was charming about Meghan, they are so clearly in love. We all had a tear in our eye.\u0027 Later he whisked his bride away in an open-top Jaguar to head for a star-studded, champagne-fuelled, black-tie reception for the bride and groom at the opulent Frogmore House in Windsor Great Park on Saturday night.The newlyweds were cheered wildly as they took to the floor with the funky soul classic Land of a Thousand Dances for their first dance at the spectacular royal wedding reception.Comedian James Corden is reported to have launched a dance routine with Harry, his brother William and his father Charles, apparently refereeing a \u0027dance-off\u0027, while George Clooney danced with both Meghan and Kate. After a very modern take on the traditional royal wedding, the late-night revelry followed suit – and those fortunate enough to bag a place on the ultra-exclusive guest list were treated to a night of risque speeches, wild dancing and plenty of stodge to soak up the alcohol.

ITV’s coverage peaked at 3.6million.The combined average audience for BBC and ITV was around 11million. But this was lower than the figure for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s wedding in 2011, which had a combined audience of 17.6million – although this included people watching on catch-up. Charles and Diana’s wedding was watched by more than 28million in 1981.Saturday’s FA Cup Final averaged 6.7million viewers and peaked at 8.7million on BBC1. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/20/22/065F52DC000003E8-0-image-a-44_1526851071765.jpg","title":"The dotty grandees gone peers just bland blobs QUENTIN LETTS Parliament","story":"    Members of The House of Lords have come under fire for inflicting defeats on the Government over the EU Withdrawal BillMore than in 1998, today’s peers come from similar careers and spout similar views. They have lost their eccentricity. Eccentrics have an independence of mind. Today’s peers are often just blobs.Those joining yesterday’s exchanges included minister George Young (a delightful ex-Tory MP), Tristan Garel-Jones (ex-Tory MP), Bruce Grocott (ex-Labour MP and PPS to Tony Blair), Angela Smith (ex-Labour MP), Helene Hayman (ex-Labour MP), Lib Dem Dick Newby (ex-aide to Charles Kennedy) and Richard Harries (ex-Bishop of Oxford and one of Radio 4’s damper pontificators).They may belong to different politicial traditions but the party they represent is the Party of Smooth Managerialism. What they want is continuity. What they hate is radicalism. Most dread Corbynism and Brexit in equal measure.The House of Lords could make extraordinary THIRD bid to...Theresa May says it is \u0027unacceptable\u0027 for Commons speaker...Share this articleCrossbencher Harries mouldered away about how the Government should not have appointed 13 new peers last week (seven are former MPs) because the newbies will delay the slow shrinkage of the House via deaths and retirements. ‘The quicker we can get down to 600, the greater the respect in which this House will be held,’ purred Lord Harries.The greater the respect? Good one! What he meant was ‘the less we will be regarded as parasitic stooges of inertia’.The public would possibly like to see the upper house reduced to something far smaller than 600.But 600 is the figure mentioned in a recent review by Lord Burns, a former Whitehall civil servant. Sound Establishment man, is Terry Burns. He’ll never suggest anything too upsetting. Most peers are delighted by Burns’s review because it does not recommend forced eviction for any current peer. Graze on, sheep. Lord Young has this week noted, with little more than a pointed stare, that the Lib Dems, who currently have a ridiculous 100 peers, have not yet put anyone up for retirement.          A new poll showed there is now dwindling support for the Upper House as many call for it to be abolished Their leader, Lord Newby, yesterday merely moaned that one of the incoming Tory life peers, Andrew Tyrie, recently accepted the chairmanship of an independent body. Lord Young announced that Tyrie would be sitting as a non-affiliate peer.On Monday, that unhappy figure Lord Adonis (a former Blair aide bent out of shape by Brexit) made a similar petty point about political allegiances. Ditto Lady Hayman yesterday. Party power is how they view everything but it misses the point. The problem with the Lords is both its size and, now, its very existence.Several peers yesterday hear-heared when Lord Burns’s report was mentioned. Of course they did.Burns does not threaten to abolish them and allows for them to remain almost as big as the Commons.Lord Young, a gracious stick, smeared his replies with charm. He all but admitted that Theresa May’s Government is trying to say nothing on Lords reform. He murmured: ‘This is the 15th question on the composition of the house I have answered – or, to be more accurate, the 15th I’ve been asked.’ Droll laughter.All those ex-MPs and ex-charity bosses and ex-quangocrats and ex-soapy bishops just want the place to teeter on for another few years until they’ve croaked. That’s all that worries them. The rest of the country may be more impatient for change."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/23/03/4C6D6BBD00000578-5760259-image-m-50_1527041809494.jpg","title":"Meghan Markles sister says Doria Ragland looked like hockey player penalty box","story":"Meghan Markle\u0027s half-sister Samantha Grant fired off a series of barbs at Doria Ragland.

They can comfortably lift about half their body weight — so about five or six pound,\u0027 said Mr Ebi          The fox finally gives up. The mid-air tussle had ended within just eight seconds, according to the photographer\u0027I spent the day watching several young foxes, called kits, rest and play on the prairie. I counted at least eight kits. There are probably more. Shortly before sunset, they started hunting. One fox managed to snag a rabbit’s foot. Several kits gave chase, but it made it to its den to feed.\u0027About 15 minutes later, a red fox caught a rabbit and was carrying it across the meadow. I panned my camera with it to capture the action. Then behind me, I heard the cry of a bald eagle. I turned around and saw it approaching fast. I knew it wanted the rabbit. I intently trained my camera on the fox bracing for a split second of action.\u0027Mr Ebi said the scene \u0027was even more dramatic than I expected. I thought the fox would drop the rabbit, giving the eagle an easy dinner.\u0027To my surprise,Instead, the fox, with its jaw still clenched on the rabbit, inadvertently got snagged by the bald eagle.

The eagle transferred the rabbit to its right talon and eventually let the fox go. The fox fell from enough height to trigger a small dust cloud when it hit the ground.\u0027The whole battle was over in less than eight seconds.\u0027He said there is no question that bald eagles are skilled hunters, as the birds of prey can spot a fish from a mile away and fly to it in under a minute.\u0027But they’re also masters of something scientists call kleptoparasitism: the art of stealing food from others,\u0027 Mr Ebi added.  \u0027There have been stories of bald eagles taking off with animals as large as young deer, but while they’re strong, they’re not that strong. They can comfortably lift about half their body weight — so about five or six pounds. The young fox and rabbit were likely just beyond that weight.\u0027Interestingly, rabbits aren’t the foxes\u0027 first choice for supper: \u0027They actually prefer insects, berries and voles. But the berries and voles have been displaced by the rabbits, which have clear-cut the prairie with their vast burrows.\u0027 The photographer added: \u0027Don’t worry: the fox was fine.

It\u0027s a monolithic insulation, made by an industrial process and surrounds the whole container inside without any heat bridges.\u0027According to Mallinowski, using the specialty foam insulation not only makes the containers more efficient, it also allows for 10-centimetre thick walls, meaning that designers can make the most out of the containers\u0027 already limited space.He said: \u0027We can build very thin walls so that the space in the container is as big as possible.\u0027  "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/21/09/4C507EC100000578-0-image-m-7_1526890281999.jpg","title":"Theresa insists Cabinet positive uplifting","story":"    Theresa May insisted to Cabinet she had made a \u0027positive and uplifting\u0027 at Jodrell Bank this week (pictured) in a direct rebuke to Ruth Davidson\u0027s jibe she is \u0027joyless and hectoring\u0027Ms Davidson made her jibe at a think tank launch on Monday night, urging Mrs May to brighten the party\u0027s image if it wanted to win. The Times revealed Mrs May then told her colleagues: \u0027I gave a forward-looking, positive, uplifting speech on science yesterday . . . and the first question from the BBC was on Brexit.\u0027One source said that it was an \u0027interesting, if pointed, contribution\u0027 following Ms Davidson\u0027s jibe.  John Bercow admits he DID call Cabinet minister Andrea...Trump\u0027s demands for new \u0027jumbo\u0027 Iran nuclear deal will be...Share this articleThe warning - at the launch of a Tory think-tank in parliament - came with the anniversary of Mrs May\u0027s disastrous snap election approaching.It saw the PM stripped of her overall majority after being branded the \u0027Maybot\u0027 during a bungled campaign.

John Bannon of the US Coast Guard in Honolulu said in a statement. So far the laze has traveled an estimated 15 miles west of where the lava gushed into the ocean on the Big Island\u0027s southern coast.Another hazard was the potential for methane gas explosions as searing lava neared pockets of rotting vegetation, igniting traces of the flammable gas given off by the decay.           A man wearing shorts, T-shirt and flip-flops takes a picture of a sea of lava on Sunday that has consumed an entire valley          Lieutenant Colonel Charles Anthony of the Hawaii National Guard measures sulfur dioxide gas levels at a lava flow on Highway 137 southeast of Pahoa on Sunday during ongoing eruptions of the Kilauea Volcano\u0027These are quite a big hazard in vegetative areas and the explosions can occur well away from the lava flow itself,\u0027 said USGS geologist Janet Babb.Geologists say Kilauea\u0027s eruption, which has already produced around two dozen lava-spewing fissures, has now entered a more violent phase, in which larger volumes of molten rock are oozing from the ground and traveling farther than before.  Over the weekend, the first major injury occurred when spattering molten rock shot out of a fissure and hit a man in the leg, shattering it. At least 44 homes and other structures have been destroyed in the Leilani Estates and Lanipuna Gardens area of the Puna district and more than 2,000 people have evacuated their homes. The area affected by lava and ash is small compared with the Big Island, which is about 4,000 square miles. The volcano has spared most of the island and the rest of the Hawaiian chain.Officials reminded tourists that flights have not been affected, even on the Big Island. There, travelers are free to do most of the usual sightseeing activities that aren\u0027t associated with the erupting volcano.          Lava flows have picked up speed in recent days, spattering molten rock that hit a man in the leg, the first major injury to occur  Brittany Kimball watches as lava erupts from a fissure near Pahoa, Hawaii on Saturday.

So is her mother,\u0027 the source said. \u0027Honestly, they are touched beyond belief. It was important to her to make a point of thanking him publicly, although, of course, he knows privately how she feels.\u0027Another source said: \u0027It is often said that he always wanted a daughter and I think he has been really moved by how well they have got on. There is definitely a special connection there.

According to the Sunday Times. Wedding guest Peter Fearnhead, co-founder of African Parks, told the Sunday Telegraph: \u0027When Harry and Meghan came in they stood on the podium and Prince William introduced them.\u0027Prince Charles made a really gracious speech, it was amazingly endearing. He\u0027s got a wonderfully dry sense of humour. Prince Harry was charming about Meghan, they are so clearly in love. We all had a tear in our eye.\u0027 Later he whisked his bride away in an open-top Jaguar to head for a star-studded, champagne-fuelled, black-tie reception for the bride and groom at the opulent Frogmore House in Windsor Great Park on Saturday night.The newlyweds were cheered wildly as they took to the floor with the funky soul classic Land of a Thousand Dances for their first dance at the spectacular royal wedding reception.Comedian James Corden is reported to have launched a dance routine with Harry, his brother William and his father Charles, apparently refereeing a \u0027dance-off\u0027, while George Clooney danced with both Meghan and Kate. After a very modern take on the traditional royal wedding, the late-night revelry followed suit – and those fortunate enough to bag a place on the ultra-exclusive guest list were treated to a night of risque speeches, wild dancing and plenty of stodge to soak up the alcohol.

The deep, still water overlooked by Tate Liverpool, which opened in a sensitively converted warehouse here in 1988, is devoid of dorsal fins. Yet perhaps there are pelagic predators lurking after all, for this gallery has chosen to mark its 30th anniversary by jumping the shark – or whatever image you prefer for a staggering lapse into the absurd.Life in Motion, an exhibition that for no good reason asks us to compare the two extremely different artistic visions of the Austrian draughtsman Egon Schiele and the 1970s US photographer Francesca Woodman, is an exhibition so shallow and patronising that it suggests Tate Liverpool has lost all respect for its audience.It is 100 years since Schiele died in the influenza pandemic that ravaged a war-battered Europe. He was only 28, yet he left behind a body of work that puts him among the greatest artists of the 20th century. He is without question in the same league as his contemporaries Picasso and Modigliani. Yet while they have recently had major solo exhibitions at Tate Modern, he doesn’t even get half a floor of Tate Liverpool to himself. Instead, there is only a quick tour of his career highlights, intercut in an infuriating and baffling way with Woodman’s black and white photographs.Even if this seemed like a good idea on paper, a quick visual test should have told the curators they were making a mistake. Most of Woodman’s pictures are small prints – more or less family album size. Putting these elusive monochrome images beside Schiele’s big, bold, fiercely coloured, often scandalous gouaches and watercolours is catastrophically damaging to her work and tragicomically distracts from his.They do have one thing in common: their early deaths. Woodman killed herself in 1981, when she was 22, leaving behind a vivid artistic life. She started taking poetic, dreamy photographs in her early teens and was already an original artist when she attended the Rhode Island School of Design in Providence in the late 1970s. I have a strong emotional attachment to her art. I once lived in Providence, and it was thrilling to find out about this gothic visionary who had taken eerie images in its old clapboard houses. In one of her Providence pictures she blurs her body so she appears to be a ghost in a derelict house. In another, she stares spookily from the shadows, dressed in old-fashioned clothes, like a Victorian revenant.The history that’s relevant to Woodman is clearly that of photography. It would be fascinating to see her haunted art alongside the great 19th-century photographer Julia Margaret Cameron, or even with Victorian spirit photographers. But she and Schiele have nothing to say to one another.I can reconstruct intellectually how you might fantasise an affinity. Both of these short-lived artists created worlds of their own. For both, sexuality was the key to dreams (Woodman photographed herself nude in many of her images). And yet Tate Liverpool seems scared to show too many of Schiele’s mind-blowingly sensual images of women. A wall text even haughtily informs us he was interested in other things besides the female body. But he’s not an artist you can really censor. In a way, Schiele was the visual equivalent of the great American novelist Philip Roth, may he rest in peace: an imagination incapable of self-censorship. By shifting the focus from Schiele’s women to his self-images, this exhibition gives his cock its head. He emerges as the Portnoy of the Austro-Hungarian empire, obsessed with priapic delight.He stares balefully out of Self-Portrait in Black Cloak, Masturbating, which he created in gouache, watercolour and graphite in 1911. There’s no sign of shame in his frank features as he gazes in the mirror. On the contrary, he is confrontational, a Freudian provocateur who lived in a time and place that was discovering modern theories of sexuality. Schiele’s contemporaries in Austria on the eve of the first world war included, as well as Freud, the sexual fabulist Arthur Schnitzler and the novelist Robert Musil, whose The Confessions of Young Törless describes adolescent sexuality with the same frankness as Schiele.But history barely intrudes on this exhibition. Schiele lived in the strange, decadent, rarefied and fascinating multicultural world of the Habsburg empire, and his daring can only be understood as part of its sensual swan song. To chuck out all of that is to reduce his art to a brainless freak-show. And yet it still blazes. In his 1912 work Reclining Couple, the woman – probably his model Wally Neuzil – is fully clothed and has her back to us. All we can clearly see of Schiele is the erect penis that she manipulates with long thin fingers. In another self-portrait, he wears a green, transparent silky vest through which we contemplate his body: Schiele liked underwear on himself, as well as on women, but his line is never smooth or corny.

I’m from a traditional Bangladeshi Muslim background and back then my life in east London was very different. We didn’t have social media, or even mobile phones – just going to a friend’s house was difficult because my parents were very protective. I didn’t wear much make-up and rather than flick through magazines and read about beauty like other girls my age, I would devour anything I could find about Muhammad Ali and Bruce Lee.But at 18, my life changed. I went to a Muay Thai class (a form of kickboxing that’s generally regarded as the world’s toughest martial art) and found something I’d never experienced before.When I’m training and competing, I don’t care about the way I look. I feel confident in just being me. I’ll wear a really hydrating moisturiser so that my skin feels good but that’s all. Away from the ring, it’s a different story. I love fashion and makeup. Thanks to my career – I became the British and world champion for Muay Thai boxing for my weight category in 2016 – I go to a lot of awards ceremonies, and for those, I like to wear heels and a beautiful dress. I’ll go with foundation, concealer, lipstick, blusher and maybe a highlighter if I’m in the mood. I have an extensive makeup collection – I like to look elegant and pretty when I’m away from the gym but I still want to look like me. No fake eyelashes!As a society, we’re keen to put people into boxes – either you’re sporty or glamorous, you can’t be both … but that’s not true. I can be taken seriously as an athlete and look glamorous when I’m outside the ring. I firmly believe that when it comes to how you look and who you are, you should never try to please other people – if you’re pleased with yourself, then it will radiate through.When I started doing this, I was simply following a passion. Later on, I realised that I had become a role model and I didn’t know how to embrace that. But eventually, I said to myself, you’ve got an amazing platform to really inspire the next generation: to inspire girls, Muslim women, people with ME and chronic fatigue (I’ve suffered for years), people from ethnic minorities, people from low-income backgrounds – these are all obstacles I’ve faced in my own journey. But I’ve succeeded and because of that I feel confident and, yes, beautiful too. Being beautiful is simply about being bold and embracing who you are – that, combined with learning your craft and working hard, is what makes people respect you.At the moment, so many girls are reluctant to pursue sport and I think that’s often because they see it as somehow unfeminine. That’s something I’m determined to change. I train girls and some of them comment on my Instagram feed, and say it’s amazing that I don’t use filters to make myself look better in photos. I try to explain that I don’t need to do that because I’m confident in how I look – whether that’s sweating and makeup-free in the ring, or all dressed up, in mascara and lipstick. Either way, I’m comfortable as I am and that’s what I want them to feel, too. I want them to discover what their bodies are capable of – everyone has strengths and it’s about discovering yours and pursuing that.This year, I’ve switched from Muay Thai to boxing. It’s a completely different discipline. While I’ve got the strength and the fighter’s mentality from kickboxing, the timing, the balance, the guard and the footwork are all different. I’m in training twice a day, six days a week, and living on a very strict diet while I build my foundations in this new sport. I know the road might not be straight but I’m not going to give up. A fighter’s mentality is about having resilience. When I’m in the ring, my coach and my manager won’t be able to help me. I’ve got to rely on myself and know how to be my own best friend.Photography: Brian Daly and Louisa ParryStyling: Steph Stevens make up: Jose Bass hair: Jamie McCormick"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7ff16fb470a460865750db88339a3d4111f772d3/0_0_1588_953/master/1588.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=99bc891241dd4e36cffba4c75a64b610","title":"your best ever skin five beauty mantras to follow religiously","story":"From dewy-skin secrets and sunscreen misting to foundation on ice – listen to your mamas and makeup artists when it comes to the best beauty tipsFrom dewy-skin secrets and sunscreen misting to foundation on ice – listen to your mamas and makeup artists when it comes to the best beauty tipsAs a beauty editor who has been writing about the subject for many years, I am so often touted as an expert. The reality, however, is that much of the beauty knowledge and knowhow I put into practice on a regular basis has been inspired by some of the amazing women in my life – from my mother to my favourite makeup artist – who have shared their tips and tricks with me. And now I am sharing them with you.Mind your décolletageLong before neck creams became a thing, my mother always highlighted the importance of treating your décolletage (that space between your chin and your chest) as you would the skin on your face. Although I was barely into my teens, she made a (daily) point of making sure I had meticulously washed and moisturised my neck and chest. She was adamant that if I didn’t do this, the texture and hue beyond my chin would start to look significantly different to the one on my face. It was exhausting having this relentless mantra sounding in your ear. As a young girl, taking care of the skin on my neck was the least of my priorities. Decades later, however, my mother’s advice has paid off she spoke the truth. It is a beauty step I follow to this day, and I now tell everyone who cares to listen, because it is never too late to start.So far, so perfect. But what happens when, one day, you look in the mirror and for some strange reason your perfect foundation doesn’t look quite as perfect as it did before? “Don’t blame it on the foundation,” says my long-time makeup artist friend. She believes a myriad of reasons could affect the finish – your hormones, change in season (every girl needs more than one shade to accommodate this), lack of sleep … “It’s all about how you store it,” she says. Most people keep their foundation in the (humid, steamy) bathroom, or in their bedroom, where it is exposed to the sun and direct light. All of this oxidises your foundation, which affects the colour, texture and its appearance when on your skin. The trick to keeping your perfect foundation perfect, she reveals, is to keep it in the fridge. Trust me, it works.Apply concealer after foundationMy younger sister is a huge beauty fan, but she doesn’t work in the beauty industry and by no means would she ever even call herself an expert. And yet I learn some of the most wonderful tricks and tips from her. She is the one who first introduced me to the joys of concealers. From her I learned that applying your foundation first and your concealer second is a much better way to ensure you don’t overdo it and end up with a cakey finish halfway through the day. I love a concealer that feels lightweight but provides full flawless coverage, such as the Clinique Beyond Perfecting Super Concealer, but when I apply my foundation first, I find I don’t need to use half as much – everything blends much more seamlessly and it stays that way all day.Supercharge your beauty routine with hyaluronic acidOne of the benefits of my job is that I get to meet women who are doing incredible things in the beauty industry. One of my favourites is a prolific dermatologist who works with some of Hollywood’s most famous faces. She was one of the first skincare experts I heard extolling the benefits of hyaluronic acid, which holds 1,000 times its weight in moisture. It has become my skincare mainstay. My dermatologist encouraged me to blend it into my foundation and powder highlighter before applying – this gives you the dewiest skin ever. She also advised mixing it into powdery or glittery eyeshadows – it is kinder to the eyes, goes on the lids without dragging and the end result is a much more silky, modern-looking finish, with major skincare benefits.Top up your SPF with clever mists Facials are quite possibly my favourite beauty treatment. I tend to battle uneven skin tone, so a good facial complements my skincare regime, which is infused with brighteners, acid exfoliators, vitamin C and a good SPF. Without sun protection, UV rays exacerbate my hyperpigmentation issues. And so I have long been religious about using a high SPF every day. What I didn’t know, however, was that I was doing it all wrong. My facialist taught me that my SPF is only effective when it is constantly topped up (ideally every two hours). This, of course, poses a dilemma: how on earth do you keep applying SPF throughout your working day, while you still have your makeup on? She introduced me to the idea of sunscreen mists and makeup-setting sprays that have SPF in them (some pressed powders also have SPF in, and can be brushed on during the day). Not only are these mists brilliant for dealing with the heat and refreshing your face and providing protection, but you can also spray them right through the day without it ruining your makeup.

The format allowed Zuckerberg to cherrypick his responses rather than reply to each inidual point. As a former Google design ethicist who spent last week in Brussels with EU policymakers, I question whether this is real accountability or just a minimal concession.Zuckerberg’s EU hearing, originally to be in private but ultimately livestreamed after public uproar, excluded many EU officials with the deepest understanding of technology and social media. He accepted the invitation just six days in advance and before a public holiday that left Brussels empty from Friday until just before Tuesday’s hearings. It’s a familiar pattern – Congress was on recess in the two weeks before Zuckerberg’s testimony in the US, with little time to prepare.Facebook has repeatedly appeared to treat these issues as a crisis of PR, not of democratic integrity, making mostly the small changes needed to avoid further scrutiny when the real solution to the problems at hand involves deep, structural changes to Facebook’s thinking and design, which enabled these problems in the first place.It should have been a historic moment, this first time that Zuckerberg appeared in the EU to answer questions in a democratic process. He likely won’t visit again. Yet Facebook will continue to powerfully influence the elections, mental health and culture of EU nations. Ireland is already in the grip of controversy over foreign actors’ Facebook ads in its forthcoming abortion referendum. The UK parliament has repeatedly asked for him to testify in its continuing inquiry into the Brexit referendum and Cambridge Analytica, but he has no plans to do so – yet many questions still need an answer from the Facebook boss.Facebook affects the public health and elections of more than 180 countries, yet has answered to the public only where the media has been loudest. In lesser-reported countries like Sri Lanka, where fake news on Facebook has unintentionally amplified violence, Facebook’s response has been criticised as insufficient. What will you change to ensure greater accountability to democratic governments?The level of changes Facebook needs to make are dependent on how you think about the problem. What do you see as the biggest social harms caused by Facebook, and the greatest social goods? How did you come to this understanding of harm and good? How do you think it compares to the public’s notions of how they are being harmed or benefited?The only way Facebook monitors how changes it makes to its platform impact two billion people is through metrics. How have previous metrics caused the wrong thing to happen? By what metrics do you monitor social goods and harms? Because metrics are developed internally and subject to those teams’ blind spots, how will you use independent advisers or academics to scrutinise them and make recommendations?It seems that even if a Facebook employee knows that a part of the service will cause harm, it’s hard for that person to make change – especially if it hurts any way that teams measure success. What kinds of internal reorganisation of your teams will be necessary to make the company capable of anticipating the harms and goods you see as most relevant? How are your employees incentivised to anticipate these harms and goods rather than just to focus on performance goals?Social media ads can be purchased from anywhere, disguised as normal social media posts, micro-targeted to polarise voters, and loaded up with sensational and isive messages. How do you plan to address these problems far in advance of important elections instead of at the last minute, as in Ireland? When will society’s interest in free and fair elections trump business interest in maintaining hyperefficient programmatic advertising?Facebook believes that using AI in addition to content moderators will successfully combat fake news and malicious ads. But the exponential ersity of threats in languages your engineers don’t even speak – millions of advertisers running millions of campaigns, targeting users with immeasurably erse content (posts, groups, ads) through automated systems – means that automated detection of new issues will lag behind the harm they cause. This potential for continued harm suggests a need for approaches besides AI. What are those approaches?The Federal Trade Commission in the US and the Commons digital, culture, media and sport committee in the UK are investigating whether a consent decree and laws were broken in regard to Cambridge Analytica. Facebook has no independent board or risk committee, and a shareholder group has questioned the work of the company’s audit committee. What changes, if any, do you think Facebook needs to make to its governance system to avoid any such mistakes in the future?The public and governments across the world have had enough with Facebook tinkering in optics and small changes. The future of our elections urgently needs structural reforms of the platform to reflect the interests of governments, civil society, and ultimately Facebook itself.• Tristan Harris is a former design ethicist at Google"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/31d56c8e10a53bc7ba778e650c2ced3e0f675fd3/0_179_5374_3224/master/5374.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a967c9b34527ebfe1e67716d3cf144c9","title":"second brexit referendum attitudes labour","story":"Demanding a second vote is futile without altering the attitudes that underpinned the resultThe votes in the 2016 EU referendum had not been cast, let alone counted, when some were already calling for the public to take to the polls for a second time. The health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, penned a column in the  to this effect just days after Brexit got the go-ahead. Labour’s David Lammy took the same view: “We need a second referendum at the very least,” he proudly declared, encouraging the British electorate to sign a petition that went on to receive more than 4m signatures. On Tuesday Tony Blair continued to echo this sentiment.At first it was understandable, given that the leave campaign was characterised by foul play and a xenophobic undercurrent, and evidence suggested leaving the EU would be a disaster for Britain. But in the two years that have followed, many of those once wedded to the idea of remaining have taken time to reflect on how the vote came to pass. A vocal minority have failed to do so, preferring to repeatedly hound the Labour leadership for not demanding another referendum before the terms of Brexit materialise, and despite the British public, including many Labour voters, backing leave. There’s a simple lesson that the likes of Owen Smith are failing to learn: if you want attitudes to Europe to change in Britain, demanding Jeremy Corbyn commit to a second referendum was never, and is not now, the answer. Demanding a second vote from the offset would also have proved futile unless the attitudes that underpinned the Brexit vote were first challenged head on. If there had been another vote immediately, is it really credible that the public would have reacted in any other way than with outright fury? Much of the remain campaign in 2016 revolved around the economic impact of Brexit, but for many voters who had lived through longest decline in living standards in modern history, the status quo offered little comfort. To change attitudes on Europe therefore, progressives must also focus on taking on the social arguments harnessed by the right in the referendum. Take, for instance, immigration – by all accounts a significant issue in the Brexit debate. It is only by challenging the anti-immigrant sentiment the right has whipped up that minds will be changed. This is a task that Labour has for too long neglected. The British public’s outrage after the Windrush scandal is a case in point. Diane Abbott and David Lammy have helped shift the terms of debate in Britain around immigration – Theresa May’s flagship hostile environment policy has been disowned, Amber Rudd forced into a resignation. The Labour party should be focused on reminding the electorate that migrants – far from being a hindrance or drain on our society – are the very people we all rely upon to keep society functioning. And, consequently, this can slowly be built upon the same is true for European nationals who for so long have been demonised by the right. Similarly, economic arguments must also be developed. A radical policy agenda that tackles inequality in Britain can prove to voters it’s our rigged system, not the EU, that is to blame for households struggling. There’s a reason many in the “centre” of British politics are so wedded to shouting about remaining – they’re out of ideas and unwilling to embrace Labour’s transformative, progressive policies.If you want to see Britain take another look at Brexit, Labour’s path is obvious: highlight the mess the Tories are making, and convince people international cooperation is worth embracing. Don’t simply demand Corbyn wave an EU flag without even considering what a second referendum would look like.Ideologues in the leave camp are determined to drag Britain out of Europe whatever the consequences. Labour must not mirror them by just shouting at voters that they’ve made a terrible mistake and seeming to be ideologically wedded to the EU come what may. The party must continue to prove that this Tory Brexit will be a disaster, and challenge the narratives that facilitated it. Once the final terms of May’s botched Brexit are presented, Labour can demand, if necessary and there is public appetite, that we have a say over any Brexit deal – whether in the guise of a referendum, a general election, or by some other means. The same old we-told-you so politics will only alienate swaths of the electorate, and ensure the Tories have no real opposition for their disastrous hard Brexit plans.

Kimmel then asked if she knew if it would be changed. “I’ve been in discussions with them and they’re gracious,” she said. “They obviously didn’t want this to happen.”She has also been told that she will have approval over the next attempt.On The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, the host started by creating a memorable mental image. “We have passed certain milestones on Trump’s highway to American greatness,” he said. “Sometimes you just have to pull the car over, get a breath of fresh air, maybe puke in the grass.”He believes that one of those moments is now after Trump called for an investigation into the investigation into him.“Some people are calling this a constitutional crisis but I don’t know about that,” he said. “A constitutional crisis technically requires that one branch of the government push back against another branch of the government. Everybody here is pushing in the same direction, and it’s down with a pillow over the constitution’s face going: ‘Sssssshhhh, it’ll be over soon.’”He then joked that the constitution has changed under Trump’s reign. “It’s gotten so bad that the opening words have gone from ‘We the people’ to ‘Help, I’ve forgotten the safe word,’” he said.On Late Night with Seth Meyers, the host covered the aides and officials who have been fired and rehired during Trump’s time in the White House. Before he became president, Trump said he would work hard to employ ferocious and mean people to get the job done. “I have to give Trump credit here,” he said. “He did warn us that he was going to hire some vicious, horrible people and he followed through.”Meyers spoke about Carl Higbie, who was originally hired as the chief of external affairs for the Corporation for National and Community Service – yet fired after hateful comments resurfaced that showed him to be a bigot.Yet despite this, he was ultimately given a job by a pro-Trump group promoting his policy agenda.“So Higbie did something terrible but instead of getting rid of him, they just moved him to a new job,” he said. “To put it in Catholic terms, he got moved to another diocese.”Meyers continued: “The guy who repeatedly said racist things about black people is still on the board that is run by the National Diversity Coalition. That’s like Charlie Sheen teaching D.A.R.E.”Similarly, Trump’s ex-assistant John McAntee was escorted off the White House premises after it was found that he was under investigation for serious financial crimes. Yet he’s now working on Trump’s re-election campaign.“So he got escorted off the White House grounds and into a promotion,” he said. “That’s like getting thrown out of a bar and the bouncer saying, ‘Get out and stay out and then come back tomorrow because you’re the manager now.’”He continued: “Trump keeps recycling these people and others because he only uses one yardstick to measure employees: are they loyal to me? And the problem with that is the kind of people who are unquestionably loyal to an ignorant bigot like Trump are pretty much always terrible people.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc552774223a7e2c89d97935d4602df6d86b8daf/0_0_2338_1402/master/2338.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b00cf3b435d159c66b1086284fd6a92d","title":"great british bee count 2018 in pictures","story":"As the fifth annual Great British Bee Count gets under way, wildlife and gardening experts are calling on the public to grow weeds to help Britain’s bees.

Gay men don’t exist.”McKellen credited 1998’s Gods and Monsters – in which he played director James Whale – as triggering a new climate of acceptance in the industry, saying it “was the beginning of Hollywood admitting that there were gay people knocking around, even though half of Hollywood is gay”.McKellen came out publicly in 1988 and has been an industrious campaigner for equal rights ever since."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/90f9f0351b07a9db827d88f8ee097e6d0eac676c/0_32_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3fd040cf8074529c606b2291fd65e585","title":"arsenal appoint unai emery manager","story":"• Spaniard unveiled as head coach in place of manager Wenger• Emery: ‘I am thrilled to be joining one of the great clubs’Unai Emery has pledged to give Arsenal “some special moments and memories” after his appointment as the new head coach was confirmed on Wednesday morning. The 46-year-old Spaniard bolted from the status of outsider to sudden favourite on Monday and he has succeeded Arsène Wenger, who departed after 22 years in the job at the end of this past season.It seems significant that Emery’s title is that of head coach rather than manager and he has been asked to concentrate his efforts on coaching and man-managing the first-team. Ivan Gazidis, the chief executive, has overhauled the club, with Raul Sanllehi and Sven Mislintat having been given overall responsibility for transfers. Emery has agreed to work within the new structure and he knows that the club will operate on a £50m transfer budget this season.Gazidis oversaw a thorough recruitment process and a clutch of candidates were considered and interviewed – chief among them Mikel Arteta, Max Allegri and Patrick Vieira. Arteta was the favourite last week and he expected to be given the opportunity, despite his lack of managerial experience. In the end, though, Emery came to seem like a safer pair of hands given his pedigree at a string of clubs since the 2004-05 season, most recently Paris St-Germain and Sevilla.“I am thrilled to be joining one of the great clubs in the game,” Emery said. “Arsenal is known and loved throughout the world for its style of play, its commitment to young players, the fantastic stadium, the way the club is run. I’m very excited to be given the responsibility to start this important new chapter in Arsenal’s history.“I have met Stan and Josh Kroenke and it’s clear they have great ambitions for the club and are committed to bringing future success. I’m excited about what we can do together and I look forward to giving everyone who loves Arsenal some special moments and memories.”Stan Kroenke, the club’s majority shareholder, described Emery as a “proven winner”. Emery won five domestic honours in his two seasons at PSG – including the Ligue 1 title last season – although his lack of success in the Champions League cost him his job. He also struggled to impose his will on a dressing room packed with egos.Before that, Emery impressed greatly at Sevilla, despite having to sell the club’s best players on a regular basis. Most eye-catchingly, he won the Europa League for three seasons in a row.“We’re delighted to welcome Unai to Arsenal,” Kroenke said. “He’s a proven winner. We’re confident that he is the right person for the job and that he will work to deliver the triumphs our fans, staff and everyone who cares about Arsenal want.“Several things stood out during his interview and the entire process his football knowledge, energy, determination and love of the game. His familiarity with our club and our players, the Premier League, and the game in Europe were all very impressive. He shares our vision to move forward, to build on the platform created by Arsène Wenger and help this club enjoy greater success.”Gazidis said: “Unai has an outstanding track record of success throughout his career, has developed some of the best young talent in Europe and plays an exciting, progressive style of football that fits Arsenal perfectly. His hard-working and passionate approach and his sense of values on and off the pitch make him the ideal person to take us forward.“We conducted a confidential, wide-ranging and rigorous search involving extensive background references, data and video analysis, and personal meetings with all the candidates we shortlisted. All were interested in the position and we were unanimous in our choice of Unai to drive the next chapter of our history.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ca2abd9cd1e1d17774a12e5e93f233b79ae5bb5e/0_86_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=955522150d6a0aab53e0381a849e4254","title":"liverpool mohamed salah real madrid jurgen klopp alexander arnold marcelo","story":"Nothing, perhaps, should give Liverpool such heart ahead of Saturday’s Champions League final as Bayern Munich’s first goal against Real Madrid in the second leg of their semi-final.Nothing dramatic happens. Franck Ribéry turns in from the left flank and plays an unremarkable low pass in to Robert Lewandowski in a central position on the edge of the box. The ball bounces up in front of the Polish striker and his first touch as a result takes him away from goal. He is able, though, to shield the ball and, as Sergio Ramos decides to sit off, Lewandowski has time to work the ball wide to Thomas Müller who is, bafflingly, in 15 yards of space, out on the touchline, roughly level with the edge of the box.Marcelo, the Madrid left-back, has been drawn into the centre, tucking in as though anticipating that Lewandowski might allow Ribéry’s pass to run across his body and then turn Ramos. That much is reasonable. What is not is what then happens. Marcelo must have been aware of Müller’s presence. Müller is, after all, his primary concern. As soon as Lewandowski’s touch took him away from goal and Ramos didn’t lunge in (and nobody can blame Marcelo for thinking that he might), Marcelo should have been closing down the space. Instead, he dropped back, five yards behind the defensive line, and only then moved left to shut Müller down.By then it was probably too late, although Marcelo dawdled, hanging back in a no man’s land when a sprint might still have pressured the cross. Ramos, slightly half-heartedly, did cut out the cross at the near post, but his indecision knocked the ball down for Joshua Kimmich, who scored.Marcelo is perhaps the finest attacking left-back in the world. That deal that took him from Fluminense to Madrid in 2007 for around £5m may, pound for pound, be the greatest the club has completed. In the majority of the games they play, Marcelo is perfect for Madrid. He works up and down the line. He is quick. His touch is superb. He can cross. He scores a couple of goals a season. The only problem comes when he has to defend. Most of the time he doesn’t have to, but he surely will in Kiev.If Mohamed Salah is gifted the sort of space on Saturday that Müller was in that second leg, and if he produces anything like the sort of form he was showing a month ago, Liverpool will devastate Madrid on that flank. Normally, that would be enough to give them a clear edge, but this is anything but a normal game. None of the usual rules seem to apply.Nothing Trent Alexander-Arnold did in Rome was quite as eye-catching as Marcelo’s dilatoriness for that first Bayern goal, but equally the way Stephan El Shaarawy exposed him in the second leg will have not have gone unnoticed by Madrid. In part, of course, that’s because Salah was exempted from defensive duties that night, seemingly instructed to remain high up the pitch and occupy the space behind Aleksandar Kolarov so that every time Liverpool regained possession there was an obvious and dangerous out-ball.Whether Madrid play a 4-3-3 or, more likely, a 4-3-1-2 with Isco tucked behind Cristiano Ronaldo and Karim Benzema, Alexander-Arnold will surely be targeted. The question for Jürgen Klopp is then whether to have Salah drop back and help out defensively, or to call Madrid’s bluff and risk them doubling up on the full-back for the potential reward of Salah constantly in space high up the pitch behind Marcelo.In most games it would be enough to say the battle on that flank would be decisive. But here it feels inadequate. Dani Carvajal did return, after a month’s absence, to play the full 90 minutes against Villarreal on the final day of the league season, which means he, rather than the converted winger Lucas Vázquez, will play at right-back. But if there is any doubt about his fitness it will be sorely tested by the pace of Sadio Mané, particularly if Andy Robertson can get up to support him – which he should be able to do if Madrid play a 4-3-1-2 and focus on trying to expose Alexander-Arnold on the other flank.And then there’s the question of the centre. Ramos is a fine defender in one-on-one situations, but how will he and Raphaël Varane cope with Roberto Firmino dropping deep, leaving them with space to mark until Salah and Mané dart into it?A repeated problem for Liverpool under Klopp has been the lack of protection afforded their back four when they lose compactness and space opens up in front of it. The nature of their pressing game means there is no natural holding player to sit in. That is a major concern and one that Isco, tucked behind two forwards, could be ideally placed to exploit.Everywhere on the pitch, it seems, on both sides, there are defensive flaws that might be exploited. And that’s what makes this final so hard to read. It’s not just that either side could win, it’s that either side could win by a wide margin."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/67ec3492864d43846ab5c6f6c0fc035ee3317256/0_15_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0f385bb90dcd0f4b56ae48367b45f590","title":"lucy bronze champions league glory lyon wolfsburg kiev","story":"Liverpool supporters are not the only English in Ukraine this week – the former Manchester City defender Lucy Bronze is aiming for a treble in her first season at the French clubWhen Lucy Bronze moved from Manchester City to the European champions Lyon last summer she said she wanted to win the Champions League. Fittingly, the England defender’s goal separated her new and former clubs in April’s semi-final. On Thursday Bronze hopes to complete the job against Wolfsburg.“It was kind of written in the stars that it had to be me that scored the winning goal,” Bronze said as she prepared for the final in Kiev. “I think we could have had a few more but obviously I’m happy we won the game – we’re in the final and that’s why I came to Lyon.”Bronze was this week named as the BBC women’s footballer of the year, the first defender and first England player to win the award, but her move to the four-times Champions League winners took some getting used to. “At first it was a little bit intimidating meeting everyone. Everyone is a world-class player, in every single position, and I was scared to give the ball away – I still am now,” she laughs. “I’m scared to make a bad pass or put in a bad cross, but it’s good though, it’s pushing me. The reason I came to Lyon was to play with these players. I knew they could make me better because they are at such a good level.”There is a reason why Bronze has gone from being considered the world’s best right-back to the world’s best defender, yet she is modest about her ability compared with that of her team-mates: “Some of them have a ridiculous amount of football talent. I don’t think I’ll ever hit their level but I’ve learnt a lot from them and they’ve helped improve the parts of my game I came here to improve.“I’ve fed off them and they’ve fed off me. I’m really athletic and they appreciate that a bit more it’s been really good for all.”Bronze has also found the different style of coaching in France has challenged her. “In England it’s very tactical. When I think about my time at Man City or with England you go through so much detail.“That can be really good but sometimes you lose your fluidity and spontaneity. France is completely different. You don’t really have a lot of detail.“The coach just keeps telling us to play, play and move, pass and move, play off each other, work off each and that’s completely at the other end of the spectrum to what I’m used to. Maybe somewhere in between would be good, but it’s great that I get the balance of a lot of coaching with England when I’m with the national team and when I’m at Lyon I’m working on being a bit more impulsive.”Lyon have secured the league title and if they win the Champions League and their Coupe de France final against their nearest rivals Paris St-Germain they will complete a second successive treble.Wolfsburg, having won the league and cup double in Germany, are hoping for a treble of their own. Bronze sees Wolfsburg’s attacking play as the greatest threat. “They’ve got world-class players all over the pitch but Pernille Harder is their key player. She’s an attacking player, she links everything up, she creates goals, she scores goals.Unusually, the final will come with less pressure for Bronze than the semi-final against City. “The first leg was a strange moment – going back to my old team and playing such a big game, having stated the reason I came to Lyon was for the Champions League. I felt more pressure in that game than I’ve felt in any game in my life because of the situation.”Wolfsburg had to go through extra time and penalties against Bayern Munich to lift the DFB Pokal on Saturday, not ideal preparation. Although Lyon dropped their first points of the season when drawing 0-0 with PSG last Friday, Bronze thinks that was the perfect preparation. “We dominated the game and had all the chances – I think they maybe had one or two chances in the second half.“We know that nine times out of 10 we win that game. It’s not the end of the world and it’s good preparation and motivation for the final. We’ve basically just played a replay of last year’s Champions League final – there’s no better preparation. We drew, so we know now we need to be a bit better and not be complacent.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/083d6cd2e87daf1f9e86520b30f0ec84220fb325/0_30_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f2264f88b52a04f99185ab293f8a3c06","title":"unai emery unveiled as new arsenal manager live","story":"Unai Emery and Ivan Gazidis faced the media for the first time at the Emirates Stadium after the former PSG manager’s appointment at ArsenalThat’s an upbeat way for us to end! Thanks for joining me – and I’m sure we will be seeing and hearing plenty more from Mr Emery on these pages in the months to come. Enjoy the rest of your day!Email from Nathan Chehoud:“Just watched the interview, and was impressed with Emery’s balance of passion and pragmatism. Didn’t promise the world overnight, but did promise effort and commitment. And what a great expression – “protagonist”. I’m looking forward to my club being the protagonist in their own story. To being on the front foot, with a clear strategy - from the corporate side all the way through to each player and their inidual roles in inidual games. Much as I loved the Wenger Era, the last few years didn’t feel like Arsenal were writing their own story – more having it written for them by external factors and internal inertia. This Gunner is excited – and sleepy. It’s midnight in Australia.”True, too. Gazidis underlined that: this is a new page, a club whose inner workings now look unrecognisable to those of a decade, or even five years, ago.A good take – I doubt that, emotionally, the highs will be too high or the lows too low with Emery.My take: there wasn’t a huge amount to get worked up about one way or the other, partly because Emery is fairly savvy, partly because he doesn’t speak fluent English and partly because he’s-only-just-arrived-so-give-the-poor-guy-a-chance. But he’s clearly up for the challenge, wants to play energetic and assertive football, and feels he is the right fit for the club. It was a decent enough first outing in front of the media but I suspect that, for the time being, his actions will speak louder than his words.In the meantime don’t be shy – drop me a line with your responses to all that. Did you like what you heard from Emery?Incidentally, I felt the most interesting part of that was Gazidis’s outline of the process’s timescale, in that long bit right at the start. Clearly keen to put any idea that Emery wasn’t No 1 choice until very late on to bed ...That’s it from Emery, and indeed from Gazidis. Top lines to follow ...Are you relishing beating Guardiola or Mourinho at last? Have you spoken to any other Premier League managers?“In terms of my past experience, it makes me feel stronger and also allows me to have a guide to my future trajectory. Im very excited to be here, against top coaches and top teams, and have to say the Premier League now it right at the top.“I speak with a lot of coaches, those are private conversations, but now that I’m here all information is welcome.”Mesut Ozil – what do you think of him?How will you win the Champions League?“All titles are important for us. We can, and want to be, candidates for them. I don’t promise today we will win, but I can promise you we will work hard, will work together, will work with emotion, demanding to find all the objectives.”What most attracted you to this project? Any other offers? What would be success for you next season?“I had three fantastic meetings in terms of who was at those meetings. First I met with Ivan, Raul and Sven, they analysed me as a person and a coach, and thought I could be an option for this team. I have to say after a three-hour meeting there was fantastic chemistry between us. That came simply from the fact it was Arsenal, a wonderful history, and I hoped there could be a new future for the club. The second meeting was with the owners, the heart of the club, they transmitted what the fans wanted and I felt a positive energy. My third meeting was in Atlanta and again I had a fantastic feeling. Everything has been very positive in terms of the challenge, which makes me very proud and is a great opportunity to grow.“Success would be developing, and that’s about battling for every title. It’s in Arsenal’s history and it’s in my history as well. We want to be among the best teams in Europe. I want the team to make the fans proud of the side. I know they are already but I want to make them even more so.”Back to Emery – how you describe your style of football?“In my career I am very demanding for all, demanding of the players also. My idea is to be a protagonist for all of the match. We play against teams with this personality, and I think the history here shows they love playing with possession of the ball. I like this, and when you don’t have possession of the ball I want a squad very, very intense in pressing. It’s two things that are very important for me. Being a protagonist, possession of the ball, and pressing.”To Gazidis – how big is the rebuilding job?“Our players, we believe, will respond to the new energy Unai brings. They will have somebody under whom they can improve their inidual and collective games. If they embrace these challenges the players we have today can be more successful. I don’t think anybody thinks sixth place is a position for a club of our stature How big a rebuilding job is a conversation we have begin and we want to be a candidate for the biggest trophies, as Unai said. But it can’t be done in one leap. I strongly think our fans, when they see the energy Unai brings to the club, will embrace it. The challenge is great, we’ve spent a lot of time building to this moment, not just the last month or six weeks. Building up the capabilities of the club, facilities, medical, analytics, scouting, recruitment. We are working in a different way to the past, more of a team effort, supporting Unai’s vision and energy and finding ways to be successful.”Was it too inidual in the past?“I don’t say that, I’m not looking backwards, we’re doing it in a new way but you’re never going to hear me being critical of what’s gone before. Now is the time for us to turn a new page and look forward with confidence. There’s a special feeling here and we need to recapture this and push this club forward.”What are your targets? Do you need to spend a lot?“I believe in the players we have here. We can grow with these players and the objective is to work hard with these talented players, to work to be a candidate for all the titles in the future. Then it’s very important for the club, after two years outside the Champions League, to work towards this, to arrive and be the best team in the Premier League and also the world.”Emery’s range of expression in English isn’t great, you might discern, but he’s giving it a go ...How passionately did you fight for this job?“In all the meetings with the people – Ivan, Raul, Sven – the connection was very important. We spoke about all they want and I want to work together, on this club, this responsibility. To know my ambition, my passion. It is a big responsibility but I think this feeling is very important and my experiences with big clubs are important. All the conversations are very good.”Is Jack Wilshere in your plans?“I don’t want to speak about any of the players today. We think we need to change little things. Today I want to work, want to speak globally for the squad.”“In my career every year I grow up with a new challenge. For me the challenge is a dream come true.”What are your immediate priorities?“Now? To know you. And all the conversations with Ivan and people who work here, to give me all the information about the club. I know all the players, I think they are very important and I want to speak inidually with them face to face.”Now Emery is speaking, thanking people and speaking highly of the conversation he had with the board. “Also thank you Ivan, Raul and Sven. The first meeting with Arsenal personnel was with people who, after three hours, I had a very good feeling that we will work together and create a new present and future for Arsenal.”He also thanks Arsène Wenger for his legacy. “For all coaches in the world you are a reference. I learned with him all the things in football.”“My English is not the very best now and I want to make an effort to speak with you to explain my ambition. I am very excited for this opportunity at a big club, a great city and stadium.”Ivan Gazidis: “I’m really delighted and excited to announce the new head coach. I know that came as a bit of a surprise, perhaops there were one or two rewrites necessary. But those who know won’t speak and those who speak won’t know. I’ll give you a little insight into the process. We formed a three-person committee of me, Sven Mislintat and Raul Sanllehi. We had some clear criteria: aggressive, entertaining football personality that fitted with Arsenal’s values also a record of developing players through detailed tactical instruction and also cultural demand, pushing players.“We looked through and analysed on the basis that every coach in the world would be interested in this position. We don’t believe any position in world football is more attractive. We created an eight-person longlist. All of them were interested and took part in extensive, in-person interviews. None of them at any stage withdrew their interest. So we were in a fortunate position to make our first choice, and that’s what we did. Our first interviewee was conducted on 25th April, our last was conducted on 15th May and we interviewed Unai on 10th May. We made our unanimous recommendation to the board on 18th May, accompanied by a 100-page dossier. We then met with London members of our board on Monday this week. Unai and Raul and I flew to Atlanta and met Josh and Stan Kroenke and flew back on the red-eye last night.“So why Unai Emery? I’ve followed Unai’s career very closely and he’s always ben on my radar screen. He’s got a fantastic record wherever he’s gone and his team’s improve over time. He’s a superb fit with the criteria I laid out. But it’s important to move this beyond the paper exercise and having taken third-person references it was very important to move to personal meetings. Unai was incredibly impressive, he came in extraordinarily well prepared, he had an analysis of all of our inidual players, their qualities and how he believes he can help them develop inidually and collectively, and also detailed analysis of our off-field team. But this wasn’t a purely technical exercise. What also distinguished Unai was the chemistry between us and feeling for football in the room. His detail, hard work, love for football and will to win made us think this fit was exactly right.”Here we go – Emery is sitting down at the Emirates ...Arsenal have produced a very nice little slideshow of their most successful managers – Chapman, Whittaker, Mee, Graham – to go with this appointment, but somehow forgotten to include Wenger ...“I’m pleased we’ve got someone credible enough to take us to the next step,” Ian Wright has said. I mean, that’s the thing: Emery has serially won European trophies with a club that, like Arsenal, hasn’t seriously been troubling the biggest title contenders. The fit isn’t too bad.Looks pretty packed in the Emirates press room. I’ve even seen our own Amy Lawrence on the telly sharing a joke with a colleague of ours. I’m sure there’ll be plenty of reaction from Amy and the rest of our reporters when all this is done.An extract from Stan Kroenke’s welcome message:“Several things stood out during his interview and the entire process his football knowledge, energy, determination and love of the game. His familiarity with our club and our players, the Premier League and the game in Europe were all very impressive. He shares our vision to move forward, to build on the platform created by Arsène Wenger and help this club enjoy greater success.”He may or may not have been first choice but those who’ve seen Emery work closely reckon he’s a top operator.Arsenal fans, does all this excite you? I’m getting “meh” vibes from a lot of people but I don’t think it is a huge slight on Emery that he only achieved mixed success at PSG. Anyone who goes there is on a hiding to nothing and this season he had to work around the absurd Neymar circus too, which I’d not wish on anyone. Won’t he add to Arsenal the level of attention to detail, particularly when looking at opponents’ strengths and weaknesses, that his predecessor wasn’t so hot on?“His career speaks for itself. He did it perfectly in Spain with many teams, as well in France. Welcome to England, a good manager is coming.”Not my words: those of Pep Guardiola when pressed on the arrival of his countryman.Warm wishes from the club where Emery made his name.I’m watching dramatic footage of Emery being shown the Emirates Stadium dressing rooms by Gazidis. “You can stand here and everyone will watch you,” Gazidis explained to his new colleague, before showing Emery to his new office.Before we get going, let me point you towards this excellent piece by David Hytner about the man who appointed Emery, Ivan Gazidis, who I think we may be hearing from later as well:Arsenal have a new manager! Yes they do, and what a strange sentence that is to write. Here’s the even more exciting part: he’s about to speak to us, we think at about 2pm UK time, so let’s huddle round the monitor to see exactly what Unai Emery has to say.Should we expect a bold mission statement? A few swift platitudes? A duet with Arsène Wenger? A withering takedown of Neymar followed by a detailed outline for his plans to eke world domination out of Alex Iwobi? We will soon find out. And in the meantime, let me know your reactions to this appointment – which of course was only confirmed this morning. It’s all moved very quickly indeed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2e7d4184da16db822c94e6b752f632cf444e13c3/0_0_5976_3586/master/5976.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=91b0718305133404facfd333c04ed2ce","title":"while the city sleeps london after hours a photo essay","story":"Photographer  Sean Smith captures the city at night, from cabaret stars to road maintenance workers, homeless people to fire wardensPhotographer  Sean Smith captures the city at night, from cabaret stars to road maintenance workers, homeless people to fire wardensIn the changing rooms backstage at Proud Cabaret in London, half a dozen performers are crammed together preparing themselves for the evening’s shows. As one liberally applies eye makeup, another fills the air with a cloud of hairspray. There are nipple tassels, high heels, leather and wigs. It’s 8pm and the night is about to begin.“There’s always a buzzing atmosphere while everyone prepares for the doors to open,” says Fiona Jay-Brown, one half of the acrobatic duo Deux Ailes. “There are a lot of performers so it does get very busy backstage but we all do our best to get the show on the road. There’s rarely a backstage panic. Whether it’s missing tit-tape or hairspray running out, we all help each other out.”Over at the Houses of Parliament, the scene is quiet and the politicians are long gone. Fire officers Eddie Brennan and Paul Chambers sweep through the House of Lords, past the empty benches, along more than three miles of corridors and down into the bowels of the famous structure, patrolling for potential fire hazards.“It’s a world heritage-listed building and I don’t want to go down as the next Guy Fawkes!” quips Brennan.Drawn from the London Fire Brigade, Brennan and his colleagues oversee numerous government buildings in the area. This past year they have investigated more than 200 alarms and reports of fire “but, touch wood, we haven’t had to fully evacuate the palace in the four years I’ve been working here,” he says.Much of the current palace was built following the devastating fire of 1834. The architect, Charles Barry, used brick, stone and iron to try to minimise the risks of another catastrophe but in the interiors he and Augustus Pugin used vast quantities of highly flammable materials.That said, Brennan notes that people present the greatest risk. “You’ve got people laying data cables next to old plumbing and it’s all out of sight, out of mind you find people propping the fire doors open and forgetting to switch off stoves and heaters and lamps. Even after the latest round of modifications, the palace will always be vulnerable to fire.”Further down the river, another London landmark, Tower Bridge, is also staffed at night. The bridge is raised around 850 times a year for registered vessels with a mast or superstructure of nine metres or more.Tower Bridge was the largest and most sophisticated bascule bridge ever built when it was finished in 1894. The lifting mechanism was originally operated using steam to power the enormous pumping engines these days the hydraulics are driven by oil and electricity while the upper walkway – now a function space with a glass floor offering views directly over the Thames – is lit in vivid pink.With the roads relatively free of congestion, Transport for London begins night maintenance work at the Upper Thames Street tunnel. Opened in 1970, approximately 40,000 vehicles and 4,000 cyclists travel through the half-mile long tunnel every day.“We have only one opportunity every three months to close the tunnel and carry out all repairs, maintenance and cleaning for the next three,” says Stewart Wilson, Asset Operations Manager. “You really feel the pressure when you have a dozen jobs that all need to be carried out at once, before the tunnel reopens.”Westminster has become a European hotspot for homelessness, with more and more people moving to the heart of London in search of hope, opportunity and support. By nightfall, not all have managed to get a roof over their heads.The Connection at St Martin’s, next to Trafalgar Square, provides help for approximately 4,500 people a year its night centre accommodates up to 45 people every night – or more during severe weather – on a short-stay basis.“Most of our clients have complex issues so our approach is to help them deal with trauma and help them to gain independence and get their confidence back,” says The Connection’s night centre manager, Paul Symonds.“They’re really relieved to get indoors at night, to have a nutritious hot meal and to get their heads down. It’s like a pool of tranquility while you’re surrounded by the bright lights and madness of central London.”Symonds adds: “You meet the most interesting characters you could ever hope to meet – that’s the joy of the job. I’ve always felt it a privilege really.“We do have our challenging moments with people dealing with addiction and mental health, but generally it’s very fulfilling.”“London can be rough when you’re on the streets. I’ve had some good times, I’ve had some bad times,” says Ken, one of the residents.“You’ve got to understand that to get into The Connection you’ve got to spend at least four nights on the street. They’ve got to see you sleeping out. There are people who’ve been out a lot longer than that, though. At least here you’ve got a bunk and the staff are quite helpful.”While London sleeps, Spitalfields night market comes alive with traders buying and selling goods. Around 750,000 tonnes of produce passes through the market each year and is shifted by 233 forklifts and about 2,000 employees.The market has been on its present 32-acre site near Hackney Wick since 1992 though its royal charter dates back to 1682 when Charles II granted permission for a twice-weekly market for flesh, fowl and roots.Peter Durber began trading at the market in 1983. “It’s still busy and bustling but it’s evolved to be a very different market over the years,” he says. “It was predominantly white trade with Jewish influence but now there’s a very large ethnic influence which has kept it alive and reflects the ersity of London.”Durber works 12 hours, six nights a week, starting at 3am. “Any sane person would look at the hours we work and think we’re all crazy,” he says. “It’s a bit of a beast but I enjoy what I do and when you have a buzz and you enjoy what you do, the time goes very quickly.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/845024883b316ad6d511b650265c74f2d6e401d7/0_0_4200_2520/master/4200.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ce724c20e07650068e359fa43fe77d0b","title":"western consumers fund extremism by buying talcum powder claims study","story":"Talc used in products sold in Europe and the US is often mined in Afghanistan by Isis and the Taliban, finds reportIslamic State and the Taliban are engaged in a bitter battle over control of mines in Afghanistan that supply much of the talcum used by European and US consumers.The mineral, used in everything from baby powder and cosmetics to paint and car parts, is mined in areas of eastern Afghanistanwhere the Taliban and Islamic State in Afghanistan are vying for supremacy.The struggle to control the extraction of talc and other minerals, such as chromite, has been exposed in a new report by Global Witness. The campaign group has spent months investigating how the murky trade means western consumers are effectively supporting insurgents in the country. Nick Donovan, campaign director for Global Witness, said that while talc lacked the imaginative allure of blood diamonds, which have featured in Hollywoods films and global rap music hits, it was nonetheless a “blood mineral”.“This report shows the insidious way in which insurgents have become involved in talc mining and the threat of groups like Isis becoming more involved,” said Donovan.He added that, while the Taliban’s involvement in talc mining is now well established, the move by the Afghan branch of Isis into mining the mineral appeared to follow a pattern whereby the group attempts to seize and exploit resources as a way of funding its efforts. The trend has been particularly marked in Iraq and Syria, where the group has moved into crude oil refining.According to the report, Isis in Afghanistan now controls large talc, marble and chromite mines in eastern Afghanistan, particularly around their stronghold in Achin district in Nangarhar province, the same area where the US military dropped the “mother of all bombs” against Isis-held caves in April 2017.Several sources interviewed for the report said significant mining has taken place under Isis since they took control. The group has fought major battles with the Taliban over neighbouring districts containing even richer deposits.One former security source told researchers they believed Isis had been involved in trying to construct a road to Pakistan to export minerals from areas controlled by the group.“The Islamic State appears to have a significant strategic interest in Afghanistan’s minerals and controls some major mining areas,” said Donovan. “Given its track record of exploiting natural resources in Iraq and Syria, this should be a wake-up call for both the Afghan government and the Trump administration.“They must strengthen control over the trade in places like Nangarhar, but just as importantly put in place desperately needed transparency and oversight reforms so that legitimate mining has a chance to provide a viable alternative.”The findings of the Global Witness investigation follow research suggesting that the Taliban is making millions annually from talc as part of the estimated $300m (£225m) a year they rake in from minerals across Afghanistan. Almost all of Afghanistan’s talc is exported to Pakistan, said the report, which in turn exports more of it to the US than to any other country. Pakistan provides more than a third of US imports of talc, with EU countries also major buyers. “Unwitting American and European consumers are inadvertently helping fund extremist groups in Afghanistan,” said Donovan, adding that a ban on the talc trade in Afghanistan, imposed in early 2015, had been weakly enforced – not least because of the involvement of political figures in the trade.

I was particularly drawn to the compact evergreen cultivar Euphorbia ‘Black Pearl’ in Chris Beardshaw’s Morgan Stanley garden, although I also spotted architectural caper spurge (E. lathyris, often maligned as a weed), bright-yellow-flowered Wallich spurge (E. wallichii) and lime-yellow cushion spurge (E. epithymoides) all over the showground.2 Fancy giving room to the prehistoric-looking black-ribbed stalks of scouring rush (Equisetum hyemale), which popped up in a couple of Chelsea gardens this year? Don’t be put off because it’s a relative of the horribly invasive weed horsetail: this is a brilliant low-maintenance architectural plant that loves swampy spots and pond edges. It was shown off to good effect in Nic Howard’s garden, set against a simple charcoal-grey wall and softened with Mexican fleabane (Erigeron karvinskianus). Stuart Towner paired it with Hosta ‘Devon Green’, Japanese forest grass (Hakonechloa macra), Gunnera magellanica and European wild ginger (Asarum europaeum). Scouring rush will spread relentlessly if given free rein, so contain it in a trough or water feature.3 If you are looking for low-maintenance, low-cost alternatives to paving your front garden, gravel has much to recommend it, and at this year’s Chelsea several gardens took this theme in different directions. Sarah Price showed how to use a Mediterranean plant palette with the papery pink flowers of the Cretan rockrose (Cistus creticus) and the vivid red flower clusters of the blood pink (Dianthus cruentus). Gravel’s also a good mulch for shade planting: see Nic Howard’s row of the huge (and thankfully slug-resistant) leaves of Hosta ‘Sum and Substance’ planted in gravel along a narrow bed that would work perfectly in a gloomy side return.4 If I was in any doubt about the rise of the houseplant, the visitors swarming over the displays of cacti, succulents and orchids in the Great Pavilion were proof of their staying power. It’s not only because these plants are so Instagrammable – Popsy the Cactus from Craig House Cacti is now so popular she has her own Twitter account – but because for many of us without much outside space, an air plant or two is a far more realistic prospect. A collaboration between Ikea and Indoor Garden Design offers clever ways to display plants indoors, from space-saving hanging planters to planters on peg boards. You’ll see houseplants creeping into show gardens, too, from the blue chalksticks succulent (Senecio serpens) in Sarah Price’s garden to the cast-iron plants (Aspidistra elatior) dotted through Stuart Towner’s garden.5 Want garden furniture that will never require repainting and doesn’t need covering in winter? What about a slab of rock? Jo Thompson’s show garden for Wedgwood shows how it’s done, with flat-topped chunks of York stone serving as chair or table or both simply add a comfy cushion or blanket. Just make sure you think carefully about where to position them, as you won’t be able to move them easily. If you’re more of a wood type, take the lead from Nic Howard, whose garden seats are simple cubes of oak, charred and shaped to make the perfect resting spot.6 If summer bedding leaves you cold, try planting up containers with succulents instead. The Pearlfisher garden cleverly employed echeverias, kalanchoes, sedums, crassulas and the like to mimic an underwater scene, while communicating its message about the perils of marine plastic pollution. The key to success is a very free-draining growing medium (use cactus and succulent compost, and choose a pot with plenty of holes in the bottom) and the sunniest spot you can muster. Remember to bring them inside to a frost-free place once summer starts to fade.7 It may be the flower show, but some gardens demonstrated that big and bold foliage can offer as much impact. Stuart Towner’s Spirit of Cornwall garden is a masterclass in combining different shapes and textures to create a big-leaved border, using the palmate-leaved false castor oil plant (Fatsia japonica), the pleated leaves of rodgersias and the huge corrugated leaves of Chilean rhubarb (Gunnera manicata). If you want a really unusual bold-leaved foliage shrub for your garden, get your hands on a spikenard (Aralia cordata), as shown off by Tom Stuart-Smith in his Weston garden in the Great Pavilion.8 Bare concrete in a garden is usually shorthand for something ugly and municipal, but this year’s Chelsea shows how to use this material in an inspired way, from the concrete cubes that break up frothy planting in Robert Barker’s Skin Deep conceptual garden to Stuart Towner’s simple oval concrete patio in his Spirit of Cornwall garden. Just make sure the lines are clean, the finish professional and the planting abundant."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b0e730e9f257d4d40f6443f7cc8896d2818f9ba5/0_460_5436_3262/master/5436.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b8e95d1d2ba22e38f46d394ae9f87e5e","title":"ditch the tin foil and channel yotam ottolenghi how to enjoy eating outdoors","story":"From flying insects to the weather, Mother Nature can be a cruel mistress. Here’s how to master British summer picnics and barbecues and realise your alfresco dining fantasies The simple pleasures of dining alfresco are a well-worn topic at this time of year: it is hardly news that food tastes better in the open air, even if it is more likely to be our appreciation, rather than our perception of flavour, that is enhanced by the novel surroundings of a cliff top, a sailing dinghy or even a park bench.Indeed, although the rustic romance of un déjeuner sur l’herbe has inspired writers and painters for centuries, the picturesque results tend to be heavily seasoned with artistic licence. No wasps hang around the fruit basket in Manet’s painting and nary a seagull e-bombs the bread and cheese as Virginia Woolf’s fractious family finally make their voyage to the lighthouse. If the Famous Five’s tinned sardines ever leaked fishy oil all over the rug, I don’t remember it, while Renoir’s boating party seem bizarrely untroubled by the distinct possibility that the small dog on the table will upset their wine glasses.These are fantasies of alfresco life, but in truth Mother Nature is a cruel mistress who doesn’t give a fig for your carefully laid plans or meticulously sliced cucumber sandwiches – which is why it pays to come prepared for all eventualities. Here’s a guide to dealing with a few of the challenges likely to crop up as soon as the words “it’s a lovely day!” leave your mouth.These days, most special diets are easy to cater for with a little notice – but when someone texts on the day to inform you they have gone plant-based, or gluten-free, it can be tempting to reply telling them to bring their own bloody lunch. Before you do, count to 10 and channel Yotam Ottolenghi: a Middle Eastern feast will keep everyone happy. Big bowls of hummus or baba ganoush, paired with a salad of roasted or barbecued veg and some falafel or vegetable fritters are sure to go down a treat with omnivores, too – add pitta or other flatbreads to bulk it out, then finish with fruit and meringues or damp, sticky polenta cake. Most of these are gluten free and can easily be made vegan too. Failing that, almost all supermarkets carry a wide range of free-from products – and everyone likes crisps, right?Even the most committed animal lover might be hard-pressed to welcome our flying friends to the feast – but if you are eating outside, a certain insect presence is inevitable to be fair to them, it’s where they live. The best way of deterring wasps and bees is thought to be to trap the first inquisitive scout before it returns to the nest weighed down with ketchup and alerts 250 of its nearest and dearest to the free buffet going on in your back garden. Avoid setting up camp close to ponds or the standing water beloved of mozzies and midges instead, embrace the fresh air of a breezy hilltop – most flying insects hate both wind and smoke, which is a great excuse for a barbecue or a campfire.The crunch of sand between the teeth may seem as inevitable a part of eating on the beach as a stiff wind and a Mr Whippy for pudding, but there are ways to reduce your silica consumption. Go for food such as wraps, filled baguettes and oranges that can be eaten straight from their wrappers (see below for eco-friendly options) with minimal contact with the gritty environment. Make sure you rinse your hands, preferably with fresh water, before you even think of unpacking anything, although even a bucket of sea water is better than nothing.Obviously, sun is welcome whether you are planning a barbie in the back garden or a celebratory drink at the top of a mountain, but it can be problematic keeping food fresh in the heat. A good rule of thumb is to choose dishes from warmer climes: cured salami and ham are more robust than poached salmon or coronation chicken, just as parmesan, manchego or feta will do better than cheddar or stilton in sunshine. (That said, if you are eating at home, or can keep them flat in transit, bries, camemberts and their ilk come into their own after a few hours outside the fridge.) Crunchy carrots and radishes and Mediterranean veg are preferable to leafy greens, and vinaigrettes tend to hold up better than mayonnaise in high temperatures. If you are making sandwiches ahead of time, consider replacing the butter with avocado mashed with lemon juice, or a soft cheese.This is more likely to be a problem in the UK than sun, sadly – but all is not lost if the forecast begins to look grim one of the best picnics I have ever eaten was consumed in the very damp shadow of a dry-stone wall on Scafell Pike in December. As on a beach, choose foods that can be eaten straight from the wrappers, and avoid soft bread or delicate pastry: you’d be surprised how water-repellent a pork pie or scotch egg is compared with your average loaf of sliced white. If you are taking advantage of a brief break in the clouds to picnic, pack a waterproof layer to protect the rug, and your bottoms, from soggy grass. If the forecast looks similarly grim for a long-planned barbecue and you cannot fit the grill under cover, or prop a well-weighted umbrella over it, then go for dishes such as jerk chicken or ribs, which can be cooked in advance and then finished off either on a grill or a hot pan, depending on how the sky is looking, or choose recipes that work in the oven as well as on the barbecue.If you are planning to eat a few hundred yards from your own kitchen, I probably do not need to tell you that a tray will come in handy. For picnics at distant beauty spots and barbecues on the beach, however, it pays to consider the very unromantic question of logistics. Some foods travel better than others exquisite Parisian pastries will not look quite so pretty once they have been carted up a hill, but a sturdy British pie with a hot water crust could probably be kicked up there without much damage. Hard cheeses, cooked meats, boiled eggs and crunchy pickles are all good choices, as are soft things such as hummus or potato salad, which won’t mind being shaken about a bit. If you must take ripe tomatoes or stone fruits, then wrap them in newspaper as carefully as fine china, and put them in storage boxes. Cold drinks can be happily decanted into Thermos flasks full of ice.One of the chief pleasures of picnics in particular is their simplicity: unless physical necessity demands it, this is not the time for tables and chairs. Much lovelier to lounge about on the grass, sand or a sun-warmed rock and feel at one with nature as you shovel Pringles into your gob. In reality, all of those surfaces can be prickly, damp or downright spiky – so if you can manage to lug along a stout, preferably waterproof rug as well as the food, all the better (a sheet of plastic, or a few large Ikea bags, underneath an ordinary rug, does the job just as well). If you are planning to sit for a while, you might also like to suggest each guest brings a cushion as head support for an eminently sensible postprandial nap, and consider bringing a parasol as a sunshade: though a hat apiece is considerably easier to carry. Proper cloth napkins not only give a picnic an air of sophistication but are much more useful than paper ones, which tend to disintegrate at the mere sight of mayonnaise – and, of course, they are endlessly reusable, as well as handy for wrapping any crockery, glasses, boiled eggs and so on.As above, if you are eating away from home, keep it simple. Go for finger food – crudités and dips, burgers, hot dogs or samosas – and all you need are napkins to wipe your hands afterwards, although a bottle opener is sure to come in useful at most British picnics, as will some beakers. (Unless you want to be lugging those around yourself, ask everyone to bring their own – it will save on the washing up too.) If you are planning to barbecue away from home, invest in a small portable grill rather than wasteful disposable ones: some models are hardly more expensive, and you will be able to enjoy them for many summers to come. Barbecues will never be the most eco-friendly option of course, but you can also help by fuelling them with sustainable British lumpwood charcoal.Naturally, this should be kept to a minimum – principally for environmental reasons, although aesthetically there is little to spoil the simple elegance of a picnic like outrageous amounts of plastic wrap strewn across the rug. This should not be a problem if you are making the food yourself: there are plenty of good eco-friendly options out there, from sandwich wraps to Indian tiffin boxes, which are not only reusable, but far easier on the eye than tin foil, and a lot better at their job as well. Unless you are feeding the 5,000, you may prefer to decant condiments and seasonings into small jars (I collect tiny jam jars from hotel breakfasts for the purpose), though always leave dressing salads and sandwiches until the last minute, if possible, to minimise the risk of things going soggy and slimy in transit.In theory, without all that rubbish to deal with, this should be relatively painless: box up any leftovers for tomorrow’s lunch, then sluice out dirty containers with water if it is available and going spare, and roughly dry with the aforementioned napkins before packing away. It’s always a good idea to take a couple of bags for any disposable packaging and recycling you do manage to accumulate, and if you are likely to be somewhere without water, a few damp flannels in a waterproof washbag will be invaluable for cleaning hands and faces before you release any trapped wasps, shake out the rug and head home, smug in the knowledge you have done your patriotic duty by the great British summer."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ee007c78e9aeed218f7d0da4be670670a6063a7c/0_277_5189_3113/master/5189.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=693bd2ba504e41e1ab1154994ba89f47","title":"natalie lee joes recipe for pork tonkatsu sando","story":"This fried pork cutlet sandwich is a bit naughty, super tasty and the perfect late-night indulgencePork tonkatsu sando – fried breaded pork cutlet in a sandwich – is something I\u0026nbsplove cooking when I get home late at night.

But just getting through the qualifying races is an epic feat in itself When you tell other ultra runners that you are training for the Ultra-Trail du Mont- Blanc (UTMB), they give you a certain look. Oh, you are a serious ultra runner. You can almost feel your trail cred rising.Not because the UTMB is the toughest race, or the longest, or in the most extreme conditions – although it is fairly extreme, being a 105-mile race around Mont Blanc that traverses a route with a total ascent of 34,000ft (10,300m) and passes through three different countries.The main reason they give you that subtle nod of kudos is because just qualifying for the UTMB is an epic feat in itself. To even enter the ballot for a place, you have to accumulate points by running three qualifying races. While you do not need to win or do particularly well in any of these races – unless you’re shooting for an elite place at the UTMB – you do need to finish them all within the cut-offs.But now I have a place. The UTMB is also the most competitive ultra trail in the world, with more of the top elite runners turning up each year, treating it as the grand final, the unofficial world championships of the sport. I have no illusions about being competitive anywhere near the front of this race, but after just over a year of ultra running, when something has gone wrong in every race I have run, I am working on being as good as I can be, for what will be the culmination of my two-year ultra running adventure.It began last February when I decided to shoot for the UTMB and ran the first qualifying race, and my first ever ultra, a 35-mile jaunt along the coastal path near my home in south Devon. Since then, I have got lost in races, worn the wrong shoes, forgotten to carry water, had extreme lows – clinging to the side of a mountain during a storm in the night –and extreme highs, when I felt like superman, flying up Holyhead mountain 130 miles into the Ring O Fire Anglesey race, unable to believe that these legs that had struggled even to walk a few hours earlier now felt brand new, straight out of the box and filled with rocket fuel.And so, with my entry to the UTMB confirmed, last weekend I took on one of two final warm-up races before the big one. It was a mere 45-mile race along the Jurassic coast in Dorset. “Just a baby ultra,” I kept telling people beforehand.My latest lesson in this sport is never to underestimate an ultra race. The numbers in ultra running are so big and insane that they start to become meaningless in the space between the races, when you’re talking and thinking about them rather than actually running them. After some of the races I had already done, 45 miles seemed like nothing.That was until about 20 miles in, when I started cramping while climbing up some steps after running along Lulworth Cove beach. It was a hot day and I hadn’t taken in enough salt. Luckily the cramps went away, but then came three brutal hills in quick succession, cliffs, pure vertical madness, interspersed, of course, by three terrifying descents. By then, I was on the point of dropping out. I had my reasons clearly laid out in my mind. This was only a training race, and so 25 miles was quite far enough for a training run. And it was dangerous to run with cramps – they had come back a few times on those three hills. What if I got stuck on my own somewhere remote and couldn’t even walk. It was irresponsible to carry on.But something, and it is still hard for me to fathom quite what it is, pushed me on. Every time I resolved to stop, it said no. Go on, go a bit further. After a while, the miles still left to go and the distances already run started to blur, and my mind stopped counting, focused completely on the simple act of moving, even if it was merely shuffling. The cliff paths and seaside towns were full of holidaymakers enjoying a balmy weekend. I ran through them with my rucksack and the number pinned on my shirt like an oddball. But word of who we were had got out, and people cheered me on, telling me I was amazing, telling me to keep going. I tried to wave or smile back. When did I become the maddest guy in town? There were moments of exquisite beauty, when you would come across an isolated cove that took your breath away. In these ultras, you are so raw, that everything is more extreme. A hug from a loved one at an aid station, or the sudden appearance of nature in full bloom, can bring you close to tears. But you must go on. Perpetual forward motion is the goal. Race positions stop mattering – it ceases to become a race. I had started out with a goal time and position, but six hours on, none of that mattered. All that mattered was to keep moving, one step after another.The race ended at Old Harry Rocks. It was a setting to lift the spirits, but just finishing was ecstasy. To sit on the warm grass, take off my shoes and stare out to sea after eight and a half hours of running. In that moment, it all made sense.And so I have one more warm-up race left to go. A 78-mile run through the Dolomites in Italy. It is a scary prospect, lots more big numbers, but for now I am going to bask a little longer in the glory of another ultra completed. Another step along this crazy path I set out on when I decided, last February, to enter the UTMB.

The structure and terms of any offer by Comcast … would be at least as favourable to Fox shareholders as the Disney offer.” Comcast, which owns NBC Universal, said it had not made a final decision on whether to make a formal offer but that the work on financing a bid and making regulatory findings were “well advanced”.A spokesman for Fox declined to comment on the potential Comcast bid. However, at the company’s recent results Lachlan Murdoch, Fox’s executive chairman, was asked about reports of Comcast considering gatecrashing the Disney deal.“We are committed to our agreement with Disney and are working through the conditions to bring it to a closing,” he said. “In addition, our directors, though, of course are aware of their fiduciary duties on behalf of all shareholders.”Daniel Ives, head of technology research at GBH Insights, said that a Comcast bid would be “game changing” and, if successful, would seriously harm Disney’s plan to build and provide content for a rival streaming service to Netflix.Earlier this week, Comcast’s bid for Sky was given a boost when the culture secretary said he was “minded not” to refer it to broadcasting regulator Ofcom to assess any potential public interest concerns.Fox has said it remained committed to its offer for Sky and is “considering its options”, which means it could potentially raise its bid.

Huge artists had toured huge sports arenas before the Stones’ 1981 jaunt around the US, but not on that scale, not with that profit, and not with corporate sponsorship – courtesy of Jōvan Musk, an aftershave one suspects Mick Jagger was no more likely to wear than he was to spray himself with manure. There were also pay-per-view tie-ins and the early 80s equivalent of live streaming to cinemas: all the stuff one now expects when the rock aristocracy hit the road.The best part of four decades on, with umpteen tours that make their 1981 outing look like the apotheosis of understatement, you might imagine the Stones’ stadium show to be a thing of perfectly-drilled slickness. In a sense, it is. You get a lot of what you might expect to get at a Rolling Stones show in London, from Mick Jagger reminiscing about a long-lost local venue, Dalston Baths (or, as he puts it, “a place near ear called Dalston Barfs”), to footage on the big screens that evokes their past – when they were Britain’s premiere exponents of tough Chicago blues. And there’s the way the rock-solid drumming of Charlie Watts is augmented by the various facial expressions of Charlie Watts, every one of which somehow communicates that this nonsense is all a bit beneath him.But in a sense it isn’t slick at all. “Well, we made it frew,” sighs Jagger after a shaky version of Under My Thumb, a song he suggests the band play rarely these days, for obvious reasons. It displays what you might tactfully call an attitude to male-female relations that hails from a different era – but which the public have apparently voted they return to their set, in an online poll. Jagger himself sounds in pretty good shape for a man of 74, the only evidence of time’s passage on his voice is when he drops out of the falsetto in Fool to Cry. But said shakiness is what’s really gripping about the Stones live. Performing without the safety net of backing tracks – as much a part of the mega-tour these days as sponsorship deals – the band still occasionally feel shambolic, as if they’re just clinging on to the song by their fingernails: a ragged version of Street Fighting Man, a leaden plod through Paint It Black that carries none of the original version’s amphetamine paranoia. And then there are moments when everything suddenly gels and they achieve liftoff. Tonight, it happens first during Ride ’Em on Down, one of the old blues numbers they resurrected for 2016’s Blue and Lonesome – even though an audience here for the hits react to its announcement as if Jagger’s just informed them where the nearest lavatory is – and then again during Sympathy for the Devil, which kicks off a ferocious home run of songs. Miss You sounds suitably humid and intense Midnight Rambler rages along, its nastiness fully intact. You’re struck by the sense that they probably sounded not unlike this back in Dalston Barfs, flaws and all.In a world of stadium rock shows where every note seems perfectly choreographed and nothing is left to chance, it’s authentically thrilling and raw. The Rolling Stones have still, to borrow their old phrase, got live if you want it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f9f1d30a22daa06f34d926bb2214afaeb238692a/0_0_5171_3456/master/5171.jpg?w=300\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=33a61e5272ed3c41eb6bd1db71b4a3e4","title":"all future labour peers must back abolition of lords says corbyn","story":"Corbyn is first recent Labour leader to make voting for abolition of upper chamber a condition for appointment of new peersJeremy Corbyn has said any new peers appointed by his party must support Labour’s position of abolishing the House of Lords if ever offered a parliamentary vote on its future.The Labour leader, a long-time advocate of replacing the upper house with an elected chamber, has already made the pledge a condition for the appointment of three new peers announced on Friday.The government can create new peers whenever it likes. But there are a few conventions, agreed between all the parties, and all nominations for a peerage have to be approved. Tax dodging and criminal convictions usually rule out appointment. Outgoing prime ministers often reward old chums with a peerage. Occasionally an MP is propelled into the Lords to create a spare seat in the Commons. By recent custom, peers are created without shifting the balance of power from no overall control.No, and famously the Lords is the second biggest legislative chamber after China’s national people’s congress. It has 750 members, of whom 150 or so inherited their titles. When one dies there is an election among other hereditaries in the same party. When the Lib Dem peer Lord Avebury died, an electorate of 3 voted for his successor. Efforts at shrinking it have led to a retirement scheme but not much else.Most democratic countries have an elected second chamber, if they have a second chamber at all. Some have a mix of appointed and elected. Efforts to reform the house of lords have foundered on disagreement on questions of scale - how big, what proportion should be elected and on what basis - first past the post, single transferable vote, alternative vote … a fresh start would make almost anything possible.\u0026nbsp One idea gaining traction is that it should represent the United Kingdom, bringing together England, Scotland, northern Ireland and Wales in a kind of federal body. But the most contentious question is always whether an elected second chamber would have more powers, which would weaken the House of CommonsThe trio of new peers, former Labour party general secretary Iain McNicol, campaigner Martha Osamor and socialist writer Pauline Bryan, have all signed up to the principle of replacing the Lords with a new, more democratic model. Senior Labour figures suggested the move was “well past overdue” and that transforming the House of Lords must take place to address the democratic deficit. Corbyn’s official spokesman said: “It’s absurd that we still have this undemocratic anachronism in the 21st century and when Labour is elected we will carry through that pledge.“The commitment is clear and anyone who is appointed to the House of Lords under the existing rules from the Labour party is required to support that policy.”Party insiders suggested that Corbyn had been reluctant to appoint any new peers but was concerned that Labour could be at a disadvantage as Theresa May unveiled nine of her own on the same day. “While it exists, it is important that we have the strongest Labour voice there to make sure that the government is held to account and to make sure that Labour priorities are pushed as strongly as they can be,” the spokesman said. One of those new peers, Bryan, wrote on a blog for the RedRobin website: “I was asked to accept a nomination on the basis that a) I would take it on as a job and work with the Labour team b) that when the opportunity arose I would vote for its abolition. It was also important that I was from outside the London bubble.” Corbyn has only nominated four people for Labour peerages since he became leader in 2016. Frontbencher Shami Chakrabarti was the only Labour peer to be named as part of David Cameron’s resignation honours. He is the first recent Labour leader to make voting for abolition of the Lords a condition of a peer’s appointment.His spokesman’s comments appear to go further than Labour’s manifesto, which said that while the party’s “fundamental” belief was that the second chamber should be elected, in the meantime it would seek to end the hereditary principle and reduce the size of the existing chamber.Theresa May has also recently appointed nine new peers to the House of Lords, including former MPs and ministers, despite previously saying she was committed to “restraint” in handing them out. At prime minister’s questions, the SNP’s Pete Wishart said that the latest increase in the numbers of peers, bringing the total to more than 800, was “cynical” and a “complete fix” after the Tories lost 15 key Brexit votes in the House of Lords. Labour also suffered a major rebellion when more than 80 of the party’s peers supported a plan, against the leadership’s will, to keep Britain in the single market. However, May’s spokesman defended the announcement, which came on the eve of the royal wedding. “We have been clear that there should be restraint on new appointments in the Lords, combined with an increased cross-party take up of retirements,” he said.“The prime minister has made clear that she will operate on the basis that there will no longer be an automatic entitlement of a peerage for any holder of high office in public life. The total size of the Lords has fallen since she took office.“The nominations reflect our determination that the House of Lords should contain people from various walks of life but also people who have expertise that can add to the overall contribution the house makes. I think that’s reflected in the list of nominations that you saw last week.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6513e88afe04f558c40693d7e6fce786cad9413f/0_165_4938_2963/master/4938.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9c07eb699db24e0e5ef4a836743f779e","title":"the friend effect why the secret of health and happiness is surprisingly simple","story":"For some, eating alone can be a joyous thing: forking mouthfuls of pasta straight from the pan, peanut butter licked off a spoon, the unbridled pleasure of walking home from the chippie alone on a cold night. But regularly eating meals in isolation is a different story. This one factor is more strongly associated with unhappiness than any other apart from (unsurprisingly) having a mental illness. This is according to a new study by Oxford Economics that found, in a survey of 8,250 British adults, that people who always eat alone score 7.9 points lower, in terms of happiness, than the national average.This research is far from the first to suggest a link between eating with others and happiness. Researchers at the University of Oxford last year found that the more that people eat with others, the more likely they are to feel happy and satisfied with their lives. The study also found that people who eat socially are more likely to feel better about themselves and have wider social and emotional support networks.Robin Dunbar, a professor of psychology, worked on the Oxford University study. He says that “we simply don’t know” why people who eat together are happier. But it is clear that this is a regular social ritual, a moment of union and communion in our often chaotic lives. It can be a place of conversation, storytelling and closeness.“At a psychological level, having friends just makes you happier,” says Dunbar. “The kinds of things that you do around the table with other people are very good at triggering the endorphin system, which is part of the brain’s pain-management system. Endorphins are opioids, they are chemically related to morphine – they are produced by the brain and give you an opiate high. That’s what you get when you do all this social stuff, including patting, cuddling and stroking. It is central to the way primates in general bond in their social groups and relationships.”Our face-to-face relationships are, quite literally, a matter of life or death. “One of the biggest predictors of physical and mental health problems is loneliness,” says Dr Nick Lake, joint director for psychology and psychological therapy at Sussex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust. “That makes sense to people when they think of mental health. But the evidence is also clear that if you are someone who is lonely and isolated, your chance of suffering a major long-term condition such as coronary heart disease or cancer is also significantly increased, to the extent that it is almost as big a risk factor as smoking.”One of the most striking pieces of evidence for this, says Dunbar, is a meta-analysis of 148 epidemiological studies that looked for the best predictors that patients would survive for 12 months after a heart attack. “The best two predictors, by a long way, are the number and quality of friends you have and giving up smoking,” he says. “You can eat as much as you like, you can slob about, you can drink as much alcohol as you like – the effect is very modest compared with these other two factors.”Human beings are biologically engineered for human interaction – and particularly face-to-face interaction. One study from the University of Michigan found that replacing face-to-face contact with friends and family with messages on social media, emails or text messages could double our risk of depression. The study also found that those who made social contact with family and friends at least three times a week had the lowest level of depressive symptoms.“The ability to stimulate positive emotions, which is linked to happiness, begins in interactions with others who are having positive emotions about you. So, when we see our friends and they say, ‘Good to see you’ – it’s important.”But there are many factors that might prevent us from seeing friends and family: mental ill health, immobility, a lack of money. Alison Harris is a consultant clinical psychologist and professional lead for psychological services in Salford. “Austerity has a huge influence on the loss of happiness and wellbeing,” she says. “Homelessness and unemployment in particular takes us out of contact with others. In addition to the obvious harms of homelessness, it does massively increase social isolation and anxiety. To take that even further, many people are in exile from their communities. In mental health services, we see an enormous amount of grief, depression and anxiety in people who are asylum seekers and refugees and much of that is not just due to trauma or torture or detention or fleeing from their country, but from the severe rupture of being cut off from their families and communities of origin.”When we are around others, it has an effect on our body. Some forms of friendship – going to parties, getting married, having positive interactions with others – stimulate our sympathetic nervous system. Gilbert says that the parasympathetic nervous system (otherwise known as the “rest and digest” system) “is stimulated through the verbal and voice tone of relations with each other. As far as we know, it’s not that stimulated through texts. Generally speaking, you’re designed to respond to voice tone and expression, and stroking. We are physiologically designed for face-to-face interaction.”Of course, for those struggling with depression, the idea of physical contact can be impossible to fathom. At those moments, the capacity to lift up a mobile phone and type out a text is an enormous mark of progress. It may not be the ideal form of interaction, but it’s a vast improvement on staring at a wall.He says that what has happened in the past decade, with the rise of social media, “is that it has become a very plastic society. We are all living like theatrical actors, presenting ourselves as our best. That can’t be real, and so we have many people who feel like failures or useless. They say: ‘I’m not as attractive as that, I’m overweight, I’m not kind or compassionate to others.’”As Gilbert says, the best relationships are the ones where people love us for our perceived dark sides and flaws. “People forget that love is about loving you for the difficult things, not the easy things,” he says. It is those who know us intimately who can provide that, and they do it through their physical presence, through touch, and through eating, drinking and sharing with us. Spending time together is social nourishment. So, instead of texting a friend or messaging them on social media, why not knock on their door, look them in the eye and make yourselves both feel better?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a216bce472aa752a348801c209b3a01f031c41ec/10_159_3164_1898/master/3164.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0d8de410681bd14ebb0e9281886ebfbf","title":"dom bess makes cricket test debut england pakistan lords","story":"Somerset spinner Dom Bess will make his England debut in the first Test against Pakistan on Thursday. The England and Wales Cricket Board announced on their official Twitter account that Bess, who replaced injured county team-mate Jack Leach in a 12-man squad, will play at Lord’s.The 20-year-old has been given the nod after England opted to play a spinner, meaning pacemen Chris Woakes or Mark Wood are likely to miss out.Captain Joe Root said of Bess: “He seems really clear about what he wants to do in the game and how to approach this week, and that’s all you can ask for from someone making their debut.“I remember mine, you just want tomorrow to come around, to get your cap and get on with it. He’s approached the week really well and hopefully he can have a good start to what’s a good, long career.”A revamped England line-up will also feature Jos Buttler at seven as a specialist batsman, with Jonny Bairstow retaining the wicketkeeping gloves.Root said: “We want a side that covers as much as possible, that gives us the best options we can have in each department. Jos at seven can be an exciting and integral part of our batting unit, to take the game to the opposition from a position of strength and make it even stronger.“The way he approaches his white-ball cricket, I think a lot of that can cross over. He’s got a good brain, a lot of experience in white-ball cricket and this is an opportunity to do that in Test cricket.”Bairstow is adamant he can handle the pressure of moving up to No 5 in the batting order as Buttler slots in lower down.“You wouldn’t be playing at the highest level if you weren’t able to cope with the pressure,” he told Sky Sports News. “It comes with expectation as well.”England will be looking to bounce back from a disappointing winter in Australia and New Zealand and Bairstow said: “It was a struggle this winter but we’ve had chance to speak about it and work out ways to move forward. Our record at home is very good and we need people to be coming here and going, ‘OK, we’ve got a serious challenge on to win in England’.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea5c9edd10142de8da8cdff3b3e18bc2fa290140/136_520_4449_2669/master/4449.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8e62089d8d78c158d10dae4b1a22f3e4","title":"own limited edition print sports photographer eamonn mccabe","story":"The award-winning sports photographer Eamonn McCabe, a former  head of photography, looks back at his favourite sporting images from the 1970s and 80s.

Viviani, barring a major accident, has the maglia ciclamino in his grasp. Back to the mountains they go tomorrow, a long ride from Abbiategrasso to Prato Nevoso, which ends with a category one climb almost a mile high after what looks a flat stage. No rest in the Giro, so see you tomorrow. And here’s the General Classification, unchanged from this morning. 1 Simon Yates (66hrs 39:14) 2 Tom Dumoulin (+0:56) 3 Domenico Pozzovivo (+3:11) 4 Chris Froome (+3:50) 5 Thibaut Pinot (+4:19)So, here’s the stage results1. Elia Viviani, Quickstep 2. Sam Bennett, Bora-Hansgrobe3. Niccolo Bonifazio, Bahrain–Merida4. Danny van Poppel, LottoNL–Jumbo5. Jens Debusschere, Omega Pharma-LottoChaos reigned but Quickstep got him home. Sam Bennett got second, having had to come back from a distance out, and with bodies his way. Viviani takes his fourth stage, and surely the purple points jersey is his. Bennett way back. Viviani leads it out....Viviani has two team-mates for company. Bennett trying to get on his wheel. Quickstep, Viviani’s team are pushing to the front. Sam Bennett is finding himself with some serious company. And here come the puddles....Swinging round some dangerous looking roundabouts, they are hurtling into the town centre. Simon Yates covered up by his team in the main group. They pass the 3km free zone, so his place at the lead of GC is assured. That may come into force if that rain causes problems. Lammertink surely won’t last long but it’s a valiant effort, this one. Under 5km to go now....Brambilla sits up, Stybar takes up the pace, but the peloton draws near. And they have a flood at the finish line to deal with, by the looks of things. The peloton catches up but Dutchman Maurits Lammertink has catapulted himself to the front. There’s a breakaway from Gianluca Brambilla with Robert Gesink giving chase. Zdeněk Štybar has joined in, but the gap to the main field is now closing. TV pictures show heavy rain at the finish, but the riders are in the dry. Into the final 10km we go, and an expectant crowd is being washed by summer rain that is probably cooling them, but holds plenty of fears on such a complicated final run-in. The speed of the peloton has produced gaps, with contenders being spat out. This is a breakneck pace now. Sanchez and De Marchi have given up the ghost at the front. And the breakaway is done. This is a winding old road into Iseo, with some punishing hairpin bends, and with that sheen of rain adding grease, these are treacherous moments. Lotto NL, Bora, Quickstep and Michelton-Scott are the teams driving the pack. Rain now coming down, which adds peril to a sprint on the best of days. De Marchi and Sanchez trying to stay away, but the gap is down to 25 seconds. Under 20km to go now....Luis Leon Sanchez has made multiple attempts to get clear, but now must give up the ghost. So, the field has already had one look at the finish line, which may help the sprint strategy of those chasing the stage win. Meanwhile, De Marchi is sat up in the breakaway group. Their fun looks to be over for the day. Soon it will be time to freewheel home. Poels has given up the ghost and slows down so his Sky team-mates can catch him up. One lap of Iseo to go now, as the tifosi gets more than look at the riders. There are 23km left. Yes, that leading group is now shedding seconds at a rate. Poels’ hopes of going up the GC look to have vanished. The crowds are building up on the road to Lake Iseo, and the gap is dropping fast. It’s 48 seconds at the moment. It looks like a sprint finish is in order. Viviani v Bennett: It’s on. And here they are: Rob Stringer emails in: “John, I’m on honeymoon in Italy and my delighted wife can’t believe her luck that I’ve brought her to the Giro at Lake Iseo!! Any help from your readers how I can save my marriage so early would be appreciated!”Many congratulations Mr and Mrs Stringer (should she have taken Rob’s name). Rob has sent a picture of the happy couple at the finish line. That reminds me: who was the football manager who took his new wife to a reserves game? There is nothing calm about race day in this year’s Giro. It’s been helter skelter stuff from the first day. No time to sit up in the saddle. There is a second chasing group forming ahead of the peloton, and at the back, the likes of Aru, Bennett and Van Poppel looked to be dropping but have had to chase back. Petrol used up for Bennett? Viviani has taken two points in an intermediate sprint in the meantime, as he increases his stranglehold on the purple jersey.That leading Poels group is still 1’ 24” clear. There seems to be a discussion taking place between the breakers. Poels is rather too high on GC for those thinking of their team, though at ten minutes back he is not too much of a threat for the likes of Simon Yates. With the final circuit approaching, it’s time to think strategically.Dumloulin also had to drop back to the team cars, but he’s calmly enough making his way back the main field. Dare we say that this is something of a lull? The leaders are 1’ 28” clear. That’s a decent gap but there is still 45km to go. My mistake below - Viviani is with Quickstep, Sam Bennett is with Bora. Talking of Viviani, he’s had a mechanical, and needed to drop back to get his bike fixed. A temporary panic, and Viviani returns to the field. Added to the confusion was that this all happened at a feed station. Bora’s domestiques looking for others to do the work, and Mitchtelton-Scott are taking up the chase. Wout Poels is pushing on the breakaway which is up to 34 seconds. The gap at the front is around 20 seconds, and the rain has gone, to be replaced by what looks like a significant temperature. Muggy, as the English say, though not in the Danny Dyer meaning of the word. David Alderton emails: “This has been a most exciting race so far, and Yates has been superb. He has ridden with both style and panache, qualities needed in a GT rider above any other. Although I was sceptical of his ability to maintain the effort, he is making a great fist of it, especially with yesterday’s result. The competition seems to be fading away, and I now think he can really do this.”I have to agree, and I think most of the field do. Perhaps most of all Sunweb and Sky. Let’s see in those mountains, though. Some wild fantasising from a, er, “Malicious A” on the Twitter: “It is raining and being over 4 minutes adrift means that Pinot has a great opportunity to get a stomp on so we can experience the thrilling heroics of him riding himself back into contention before winning overall.”That would be up there with Nibali in 2016. This latest climb is uncategorised, but looks tough enough to me. The riders are snaking up through heavy crowds. Bora, the team of Viviani, are leading the main group, with that final sprint in mind. That breakaway looks to comes to naught, and the peloton is back together. Just over 60km to go now...but away they go again. Poels, Sanchez, Hermans and De Marchi, the latter the attack specialist of this Giro. Rodolfo Torres has also gone with them. Here’s an example of just how fast they go in the Grand Tours, some 2009 amateur footage from the Lago de Iseo, where they finish up today. That blur on the shore is the cyclists. Rain absolutely hacking down now, and that’s potentially bad news. They are racing down to the flat section, at least, but they are racing at almost 60km an hour. Tom Dumoulin is sat amidships of the peloton, with no team-mates around him, but looks comfortable enough. Yates’ Mitchelton-Scott team are marking down the breakaway on this fast descent. Some unwelcome rain is also falling. That’s never welcome on the way down. The descent from the big climb of the day has begun. The gap is 24 seconds to Yates’ main group. Sanchez is amid an eight-man group, which includes Wout Poels and Kenny Elissonde of Team Sky. Has Froome decided he wants team-mates to just go out there any enjoy it, or is there another strategy at hand? There are gaps appearing in the field. With a long descent to follow, the expectation is that all will come back together, but plenty of fuel has been used up by all those breaks and now this climb. Luis Leon Sanchez is having another dig at getting into a break. The rest of the field won’t thank him for that. After all that chaos, now for a big climb. This is a category 3, up to Lodrino. The field is back together now, so this could be the launchpad for further attacks. Thanks to Tim Young for his prompt answer to Richard’s question below: “Think that Juan José Cobo beat Froome into second place with win bonuses in the 2011 Vuelta.”Yes, imagine if Froome hadn’t had to play super-domestique for Brad Wiggins. Cobo won by 13 seconds, though was playing a similar role to support Denis Menchov himself.Looks like Viviani didn’t add to his points lead over Bennett in the purple jersey chase. Viviani has 237 points to Bennett’s 197.Viviani was the sprint winner from the main group, but if he got any points from that, it was only a single one. An intermediate sprint awaits, but the current stage leaders, Marco Frapporti and Darwin Atapuma, will be taking the main points from Viviani and Bennett. Question to the floor from Richard Powell: “Is it still feasible that Yates wins with a slower overall time due to his bonuses? And has this ever happened on a Grand Tour before?”Currently trying to recall if the 1989 Tour, that infamous eight seconds between LeMond and Laurent Fignon, included time bonuses. Any help appreciated, and other examples welcome. At the front of the field, France’s Quentin Jauregui, Italy’s Mattia Cattaneo and Krist Neilands of Latvia are our three-man leadership group. The jiggery pokery behind the group behind them and those chasing that down might give them leeway to get away for a while. Who else is in the second chasing group? Miguel Angel Lopez is pedalling like thunder alongside Froome. That’s bad news for the white jersey holder. Meanwhile, Froome seems to be having one good day followed by another bad day at the moment. Should he actually be allowed to ride this year’s Tour de France, that’s not a good sign. Andy McGrath, from the excellent Rouleur mag, emails in, to tell this tale. You’ll like this, John. A bloke in New England called Simon Yates has been getting hundreds of Tweets of encouragement intended for the Giro leader due to his Twitter username. An extension of the Chris HoyChris Foy confusion years ago.Some official accounts have made this mistake. And here’s the other Simon Yates. Up the front, the peloton is catching up the breakaway. Just 12 seconds in it now. But it’s the gap between the chasers that’s intriguing. Yates and Dumoulin, in the leading group of chasers, have distanced a group containing Chris Froome and there’s 15 seconds in it. And this was supposed to be the quiet day. Sam Bennett, in becoming the first ever Irishman to win a Giro stage in 31 years, is almost certainly the best sprinter since the legendary Sean Kelly, these days best known for being a voice on Eurosport. Kelly, who sounds like the most impassive man in show business, was pumping the air in delight at his compatriot’s success. And who won 31 years ago? Stephen Roche. Kelly was the superior one-day racer, perhaps the greatest of his era, but Roche had that amazing 1987. Anyway, here’s Kelly on his old pal. Back in the peloton, there is some early intrigue. Elia Viviani, holding the leading sprinters’ purple jersey, seemed to have fallen off the back but is now at the vanguard. Bora–Hansgrohe’s men were putting in work and looked to be trying to distance the Quickstep man to help out Sam Bennett, who has designs on that purple jersey. The breakaway group is now on the descent. Ok, as expected, there has been a breakaway. The hilly section of today’s course is at the start and there’s a gap of 40 seconds to a sizeable group which includes no GC contenders. The biggest name in there is Spanish veteran Luis León Sánchez, who has been trying to get others to do work.Afternoon, all. This Giro is Simon Yates’ to lose now. And it would be a hell of a surprise if he lost it today, a flattish ride through beauty spots, from the banks of Lake Garda to Lake Iseo in Lombardy. After Tuesday’s time trial, the gaps is 56 seconds, by no means unbridgeable, but there are mountain stages to come this week in which it would be expected that Yates takes more time out of second-placed defending champ Tom Dumloulin, with Domenico Pozzovivo 3’ 11” back on the Dutchman. Chris Froome lurks on 3’ 50” behind, but last night appeared to be dismissive of his chances of repeating the amazing comeback that Vincenzo Nibali pulled off in 2016 when coming back from over four minutes down to steal the race in its final days. Froome’s lack of form suggests he is not in the right shape for such a miracle, and not when Yates has looked almost invulnerable on the climbs. The leader was helped somewhat by a TT yesterday that was not as harsh as expected, with Dumoulin’s Sunweb team a little miffed at its relative ease.So, this one looks a day for the sprinters, with Sam Bennett perhaps seeking a third stage win. The Irishman was dead last up the Zoncolan on Saturday, and rather took the Michael in pulling a series of wheelies up the final climb. His main rival is Elia Viviani, the Italian seeking his fourth stage win. Before that crescendo, expect some cat and mouse stuff between Sunweb, Team Sky and Yates’ Mitchelton-Scott team, who are now expected to ride defensively. And, of course, with possible stage wins now at a premium, expect the breakaway specialists to have an early dig or two.

The travel guide publisher has attempted to tackle the issue of overtourism in its annual holiday hotlist, by highlighting lesser-visited destinations across the continent.Dundee is Scotland’s fourth largest city and is sixth on Lonely Planet’s Best in Europe 2018 list. It earned the spot for its “head-turning” urban redevelopment, including the transformation of its historic waterfront and the opening of a new branch of the V\u0026ampA this September .Lonely Planet describes it as an “exciting moment” for a city that has often been overlooked by visitors to Scotland, and praised its “nationally important museums and attractions” and “dynamic, creative spirit”.The number one spot went to Emilia-Romagna in Italy. The region was picked out as an alternative to Tuscany, Campania and Veneto, and for its emergence as one of the best foodie spots in the country. Emilia-Romagna is the home of ragù, Parma ham, balsamic vinegar and Parmesan cheese. Recently Bologna, the regional capital, saw the opening of the world’s largest culinary theme park, Fico Eataly, where visitors can sample all manner of local cuisine. Other picks on the list included the wild beaches, mountains and “enchanted” villages of Cantabria, Spain (a far cry from the overcrowded attractions of Barcelona and the Costa del Sol) and Kosovo, which boasts “dramatic hiking trails, Ottoman-era history and a growing cultural scene”. “There is growing concern over the increase in tourism to popular European destinations, particularly over the busy summer months, so with this list we wanted to show that there are a wealth of incredible alternatives to discover across Europe,” said Lonely Planet editorial director, Tom Hall.

Like Ariana Grande.” It is poignant because, even now, these teenagers are able to recapture that sense of anticipation. It is devastating because you know what is coming next.In all, 14,000 people attended Grande’s show at the Manchester Arena on 22 May last year. Manchester: The Night of the Bomb (BBC Two) recounts the events leading up to, and after, the explosion in the foyer that killed 23 people and wounded more than 500. It is a documentary you can watch only with your heart in your throat.Grande performed her last number and walked off stage shortly before 10.30pm, perplexing a lot of her young fans. “It was the Dangerous Woman tour and she hadn’t sung Dangerous Woman,” says Acacia Seward, 12. By the time Grande came out and did the song as an encore, a good proportion of the audience were already making their way through the foyer.The device went off at 10.31pm, while the bomber stood among parents waiting to collect their children. The moment of the explosion is recalled by survivors in a litany of horrifying details. People were lifted off their feet. The doors blew open, then shut themselves. The foyer was filled with a bright white light – “Like snow coming towards you” – and then darkness as it was suffused with smoke. Nuts and bolts from the device ricocheted, making a sound like machine-gun fire. For some victims, the immediate aftermath was eerily silent: their eardrums had been perforated. There was blood everywhere and people struggled to grasp the\u0026nbspextent of their injuries. “I saw my legs were on fire and then I was unconscious,” says Eve Senior, 15.A countdown clock (reminiscent of the one Grande employed as her big entrance approached) winds back to the moment of the explosion for another perspective. Phone footage recorded the panic inside the auditorium, where there was a stampede of people trying to get out\u0026nbsp– running towards the carnage by the exits. In all the\u0026nbspconfusion, rumours about gunmen spread.Winding back again, the documentary adopts the point of view of the emergency services. Four transport police were on duty at Victoria railway station, connected to the arena by a footbridge. They ran toward the scene, in the opposite direction of the fleeing crowds. “If you can imagine hell,” says PC Steve Corke, “times it by a million”.Because of the possibility of secondary devices – there were abandoned bags everywhere – arriving ambulance crews were kept back, even as members of the public ran toward the danger to help. With no proper medical equipment on the scene, the flow of blood was stemmed with Grande T-shirts. Victims had to be ferried to the train station to get medical attention. The safety protocols in place were much criticised after the fact, but the documentary obliges you to experience the confusion, the agonising and frustration over decisions taken, for better or worse, on\u0026nbspthe night.The other main strand of the film concerns the 23rd fatality: 22-year-old Salman Abedi, sliced in two by his own bomb. Born and bred in Manchester, Abedi had returned to the city four days before on a flight from Libya. His parents, who fled Libya during the Gaddafi regime, had recently gone back there to live. A difficult and sometimes violent student, Abedi was fighting on the front line in Libya’s civil war by the age of 17. In the months before the attack, he was living alone in the family home in Manchester. His exact motivations remain opaque, but police say he would have been incapable of making the bomb he used without close guidance. Abedi does not qualify as a victim alongside those he killed, injured and traumatised that night, but he is bound up in the tragedy all the same.Manchester: The Night of the Bomb provides a gruelling evocation of that tragedy. Some of it – such as the recorded announcement still blaring out the words “Attention: due to an incident, it is necessary to evacuate the area” long after the building had been emptied of anyone who could walk – is positively haunting. But it is also, in the end, inspiring, thanks to the determination of those present to tell their stories."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/97db1d55006fee1460f5ca893278ecf4e8339198/0_135_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=acb0d060dd9e2612d6af91d80f360579","title":"westworld annoys me but is it ok to give up on it","story":"It is not easy to quit a series you once loved, but in the age of peak TV, there is no time for hate-watching shows that no longer rock your boatWhen I’m on my deathbed, surrounded by people I love, I know the regrets that will flash through my mind. I’ll regret trying to grow my hair out as a teenager. I’ll regret spending so much time on dishwasher comparison websites. But most of all – and I guarantee that this will happen – I will regret sticking with Westworld.And I suspect this is the case around the world. I have yet to meet a person – a real flesh-and-blood person, who does not work in television or get paid to write Westworld recaps – who can summon even a hint of excitement about it. Westworld’s entire audience, I am certain, is made up of people who sit there idly checking their phones during episodes because they’re still on the fence about formally giving up.I think I can feel the start of something similar happening with The Handmaid’s Tale. What started off as something timely and necessary has given way to out-and-out torture porn. The first episode of the second series – which variously included muzzling, nooses, freezing, chaining, burning and graphic, closeup self-mutilation – was essentially one liquidised pig’s carcass away from becoming Saw III: The Series. The Handmaid’s Tale is now so relentlessly grim, so spectacularly, queasily bleak, that it overwhelms any point it might be trying to make. I would be much happier if I gave up on it now and never looked back. But guess what? I am still here, because it is a big important show, and that apparently overrides whether or not I like it.This is not to say that I am entirely hamstrung by apathy. There have been a couple of moments this year where I have victoriously given up on a programme. The first was Amazon’s The Crossing, billed as The New Lost, but which ended up being a honking great mess of too many ingredients hurled at the screen with a shrug. Yes, it might have taken five episodes for me to get there, but turning to my wife at the conclusion of another hour of nothingy bullshit and asking “Do you actually want to keep watching this?” felt like a moment of genuine triumph. Same goes for BBC One’s’s Hard Sun, which I bailed from two episodes in because I’m only human.There was a time when I would have persevered more aggressively with these programmes. I might have even made a sport of it, turning Westworld into a hate-watch endurance test, gleefully yelling at the TV whenever Jeffrey Wright murmurs another faux-intellectual phrase with all the pretend idiot profundity his stupid robot body can muster. But what is the point, when there are dozens of better shows I could be watching instead? Or a new show that I would otherwise never get around to watching? To hate-watch Westworld in 2018 would be even more self-indulgent than Westworld itself, if you can imagine such a thing. So here I am, trapped in purgatory. This is what I want to know: at what point do you summon the courage to give up on a show? Is there a tipping point, a moment of no return, where you can happily cash in your chips and move on from a series you no longer enjoy? If there is, for God’s sake tell me, because I would love nothing more than to stop watching Westworld and The Handmaid’s Tale. I won’t stop watching them, obviously, but I would love to."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/27d736d301e66e1c78fbbcf8c073488b9e6e5b08/191_0_3928_2358/master/3928.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b725575e4136f2b4edfc0fa3cc823090","title":"emmanuel macron plans summit to push for libyan elections","story":"French president aims to bring factions together to prevent disruption to proposed ballotEmmanuel Macron is planning to stage an international summit on Libya next week to push for presidential elections in the country to be held this year, and to secure commitments from key Libyan political players that they will not to seek to disrupt the process.Reports in Libya’s state media say Macron’s emissary has sent invitations to Gen Khalifa Haftar, the dominant military figure in the east of the country, Fayez al-Sarraj, the president of the UN-recognised government of national accord based in Tripoli, the president of the house of representatives, Aqila Saleh, and Khalid Al-Meshri, the chairman of the state consultative council. The aim, according to documents leaked in Egypt, is to bring the warring factions together to agree to reopen registration for the elections for a further 30 days, back a referendum on a new constitution before or after the presidential elections, unify the Libyan central bank, and to ensure that the parties recognise they will be subject to international sanctions if they seek to disrupt a UN-verified electoral process.The groups would also agree to hold a politically inclusive national conference either inside or outside Libya in a bid to foster reconciliation after what has been constant chaos since the overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011.Formal invitations to Macron’s summit have not been sent out or confirmed by Paris, but foreign embassies have been made aware of the plan for a French mediation meeting set for 29 May. A call for elections this year does not have universal support, with the former Libyan leader Mahmoud Jibril warning a premature move could lead to the country’s partition. Jibril, who led the National Transitional Council during the uprising that toppled Gaddafi after more than four decades in power, said a UN-endorsed target of holding national polls by the end of the year was unrealistic. He told Reuters: “The country is still not ready. More unity is needed, more consensus is needed. To go for elections when the country is so ided – we are exposing the country to real partition.”At the UN this week, Russia also urged caution, saying it was concerned elections without a constitution would mean there was no legal basis for the work of national authorities after the elections. “If the parties do not agree in advance on their modalities, then the entire system of state administration in Libya may be incapacitated,” it warned.Macron brought together key political leaders last year in a move that was privately criticised by the Italians and British as an ad hoc initiative. But France is understood to be so frustrated by the slow political progress that Macron would like to force an agreement on the terms for holding parliamentary and presidential elections this year. The elections would be a test of whether the authoritarian Haftar has appeal that extends beyond Libya’s east. His often brutal anti-Islamist forces, backed by the UAE, are currently besieging the coastal town of Derna.A group of young, technocratic Libyan businessmen are drawing up an economic recovery plan to swing into action if a political breakthrough is reached.The French move comes as Italy, normally a dominant player in Libyan diplomacy, faces the distraction of forming a coalition government.At a UN security council session this week the UN’s Libya special envoy, Ghassan Salamé, admitted he had been unable to forge agreement on a revised Libyan political accord. But he said elections should still go ahead. Due to Russian objections, the UN was unable to press ahead with plans to impose UN sanctions on six Libyans believed to be involved in trafficking migrants. The US ambassador, Nikki Haley, said evidence against the six people, who were not identified, was clear and “failing to move forward with the designations would be a travesty in the face of so much global outrage over these abuses”. Salamé said Libya had to address the flow of trafficked people and goods through its borders as well as the issues of subsidies and “the severe mismatch between the official and black-market exchange rate”.“These facets provide opportunities for those few who sit at the heart of Libya’s political stalemate, plundering the nation’s coffers, resisting any actions which might challenge their predatory economy,” Salamé said. “It is this perverse economic model which must be shattered if the political process is to meaningfully progress.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3505657.1527086067!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"loneliness a public health epidemic ni gp group says","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Royal College of General Practitioners Northern Ireland said that between one and five people are attending GP practices each day mainly because they are lonely. File image: iStock.Loneliness has become “a public health epidemic” in Northern Ireland, a doctors’ group has said. The Royal College of General Practitioners Northern Ireland said that between one and five people are attending practices each day mainly because they are lonely. The doctors organisation, which has more than 1,300 members in the North, says 10-minute appointments are “unfit for purpose as GPs need more time to care” and that workforce gaps and workload pressures must be addressed to allow GPs to spend longer with their patients. The college on Wednesday announced the details of a community action plan to tackle the issue of loneliness, which is says increases a persons risk of an early death by 50 per cent when compared to those with good social connections. They says loneliness is as bad for health outcomes as obesity. Dr Grainne Doran, chair of the college, says loneliness has become “a public health epidemic” and factors like demographic changes and the loss of the nuclear family have caused an increase in loneliness across the age spectrum. “All too often, GPs are the only human contact that chronically lonely patients have,” she said. “These moments of meaningful connection matter. “As family doctors, we believe that treating patients means listening to them and understanding their concerns – but GPs need time to care.” Dr Doran said tackling loneliness was about more than medical care. “That’s why we want to see a dedicated professional for every GP surgery — a community navigator,” she said. “We also want councils to help people make the right connections by establishing a regularly updated database of community and voluntary sector projects and schemes in their area. “This will support patients, community navigators and carers to ensure that people are matched to the best schemes for their needs.” "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3502274.1526843650!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"in muff we pray for the president in culmore the queen","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tArchdeacon Robert Miller at Muff Church of Ireland in Co Donegal. Photograph: Trevor McBride. “When I’m in Muff we pray for the President, and when I’m in Culmore we pray for the Queen.”For Archdeacon Robert Miller, that is the only difference between his parish in Donegal and his three in Derry.The rector of Christ Church, St Peter’s and Culmore in Derry City, and Muff in Co Donegal, Archdeacon Miller laughs at the idea of having an “international ministry” given the cross-Border nature of his work.With Brexit looming, he admits there is uncertainty among some in his parishes around what may come, but he says that for the church “the Border doesn’t really exist”.“I have joked that I hope I won’t need my passport to go to Muff on a Sunday morning,” he says, “but the reality is that we’ve been here before with Border checkpoints and crossings and during that time Muff and Culmore related and worked together, so I would be hopeful that whatever happens, we’ll manage.”Culmore is about 3km from Muff. The journey between the two takes less than five minutes and only the changing road signs and a poster erected by the Border Communities Against Brexit campaign group, marking the Border’s location, suggest that you have moved from Northern Ireland to the Republic.There may be complications down the line if a political agreement on Brexit is not reached but Archdeacon Miller says the Church of Ireland existed long before there was any Border.“We predate partition, and the reality then was that the Church of Ireland had to negotiate something that was imposed upon it and which put a Border between some of its dioceses,” says Archdeacon Miller.“But the Church of Ireland is a church of the whole island, and whilst obviously we acknowledge the secular way in which the island is ided, the Church of Ireland operates as a whole-island church.“If you talk to people they’ll say that the reality of the matter is that at partition a line was drawn on a map – and especially during the Troubles things were very, very difficult – but the relationships existed and persisted.”Archdeacon Miller ministers to about 330 families across the four parishes. He says his responsibility is to provide pastoral support for his parishioners throughout the challenges posed by Brexit.“I don’t do down the uncertainty, because certainly for people who are farming, or people whose business causes them to go back and forth across the Border, or even those who work in one or both of the currencies and then have to cross the Border, all of this causes uncertainty for them,” he says.“Each generation will have its own challenge, and in some ways our challenge is Brexit.”The archdeacon says that while it is not the church’s role to have an opinion on Brexit, its responsibility is to react to people’s concerns.“In terms of peacebuilding, you’re always aware that a change in the status quo at the minute could be a difficult thing,” he says. “For people who have lived on the Border for 40-plus years of troubles, that would be a concern if there was an attempt to reimpose it, but it does seem that it will be a soft Border.”Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3503528.1526934314!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"westminster committee urges may to take more active role in north","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritish prime minister Theresa May was urged by the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee at Westminster to take a more active role in Northern Ireland’s affairs until devolved institutions there are restored.  Photograph: EPAThe Northern Ireland Affairs Committee at Westminster has called on Theresa May’s government to take a more active role in the affairs of Northern Ireland until the devolved institutions there are restored.In a report, Devolution and Democracy in Northern Ireland – Dealing with the Deficit, to be published on Tuesday, the committee also urges an early return to talks to restore the Executive and Assembly.“Karen Bradley is right to make restoring power-sharing devolved government in Stormont her first priority. However, while the political impasse continues the list of policy obstructions and project delays grows and becomes more serious,” committee chair Andrew Murrison said.“We believe the Secretary of State is correct to insist that any decisions from Westminster align with the principles of the Good Friday Agreement. Helpfully, some GFA-compliant guidance already exists. For example, the Hart Report makes policy recommendations that were broadly welcomed across the community.“Elsewhere, the Secretary of State will need to develop stronger ways of engagement and consider new measures to secure adequate scrutiny. Our recommendations include a committee system at Stormont as a temporary expedient pending restoration of the Executive.”Some members of the committee, including Labour’s Kate Hoey and the DUP’s Ian Paisley, have criticised the way the Belfast Agreement operates and the report calls for a consultation between London, Dublin and Belfast on how it might be improved. The report suggests that such a consultation should review how the power-sharing system works and if and how it should be changed.“The Good Friday Agreement has had a transformative effect on Northern Ireland. However, its institutions have collapsed and even if restarted tomorrow would likely remain fragile,” Dr Murrison said.“With the involvement and consent of the whole community in Northern Ireland, we have to consider if they can be more robust and how improvements can be made, as envisaged in the agreement itself. We must investigate every avenue to secure long-term stable government.

Photograph: Thierry RogeEPAIt was a long, repetitive exercise that kept the British establishment waiting some of them willing it on, some of them concealing distaste. Bishop Michael Curry’s sermon at the royal wedding was a truer metaphor for Brexit than any journalist has coined these past two years.As the second anniversary of the referendum nears, there is more exasperated checking of watches left to go. A transition period from membership to non-membership will run until the end of 2020. The latest answer to the customs impasse is continuation of the status quo until 2022, when new technologies might fix the problem. By then, the process of exit will rival the second World War in length. If a technical solution does not emerge, Britain’s holding pen could become a permanent home.There is also a new immigration system to decide, as well as the UK’s freedom of manoeuvre on state aid and other regulatory matters. Whatever Britain does in these areas could affect the terms it secures in the trade talks that constitute yet another avenue of negotiation with the EU. In all likelihood, London will be haggling with Brussels over one thing or another indefinitely, much like the Swiss. Ivan Rogers predicted this future when he quit as Britain’s diplomatic emissary to the EU after the referendum.It is not clear that Britain will turn on Brexit as young voters replace old. Demography is not destiny. Even if it were, it is slow to work. All the same, Leavers should worry about the passage of time. The drop in European immigration that is already showing up in data could blunt the public’s main grievance against the EU. Endless negotiations could themselves accustom voters to a kind of rolling semi-membership. If a clean exit is to happen, it has to happen before long.At the risk of riling Brenda of Bristol, the voter whose fatigue at hearing the news of last year’s general election became a viral hit, the best hope for Tory Leavers is another election, and soon. A plan leaked over the weekend envisages a vote of no-confidence in prime minister Theresa May, before an autumn date with the electorate, perhaps under the leadership of Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary and committed Leaver.A new election is not certain to fix the Leavers’ central problem, which is the shortage of parliamentary numbers for their preferred exit. But the potential is there. Two favourable circumstances obtain right now that might not in a few years. One is material. The economy is still growing, with wages rising ahead of inflation. If the business cycle turns before Britain leaves, the animal spirits behind Brexit could weaken. A downturn has the power to frustrate Brexit in a way no human factor can. It is one thing to vote Leave, and another to leave while the economy is fragile.The other tailwind is political. The opposition Labour party still wants to leave the single market. As stable as this seems, Leavers cannot treat it as an immovable fact of politics. They are in parliamentary trouble because the opposition line is already softer than it was at the turn of the year. If it softens much more, a hard exit becomes a fringe prospect.In other words, this apparent rough patch for Leavers is, on second glance, much better than things might be in the near future. The Conservatives are in reasonable shape after the local elections this month. Some voting-intention polls have them ahead. Other surveys show that voters trust them over other parties to negotiate exit.Most Tories dismiss the weekend speculation out of hand. A snap election seems implausible. But the same was true five minutes before May called one last spring, at which point such insurmountable barriers as the Fixed Term Parliaments Act were breezily surmounted. Given the delicate balance of forces in the House of Commons right now, it would take a small shift in their favour to smooth the way to a clean exit.The Eurosceptic dread was never a formal annulment of the decision to leave. No government could do such a thing without inciting half the nation. Their real nightmare is a prolonged exit that ultimately obscures the difference between leaving and staying. This explains their impatience to leave now, and to elect a parliament to that end.On the balance of probabilities, they will fail. May should see out the year, and the process of exit. But that balance is finer than generally believed, and liable to change with events. The parliamentary deadlock is real. The answer is the long grass or to consult the country.

Managing Director of Home Services, said: “These changes will mean that broadband providers will no longer be able to entice customers with unrealistic adverts promising speeds that most of their customers may never get.“We know that fast and reliable broadband is what really matters to broadband customers and have been campaigning for these changes. We will now be watching closely to make sure providers are finally living up to their promises.”Chief Executive of the Advertising Standards Authority, Guy Parker said: “From today, consumers will see a difference in broadband ads that make claims about speed as this new, tougher, standard is enforced.  We’ll be making sure consumers aren’t misled by speed claims in ads, not least because choosing the right broadband deal has become such an important part of running a household or business.”Tiny cross provides clue that reunites Renaissance masterpiece with its other halfTrump says he is victim of “Spygate” after FBI reportedly used Cambridge professor as sourceHow Bangladesh took on a global killer with the world\u0026#39s only diarrhoeal disease hospitalPMQs analysis: It had a retro vibe with NHS stats fired from both sidesAcid attacker who left ex-lover in such pain he took his own life is jailed for life for \u0026#39act of pure evil\u0026#39Georgia makes history with Stacey Abrams, the first black female nominee for governorGerman sweet maker accused of racism over \u0026#39stupid and embarrassing\u0026#39 post linked to Meghan MarkleWild, untidy gardens better for mental health, designer claims at Chelsea Flower ShowTrain timetable shake-up \u0026#39could see house prices in some commuter towns fall by 15pc\u0026#39What next for newlyweds Meghan Markle and Prince Harry?

It\u0027s very clear that people are looking for more women.Ms Abrams, who has a law degree from Yale University and a masters from the University of Texas is considered a rising star within Democratic party\u0027s progressive faction. Hillary Clinton, whom Ms Abrams strongly backed in the presidential election, recorded a robocall for her ahead of Tuesday\u0027s race. A number of other prominent Democrats, including Bernie Sanders and Kirsten Gillibrand, have backed the Georgia nominee.Ms Abrams, who was elected to Georgia\u0027s state House of Representative in 2006, has also written eight romantic novels under the pen name Selena Montgomery.Please review our commenting policyTiny cross provides clue that reunites Renaissance masterpiece with its other halfTrump says he is victim of “Spygate” after FBI reportedly used Cambridge professor as sourceHow Bangladesh took on a global killer with the world\u0026#39s only diarrhoeal disease hospitalPMQs analysis: It had a retro vibe with NHS stats fired from both sidesAcid attacker who left ex-lover in such pain he took his own life is jailed for life for \u0026#39act of pure evil\u0026#39German sweet maker accused of racism over \u0026#39stupid and embarrassing\u0026#39 post linked to Meghan MarkleWild, untidy gardens better for mental health, designer claims at Chelsea Flower ShowTrain timetable shake-up \u0026#39could see house prices in some commuter towns fall by 15pc\u0026#39What next for newlyweds Meghan Markle and Prince Harry?

Don’t you want to be Meghan today?” the post asked. The picture showed  a smiling Schokokuss, or “Chocolate Kiss” complete with tiara and waving to the camera.A caption read “A foam in white” — which rhymes with “A dream in white” in German.The post set off a storm of protest on social media from people accusing the company of a racist allusion to the Duchess’ African American heritage.Public anger was heightened by the fact that chocolate marshmallows used to be popularly known in Germany as Negerkuss — or “Negro kiss”.“Don’t buy from these people!!!!! They are racist,” a user calling herself Joanne posted on Twitter, while JennyImWestern tweeted: “Saw Dickmann\u0027s commercial and want to set something on fire #racist s***!”To make matters worse, the company made a bungled initial attempt at an apology in the persona of a sweet: “Like all my pictures, the picture shows myself and it was my thoughts about the big wedding, my dream in white. I’m very sorry if I have set off other associations with it. A big apology. The world of Super Dickmann\u0027s is colorful and erse and far from racist thoughts.”The apology only served to increase the anger. “Poor ad, poor response.

Muslims are asked to give away 2.5 per cent of their wealth during the 30-day festival as part of zakat.“We are trying to appeal to a wider audience with the new money,” Erkin Guney, the chairman of the board of trustees, told The Hackney Gazette. “It’s big in the Islamic world, and we have set up a platform for wealthier Muslims outside our community to support and donate to our mosque.”Last month, Muhammad Abu-Bakar of Blossom Finance in Indonesia explored the functionality of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to determine whether they fit with Islam’s strict definitions of money.“Several recent fatawah issued by prominent Muslim scholars offered incomplete or contradictory opinions on the topic,” said Matthew Martin, CEO of Blossom Finance.“With all the confusion out there, we wanted to offer clear guidance supported by solid research that benefits both laypeople and practitioners of Islamic finance.”The conclusion of his study was that bitcoin is permissible in principle as it is accepted by a wide variety of global merchants.Scandal and infighting fuels the battle over bitcoinThe bitcoin wallet address used by the mosque to receive the cryptocurrency has so far only received one donation, worth just over £100 at today’s prices. Gurmit Singh, founder of blockchain startup Combo Innovation who helped advise the mosque on setting up the bitcoin wallet, is hopeful for more donations.“If Muslims, who make up a quarter of the world’s population, hold just 1 per cent of bitcoins – or £1.04 billion – then £26 million in Zakat contributions is due,” Mr Singh said.“It is likely the actual figure is much higher. Currently hardly any mosques or Islamic charities accept Zakat in cryptocurrency. They are potentially losing out on millions of pounds.The Independent\u0027s bitcoin group on Facebook is the best place to follow the latest discussions and developments in cryptocurrency.

Couriers for its Uber Eats food delivery service who have completed at least 30 deliveries in eight weeks will also be eligible.Since April 2017, Uber drivers - who are classified by the company as independent contractors - have been able to purchase insurance from the company for £2 per week to cover them for lost earnings in the event of illness or injury.Under the new free scheme,\u0026nbspdrivers are entitled to a £7,500 medical cover lump sum and £50,000 for a permanent injury related to the job.The sickness cover offered amounts to up to £75 per day for a maximum of 15 days and then £30 per day for a further 15 days. Drivers who have a child are eligible for a £1,000 payment.\u0026nbspThis compares to statutory maternity pay of 90 per cent of earnings before tax for six weeks followed by the lower out of £145.18 or 90 per cent of earnings for a further 33 weeks.The Independent Workers’ Union of Great Britain (IWGB) said the protections were not enough.James Farrar who is a co-claimant in an employment rights case against Uber and branch chair of the IWGB\u0026nbspsaid: “It\u0027s good to see Uber is reacting to the pressure piled on by the IWGB\u0027s campaigns and legal action.\u0026nbsp“Sadly, this is once again a case of tinkering around the edges for a quick PR win, rather than dealing with the issue at hand.\u0026nbsp“If Uber really cares about the workers on which the business relies, it should stop fighting us in court and give the drivers the rights they are entitled to under the law.”\u0026nbspUber\u0026nbspis currently fighting a legal battle in the UK over its classification of drivers and couriers as “partners” who are independent of the company, rather than workers, who are entitled to rights such as the National Living Wage and holiday pay.An employment tribunal ruled last year that two drivers -\u0026nbspMr\u0026nbspFarrar\u0026nbspand co-claimant Yaseen Aslam - were workers.

The Office for National Statistics said the biggest factor pulling the rate down was air fares, which were influenced by the timing of Easter.\u0026nbspThe pound was down in morning trading, dipping 0.63 per cent to $1.3345, as traders reduced back bets on a summer rate rise from the central bank.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe bank’s governor, Mark Carney, told the Treasury Select Committee on Tuesday that weaker than expected inflation in March had been one of the influences on the bank deciding not to hike interest rates this month, but many analysts had said that an August increase in borrowing was still possible.Kevin Doran, chief investment officer at AJ Bell, said that the recent weakness in the pound and the rising oil price “are a concern and could quickly reverse the drop in inflation”. “The jump in the oil price has started to hit petrol pumps, pushing up costs for UK consumers and businesses alike. In addition, the weak pound will be driving up input costs for many UK companies which will ultimately filter through to UK consumers in the coming months,” said Mr Doran. “If inflation does increase, UK consumers will once again start to feel the pinch. Wage growth is currently only marginally ahead of inflation at 2.6 per cent, and interest rates on cash savings remain rock bottom – so rising prices will weaken the spending power of both earnings and savings.”Alistair Wilson, head of retail platform strategy at Zurich, offered a more optimistic view and said UK inflation is “finally heading in the right direction for savers”. “Coupled with rising wages and record levels of employment, this will provide a small\u0026nbspyet well deserved boost to the spending power of UK households,” he said. However, Charles Haresnape, chief executive of Gatehouse Bank, said the UK’s savers “still have little reason to feel uplifted”.“Despite its recent falls, inflation remains far above what the average deposit account is paying, which means the vast majority of savers are still seeing their capital eroded in real terms,” he added.You can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?We use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you.

When Labour is elected we will carry through that pledge.”Asked whether he was now going further than the manifesto, he added: “The commitment is clear. And by the way, anyone who is appointed to the House of Lords under existing rules from the Labour party is required to support that.”Mr Corbyn recently appointed former Labour general secretary Iain McNicol, campaigner Martha Osamor and writer Pauline Bryan to the Lords.The House of Lords defeats the government voting to remove the Brexit date from the billBut the strong words from his spokesman also come after more than 80 Labour peers ignored their leader’s will and backed a plan to keep the UK in the EU’s single market.They helped rebel Tory peers to inflict a defeat on the government over the issue during the passage of Ms May’s EU (Withdrawal) Bill – one of 15 her administration suffered in recent weeks.Ms May has also recently appointed nine new peers to the Lords. Questioned on how she justified the new commitments, her spokesman said that the overall size of the Lords had reduced during her tenure.And on appointing ex-ministers, like Peter Lilley and Sir Eric Pickles, he said: “The nominations reflect our determination that the House of Lords should contain people from various walks of life.“But also people who have expertise that can add to the overall contribution the house makes.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The Office for National Statistics said the biggest factor pulling the rate down was air fares, which were influenced by the timing of Easter.\u0026nbspThe pound was down in morning trading, dipping 0.63 per cent to $1.3345, as traders reduced back bets on a summer rate rise from the central bank.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe bank’s governor, Mark Carney, told the Treasury Select Committee on Tuesday that weaker than expected inflation in March had been one of the influences on the bank deciding not to hike interest rates this month, but many analysts had said that an August increase in borrowing was still possible.Kevin Doran, chief investment officer at AJ Bell, said that the recent weakness in the pound and the rising oil price “are a concern and could quickly reverse the drop in inflation”. “The jump in the oil price has started to hit petrol pumps, pushing up costs for UK consumers and businesses alike. In addition, the weak pound will be driving up input costs for many UK companies which will ultimately filter through to UK consumers in the coming months,” said Mr Doran. “If inflation does increase, UK consumers will once again start to feel the pinch. Wage growth is currently only marginally ahead of inflation at 2.6 per cent, and interest rates on cash savings remain rock bottom – so rising prices will weaken the spending power of both earnings and savings.”Alistair Wilson, head of retail platform strategy at Zurich, offered a more optimistic view and said UK inflation is “finally heading in the right direction for savers”. “Coupled with rising wages and record levels of employment, this will provide a small\u0026nbspyet well deserved boost to the spending power of UK households,” he said. However, Charles Haresnape, chief executive of Gatehouse Bank, said the UK’s savers “still have little reason to feel uplifted”.“Despite its recent falls, inflation remains far above what the average deposit account is paying, which means the vast majority of savers are still seeing their capital eroded in real terms,” he added.You can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?We use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you.

out at least one massacre of Hindu villagers in Myanmar’s conflict-wracked Rakhine state, an Amnesty International report has concluded. Ethnic conflict has convulsed the southeast Asian country in recent years, with the military accused of slaughtering members of the Muslim Rohingya minority in the majority-Buddhist country.But the new report from the human rights organisation suggests that a Rohingya group known as the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) killed up to 99 Hindu women, men and children while also abducting Hindu villagers.‘Bittersweet’ Ramadan for Rohingya Muslims forced

have left an indelible impression on the survivors we’ve spoken to,” Amnesty International’s Tirana Hassan said in a statement.Myanmar’s government has justified a crackdown on Rohingya residents by saying they were suppressing an armed insurrection after attacks on police posts.The Rohingya have responded by suggesting that their communities suffered disproportionate and undiscerning government reprisals as a result.But while the Amnesty report accused Myanmar authorities of orchestrating a frenzy of “unlawful killings, rapes, and burning of villages” targeted at the Rohingya, driving a mass exodus to neighbouring Bangladesh, it said “no atrocities can justify the massacre, abductions, and other abuses” committed against Hindu villagers.Rohingya Crisis in Photos Rohingya Crisis in Photos

crucial as it is for the crimes against humanity carried out by Myanmar’s security forces in northern Rakhine State”, Ms Hassan said.After ARSA members launched an assault on army installations in August of 2017, the report says, Myanmar’s security forces responded with an “unlawful and grossly disproportionate campaign of violence marked by killings, rape and other sexual violence, torture, village burning, forced starvation tactics and other human rights violations”.Security forces targeted all Rohingya in Rakhine state, the report alleges.ARSA responded by unleashing violence on Hindu people, according to Amnesty. It says the group killed some Hindu villagers “execution-style” and abducted others, with survivors recounting having been forced to convert to Islam if they wished to be spared.The group denied having carried out a massacre.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Rather, she wanted to widen the electorate by attracting young voters and non-whites who hadn’t been casting ballots. She will test her theory as the underdog against either Lt Gov Casey Cagle or Secretary of State Brian Kemp, who will meet in the Republican runoff in July. Mr Cagle led a five-man Republican field, with Kemp qualifying for the second spot after a campaign that was a sprint to the right on everything from immigration to support for President Donald Trump. Mr Kemp promised to keep pulling in that direction, with Mr Cagle trying to balance the demands of a conservative primary electorate with his support from the business establishment. The scenario worried some Georgia Republicans who were accustomed to centrist, business-aligned governors who rarely flouted Atlanta-based behemoths like Delta and Coca-Cola. Some GOP figures worried the GOP gamesmanship on immigration and gay rights, in particular, had already ensured Georgia wouldn’t land Amazon’s second headquarters. Elsewhere in the South, Texas had three House runoffs that will be key to whether Democrats can flip the minimum 24 GOP-held seats they would need for a majority in next year’s Congress.All three were among 25 districts nationally where Mr Trump ran behind Hillary Clinton in 2016. Democrats nominated women in two of the districts and a black man in the third all three nominees will face white, male incumbent Republicans in November. Attorney Lizzie Fletcher far outpaced activist Laura Moser in a metro-Houston congressional contest that became a proxy for Democrats’ fight between liberals and moderates. National Democrats’ campaign committee never endorsed Ms Fletcher, but released opposition research against Ms Moser amid fears that she was too liberal to knock off vulnerable Republican Rep. John Culberson in the autumn election. World news in picturesWorld news in picturesPeople demonstrate in Paris during a nationwide day protest by French public sector employees and public servants against the overhauls proposed by French President Emmanuel Macron, calling them an attack by the centrist leader against civil services as well as their economic security.Newly appointed Catalan president Quim Torra arrives to visit jailed Catalan separatist politicians at the Estremera jail near Madrid.Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro casts his vote during the presidential elections in Caracas.

Ms Jones would be the first openly lesbian congresswoman from her state. Former NFL player Colin Allred won a battle of two attorneys and former Obama administration officials in a metro-Dallas House district. Mr Allred, who is black, topped Lillian Salerno and will face Republican Rep. Pete Sessions in November. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee lined up behind Mr Allred after the group’s initial favourite failed to make the runoff. Among Republicans, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz showed off his endorsement muscle, with his former chief of staff, Chip Roy, winning a competitive runoff for a San Antonio-area congressional seat opened by the retirement of Rep. Lamar Smith. In the governor’s race, Democrats tapped former Dallas County Sheriff Lupe Valdez to take on Republican incumbent Greg Abbott in November. Ms Valdez is Texas’ first openly gay and first Latina nominee for governor. Voters in a central Kentucky congressional district opted for retired Marine officer and fighter pilot Amy McGrath over Lexington Mayor Jim Gray to advance to a campaign against Republican Rep. Andy Barr. National Democrats once touted Mr Gray as one of their best recruits in their efforts for a House majority. They said in recent weeks they’d be happy with Ms McGrath, but the race still shaped up as a battle between rank-and-file activists and the party establishment. Ms McGrath was making her first bid for public office, among a handful of female Naval Academy graduates running for Congress this year. Mr Gray also lost a 2016 Senate race. In eastern Kentucky’s Rowan County, voters denied the Democratic nomination to a gay candidate who wanted to challenge the local clerk who denied him and others same-sex marriage licenses. David Ermold had wanted to face Republican Kim Davis, who went to jail three years ago for denying marriage licenses in the aftermath of an historic US Supreme Court decision legalising same-sex marriage. Republicans want new special counsel to probe alleged FBI misconductClinton endorses woman who could become first black, female governor While Washington fixates on the daily developments in the Russia election meddling investigation, Democratic congressional candidates insist they’ll win in November arguing about bread-and-butter issues like health care. Arkansas state representative Clarke Tucker captured Democrats’ congressional nomination in a Little Rock-based district by telling his story as a cancer survivor. Though he faced a crowded primary field, his real target all along has been Republican representative French Hill, who voted many times to repeal the 2010 Affordable Care Act. The Arkansas district may not be at the top of Democrats’ national target list, but it’s the kind of district the party might have to win to be assured of regaining House control in November. The state’s Republican governor Asa Hutchinson dispatched primary opposition as he sought another term.

The two had been lovers after meeting in 1960 when being gay was banned.Scott, who worked as a model, was said to have had a full blown affair with the politician and even had liaisons in Thorpe’s Commons room.But after they parted, Thorpe was said to have viewed Scott as a dangerous blackmailer intent on revenge - something that could have wrecked his political ambitions.For while homosexuality was legalised in 1967 it was still taboo for people in the public eye.Scott had been lured on to Exmoor by a hitman, who was allegedly a part-time pilot called Andrew Newton who had been hired as part of the plot.He shot the model’s dog before turning the gun on Scott – but it jammed. Effing and jeffing, he sped off.After managing to hail down an approaching car, Scott blurted “Jeremy Thorpe” to the driver.A police investigation lead to a trial in the Old Bailey with the Liberal leader accused of conspiracy to murder along with three other men. But the jury did not feel convinced that Thorpe, a man of hitherto unblemished reputation and a national figure with a very distinguished public record could be capable of the crime. And he was acquitted along with the others.But Scott maintains Thorpe wanted him dead and said he only felt safe when the politician died in 2014.His younger self has been played by actor Ben Wishaw in the new BBC drama starring Hugh Grant called Very English Scandal."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict0004075418813.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"david starkey harry meghan royal wedding","story":"Nazi-uniform-wearing, strip poker-playing, headstrong Harry was the black sheep of the Royal Family and his whirlwind romance the most unlikely, least planned of royal unions.But by wooing and winning Meghan he’s done more to change the image of the Royal Family than any focus group or image consultant.More than Prince Charles’s anxious musings and more even than his mother Diana’s dramatic life and death.Actions, they say, speak louder than words. Well, Harry’s acted.They all talked about modernising the Royal Family. Harry has actually done it with a bride and a wedding service like no other.“Love,” Bishop Curry told us in his extraordinary sermon — which spoke in accents unheard of in polite English churches — “love can change this world.”It’s sure changed the Royal Family. Ms Markle, it is worth repeating, is mixed-race, American, of uncertain religion, an actress, divorced and with a sexual history.In the past any one of these would have rendered her deeply doubtful as a royal bride and the combination would have ruled her out entirely. But the times they are a’changing.The stigma of divorce was still powerful as late as the 1990s, which is why it took so long to dissolve the disastrous marriage of Harry’s parents, Prince Charles and Princess Diana.But their divorce, and Charles’s subsequent remarriage to Camilla, acted as a sort of earthquake which brought all the remaining conventions of royal marriages — virginal brides, nice English girls, no divorce — tumbling down.Which, in a nutshell, is how the Royal Family came to get Meghan.But why did Meghan want to become royal? The short answer is that she wanted Harry. But so did lots of other women, who all baulked at the prospect of becoming royal.Not Meghan. Indeed, she seems to have embraced it as passionately as Harry himself.As an actress, of course she wasn’t fazed by the publicity that had so put off Harry’s earlier girlfriends. But there’s more to it than that.At university she took a double major in theatre and international studies — which was her real love.She became an intern in the American embassy in Argentina. She took the exam to enter the US State Department, which is the equivalent of our Foreign Office.It was only when she failed the notoriously difficult test that she turned to acting.Moreover, the moment she enjoyed success and fame with Suits, she used it to leverage her entry on to the international stage as “Global Ambassador” for World Vision Canada, among many other good causes.In other words, acting was not her vocation. It was only a means to an end.And that end is much better served by her marrying Harry, becoming royal and using her fame — and his — to serve the issues, particularly women’s issues, she is so keen on.So you could say that Harry — the eternal boy-man — is marrying his mother, since Diana used her fame too.But Diana did it in opposition to her estranged husband. Meghan aims to do it in partnership with Harry and at the very heart of the Royal Family.And she’s proving astonishingly adept — is it those actressy skills again? — at winning over the British establishment.Back in the 1930s, the Archbishop of Canterbury was the deadly foe of Wallis Simpson, King Edward VIII’s divorced American bride, and led to his abdication.Today, Archbishop Justin Welby is Meghan’s best friend. Indeed, he’s practically three in a bed with the couple.There’s chemistry, of course. But there’s also calculation on both sides.Welby wants to use Meghan, who as an American does religion as well as touchy-feely, to spearhead a religious revival among the young.The Royal Family also want to buy into her as an international brand.Which is why the Queen appointed Harry Commonwealth Youth Ambassador.Weve made a brand new Snapchat lens just for the big day!Unlock The Suns Royal Wedding lens on Snapchat here and send us your snaps to @TheSunUKKeeping the Commonwealth going in the face of the overwhelming indifference of British politicians of all parties has been the greatest personal achievement of the Queen’s long reign.And she capped it by ruthlessly stage-managing Charles’s acclamation as her successor as Head of the Commonwealth at the most recent Commonwealth Conference.That was the constitutional bit sorted out.Harry’s appointment addresses the equally important question of PR.Meghan and Harry are the model modern couple: Mature (well, she is), bi-racial,bi-cultural, international, do-gooding, fashion-conscious and media-savvy to their fingertips.They are the perfect face of a modern monarchy at home and ideal Global Ambassadors for Brand Windsor abroad.And, come to think of it — which I’m sure the Queen and her advisers have done — they are the perfect Global Ambassadors for post-Brexit Brand Britain as well.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Nobody would believe that.Yet the happy couple set aside family rows, petty jealousies and drunken sabotage and basked in the warm embrace of an adoring public.Windsor’s Disney-style ceremony was watched in broad daylight north of the equator and the middle of the night Down Under by happy viewers of all races and creeds.There is a message here for us all.Harry and Meghan’s wedding did more than unite this nation in sympathy and affection for a popular prince and the love of his life. It showed this country is world class.The sub-plot, of course, was the emotional union between the damaged children of two broken families.Fans have long yearned for Prince Harry to find happiness after the roller-coaster life and shocking death of his fabled mother, Princess Diana.They have warmed to a young man who transformed himself from a mixed-up kid to a likeable soldier, helicopter pilot and champion of war-damaged Invictus casualties.As for his bride, Meghan Markle is the glamorous star of hit TV series Suits, who dreamed as a child of becoming a princess.Best of all in this age of right-on political correctness, she is the daughter of a charming African-American mother and an Emmy-winning Hollywood lighting specialist.The House of Windsor is now truly multicultural.It is also hip.Our amazing sovereign, at 92, and doughty Prince Philip, 96, both heading for their royal telegrams, are the Queen and King of Cool.Where else in the world would you see an Elton John double act with Windy City preacher Bishop Michael Curry?This was a truly uplifting occasion, worn lightly by a once-stuffy Royal Family.Nobody does it better when it comes to choreographing mounted cavalry, trumpets, banners and horse-drawn carriages with an electric-powered E-Type and a vintage Rolls-Royce.All underscored by a sense of humour, as Harry and his supportive brother William exchanged banter at the altar of Windsor’s historic St George’s Chapel.Even the weather turned out in tribute, bathing Windsor Great Park’s glorious greenery in spring sunshine.There may have been some muffled coughs over Markle family squabbles but they were nothing compared with the torrid dramas leading to the Queen’s own “annus horribilis”.The world has become used to British pageantry.But this Royal Wedding was a timely reminder that Britain is not just a small island with a fading history on the edge of Europe.The Duke and Duchess of Sussex ride in a carriage down The Long Walk back towards Windsor Castle after getting married in St Georges Chapel, WindsorThe 21st-century United Kingdom is an unrivalled brand on the global stage.The world was witnessing more than mere pomp and circumstance.This was UK plc on international parade, joining hands with the global community in a way no other nation can match — even the mighty USA.Had Meghan married into the family of a French or American president, a German Chancellor or a Kremlin tsar, would anyone have tuned in?Neither China nor Russia could captivate so many friendly eyeballs.The Olympics might do it.But London 2012 revealed Britain is best on these occasions, too.On Saturday, Britain proved it is capable of reaching out to a world beyond borders.Harry and Meghan’s marriage bonded the UK indelibly with the US.If the new Duke and Duchess have kids, they will be American citizens — as well as British due to Harry’s lineage — and will eventually be liable to American tax.Importantly, this wedding had special significance for the 2.5billion citizens of 52 Commonwealth countries, especially in Africa and the Caribbean, who swear allegiance to the Queen.My Australian in-laws were constantly on the phone from Sydney this weekend, all thoughts of becoming a republic abandoned, to discuss the finer points of royal protocol.But this event was watched from lands with no current ties to Britain — South America, the Far East and the Gulf States.It was a showcase of modern Britain forever adapting to change, the key to our success as an outward-looking nation.There was a clear hint of defiance, too. This steely couple were doing it their way.Our Brexit negotiators — on both sides of the argument — should take note.That big wide world, viewing us in high definition on Saturday, is where Britain’s future lies.These are our markets.The audience liked what they saw and they want some of what we’re having.In marketing terms alone, it was priceless.Too often we underestimate our strength and standing.We have developed an absurd inferiority complex.We’ve been led to believe we are too weak and puny to stand alone on the global stage.Yet we are among the world’s greatest economies, second only to Germany in the EU.We are a nuclear power with a real professional army which has helped keep the peace in Europe, and have an envied place on the UN Security Council.Republican lefties despise all this stuff.They smear Britain’s record as a brutal colonial power while ignoring our global lead in abolishing slavery.Disturbingly, some Conservatives seem to agree the UK is washed up and past its prime.Since we cannot run our own economy, they say, we should hand the job to unelected bureaucrats in Brussels.These, remember, would be the same Brussels flunkies who created the euro, wrecked the economies of member states and put millions of unemployed young people on the scrap heap.Most of those workless youngsters gratefully upped sticks and moved here.I wonder why?Saturday’s Royal Wedding showed we are in the Premier League.Now the world is watching, perhaps with slightly less enthusiasm, as another British saga lurches towards its climax — another broken family consumed with jealousy and bent on revenge.The cast is familiar — the statutory drunk, a bully who prefers to talk with a gun in his hand, some characters who would prefer a car crash to a happy ending.Can we stop the bickering and reach a good Brexit deal?Why can’t the Leavers and Remainers put the country first, join hands, bury their differences and take a vow to work together to serve the national interest?Inspired by the Royal Wedding, by the poem Invictus, we can rise above petty differences.“We are the masters of our fate: We are the captains of our soul.”Want to celebrate Harry and Meghans wedding like a royal?Weve made a brand new Snapchat lens just for the big day!Unlock The Suns Royal Wedding lens on Snapchat here and send us your snaps to @TheSunUKOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Oh well.Most married couples leave it 18 months before they reach that arrangement.But on that bombshell it was on with the Royal Wedding, which normally divides the nation into two distinct camps.There are the royalists, who have great fun watching all the pomp and pageantry on television.And the republicans, who have great fun hating all the pomp and pageantry on television.So the only real choice to be made, for all of us, is: Which channel?Personally, six hours of a photobombing Kay Burley giving it the full Partridge on Sky News was a punishment that’s way beyond me, as was five hours of the E! channel gang ­yelling: “Oh my God. Wow!”ITV was never going to be anything less than thoroughly professional in the hands of Julie Etchingham and Phillip Schofield, once he shut up about Holly Willoughby, so I went with the Beeb, where Naga called it a night shortly after announcing Prince Harry was now: “The Duke of Essex.”Oi! Oi! “Sussex rather.” Oh. Pity.The real surprise for some of you, though, might have been discovering that to give it an informal vibe, ­alongside Kirsty Young, BBC1’s 9am-and-beyond coverage was now being fronted by the strangely contorted ­figure of Dermot O’Leary — the former host of ITV’s The Marriage Ref.A show that may have been the ­perfect rehearsal for most royal ­weddings, but probably not this one.They weren’t alone, obviously.The Beeb had the joint surrounded, in fact, by among others Huw Edwards, ­fashion expert Jo Elvin, who was “across the dress” (as clueless as the rest of us), Alex Jones, Ore Oduba and Anita Rani, who performed the ­essential task of repeating what the other person had just said.Ore: “First glimpse of the dress, it’s going to be a moment.”Anita: “It’s going to be a moment.” Traditionally, of course, on these great state occasions, the moment TV crews start interviewing other TV crews is the cue for the coverage to descend into flannel, repetition, idle speculation, cliche (“Excitement’s ­building”), imponderable questions and outright stupidity.On Saturday, by slight contrast, the trigger was actually the arrival of Oprah Winfrey and the first trickle of celebrity guests, who had a clearly ­nervous ­Dermot asking: “When the invite says ‘hats’, does that mean hats are an absolute given?”“Absolutely, it does,” said Kirsty, slapping him down testily.It got progressively worse with each arrival as well.So by the time Amal Clooney wafted in alongside husband George, who was dressed as one of Modern Romance, even basic motor tasks seemed beyond some of the BBC team.Kirsty: “It can be difficult to wear a hat, can’t it?”Jo: “I think so, yes.”In fairness, it should also be stated this idiocy was certainly not restricted to the BBC.I switched over to ITV during the ­arrivals and heard Meghan’s old drama teacher, Gigi Perreau, say: “This is incredible and we’re right there. Well, we’re here but we’re also there, so it’s fabulous.”It’s just the nature of the beast.With so much time to fill, everyone will say these things.Only the BBC, though, could possibly leave me feeling queasy with the choice of one of its Royal Wedding experts.This was left-wing “social commentator” Afua Hirsch, who was privately educated and has led a life of unimaginable advantage, compared to most of us, but is also a professional victim who thinks pretty much ­everything is “racist”, wants Nelson’s Column torn down and wasn’t about to drop her agenda with such a large audience at her mercy.“While I have felt alienated by the inherited privilege,” said Afua, who’s enjoyed more than most, “my own struggles with identity have made me appreciate the need for cultural ­continuity.“So while I didn’t relate to the Royal Family, I did relate to that need for a sense of tradition.”Quite a brass neck, isn’t it, speaking out against the whole concept of the Royal Family, while simultaneously using them to increase your TV profile, as Afua had been doing all week.Instead of telling her so, or pointing out Harry’s ex Chelsy Davy had arrived while she was guffing away, a nodding Dermot said he could listen to Afua “all day”.A claim I doubt, frankly.Indeed, I reckon he’d have been throwing himself off Windsor Castle’s ramparts before breakfast if he’d tried.No one else, I suspect though, was listening to a single word she said.Nor will they have needed Afua’s lofty approval to enjoy a day filled with so many memorable events, including Bishop Michael Curry’s fiery address to the congregation, the ­reappearance of the Duke of Edinburgh and Meghan’s Rolls-Royce ­hurtling up the Long Walk past 100,000 Union Flags like it was being driven by Richard Hammond.These are all magical moments you’ll possibly want to watch again — and if you do, having sat through both start to finish, I’d probably recommend the ITV version.It had the better ­historic detail, was never in any danger of missing Chelsy Davy’s arrival and rounded everything off nicely as well.Over on the BBC, meanwhile, Kirsty did it by searching for profundities and going where angels feared to tread.“Something has travelled between Harry and Meghan that might be the next page of the story, where they give us a gorgeous little product of their union which we might enjoy too . . . ?”Though not if Naga’s honeymoon arrangements are to be believed, they won’t.Obviously.Want to celebrate Harry and Meghans wedding like a royal?Weve made a brand new Snapchat lens just for the big day!Unlock The Suns Royal Wedding lens on Snapchat here and send us your snaps to @TheSunUKOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Brexit negotiators should remember this.An exciting new era awaits the happy couple, and us, as a truly global Great Britain.SHADOW Chancellor John McDonnell is a sinister politician who would wreck Britain’s finances.Yesterday he outlined how he wants to overthrow capitalism and introduce socialism.He and Jeremy Corbyn would take us down a very dark path. Just look at once-rich Venezuela, where socialism resulted in the poor starving to death and there being no medicine for the sick.Madly, McDonnell yesterday claimed the South American country’s problem was that it was not socialist enough. He also said he wanted a “zero- tolerance” approach to anti-Semitism, yet defended Labour’s appointment of Martha Osamor to the House of Lords.That’s the same Martha Osamor who claimed the party’s anti-Semitism row was manufactured as “a tool to intimidate activists on the Left”.We wouldn’t expect anything less from McDonnell, a man who glorified the IRA, described London rioters as “the best of our movement” and joked about lynching a Tory minister.There are rumours the Government is insanely considering calling a snap election — risking handing this scary clown the keys to the country finances.The Tories would not just be gambling their future, but Britain’s.CULTURE Secretary Matt Hancock is right to get tough with the social media giants.For far too long Facebook and Google have shown no concern for the youngsters using their sites.Mr Hancock invited 14 of the internet giants to a consultation.

Later, I went back with him after he had built a night school for the boys, and asked over a cup of tea: “Why are you doing this, Harry?”He replied: “This is the most important thing I do.”It tells you everything about who his mother was.Inside the Chapel, the hymn was Guide Me, O Thou Great Redeemer, which was played at Princess Diana’s funeral and one of her favourites.Di’s sister Lady Jane Fellowes delivered the only reading. Listening to it was Sarah, the Duchess of York, who had not been invited to other recent royal weddings.Inviting Fergie was a brilliant thing to do. During Diana’s troubled times every Sunday she would drive down to Berkshire to have lunch with Fergie, spending the afternoon talking about their divorces.Outside in the Chapel courtyard were 2,000 people from Harry and Meghan’s charities, including servicemen who have lost limbs.Harry is following Diana’s hugely successful campaign to stop landmines by working with those who have been wounded by IEDs.When Harry was flying back from one of his tours of Afghanistan he shared the plane with three soldiers who were in a coma.He realised these soldiers, if they recovered, would have limbs missing and facing a life of misery — which is why he inspired them with his support for the Invictus Games.And Harry and Meghan asked guests to make donations to the Children’s HIV Association.Harry has clearly never forgotten how his mother took the stigma out of Aids by embracing sufferers, including babies in Brazil.And then there was the ring. On Saturday night Meghan was wearing the emerald-cut aquamarine ring Diana first wore in 1996.Harry once told ITV’s Tom Bradby: “I wanted to do something that would make my mother proud.” He succeeded on Saturday.Want to celebrate Harry and Meghans wedding like a royal?Weve made a brand new Snapchat lens just for the big day!Unlock The Suns Royal Wedding lens on Snapchat here and send us your snaps to @TheSunUKOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The decision to allow a bid to be cancelled is up to the seller.But Claire isnt the only opportunist to sell off the commemorative bag, with a number of other bags put up for sale just hours after the wedding that saw everyone from the Queen to the Clooneys attend.One seller called Chrisofwilliams, from Merthyr Tydfil, Wales, stands to make more than £40,000 after putting his commemorative bag on eBay.The gift was initially listed for 99p on Sunday, with the seller saying: Buy a piece of history and memorabilia to celebrate a momentous special day for Britain’s and the royal family.I am selling my limited Goody bag for guests of Royal wedding of Meghan and Harry 19th May 2018.Official bag with full contents containing commemorative chocolate coin unopened sealed and in original condition, labelled spring water bottle unopened and sealed in original condition: royal wedding fridge magnet unopened in original packaging, the castle spectator badge and a tub of ‘handbag shortbread’ unopened as well as a Marriage order of service booklet and a 20% off voucher of middle ward shop in Windsor castle.Don’t miss out on this limited once in a life time opportunity to have a piece of royal history.”But many saw the monetary value in flogging off the bag, selling it online.So what does the bag actually contain? - Bottle of Windsor Castle Still Spring Water 500mL- Harry and Meghan Traditiaionl Handbag Shortbread Biscuits- Royal Wedding 2018 Belgian Milk Chocolate Coin 90g- Royal Wedding Commemorative Magnet- Voucher for royalcollectionshopAnother online listing has reached £420 while another hit £411.One of of the listings, the seller declared proudly: “At the wedding today I received this wonderful gift bag for guests.”And the post promised: “I forgot to mention all money raised will go to charity.”Another seller has even been trying to flog PDFs of the Royal Wedding order of service - for £5 each.As the non-VIP guests departed on Saturday the wedding reception turned into an ­outrageous party with a very royal dance-off and “beer pong” games. The Sun can reveal that chat-show superstar James Corden — who was compering the event — instigated an extraordinary dance routine which featured Prince Charles, Prince William and Harry.The royal couple chose I Wanna Dance With Somebody as their first dance at the fun-filled, early-hours wedding bash.Harry, 33, and Meghan, 36 — now the Duke and ­Duchess of Sussex — let their hair down to the hit by Whitney Houston at Frogmore House, Windsor, where telly’s Corden hosted dinner and fireworks for 200 guests.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

So is Her Majesty the Queen. They haven’t felt the need to label themselves as such we know from their actions.As the basic scriptwriting rule dictates, show don’t tell.To her credit, Meghan Markle championed many charitable causes that advocate female empowerment before she met Prince Harry, and no one is suggesting she shouldn’t continue with this work.But what grates about the above statement is the unsaid inference that here is a feisty, independent woman who, unshackled by pomp, ceremony and dutiful political impartiality, is going to drag the stuffy, deluded old monarchy kicking and screaming into the 21st century.That this go-get-’em gal from the US of A is going to shake things up with a few bumper-sticker sentiments and teach those Brits a thing or two about how the world works.Or perhaps we should leave it to Patrick Jephson, former private secretary to Princess Diana, a man very much in the know on the inner workings of the House of Windsor.In his book, The Meghan Factor, he says: “The one key skill Meghan absolutely must perfect is how to avoid being seen as any kind of a destabilising force. It’s a useful guideline when weighing the pros and cons of any intended course of action, from saving a local playgroup, to saving an endangered species, to saving the planet. What always comes first is saving the monarchy.”Quite. In other words, don’t get up the collective nose of the British public or they might just, ahem, pick it and flick you off into oblivion.As we saw on Saturday, as Bishop Michael Curry’s address entered what felt like its third decade, The Queen’s resolutely impassive expression suggests she’d make a fine poker player.We have no idea what she thought of it, nor Donald Trump, Brexit or the highly political Me Too campaign. She has opinions, of course. But what she doesn’t do is wear them like a badge.Just like her great-great-grandmother Victoria, who advocated “never complain, never explain”, The Queen knows the future of the monarchy lies in being a non-political figurehead who promotes national unity.Jephson adds: “If you acquire a profile, a purpose and a passionate public devotion independent of the royal mainstream, then you risk being perceived and presented as a threat to the Crown itself.”We already know what Meghan thinks about an awful lot of things, because her life so far can’t be edited.We also know that her soapbox has just got bigger thanks to her new status which, to those unused to it, could foster the corrosive misconception that everyone is hanging off your every word.Read my pursed lips: They’re not. They’re just being polite.So Meghan must learn fast that she’s a very minor cog in an ancient royal machine that has survived so long by saying nothing and doing its duty to its loyal subjects.Frustrating that may be for a “feminist” (or, indeed a manist), but that’s the trade-off for the largely taxpayer-funded life of luxury that is granted, not self-generated.As a celebrity, you can say what you like and we can choose to listen or not. But opinions divide people and, as a royal, you are supposed to represent everyone.Meghan needs to understand, and implement, that distinction sooner rather than later.HUMAN rights lawyer Amal Clooney was officially crowned “best-dressed guest” by fashionistas observing the Royal Wedding.According to one, she was “a sublime vision in marigold”, though personally speaking, Colman’s Mustard yellow might be more accurate.Either way, Ms Clooney once again proved adept at pulling focus from the other mere mortals floundering in her ever-stylish slipstream.By contrast, the Duchess of Cambridge’s understated, Alexander McQueen frock coat got a sniffier reception from certain fashion quarters, not least because she’s worn it three times before.They’re missing the point.A wedding is about the bride, not the guests.And Kate understood that perfectly by wearing something that wouldn’t propel her into the limelight on Meghan’s big day.Now that’s style.THOSE attending Chelsea Flower Show (no, me neither) have declared that “she-sheds” are the latest must-have – kitted out with radiators, chandeliers and squishy sofas.Alternatively, we could have all that inside the house and just send the other half out into the garden.AN Islamic school in Birmingham has warned female pupils against using tampons.The guidance, adopted as school policy, states: “Among the types of pads, tampons may not be appropriate due to insertion.”But the head of the school insists it has “no connection to faith”.Hmmmm. Meanwhile, it has emerged that women are having “virginity restoring” operations on the NHS at a cost of £1,000 a time.The 30-minute procedure involves the hymen – which can break after using tampons, doing sport or having sex for the first time – being stitched or reconstructed.One relationship counsellor suggested that one of the reasons was that some religious women were “over- whelmed” by feelings of sexual guilt and wanted to be “as pure as possible again” for their husband.Want to? Or are forced to by religiously driven, moral expectations not placed on the man they’re marrying?Either way, is this really something the NHS should be funding when money for other, more vital, operations is so scarce?MEMO to Sir Anthony Hopkins: Yes, families do fall out and just because you’re related doesn’t mean you have to like each other.But saying you “don’t care one way or the other” whether your 48-year-old daughter Abigail has children or not seems overly cold and perhaps partly explains your 20-year estrangement.In future, a simple, “We don’t speak and I’d rather not go in to it”, might be wiser.HOW come, in this age of state-of-the-art camera phones, when anyone spots the Loch Ness monster, beast of Bodmin Moor or any of the other fearsome creatures supposedly roaming our shores, the evidential photo is always out of focus?Exhibit A: The “lion” spotted in Oldbury in the West Midlands this week.Yep.

He had definitely had a procedure done – he wasn’t feeling very well. He seemed like he was in a bit of pain. Heart surgery obviously isn’t something minor.“He definitely wanted to lay low. He was given his space and he did not come out of the guesthouse.It was an apartment with a full kitchen so he could cook. He didn’t have any visitors – it was a bit sad that he was all by himself.“He checked out on Monday and said he was feeling better and well rested. It is good to see him back on his feet again.”He emerged from the guesthouse, in a gated compound three miles south of Antonio Del Mar, on Monday afternoon, after telling the landlady that his daughter looked “beautiful” at the wedding.Despite recovering from heart surgery, Thomas Sr was picked up by a pal, single mum Lori Davis, 38, and driven to a Starbucks, where he was seen holding a creamy Frappuccino with whipped crème.The Emmy Award-winning lighting expert was then taken back to his scruffy cliff-top home – carrying a bag marked ‘personal belongings’. It was one week since he had been seen at the property – following the heart drama which eventually saw him ruled out of attending the royal wedding on health grounds.He had told TMZ on Monday last week that he suffered a heart attack six days previous and was not going to go to the royal wedding. Twenty-four hours later he informed the website that he had checked into hospital.The father-of-three underwent surgery on Wednesday – later revealing that three stents had been inserted into his blood vessels. He then told TMZ that he had crossed over the border, 45 minutes from his Mexican home, and was recovering in California, where he watched Meghan get hitched from the bedroom of a ‘safe house’.Thomas Sr, who watched as Prince Charles gave Meghan, 36, away, told the website it was “emotional a joyful”, adding: “My baby looks beautiful and she looks very happy. I wish I were there and I wish them all my love and all happiness.“The service was beautiful and its history. I will always regret not being able to be there and not being able to hold my daughters hand. My baby girl is a duchess and I love her so much.“When you watch your child get married, every thought goes through your mind, every memory from the first day she was born, the first time I held her.”The Sun told on Monday how Meghan and Harry – who had spoken to Thomas Sr during an emotional phone call on Thursday – were discussing plans to visit him.They are thought to be leaving on their honeymoon this week, following Saturday’s glitzy wedding at Windsor Castle – attended by David Beckham, Oprah, Tom Hardy and George Clooney. Thomas Sr did not answer the door of his Mexican property last night.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Fine words are well known for not buttering parsnips, and we are not getting our parsnips buttered at the moment.”His withering attack continued: “In terms of these negotiations, particularly as they’re led by someone who backed Remain, trust is very important.

It is essential that the Speaker steps aside from chairing and participating on all matters related to bullying.”He also asked for a call to evidence over “intimidating behaviour which I and other members have witnessed repeatedly over the years”.The Commissioner’s office confirmed it had received a complaint and she would “consider whether the matter is within her remit and, if it is, whether there is sufficient evidence to justify beginning an inquiry”.A spokeswoman for Mr Bercow declined to comment.Last night No10 said MPs must always treat colleagues “with courtesy and respect” in a pointed dig at Mr Bercow.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

above the weekly average of six ads - boosts consumption of unhealthy food.Scientists claim exposure to just one more advert can result in up to 5lb weight gain.One in three kids now leaves primary school overweight or obese.Being too heavy increases the chances of type 2 diabetes, liver, heart disease and several common cancers.Presenting the data at the European Congress on Obesity in Vienna, lead researcher Dr Jyotsna Vohra, said her findings show a clear link between advertising and weight gain.Dr Vohra, the head of the Cancer Policy Research Centre, said: “Junk food marketing is associated with obesity in young people of all ages, and we know that obesity is linked to at least 13 types of cancer.“The food industry wouldn’t pump hundreds of millions into advertising their products by creating catchy adverts if it didn’t get people to eat more.”Cancer Research UK is one of several charities calling for junk food adverts to be scrapped before 9pm.The ads are already banned from kids programmes, but can still be shown during family-friendly broadcasts such as reality TV shows and sport.The research is the largest of its kind, and involved more than 3,300 children and teenagers between the ages of 11 and 19.They were all asked about adverts for products high in salt, sugar and fat.Participants watched an average 21 hours of television a week, including six junk food commercials.They reported scoffing around 30 unhealthy snack items weekly.But seeing just one extra advert significantly boosted their calorie intake from unhealthy items by 350 a week.Experts warn this is enough to make a child obese.The findings come as Theresa May prepares to publish a new crackdown on childhood obesity.Separate research suggests tubby kids are around five times more likely to become fat adults.In 2017, a report by the Obesity Health Alliance found that junk food companies in the UK spend £143 million a year on advertising - almost 30 times the £5 million spent annually by the Government on healthy eating campaigns.A Public Health England report found fat-fighting plans to slash sugar from family favourites are failing miserably as companies ignore Government pleas to reduce sugar in their products."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000408197859.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"saddam hussein superyacht basrah breeze","story":"Although it was built for him in 1981, the dictator never set foot on board - and its now set to be enjoyed by pilots who guide shipping in and out of the port of Basra, the main southern city in Iraq.As well as rocket launchers, a secret passage leading to a small submarine, the yacht comes equipped with a presidential suite comprising Saddams private quarters, dining rooms and bedrooms, as well as 17 smaller guest rooms, 18 cabins for crew and a clinic.The yacht has been decorated in an Arabesque style according to YachtCharterFleet, with mahogany carvings, gold tap fittings and brightly-coloured deep-pile carpets, and also features swimming pools, a small theatre, and landing for a helicopter and an operating theatre.In common with other treasures left by Saddam, toppled in 2003 during the US-led invasion of Iraq and hanged three years later for crimes against humanity, the governments that succeeded him have been struggling to find a use for the ship.Since Iraq got it back in 2010 following a court battle and a three-decade odyssey abroad, it has been mostly moored in Basra - and as the Government has failed to find a buyer, for the past two years the Basrah Breeze has served Basra University, hosting researchers on trips to study marine life.The presidential yacht is in a very good condition. Its two engines and generators are functioning, said Abdul-Zahra Abdul-Mahdi Saleh, its captain. It only needs periodic maintenance.But authorities have now decided to moor it permanently as a hotel and recreation facility for the southern ports pilots, many of whom live in distant cities.The port needs the boat to be a station where sea pilots can rest, said Basra port spokesman Anmar al-Safi.Built by a Danish shipyard while Iraq was at war with Iran, the yacht was passed on to Saudi Arabia - then a Saddam ally - to protect it from air strikes on Basra.The kingdom, which fell out with Saddam after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990, then handed the vessel over to Jordan.Its subsequent movements were unclear until Iraq tracked it down in the French resort of Nice, where a court seized it and sent it home.While the Basrah Breeze survived the turmoil of Saddams decline and demise, its sister ship al-Mansur - which he also never boarded - suffered a different fate, sinking in the Shatt al-Arab waterway that passes through Basra after it was hit by US planes and then stripped bare in the chaotic aftermath of his overthrow.Saddam had ordered it in 2003 to leave Umm Qasr, Iraqs biggest port outside Basra, where it had been moored, to Basra in a vain attempt to avoid air strikes.I told the captain of the yacht, who was a brigadier, to get rid of the military uniforms of the crew, weapons and munitions and pose as civilian ship in case it is caught by the American warships, said Ali Hussein, a port pilot who guided the yacht at the time.As regards Basrah Breeze, Basra museum has not given up hope of persuading the port to allow it to dock the vessel next to its exhibition halls in one of Saddams former palaces overlooking the Shatt al-Arab.Future generations could see how a dictator lived, said Jawad Abdul Kadhim, the museums deputy director."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000407467154-e1527071508182.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"male labour activist suspended after he tries to become womens officer because hes female one day a week","story":"David Lewis said that he feels like a man six days a week, but becomes a woman on the other day.He stood to be the Labour womens officer in Basingstoke in a bid to highlight the partys policy which allows members to define their own gender.But now party chiefs have suspended him and launched an investigation into claims hes undermining Labour.Rules which were confirmed by the partys executive committee last night state women-only positions are open to anyone who self-identifies as female.Mr Lewis told the Spectator he intended to highlight what this policy means, what happens when you say that someones gender depends only on what they say and nothing else.He added: Anyone elses criticism or questions about my gender identity are just not relevant to the Labour party at the moment, given the current policy.

The Government must think again so that people don’t fall into debt or are left at risk of losing their home.”Lib Dem MP Stephen Lloyd added: “These lamentable figures show that thousands of people have still not responded to the significant changes on mortgage interest loans being pushed by the DWP.This is yet another cack-handed benefit change by the Tories which is wholly unnecessary, and is already causing anxiety amongst some of our most disadvantaged, marginalised citizens.The DWP said that any SMI claimants who havent got a phone call about the change will still get the benefit for at least six more weeks.Those affected are urged to contact the official hotline on 0800 731 0459 for pensioners or 0800 169 0310 for anyone of working age.A spokesman said: Over time, someone’s house is likely to increase in value, so it’s reasonable that anyone who has received financial help towards their mortgage should be asked to pay that back.“Everyone who signs up to the loan will continue to get help with their mortgage interest, and it’s only repayable if there is available equity when the property is sold.“If people decide to decline the loan now but change their mind in future the loan can be backdated so in effect there would be no break in payments.“We have already contacted everyone currently in receipt of SMI to explain the change but we are making sure people have time to review the documents, obtain advice and consider their options."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict00040797110912.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"royal portraits place in history","story":"The formal photo of all the family and Meghan’s mum Doria Ragland not only ­features the Queen and the future king, but also the next and the one after that.The Queen and Prince Philip look a bit lost because there are so many bridesmaids and pageboys.But it is a great family ­picture and it’s clear Meghan’s mum Doria is now an important part of it.What is most amazing about the bridesmaids and pageboys is that all bar one are looking towards the camera.

And to the fact that we\u0027ve been allowed to watch it?First, it\u0027s worth noting how unique Punggye-ri is. It is the only active nuclear weapons test site in the world. It\u0027s where the North Korean regime has detonated six nuclear devices, the most recent, in September, a massive hydrogen bomb. To let foreign reporters in to see a place like that is extraordinary. But this is where the objections mount. Kim Jong Un is welcoming reporters, not weapons inspectors, who might be able to more comprehensively verify the regime\u0027s claims. And even us journalists have had our dosimeters confiscated so we can\u0027t independently confirm how much radiation (if any) is leaking out of the site. Then there\u0027s the site itself. Some reports have suggested that it\u0027s now unusable thanks to a tunnel collapse, triggered by detonation after detonation. Six nuclear blasts is a lot even for a mountain to endure.And the final argument - Mr Kim has already proved, to his and the world\u0027s satisfaction, that he has a nuclear weapon of terrifying power. He simply doesn\u0027t need to do any more tests, so shutting down Punngye-ri doesn\u0027t mean all that much. Those points are good ones, although you can deal with them one by one.In reverse order: The last test might have been impressive but the North\u0027s nuclear programme is far from complete - not least in demonstrating the ability to fit a warhead to a missile that successfully reaches its targets.Second, even if Punggye-ri is out of action, there are plenty of mountains in North Korea. It would be easy enough for a totalitarian dictatorship to build another test facility.Third, if Kim is promising not to conduct any more nuclear tests - well, you don\u0027t need weapons inspectors to check that. They show up as glaring seismic events continents away. The decommissioning of Punggye-ri is therefore total symbolism. That\u0027s why camera crews are here, not weapons inspectors. But that symbolism is hugely important.Kim has pledged no more tests - an easily verifiable claim. If he reneges on that, he makes a very public, deliberate choice - the opposite of hiding a weapons program in secret.More importantly, the path to peace is paved with photo ops. The rapid turnaround in the situation on the Korean peninsula has been captured in three moments full of imagery and symbolism.The North Korean delegation to the Winter Olympics the meeting of Kim Jong Un and Moon Jae-in in the demilitarised zone between their two countries, still technically at war the handover of three American political prisoners to the US, shown off by a deliriously happy Donald Trump at Joint Base Andrews in Washington. All photo opportunities.But photo ops that have pushed things closer to peace, stunts that have built momentum when the difficulty of complex geopolitical negotiations have slowed it."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/05/2048x1152/skynews-marks-and-spencer-m-and-s_4314792.jpg?20180519134827 ","title":"same old message from ms but is there room for optimism this time","story":"Today, Steve Rowe, the latest chief executive to attempt to revive the fortunes of the high street stalwart, made this observation: \"The first phase of our transformation plan, restoring the basics, is now well under way and the actions taken have increased the velocity of change running through the business.\":: M\u0026S store closure costs push profits down 62%A cynic would say this feels like Groundhog Day. From a financial point of view, that is certainly the case.M\u0026S was the first British retailer to make pre-tax profits of \u0026#1631bn under the legendary Sir Richard Greenbury back in 1998. The now Lord Rose of Monewden hit the same benchmark a decade later. Over the two decades, though, that achievement looks more and more like an upward blip in a downward spiral.Few would dispute Mr Rowe\u0027s diagnosis of the headwinds facing M\u0026S: the \"continued migration of clothing and home online, the development of global competition, the growth of home delivery in food and the march of the discounters\", along with a challenging consumer backdrop. The problem is that M\u0026S has known about some of these issues for many years and, with the benefit of hindsight, has failed to address them.Of particular disappointment is that, as Mr Rowe admits, M\u0026S\u0027s online capability is not as good as its competitors and its website is too slow.That is an implied criticism of Mr Bolland, who invested \u0026#1631bn in M\u0026S\u0027s logistics and technology, including \u0026#163200m alone on an automated warehouse at Castle Donington in Leicestershire. Mr Rowe admitted today that \"Castle Donington has struggled to cope with peak demand\".There have been other self-inflicted wounds, as well. Mr Rowe noted that in both food and in clothing and home, M\u0026S has seen its customer base narrow, with the loss of market share particularly acute among younger families.That may partly reflect the push towards high-end fashion under Mr Bolland and a failure, in the past, to identify and react to the rise of so-called \u0027fast-fashion\u0027 retailers like Zara, H\u0026M and Primark, the latter of whom has seen its share of the UK clothing market, by value, rise from 4.4% to 7% during the last decade while M\u0026S has seen its share fall from 9.7% to 7.6%.Of particular concern will be that food, the part of M\u0026S that Mr Rowe ran from 2012 to 2015, and which was the one unalloyed success during Mr Bolland\u0027s time at the helm, is starting to go backwards.While overall food sales were up, thanks to the opening of new Simply Food outlets, like-for-like sales, which measure sales from outlets trading under the same format for a year or more, fell in every quarter during the last final year, with the rate of decline accelerating during the final January to March quarter, although that may well reflect the \u0027Beast from the East\u0027 factor.So, Groundhog Day, then?Not necessarily. Mr Rowe, doubtless under the guidance of M\u0026S\u0027s hard-driving new chairman, Archie Norman, is stepping up the store closure programme. As the company announced on Tuesday, it will have 100 fewer stores by 2022, by which time it expects a third of its sales will be coming online. These are drastic measures.Some in the City are optimistic. Clive Black of Shore Capital, one of the best retail analysts around, told clients: \"The business, now in the hands of Messrs Norman and Rowe, is starting to make decisions that have arguably been needed for many years... the current lead [management] team appear, to our minds, to be the best chance that the business has had for some time to stabilise and press on.\"He said investors would doubtless be frustrated that M\u0026S has been in \"perpetual transition\" but that they would need to show \"more patience\".That patience is likely to be tested in coming weeks as M\u0026S faces possible relegation from the FTSE-100, a largely symbolic illustration of the company\u0027s fall from grace, but one that will no doubt sting the group\u0027s hundreds of thousands of loyal staff and more than 325,000 small shareholders.The big question, which some may find odd in the wake of the store closures just announced, is whether M\u0026S is being radical enough in its downsizing of the estate.Even after these store closures, it will still have 200 food, clothing and home stores, which looks too many for a business looking to accelerate its move to online.The second question concerns the dividend. This has been held at 18.7p a share for the full year and paying it costs \u0026#163303.4m.The dividend is less than one-and-a-half times covered by underlying earnings - a level of cover skimpier than model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley\u0027s M\u0026S lingerie. It would be interesting to know whether there has been any discussion of cutting the dividend.A lot of comment on these results will, inevitably, be negative."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/04/2048x1152/skynews-shahid-khan-wembley-stadium_4293190.jpg?20180426154131 ","title":"theresa may calls wembley stadium sale private matter as she dismisses calls to intervene","story":"He asked: \"When the Premier League has spent hundreds of millions of pounds on wages and transfers does the prime minister agree with me there is actually more than enough money in the game for there to be no need to sell off this asset?\"Mrs May retorted: \"That is a decision for the owners of Wembley.

Jon Thompson, chief executive of HM Revenue and Customs, said the “max fac” system could cost business between \u0026pound17bn and \u0026pound20bn - or \u0026pound385million a week. And he revealed it won\u0027t be ready in time before Britain\u0027s Brexit transition period ends in December 2020. The Tories are struggling to decide between two options for customs arrangements after we leave the bloc. So-called max fac, which would use technology to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland, is preferred by leading Brexiteers including Boris Johnson. But grilled by the Commons Treasury committee, Mr Thompson said under this form of arrangement each post Brexit customs declaration is likely to cost business \u0026pound32.50. By comparison the alternative \u0027partnership\u0027 model, which would involve the UK collecting tariffs on behalf of the EU, would cost a maximum of \u0026pound3.4bn, he said.  Mr Thompson told the committee there was an argument that the partnership would cost business zero because firms would get a refund.

He vowed to reset the relationship between PCs and the government three years after Mrs May accused them of crying wolf over cuts. Finally admitting a lack of resources could clearly have an impact, he strongly hinted at new money for police by vowing to prioritise the issue at next year\u0027s spending review. And Mr Javid swung behind the use of stop-and-search powers which were scaled back under Mrs May\u0027s six-year reign as Home Secretary. In a deeply personal address, the Home Secretary told how his brother, an officer for 25 years, was yelled at and branded a P*** b*****d while taking him on patrol in Bristol. Mr Javid, who replaced disgraced Amber Rudd last month, admitted he was new to my job and not yet a policing expert in his speech to the Police Federation - renowned as the toughest gig in British politics.   Up to 63 Windrush citizens may have been wrongly deported from the UK admits Home Secretary  But he said police were wrong to assume there was no way he could understand his job. He said his family grew up on a Bristol street that one newspaper branded the most dangerous in Britain. One journalist, he said, called it a lawless hell hole where murder rape shootings drug pushing prostitution knifings and violent robbery are commonplace - but to us it was just home. He also jokingly revealed he was in a gang - he and his eight-year-old brother becoming amateur crimebusters with “two knackered old bikes” and walkie talkies with a range of three metres. Mr Javid said he believes himself to be the first Home Secretary with a police officer in his immediate family. He told how his brother, now a Chief Superintendent, missed Christmas for having his jaw dislocated. I’ve seen the impact the job has on family life, he added. When his brother took him on patrol on Bristol, he said, At one point when his car approached lights and slowed down one teenager leaned over and yelled at my brother \u0027You P*** b*****d\u0027.  “That was the first time it really hit me just how hard and horrible it can be being a police officer.” Mr Javid said police could be “ineffective, corrupt or too politicised” but vowed to work with officers more closely. Hinting at new funding in a government-wide review next year, he said: “We need to prioritise public investment in policing. We need to think more about the long term funding of police. My pledge to you is this - I will prioritise police funding in the spending review next year. And re-committing to stop and search powers, which Amber Rudd announced could be extended months earlier, he said: Let me be clear - I support the use of stop and search.

And now, for the Duchess of Sussex, the serious work begins.  She and Prince Harry were already back on royal duties yesterday at a Buckingham Palace garden party celebrating Prince Charles’ 70th birthday .  But she has made it clear that her role in “the Firm” will be to do more than wear stylish dresses or just be arm candy for her husband.  Shortly after the wedding, her official biography on the Buckingham Palace website was out and in it she boldly announced she is “proud to be a woman and a feminist”. It was a signal she will be using her huge platform to support causes that help the advancement of women. Insiders say she has the blessing of the palace to do so.  It didn’t take long for the haters to pile in at the mention of the word feminist and I must admit that I initially groaned at the thought.  Of course I believe in equality of men and women which, by definition, makes me a feminist. But I’ve always felt excluded from feminism and feminist debates because they’re always dominated by one voice – well-off middle-class women. Instead of being inclusive, it is exclusive and rarely addresses the views and needs of ethnic minority or working-class women. It seems those who benefit most are usually already well paid and well connected. I’ve been to networking events about gender equality in business or the media and I can usually count the number of non-white women on one hand. During panel discussions I never hear anyone talking about tackling the lack of social or racial diversity. Instead it’s a certain group of women fighting for women like themselves. Women of colour have fought against sexism and racism, but their voice is rarely heard. I believe Meghan can change that. Yes she’s well-off and privileged, but her background, and the fact she was raised by a black woman, gives her a different perspective.  As her bio says, she’s had a keen awareness of social issues from an early age, instilled by her wonderful mother Doria Ragland . “Those early experiences helped shape her lifelong commitment to causes such as social justice and women’s empowerment,” it says.

Brave Leah was taken to hospital where doctors failed to save her injured leg. Now, three years on, Leah, from Barnsley in South Yorkshire, has shared footage of her running for the very first time. She shared a video of her smiling while running alongside her physio Carolyn - captioning the clip: \u0027This is my first time running since my accident. it felt amazing\u0027.

Only blackness, The next thing I remember was the screaming and the blood. There was so much of it. The metal of the safety bars had folded into our bodies.

He had kind, sad eyes and spoke to me slowly.  \u0027I’m so sorry. I had to amputate your left leg. It was seriously injured. It was the only way I could save you.\u0027 The 24-year-old has started blog, Limbitless , and documented her journey from being afraid she might not be able to run, to ordering prosthetics blades and taking on a 10k race. “Everybody is unique and people should be proud of that.

Kelsie Murphy was celebrating her birthday when the test centre contacted her and told her there had been an admin error. The 22-year-old says her examiner had gone through the test paper with her after she took the exam in Herne Bay, Kent, last month. She says he showed her she had received only six minors and told her: You’ve got yourself an early birthday present- you’ve passed! Kelsie was so delighted she was almost in tears - but her happiness turned to confusion when the test centre got in touch the next day.  She says she was told to return her pass certificate, with a major error having been recorded during her driving test on April 11. It remains unclear how she ended up being given an initial \u0027pass\u0027 result - but the centre has said there was an administrative error. It is thought she is the first person in Britain to have had their licence revoked before even receiving it. Kelsie said: “I have no idea where the major mark came from. As far as I knew, everything had gone smoothly. I feel like the unluckiest person ever because they told me it hasn’t happened to anyone but me.”  The mum-of-two had thought she had passed with half a dozen minors after taking the test at Herne Bay driving test centre. Drivers must have fewer than 15 minor faults and no major errors to pass and be issued with their interim driving licence. Kelsie claimed: “My examiner said ‘congratulations you’ve got yourself an early birthday present- you’ve passed!’ “I was so happy, nearly crying, but holding myself back because I didn’t want to embarrass myself. “I’ve been through a lot in my life and I was over the moon that things were finally going well for me.  “My driving instructor came running over to me because she could see the smile on my face. “The examiner went through the paper with us, showing me that I only had six minors.” Kelsie, from Broadstairs, Kent, was ecstatic to have \u0027passed\u0027 the test after previously failing on her first attempt. She returned home to celebrate with her family and friends, where she was greeted with congratulatory balloons, banners and cards. Her mum had helped her to buy a car, and she sent her papers off to the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency to get her driving licence. But a day later, while celebrating her birthday, she received a call from the test centre asking her to return the pass certificate to them.  Shockingly, she says they then told her she hadn’t passed after all. A letter addressed to Kelsie, from the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency’s (DVSA) Operational Delivery Manager, Mark Aston, said a serious fault had been recorded during her test. The letter, dated April 14, read: “After your test on Wednesday 11th April at 13:35 our in-house checks identified a serious fault had been assessed and recorded during your test but due to an administrative error, your examiner issued a pass. “You can only pass your test if you receive fewer than 15 driving faults and there are no serious or dangerous faults recorded. “With this in mind, I am sorry to confirm that you have not passed your driving test and that you should only be driving in accordance with the provisional licence regulations.” It added: “Finally, please accept my sincere apologies for any upset and inconvenience that this error may have caused.” "},{"url":null,"title":"royal wedding guest made 21400","story":"NewsRoyal Wedding guest makes £21,400 flogging her Harry and Meghan goody bag on eBay hours after ceremonyHR manager Claire Oliver, 31, was invited to watch the wedding inside the grounds of Windsor Castle after being hailed a \u0027community champion\u0027 and receiving a \u0027golden ticket\u0027\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByAbigail O\u0027Leary09:41, 23 MAY 2018Updated10:30, 23 MAY 2018NewsClaire made an incredible profit from the small bag filled with sweet treats (Image: Facebook)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA Royal Wedding guest made \u0026pound21,400 flogging her Harry and Meghan goody bag on eBay just hours after the ceremony.

Linda Humphrey, 59, and her partner Norman Howe, 47, of Grimsby, were served an eviction notice by their estate agent after they had fallen more than \u0026pound1,000 behind on their rent, when it was not paid to them through Universal Credit.  Linda, who lost her leg last September due to complications with her diabetes, said that all of their problems seemed to occur at once, as she had just lost her beloved son Paul, 37, three months before, reports the Grimsby  .   Paul had spent 45 weeks in Grimsby hospital with penile cancer before his death. His family had campaigned for a specially-adapted home for him in which to die in peace.  He had lost around 12st while in hospital, having weighed 42st when he was admitted. But sadly, he died in hospital.  She said that Paul\u0027s death played a huge emotional toll on her family, as well as a financial one, because before he was admitted to hospital he had helped to provide support with the rent and bills. It also hit her ex-husband so hard that he was forced to leave his home due to panic attacks fearing that he would die alone there, and he moved in with Linda, Norman and her other son. Linda said: Paul\u0027s passing was very hard on us all, nobody should ever have to lose their child. Since then it just seems like life has got to be very cruel on us, because while we were still trying to cope with his loss, I found that due to my diabetes I had developed an infection in my foot that caused all of the bones to shatter and I was forced to have it amputated. As I normally took care of all the bills things just seemed to start to slip, and we have spiralled into all of this debt just to get by. Linda had been receiving disability benefits since 2009, following an accident at work when she was a carer, while her partner Norman had been getting income support as he was her full-time carer. Following the tragic events of last year, they say that they were advised to switch from their current benefits and go onto Universal Credit, as that would mean that they would receive more money than they had been before. However the pair say that this just was not the case, and that the rent portion of their claim was not being paid directly to their landlord, despite assurances that it would be.  They also claim that even though they explained that they would need \u0026pound207 a week for rent, they had in fact only being receiving \u0026pound137, and this meant they were unable to pay it, or their arrears, putting them into even more debt. Going into the Job Centre after receiving notice from their landlord to find out what the issue was, they were told that they would be able to get the correct benefits that they need if they sign up for a disability premium, which would give them the amount of help and support that they need. But this premium would take 12 weeks to process, meaning that they would not actually receive it until after they are due to be evicted on June 21. The couple say that because of their debts they have been forced to live on less than \u0026pound200 a month, and that they have racked up further debt on credit cards as they have had to use them in order to buy food. Norman was even forced to sell his car in order to try and recoup some money. Norman said: We were advised to go onto Universal Credit because we were told that it would allow us to receive more money than we were currently getting, but that just didn\u0027t seem to be the case.  Our rent money was not being paid to our landlord, and when it started to be they were not providing enough money. Because of this we have been trying to live on less than \u0026pound200 a month, I have had to sell my car, and we are relying on credit cards in order to do the shopping and put food on the table. A single system replacing six benefits: Child and Working Tax Credits, Housing Benefits, Income Support, Jobseekers’ Allowance, and Employment and Support Allowance. It was launched in 2013 as the pet project of Tory Iain Duncan Smith supposedly to make work pay. Who claims it? Low earners, those out of work and the sick or disabled. Already 610,000 people are on UC - 8% of benefit claimants. It is being rolled out to individual Jobcentres including 52 in October 2017. What are the problems? Debt-ridden claimants must wait six weeks (five from early 2018) for their first payment, with 19% waiting longer than that and 4% waiting ten weeks in late 2017. Research also suggests overall, UC leaves many working families worse off than the old system. That is because payments taper away at 63p for every \u0026pound1 claimants earn. The timetable has also been put back nine times since 2013 after a string of glitches and will only be fully complete in late 2022."},{"url":null,"title":"what princess dianas lover james","story":"NewsWhat Princess Diana\u0027s lover James Hewitt was doing on Prince Harry\u0027s wedding dayFormer army officer James Hewitt spent the day of Prince Harry\u0027s wedding shopping in Exeter\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByIsaac Crowson13:59, 23 MAY 2018NewsThe former army officer shopped at Sainsbury\u0027s in Exeter, the city he lives with his mother in a two-bedroom flat\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailPrincess Diana\u0027s former lover James Hewitt spent Prince Harry\u0027s wedding day doing his weekly shop, it has emerged. The former army officer was never going to be invited to the Windsor event after the scandal of his affair with Harry\u0027s mum. Instead Mr Hewitt, 60, was spotted shopping at Sainsbury\u0027s in Exeter, the city where he lives with his mother Shirley in a two-bedroom flat. He packed beer, wine and food into the back of his Audi, and was smartly dressed in suit trousers, braces and a shirt and tie, suggesting he may have been going to a party to celebrate Harry\u0027s marriage to Meghan Markle.  He was then seen spending the afternoon with a mystery blonde woman in a Devon village 15 miles away, reports Mail Online.   Mr Hewitt has always denied scurrilous rumours he is Prince Harry\u0027s real father. During a frank and candid television interview last year, he was asked directly if he was Prince Harry\u0027s father. Mr Hewitt replied: No, I\u0027m not. Asked why the rumours have persisted for so long, he said: It sells papers. It\u0027s worse for him [Harry] probably, the poor chap. In fact Mr Hewitt and Diana only began their secret affair in 1986 - two years after Harry was born.

The bizarre clip, filmed with a mobile phone by another festival-goer, shows a crowd gathering around the rowdy revelers as punches fly. At first a pink-haired man can be seen wrestling on the ground with a leather thong-clad rival, who is then thumped in the face repeatedly by a third man. As that fight intensifies, another reveler takes on the pink-haired man who attempts to punch back - but then his shorts fall down. Passersby can be seen attempting to break up the scraps and a police officer rides past in a buggy, but the chaos isn\u0027t calmed until an on-site security guard intervenes.  It\u0027s unclear exactly what caused the brawl but towards the end, one of the men can be heard screaming: We gave you a ride b**ch! The two-minute tussle broke out at around 5pm on Sunday at Long Beach Pride Festival in California. The woman who filmed the video, who asked not to be named, said: We were walking away from the Latin tent when there was a loud thud and we saw arms swinging. My jaw dropped when I realised it was a fight. There were these grown men and one had pink hair and when I got closer I saw someone\u0027s butt hanging out.  Then I saw this guy was wearing a thong and there was another gentleman pushing this guy who had the thong - he wasn\u0027t wearing much of anything. He looked like he was going to crack his neck into the van. Then someone said, \u0027I gave you a ride b**ch!\u0027 It was the funniest thing because to get there and park is a hassle and to get an Uber or a Lyft is a hassle too. People were trying to separate them and pull them a part.  I saw one person get punched in the face several times in a row. You would have thought the guys would have been seeing stars by the time it was done but they were so amped up that they just kept going. The brawl was eventually broken up after a few minutes after a guard in a high vis vest stepped in and the crowd dispersed. The woman who filmed the video added: It was absolutely shocking.

She is reported to have gone into the fast food restaurant after a night of partying. The woman is wearing a sheer top and tiny black skirt that is hitched up around her waist. German newspaper Bild said she was filmed in the Majorcan town of Inca at 11am on Sunday. Majorcan newspaper Ultima Hora also carried the picture, linking it to the drunken tourism the island is fighting against. The newspaper also mentioned the party resort Magaluf , which is 29 miles away from Inca. Inca is in the centre of the island and is not a mass tourism hotspot.  Bild claimed the woman was with with two friends and needed the burger as a hangover cure and headlined its article “This is how you ask for a hamburger in Majorca”. It added: “Her already tight skirt has probably slipped over her buttocks.”  It was previously reported how boozy British tourists had been warned to think twice before stripping naked in Magaluf as they could be fined hundreds of pounds. Officials on the Spanish island introduced new laws in 2015 to clean up its image as a wild party town for stag and hen dos and tanked-up teens.  Anyone found committing alcohol-fuelled rowdy acts like balcony hopping, urinating in public and skinny-dipping can now be given an on-the-spot fine. CCTV and police patrols were also beefed up, as well as a ban on drinking in the street between 10pm and 8am, and shops can no longer sell booze after midnight. Anyone found urinating in the street and being naked in public could be made to pay €750 (\u0026pound658). Spanish authorities have been cracking down on unruly behaviour on the streets of Magaluf in recent years.  In April it was reported Magaluf cops have banned a pub crawl by 90 boozy Brits in a clampdown on “uncivic” behaviour. Police said the outing was “totally against” regulations put in place to combat public drunkenness by visitors to the popular tourist island. The bar crawl promised drinking games, an open bar and a bucking bronco for revellers. The group, which was led by two guides from Ireland, was visiting its second pub in the Punta Ballena area of the city when police intervened.

But the Iraqi dictator never boarded the 82-metre (270-foot) Basrah Breeze built for him in 1981 - and its amenities will now be enjoyed by the pilots who guide shipping in and out of the port of Basra, the main southern city.  In common with other treasures left by Saddam, toppled in 2003 during the US-led invasion of Iraq and hanged three years later for crimes against humanity, the governments that succeeded him have been struggling to find a use for the ship.  Since Iraq got it back in 2010 following a court battle and a three-decade odyssey abroad, it has been mostly moored in Basra.    What was it like in Baghdad when Saddam Hussein\u0027s statue was toppled? Defining moment vividly retold   Equipped with a presidential suite comprising Saddam\u0027s private quarters, dining rooms and bedrooms, as well as 17 smaller guest rooms, 18 cabins for crew and a clinic, the opulently equipped and decorated vessel was put on the market for $30 million.  The government failed to find a buyer, and for the past two years the Basrah Breeze has served Basra University, hosting researchers on trips to study marine life.  The presidential yacht is in a very good condition. Its two engines and generators are functioning, said Abdul-Zahra Abdul-Mahdi Saleh, its captain. It only needs periodic maintenance.   But authorities have now decided to moor it permanently as a hotel and recreation facility for the southern port\u0027s pilots, many of whom live in distant cities.   The port needs the boat to be a station where sea pilots can rest, said Basra port spokesman Anmar al-Safi. Built by a Danish shipyard while Iraq was at war with Iran, the yacht was passed on to Saudi Arabia - then a Saddam ally - to protect it from air strikes on Basra, officials giving an exclusive tour said.  The kingdom, which fell out with Saddam after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990, then handed the vessel over to Jordan.  Its subsequent movements were unclear until Iraq tracked it down in the French resort of Nice, where a court seized it and sent it home.  While the Basrah Breeze survived the turmoil of Saddam\u0027s decline and demise, its sister ship al-Mansur - which he also never boarded - suffered a different fate, sinking in the Shatt al-Arab waterway that passes through Basra after it was hit by US planes and then stripped bare in the chaotic aftermath of his overthrow.

The shocking accident was caught on CCTV and shows the young boys going up the moving staircase. The older boy, who looks about three, is standing facing looking back down the escalator as it carries the pair upwards. But even more terrifying is the younger boy, who appears to be aged about one, laying on the steps, with his head facing down the up escalator. The first boy manages to work out how to get off safely, and is waiting the top for the younger boy.  The tot then travels back over the mechanism and gets his fingers trapped in the metal. The older boy spots the danger, and presumably the screams from the toddler and tries to free him. He has no luck and leaves the tot with the escalator still running, to go and find help. Eventually a shopkeeper rushes out and hits the emergency stop button before calling the fire service. The boy was released by firefighters and was taken to hospital, although it is not known if his fingers could be saved.

It wasn’t exactly encouraging.\u0026#8221Mark was 19 when he left Dundee and decided to travel Europe by rail, and it was those experiences that prompted him to write a book, titled Changing Trains.\u0026#8220The main character in the story is Sam, but much of it is based on my own experiences travelling alone in Europe in 1985,\u0026#8221 he said.\u0026#8220I’m a big fan of the novelist Christopher Isherwood, whose books formed the basis for the film Cabaret.\u0026#8220My title is a nod to his book Mr Norris Changes Trains.\u0026#8220Isherwood’s Fraulein Schroeder is remembered in my book as Madame Gilbert and all the young female characters that Sam encounters in my book kind of collectively represent Isherwood’s Sally Bowles.\u0026#8221\u0026#8220When I travelled across Europe in 1985, we were still in the cold war era \u0026#8211 weird to think we could heading that way again now \u0026#8211 and it was pre-Shengen, so I had to go through border controls as I entered and left each country and there was no euro at this point, so I had to get my head around constantly changing my currencies \u0026#8211 pounds to francs to pesetas to lira. This is all described in the book, and I have a little fun with it.\u0026#8221Mark began writing the book in 2010, while he was travelling between his work in London and a small house in France.\u0026#8220I’m a huge fan of Ian Fleming’s James Bond stories and when I travelled to places like Paris, Monte Carlo, Venice and the French Riviera \u0026#8211 all places that have appeared in Fleming’s novels \u0026#8211 it really felt like you were in the world of Bond, so I play with this a bit too,\u0026#8221 he said.\u0026#8220And when I went Interrailing, I travelled \u0026#8211 as everyone did back then \u0026#8211 with a number of compilation tapes for my Walkman, so the soundtrack to the book is also very 80s.\u0026#8220Everything from Duran Duran’s Bond theme ‘A View to a Kill’ to Simple Minds’ Glittering Prize album. Fab music.\u0026#8221The story starts in Dundee, and Mark said it was central to the story of Sam\u0026#8217s journey from uncertain, undecided small-town boy to a modern, outward-looking European with a sense of direction in his life.\u0026#8220Once the main character Sam has left Dundee and is discovering new cities like Paris, Barcelona and Monte Carlo, he often compares them with his origins.

Sometimes you just have to look after yourself, make sure you give your team the best chance to go and win a game by making saves when you need to.“All I did really in that Partick game was do my job.“I conceded a goal which is very annoying because I just want to keep clean sheets – that’s what goalkeepers are built on.“I wasn’t happy about that but, overall, it was a pleasing performance for myself.”And Ferrie did impress, making timely saves as well as commanding his area with Partick quickly putting the rookie keeper under pressure from the off.An early save that saw him claw an Adam Barton header out of the top corner set him on his way and, although he couldn’t stop Kris Doolan poking in the winner, he was happy with this performance.On that Barton header: “It had me worried when it was looping over me! I was thinking ‘oh, no, it’s looping, it’s looping, please get there!’“I managed to just get there and then, after that, there was a corner and with a young keeper they were going to put it on me. That’s what anyone does with a young keeper, and I got a good punch on it.“I felt that was important because it meant they maybe didn’t put it on me as much. I found in the second half they didn’t. The crosses were a bit further out, which was good.“Teams might look at that because I’m maybe not as big as other goalkeepers. I’m 6ft 1in but it doesn’t matter, you just have to be dominant and you get yourself out for crosses.“I’ve always tried to do that because I always think if you attack it 100% you can get there even if they are six foot seven or eight.“If you want that ball more than them then you can go get it.”His displays in training and for the successful U/20 side, saw him handed another year’s deal by Dundee and Ferrie is determined to make the most of the chance he’s been given.He added: “It was good to get that signed, get secure for next year knowing I can come back and work 100% again to make sure that gets me as far as I can go.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2017/10/SMac_Invertay_House_Maule_Monifieth17100501.jpg-846x564.jpg ","title":"fresh hope of building facility for local community","story":"\t\t\t\t\tPlans to build a new community centre in the local area could be back on the table.The Monifieth Community Resource Group (MCRG) suffered a huge setback in March when a £1 million request to the Big Lottery Fund to refurbish Invertay House was rejected.The former school building was earmarked to be turned into a multi- purpose centre to hold sports and community events.Angus Council had most recently used the premises to process benefit inquiries, but agreed to the community asset transfer in August last year.Jean Lee, chairwoman of MCRG, said: “Before Invertay House was declared surplus to requirements by Angus Council, and we began the whole process, we had done a huge amount of work on the potential development of a community hub on land beside the Blue Seaway.\u0026#8220We were at the stage of being ready to apply to the Big Lottery for funding. Our plans were well advanced and we were very enthusiastic about them.“However, the decision was made to shelve those plans and pursue the option of Invertay House because it was accepted it had always been first choice of building by the community.”However, £2m was needed to realise the ambition, and with the Big Lottery grant application having been turned down, the MCRG is now considering the previous plan to build a brand new facility in the Blue Seaway park area, near to the waterfront, in conjunction with Monifieth Athletic FC.Jean said: “The Blue Seaway option is now again our best option.“We can have a fit-for-purpose building in a magnificent setting – a building that provides for local groups, community events and individuals who just want to have somewhere to socialise, an activities space that will ensure the viability of the whole community project.“Monifieth needs this building and we are ready again to start work on making it happen. We have had very positive preliminary discussions with Monifieth Athletic to take this forward as a joint project.“They had ambitions to create a sports hub down at the riverfront and we had always shared the understanding that we would support them in this ambition after we had secured our community centre. To ensure that Monifieth gets the best that’s possible we will work together in the spirit of joint compromise.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/5b03e9f0f1800-846x564.jpg ","title":"hero bouncer pulled keys from car as boozy motorist tried to drive off from dundee pub","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA hero doorman chased a drunk driver along a Dundee street and stopped his car — pulling the keys from him to stop him from driving away.The security guard was worried Silviu Palade, 33, would cause an accident and injure people as he was driving on the wrong side of the road and weaving from side to side as he travelled along King Street and on to Fort Street in Broughty Ferry.The doorman leapt into action on Sunday after he saw Palade driving away from the pub he had been drinking in.A roadside breath test revealed Palade was more than six times the legal limit, however he failed to provide further breath tests at police HQ, Dundee Sheriff Court heard.He pleaded guilty to failing to provide two specimens of breath at police HQ on Monday.Fiscal depute Laura Bruce told the court Palade had walked out of the Eagle Inn pub and witnesses saw him going towards a car, getting in and driving away along King Street on the wrong side of the street.She said he then turned the car around and drove back towards the pub and the witnesses, including the doorman, realised the car was all over the road. They started to chase after the car in case he injured someone and the bouncer told him to give him the keys.Police were called and Palade disappeared, however when police attended, he returned with a spare set of keys and tried to get into his car and start it up.Officers prevented him from doing so and a roadside breath test showed a reading of 134 mics. He was then taken to Bell Street HQ but would not agree to provide two further specimens of breath and would not provide any explanation, Mrs Bruce said.Solicitor Nicola Brown told the court Palade had “panicked” when told what the roadside breath test reading was and had failed to provide further tests.She said in terms of the driving offence, he had driven about 300 metres.Ms Brown said he had gone to the pub for a drink with a colleague but ended up consuming far more than he had intended and had foolishly decided to move his car away from the restricted parking area he was in to avoid getting a parking ticket the following day.She said he intended to sell the car to pay for any fine that was imposed.Sheriff Alastair Carmichael fined Palade £800 and banned him from driving for 16 months. The sheriff rejected the crown’s motion for forfeiture of the vehicle.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/5b03ea61a9b1d-846x564.jpg ","title":"locals blame overflowing bins for creating rat haven near busy dundee nightspot","story":"\t\t\t\t\tResidents have voiced their disgust about overflowing bins that have attracted “massive” rats to their neighbourhood.Seabraes Lane in the West End has been described as a “haven” for vermin, with rats seen just yards away from people’s homes.Several students who live in the block said the issue had been ongoing for several months.Items including sanitary items, rotten food and pizza boxes are discarded on the ground beside eight wheelie bins.The mess is just yards away from eateries and bars along Perth Road.Signs have been erected by tenants at the block requesting that the communal close door is closed at all times.One of the sign states that there are “massive rats outside the building” and urges people to report the matter to Dundee City Council.Rachel Stubbs, 21, a business student, said she had reported the issue to the local authority.She said: “As far as I’m aware, the rubbish is collected once every four weeks.“I sent a complaint in about the matter because it is vile.“People usually walk down the footpath towards Tesco Riverside and I think they are scared they are going to see more vermin.“We’ve placed some signs urging people to recycle as much as possible and close the doors to prevent rats coming into the building.”Another resident, who declined to be named, said a rat roughly the length of a “school ruler” was basking in the sun just yards away from her window.She said: “We saw the rat at the weekend.“My flatmate took a picture of it and someone else saw a dead rat lying in one of the parking bays beside the bins.“The area is a haven for vermin at the moment.”Law student Hannah Paterson, 20, said the ongoing rubbish situation had put her off renewing her lease.She said: “There are about five students in each flat and there simply aren’t enough bins to cope with the demand – we need Eurobins.”A council spokeswoman said: “We are looking into this.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/5b02998d05dab-854x564.jpg ","title":"return of james keatings gives dundee united early fitness boost","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee United have been handed an early fitness boost for next season by the return to action of James Keatings.The attacker delayed his summer break to take part in youth coach Dave Bowman’s charity match against a team of fans at Tannadice on Friday night.It was the first time since January he’d kicked a ball in anger and leaves him on course to be ready for the start of pre-season training next month.The man who won promotion from the Championship with Hamilton, Hearts and Hibs was seen as a key signing when he joined after leaving the Hibees last summer.However, the first season of a two-year deal was ruined by a catalogue of injuries.Early in the campaign he was sidelined by an ankle problem and he hasn’t played since being forced out by a groin condition in January.That led to surgery but, in recent weeks, he has been building his fitness and has now reached the stage where he can resume playing.Also turning out for the United greats team on Friday was Craig Easton, with whom talks over a youth coaching role at Tannadice are continuing.Easton taking charge of the development of the club’s young talent remains very much on the cards.The 39-year-old was himself a product of United’s youth policy and went on to make more than 200 appearances for the club before continuing his career with Livingston and then a string of lower division clubs south of the border.Once his playing days were over, he did some coaching in England and, for the past two years, has been in charge of the youths at Raith Rovers. United, meanwhile, are continuing to hold talks with a long list of signing targets for next term.Dunfermline pair Nicky Clark and Fraser Aird could be fixed up this week.And Celtic youngster Sam Wardrop is also expected to join what will be a new-look squad.The 20-year-old played against United last season during a loan spell at Dumbarton that saw him make 27 appearances.United now know all

proud of stints at both dundee and united but focus is now on hibs","story":"\t\t\t\t\tSought-after Simon Murray’s future will not be decided until July at the very earliest.And while the striker, who’s just finished a loan spell at Dundee, is extremely flattered by interest from the other side of Tannadice Street, his first choice is to remain at parent club Hibs.Murray is currently enjoying his summer break but is well aware of speculation linking him with a return to first full-time employers Dundee United.Beaten Scottish Cup finalists Motherwell are also known to be considering a summer move for him and, dating back to his time at United, several clubs in Europe have monitored his progress.As recently as Dundee’s victory over St Johnstone last month, one sent their chief scout to update their file on him.For the 26-year-old, however, the next piece of business he aims to be involved in is a battle to re-establish himself at Easter Road.“I am contracted to Hibs for another year and, although I spent the second half of the season on loan at Dundee, my aim has always been to go back there.“I still finished the season top scorer for them and, even when I went to Dundee in January, the plan was always to go back.“At the time I spoke to Neil Lennon and he stressed whether or not I went was entirely down to me.“I could have stayed and he would have considered me for selection but really the move came up because Anthony Stokes had left and they needed a No 10.“They wanted Scott Allan and the only way the deal was going to be done was if I went to Dundee, so the gaffer did say to me I would be back in the summer.“He’s told me I can stake a claim for a place in the team next season and I know, if he says that, he means it, because he’s very honest with me.”Should things not work out in his second season at Hibs, Murray will look at his situation.“Obviously, if they sign another striker or decide to go another way I’ll have to think about what happens next, so it is good to know other clubs are interested. If it doesn’t work out, the only person I will blame is myself but I feel the move to Dundee has been good for me because it’s got me a lot more Premiership experience.”He admits had the loan interest at the turn of the year been from someone other than Dundee, there’s a fair chance he would have opted to stay put.“A lot’s been said about me being a Dundee fan and that was a factor.“More important was it was a move that wasn’t going to involve me having to get used to a new city or league.“I stayed at my mum’s when I was back up and I already knew some of the boys, so it was easy to settle in. I’m not saying I wouldn’t have gone somewhere else but all that made it an easier choice to come.”And, as a proud Dundonian, Murray admits the fact he’s joined a select band of players to have worn dark blue and tangerine is pleasing.“I will look back at the end of my career and be proud I played for Dundee and United. While I’m a Dundee fan, even before I was at United I was never one who didn’t want them to do well.“I always went to see both teams and I still do. I’m a football fan and I want to see both sides from my city doing well.“Now I’ve got a United connection, they are a club I will always have a lot of time for.“They were the team that gave me my chance in the game full-time and I’m grateful for that.“I still know a lot of people there and they are very good people who I respect a lot.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/5b03eb105ae54.jpg ","title":"zimbabwe international striker macauley bonne tops dundee wishlist","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee are in the hunt for a goalscorer and Leyton Orient marksman Macauley Bonne is top of their wishlist.The Zimbabwe international scored 25 goals for the National League side last season, sparking the Dark Blues interest.Born in Ipswich, Bonne started his career at Colchester United, where he played with current Dundee midfielder Glen Kamara briefly, before loans at Lincoln City and Woking.It’s been at Brisbane Road, however, where he’s shone, smashing in 22 league goals last season.With a year remaining on his current deal there, a fee will be required to prise him from Orient and that could be a sticking point with the non-league side holding out for six figures.With Shrewsbury, Portsmouth and Burton Albion all interested, too, Dundee have fierce competition to land the 22-year-old striker.Orient are also keen to keep him on a longer contract but a mid-table finish in the National League is unlikely to have been enough to keep him amid interest from other clubs.Dens gaffer Neil McCann highlighted a lack of killer instinct in his side throughout last season, something he is determined to rectify this summer with a proven goalscorer.With money in the bank from the January sale of defender Jack Hendry, Dundee have the funds behind them to strengthen that area of the team.And having already raided the English non-league for Roarie Deacon last summer and Elton Ngwatala last week, Neil is hoping he can attract another National League star to come north of the border.\t\t\t"},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7486028.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the

It also set up groups to help tackle loneliness and social isolation.Run as a voluntary not-for-profit organisation, it has experienced dwindling funding over recent years from various sources including Highland Council,Part-time development manager Catherine MacNeil \u0026ndash whose hours were reduced last year as another employee was made redundant in a bid to keep it going \u0026ndash said the organisation was no longer viable as it could no longer meet the annual running costs of about \u0026pound30,000.Its main venue, the Bike Shed in Grant Street, will now be used as a community coffee shop and social hub in a venture involving the Methodist Church and King\u0027 Fellowship.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\"It is sad but at the same time some of the groups we set up still exist and the Bike Shed is still there as a resource, so there may be an opportunity for individuals to pick up the mantle and run with projects,\" Ms MacNeil said.\"I think some groups will manage to continue such as Merkinch Men\u0027 Shed and the Blazing Needles knitting group, but I don\u0026rsquot think there will be new developments in the same way.\"She added she believed it unlikely the summer arts festival would go ahead, having also been cancelled last year.\"There isn\u0026rsquot the funding to make it happen,\" she said. \"That is a huge loss.\"It was so good in terms of profiling the area and bringing in young children as well as providing a platform for so many artists in the area.\"\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspShe said it was particularly sad coming within one year of the death of founder member Bette McArdle, a former editor of the Highland News Group and keen advocate of access to arts for all.Merkinch Community Council chairman Dell McClurg said Arts in Merkinch would be greatly missed and felt it was the loss of another service for a neighbourhood which is continuing to grow, with more homes being planned.\"I think it is quite important to keep these things going,\" she said. They are building more, which means more people and more children.\"Wednesday 23 May 2018 4:36 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04099000/04099466.jpg","title":"More money for city centre heritage work","story":"\u0026nbspNEW funding is set to allow Inverness to continue improving the city centre landscape beyond 2020.The Highland capital is to receive a further \u0026pound250,000 for heritage-led regeneration, on top of \u0026pound1.25 million committed for 2015-20 through Historic Environment Scotland\u0027 City Heritage Trust programme.That cash has been concentrated largely on improving Academy Street as part of the Townscape Heritage Project, as well as helping fund some of the refurbishment work carried out at the Town House.As well as improving the look of some of the city centre\u0027 most important buildings the project also aims to create jobs and new training opportunities and to leverage additional funding from other sources.Councillor Jimmy Gray, chairman of Inverness City Heritage Trust which administers the funding and recently announced backing for the Cairngorm Brewery\u0027 efforts to revitalise the former AI Welders building in Academy Street, said: \"We very much welcome the ongoing funding support from HES for Historic Building Repair projects here in Inverness.\"At present our focus will remain on Academy Street for the delivery of the Townscape Heritage project.\"This additional funding will allow us to take a strategic partnership approach to the repair and protection of the wider historic built heritage of Inverness beyond 2020.\"Alex Paterson, chief executive of HES, said: \"Through schemes such as City Heritage Trust funding, organisations best placed to understand local needs have the opportunity to not only improve the condition and quality of their local historic environment, but align projects to deliver the best possible outcomes in their communities.\"We want to ensure more of the money we spend is directed by communities themselves \u0026ndash by the individuals and organisations who know best how to tackle the issues affecting their communities and harnessing the energy of local people.
