Tom Jenkins has been taking an enforced break from action photography and pursuing a different kind of vision in his gardenI have never appreciated my back garden so much.At this time of year, I’m usually caught up with all the to-ings and fro-ings of the sporting world: taking photos of traditional spring events like the Boat Race and Grand National, or key matches as the football season builds to a crescendo. Normally I’m away a lot, not really passing an eye over developments in my garden. But this is not a normal year.It was mid-March, and I was sitting despondently in my tiny postage stamp of a garden. The previous week I had photographed the Cheltenham festival, an event I associate with the end of winter, spring coming, the light getting better. A chance to look ahead to a summer of sport, going to events that I love. But this year, the festival had felt all wrong – more like a dangerous party on the eve of war. It seemed all around me the news was harrowing, and sport was getting hammered as event after event was cancelled. My world had suddenly been turned upside-down.I realised then that I had to reframe and refocus. With all my normal avenues for taking pictures closed off, I needed to find something else. I recalled the words of Ed Jackson, a former professional rugby player whose portrait I had taken exactly a year earlier. After suffering an awful accident that had left him partially paralysed, he had developed a mental process to cope with his new situation: focus on what’s in front of you, focus on things you can affect, and try to forget what’s out of your control.Remembering this, I looked round the edge of the tiny piece of lawn and noticed some tulip bulbs that my wife had planted in terracotta pots. Lush green leaves with buds full of promise had emerged from the soil, ready to bloom. In these plants, I saw hope. I saw normality.It occurred to me then that this process of growth and positivity deserved to be documented. Despite the global madness, nature was thriving – and these tulips seemed to be begging me to tell their story. To me, photography is more than just a career: it is my passion, and in these flowers I found the perfect opportunity to take pictures without leaving my home.To test myself, I decided not to use any of my main professional cameras. These are more used to the hurly-burly of sport, all fast focusing and speedy motor-drive. Instead, I turned to what I call my “holiday camera”, an upmarket point-and-shoot that I take away on trips with the family (the last thing I want on holiday is to be surrounded by items associated with work, many of which are heavy). Light, easy to manoeuvre around the plants, and – most crucially – able to focus close-up, this small camera actually turned out to be perfect for this project.As the sun moved round the garden during the day, backgrounds became dark and shadows on the flowers created gorgeous patterns. I would note which times were best to photograph certain plants, and would periodically drop whichever household task I was doing (much to the irritation of my family) to race to the garden and catch the flowers in the perfect light.Like all photographers, I look to light as another tool in the box, an opportunity to create something different. By varying angles, I could make petals look like paper, tightly bunched flower heads look like lips. Going in tight, I attempted to show the beauty of the flowers in a surreal way. The warm spring sunshine of the last few weeks had not only ushered the tulips into full bloom but enhanced their colour and vibrancy, so some of my photographs gained an almost unearthly quality.I’ve never felt so lucky to have my garden, this tiny oasis in densely crowded north London. In the land of quarantine, my house has never felt more like a castle, defending me from the warzone outside the front gate. In that castle, my garden is the green inner sanctum, a place of peace and tranquillity.As I sit here now, in the sunshine, I hear birdsong and the rustling of leaves, with the chirruping of children playing wafting in on the breeze. The sky above my head is free from planes and pollution and a brilliant blue. The sun, bright and sharp at this time of year, makes everything look crisp. In times like these, we remember that nature truly is life-affirming, and the simple act of flowers growing means so much. It shows that in an abnormal world, normality is king."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/59bbe22446bd4dc259837bbeec20fe9d6da3bd21/0_0_6235_4162/master/6235.jpg?width=1010\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=317cfa6164deb948bcbac7dcee9db2a4 1010w","title":"look no people sydney seen from the air during coronavirus lockdown in pictures","story":"Getty photographers Cameron Spencer and Ryan Pierse take to the skies to capture the sights of Australia’s biggest city during the Covid-19 pandemic.

While Evans’s aim was to present a snapshot of contemporary practice, it’s clear from her introduction that she wasn’t holding out for consensus. In fact, she suggested, the art world was currently in the middle of a series of all-encompassing “battles” between “Hampstead, Bloomsbury, surrealist, abstract, social realist, Spain, Germany, heaven, hell, paradise, chaos, light, dark, round, square”.Evans’s breathless list was meant to be playful, but she was making a serious point. Within the broad church of modernism, you could find the cool abstract grids of Piet Mondrian, the increasingly politically engaged style of Picasso or, more recently, the curve ball of surrealism, as represented by Salvador Dalí and his lobster telephone. What made the struggle for dominance more intense is that much of it was being played out within a few streets around Hampstead and neighbouring Belsize Park in north-west London.It wasn’t simply that British artists including Henry Moore and Nash had piled into NW3, attracted by cheap studio space and good northern light. It was that the area was increasingly home to distinguished émigrés, driven out of Europe by the Nazis’ conviction that modernism’s machine-tooled, mass-produced aesthetic was the product of a covert communism. Following the closure of the Bauhaus in 1933, many of the influential art school’s faculty, including Walter Gropius, Marcel Breuer and László Moholy-Nagy had taken refuge in the Isokon building, a sleek new residential complex on Lawn Road in Hampstead that was the closest that British architecture ever got to the modernist ideal of “a machine for living”.Above all, Evans understood that the current culture wars involved not just ideologies and manifestos but flesh-and-blood people. She knew all about the drunken japes, open marriages, shabby accommodation, ecstatic assignations and slow wars of attrition through which art got made in the 1930s. An affair with another painter, for instance, might bring someone towards a new way of seeing, while a feud with a flatmate could result in a sculptor’s violent change of direction. Artists continued to produce work in the midst of babies arriving, holiday leases being taken, motor cars giving up the ghost, savings running dry. And it is this human story – or rather these stories – that Caroline Maclean delivers in this hugely enjoyable and well-plotted book.A good place to start is with Evans herself, quite possibly the only bona fide Hampstead native in this story. As a clever Oxford undergraduate she had admired the published art criticism of a young unknown painter called John Piper. Invited by friends for a weekend on the Suffolk coast – then, as now, an outpost of north London – Evans was picked up at the station by a fellow house guest who took her straight to the beach for a swim. He turned out to be Piper and they lived happily ever after, at least once he’d obtained a orce from his painter wife who was already in love with someone else. Modernist life, unlike its art, never ran in straight lines.Together and separately John and Myfanwy Piper worked through the implications of the move towards pure form that they witnessed in the work of contemporaries including Barbara Hepworth, Ben Nicholson and Nash. The Pipers worried that their erstwhile friends’ lofty, depersonalised approach to object and image-making actually constituted a political dereliction in these increasingly desperate times. In The Painter’s Object, Myfanwy included a reproduction of Picasso’s Guernica, which violently depicts the destruction of humanity by aerial bombardment during the Spanish civil war. Its brilliant horror was enough to nudge John Piper away from abstraction and towards a figuration of ordinary, everyday things, which he now reported seeing with a new intensity. Where once Piper’s landscapes had been as spare as an architect’s plans, now they bristled with churches, trees and monuments – all those dear sights that would soon be at risk of wartime obliteration.More topsy-turvy is the story of Hepworth and Nicholson – how the sculptor and the painter met when married to other people and how they tried their best, as civilised people (not to mention positive-minded Christian Scientists), to avoid causing emotional pain. Inevitably, however, their inability to take decisive action resulted in extra suffering all round. Nicholson’s discarded wife Winifred behaved like “an absolute dear”, according to Barbara, who suggested that the two women should live together and welcome periodic visits from the man whom they both loved. Nicholson, conveniently, believed that as long as he stayed true to his own desires then happiness would automatically follow for everyone else.Despite all the comings and goings, all three artists found time to practise their tennis, with Winifred perfecting what Ben called “a very pretty stroke”. What really threw a ner in the works was the birth of triplets to Ben and Barbara in 1934. This was the sort of corporeal reality that abstract artists might find difficult to absorb. Who was going to look after the babies while Ben developed his “constructivist” painting and Barbara concentrated on her pebble-smooth sculptures? The nanny, of course. One of the happier results of the flatlined economy of the 1930s was that there was always a “local girl” around whether you were in Hampstead or St Ives, to mop floors and wipe noses.Circles and Squares is a skilful work of synthesis, which draws on the piles of biographies that already exist of the principals and supporting players. Given the huge cast of characters, it is perhaps inevitable that there are times when the narrative starts to sound like a boho court circular, an endless list of who has left for the south of France and who has turned up for dinner. But Maclean never forgets that ordinary life matters too. Someone takes the No 24 bus into town, while Jack Pritchard, co-designer of the Isokon building, quarrels with his architectural partner Wells Coates over where the bins are to go.• Circles and Squares: The Lives and Art of the Hampstead Modernists is published by Bloomsbury (RRP £30)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/11dcfefa08efaf3cfd68b5b68d019815f8edd32c/0_31_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ccde22bc0193925a18d03825f4950731","title":"little eyes by samanta schweblin review timely visions of a virtual reality","story":"Strangers connect in this artful exploration of solitude and empathy in a globalised worldEvery technological innovation both changes its human users and uncovers something new about our nature. In this ingenious novel, Argentinian author Samanta Schweblin conducts an unnerving thought experiment: if an inidual could be virtually inserted into the life of a random stranger, anywhere in the world, what effects would that have on them both? And what hidden truths would be revealed?Little Eyes follows her gripping 2017 novella Fever Dream, a destabilising parable about GM farming and maternal anxiety, and a story collection of domestic surrealism, Mouthful of Birds all three books have been long- or shortlisted for the International Booker. In her new novel the gadget that’s sweeping the globe is called a kentuki. It’s not much more, says one character, than “a cell phone with legs”, but the camera and speaker are housed within the felt-covered, remotely propelled body of a toy animal – rabbit or panda, dragon or crow, the buyer or “keeper” decides. What the keeper can’t choose is who the “dweller” connecting with the robot and watching online is, while dwellers have no control over where, and with whom, they “wake up”. As with a human life, the stakes are high there is one connection per kentuki, one mind per body. When the keeper destroys their pet or forgets to charge its batteries, or the dweller disconnects, it’s game over, no replays. If death is what gives life reality, the life of a kentuki is real.Schweblin familiarises the reader by artful degrees, introducing us to dwellers and keepers around the world, all reacting differently to the new gizmos. For Emilia in Peru, globalisation has meant profound loss her grown-up son has been “snatched away” to Hong Kong for a glittering career. When he gives her a connection, she turns on her computer and wakes up in a flat in Germany, where she enjoys being a pet bunny for a young woman: attention at last, and day-to-day intimacy. In Mexico, purposeless Alina finds herself choosing between a crow and a dragon for “the miraculous distraction” of unboxing a new product. In Antigua, a stifled little boy called Marvin who is grieving for his mother wakes up at the top of the globe and goes looking for snow: “At least in this other life, he wouldn’t let himself be locked up.” Italian Enzo falls into easy companionship with the mole that follows him around his greenhouse. And the consequences of capitalism never stop evolving: in Zagreb Grigor starts a business buying and tending connections through multiple tablets, so he can offer tailor-made experiences to those who want more consumer choice than the market officially offers.There has always been a tinge of horror to Schweblin’s work, and here she gets full effect from violent interludes where the connections go sour. That hoary staple of an inanimate object coming alive can be just as frightening when you’ve paid for it to happen – even, or perhaps especially, when it’s a cuddly panda rolling closer with unknown intent. But as she works through the implications of her premise in a nimble, fast-moving narrative, what’s most impressive is the way she foregrounds her characters’ inner hopes and fears.The kentuki can hear and translate speech, but only respond with animal-appropriate squeaks or purrs, so the first issue is always communication: whether dweller and keeper will connect in the wider world. For Alina, the relationship is about control. She wants to keep her crow as nothing more than a toy, but gradually it becomes the conduit and eventually target for her rage and shame. Marvin finds he has more power and agency when negotiating the world as a kentuki: “Marvin was no longer a boy with a dragon he was a dragon with a boy inside him.” When the characters happen by chance to glimpse their kentuki selves, they feel an overwhelming tenderness for the ball of plastic and felt that is the vessel for their consciousness. In a disassociated world, they are seeing themselves at last.Like Mohsin Hamid’s Exit West, in which magical doors act as portals out of conflict zones, Little Eyes has much to say about connection and empathy in a globalised world. On a personal level, its investigation into solitude and online experience becomes only more poignant in a global lockdown. Marvin has never seen snow he longs to roll his little dragon into an untouched snowbank, to leave his mark. It would be “just like touching the other end of the world with your own fingertips”. If a virtual reality is all we can have, we will still reach out to explore its limits.• Little Eyes by Samanta Schweblin, translated by Megan McDowell, is published by Oneworld (RRP £14.99).

Yet when we step out into the real world, everything seems more vivid to them “There’s a ghost fish called Hank in Bora Bora,” said my daughter, finding me in the kitchen after a morning spent on screens.“Fiction or non-fiction?” I said. We bring this question, previously raised by the librarian at my girls’ kindergarten, to every hideous video they watch. It makes me feel slightly better about the whole school of YouTube.“Non-fiction?” she said, and after a long pause, “what’s Bora Bora?”Over five weeks of lockdown, my kids’ daily screen time has crept up, along with the age bracket of the stuff that they’re watching. Gone are the days of endless slime videos and Ryan’s Toys. Now it’s hours of Minecraft and Roblox. YouTube is largely out. TikTok is in. I try to filter the content as much as I can, but at five years old, they’re definitely getting a crash course in tween culture. “You’re the worst,” yelled one the other day – it was like a rehearsal of the slammed doors to come.There are various tricks I perform to make myself feel better about all this – chiefly persuading myself that there’s no other way to occupy two five-year-olds and get any work done. I tell myself that, as kids, we all watched uninterrupted hours of TV and still managed to read books and go to college. I remind myself of those parents who severely limit their kids’ screen time and are, invariably, the same fusspot parents who make their kids go to bed early in the holidays and are one step away from making them wear school uniforms at the weekend.And not all of the screen stuff is as bad as it seems. Minecraft, along with Block Craft and its other versions, is less passive than the baby video stuff. You can build and explore. You can get killed by a zombie, or run away from a wolf. In Roblox, a seemingly infinite series of digital worlds, my kids can be in the same game at once, and when I hear them chatting and strategising I breathe a sigh of relief.I’m trying to hold various lines. I won’t pay for in-game accessories, no matter how hard they beg. And after we’ve done a long day at the coalface, there are no screens in the evening. Being inside and online all day has also changed the way we experience the material world. At the weekend, after spending the best part of the week in our apartment, we go out for a walk and the effect is amazing.The sky is insanely blue. The world, as Louis MacNeice put it, is “suddener than we fancy it”. You’d think my kids had never seen colour before. All of us stand, rapt, before a bank of red tulips, while I take a stab at remembering how pollination works. The online world looks suddenly very shallow and dim, and I’m reminded that misinformation exists IRL, too. Later, my daughter looks at me expectantly after the question about Bora Bora. “It’s in a country called Afghanistan,” I say with confidence."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf1a36baa39618ff768e20c8dca59400aebac92b/0_339_6329_3797/master/6329.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6a0c5d97ece2e5f8bfec8f635f3fd89e","title":"coronavirus exposed china history racism africans guangzhou","story":"Today Africans in Guangzhou are being demonised over Covid-19, but the roots of this prejudice go back centuries“Clean up the foreign trash!”. “Don’t turn our hometown into an international rubbish dump.” “This is China, not Nigeria!” Resembling the anti-migrant racist hatred you frequently see on UK social media, these are just a few examples of countless anti-African rants from Weibo users in China in a surge of popular racism over the past month.Despite the huge amount of censorship on China’s social media, none of these posts have been removed. Migrants from sub-Saharan Africa have become the primary target of suspicion, racial discrimination and abuse amid public fear of a second wave of Covid-19. And this intolerance has peaked in Guangzhou, a city of 12 million people in the highly industrialised Guangdong province.It started with the local government in Guangzhou implementing surveillance, conducting compulsory testing and enforcing a 14-day quarantine for all African nationals – even if they had earlier been tested negative and hadn’t recently travelled outside China. In Yuexiu district, the largest African migrant community in China, many Africans were evicted by landlords – despite having paid their rents – and left to sleep rough on the streets.In an echo of apartheid South Africa or segregation-era United States, a colour bar was imposed across the city: Africans were refused entry by hospitals, hotels, supermarkets, shops and food outlets. At one hospital, even a pregnant woman was denied access. In a department store, an African woman was stopped at the entrance while her white friend was allowed in. In a McDonald’s restaurant, a notice was put up saying “black people cannot come in”. The widespread racism has caused a huge public outcry across Africa, shared on social media under the hashtag #ChinaMustExplain. YouTuber Wode Maya, who has lived in China and is a fluent Mandarin speaker, urges fellow Africans to “wake up to what’s happening”. The global African diaspora has put pressure on African embassies and institutions to act. Last weekend the Kenyan government announced plans to allow its citizens stranded in China to be evacuated.The official Chinese responses were at first silence or denial. State media such as Global Times and Xinhua failed to report the story in the first few days after the news broke in African news outlets. Later, the Chinese authorities began to recognise the reports of racism as “reasonable concerns”, though migrants continue to feel unsafe.The ideology of “race” in China goes back a long way. In the late 19th century, Qing imperial reformers searched for an “answer” that could revive China in face of European and Japanese colonialist expansion. “Race”, “nation” and nationalism have since been embedded into Chinese republicanism in the early 20th century, and then into the establishment of the Chinese Communist party.Nationalism has taken deeper root in the four decades since Deng Xiaoping’s economic reforms. National revival has been a key ideological driver behind modernisation. Today, assimilationism is at the centre of the concept of nation. Minzu, a key term used interchangeably for both ethnic group and nationality, refers to a group of common descent, with a distinct culture and territory.In 2012, Xi Jinping began his rule by saying: “The China dream gathers Chinese aspirations and wishes for generations and manifests the interests of the whole Chinese nation (zhonghua minzu) …” The “China dream” became the political-economic programme for “the realisation of the great revival of the Chinese nation”.China’s growing presence brought with it labour migration from African countries from the late 1990s. People from Nigeria, Mali, Kenya, Senegal, Ghana and other west African countries came for work opportunities, mostly in the metropolis of Guangzhou. Many work in the city’s wholesale markets as other types of employment, including factory work, are closed to them. It’s commonly said by them that Africans are often “accepted as traders but discriminated against as people”. There are currently more than 15,000 African migrants with formal immigration status living in Guangzhou.The Covid-19 crisis has highlighted this longstanding anti-African racism. With all the damage this pandemic has done to the economy and people’s livelihoods, scapegoating and hostility towards an imagined outside threat clearly helps to ert domestic frustration away from the ruling elite – a trend we are all seeing worldwide. As Asian communities in Europe and the United States become victims of racism during this pandemic, Africans in China are crying out, “We are not the virus!” To resist racism, we need to see it for what it is, wherever it occurs.• Hsiao-Hung Pai is a journalist and the author of Scattered Sand: The Story of China’s Rural Migrants"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7150cca54a34b714ca9ec9a9655cc7f5fb10f09/0_5_1654_994/master/1654.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d4ee23f8be2b01c090b97f548404f269","title":"the art of lockdown musicians comedians and more on their isolation culture picks","story":"Lauren from Chvrches, George the Poet, Shura and more on how they’ve been entertaining themselves, from rewatching the Coen brothers to folding knickers1.

In Scotland, the government has announced a £5m package of emergency financial support.The NUS has called on the government to supply a £60 million hardship fund that would provide students with a “safety net” during the coronavirus lockdown. The NUS also demanded that universities reimburse students’ tuition fees and allow them to retake the year to make up for the disruption to their degrees.This has been echoed by cross-party MPs, who have asked the chancellor to set up emergency maintenance grants for those who are not entitled to claim universal credit.Lily Taylor, a master’s student at Sheffield Hallam University, lives off £90 a week after being furloughed from her bar job, along with her savings that will run out soon. “The hardest part is having no space to study,” she says. “In the house I rent we have a high-up dining table with stools. I have a bad back after an accident a couple of years ago and I can’t sit here for longer than 20 minutes without it being a strain.”Taylor tried asking her university if it could supply her with a desk chair. She was told to apply for the university’s hardship fund, but says her application was denied. “I’m stuck on my own in Sheffield, 160 miles away from my friends and family, and I’m worried about how I’m going to be able to complete my dissertation.”Sheffield Hallam has launched a crowdfunding appeal to raise money for struggling students after its usual hardship fund was overwhelmed by requests from students as a result of the pandemic.Similar measures have been announced by the University of York and the University of Greenwich. Greenwich has also offered free laptops and broadband for students and staff, while students at the University of Loughborough can request free meals if they are struggling to cope financially while stranded on campus.But students will need to meet certain eligibility criteria to receive support. Sophie Cartwright, a master’s student, applied for the University of Birmingham’s hardship fund after losing her income from three part-time jobs. Although she comes from a single-parent, lower socioeconomic background, she says she doesn’t meet requirements.“The university requires any postgraduate applicant to have a minimum average of £180 a week in income throughout the academic year in order to even apply to the fund. This is extremely counterintuitive as it means those who most need the financial support are immediately not eligible,” she says.Some students who have lost their jobs were employed by universities themselves – in campus shops or student unions, for example – and are frustrated by the lack of clarity around the future of their employment.Issy Emmitt, a third-year student at the University of Bath, was working two jobs on campus before the outbreak, as both a student ambassador and in the campus supermarket. When the lockdown began, she and other student employees were informed via a Facebook page that there was no more work available at the shop.“Those of us working zero-hour contracts on campus still haven’t been told whether or not we have been officially furloughed or just plain fired yet – four weeks on,” she says. “A coursemate of mine lost three campus jobs and estimates her losses to be already around £1,000.” In the meantime, Emmitt is worried about how she will pay rent. “I have no savings because of how expensive living in Bath is, and so I’m suddenly in a position where I not only can’t afford my rent, but even basic living necessities,” she says. “I also can’t move home at the moment as my father is severely immunocompromised.”Rent is a major concern for hard-pressed students. Nearly 75,000 students have signed a petition for universities to suspend all student accommodation rent for those who have returned home due to Covid-19.For students like Cartwright, the financial pressures may be too much. “If I do not receive additional support, I will likely not be able to finance somewhere in Birmingham to live for the remainder of my degree,” she says. “I won’t be able to afford a deposit or save up rent upfront for the new property. Due to the hands on nature of my degree, I need to be in Birmingham to complete my dissertation. I do not wish to drop out, but this is something I’m unfortunately forced to consider.”Some names have been changed"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/70b1df72795ce06ae25c7c73dbf6bfd75d1ba117/0_275_4724_2835/master/4724.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2d1f67acb0fae7ae5cc77d44a083f7cb","title":"italy home schooling coronavirus lockdown what weve learned","story":"Schools in northern Italy were the first in Europe to close. Since then, teachers, parents and kids across the country have all had to adapt to a new existence – and the results have surprised everyone. By  Tobias JonesMost of us in Emilia-Romagna, in northern Italy, remember the weekend of 22 February very clearly. To begin with there were just rumours – phone calls and messages flying around between friends – but then it was confirmed: all schools in the region were going to close for a week.The decision was, in many ways, shocking. At that time, there had only been three deaths from Covid-19 in Italy, and only 152 reported infections. It seemed strange that education was the first social activity to be sacrificed. I guessed it was because it wasn’t perceived to be economically productive. Nothing else was closing: football grounds, bars, shops and ski resorts were still open for business, and no schools in any other European country had closed.Still, to our three kids – Benny (15), Emma (13) and Leo (9) – the idea of a week off seemed like bliss. We had moved back to Parma from the UK three years earlier, and by comparison with the UK, education here seemed relentless. Many pupils go to school six days a week and there are no half-term holidays. But my wife, Francesca, who is Italian, and I were both worried. She works with Syrian refugees, which isn’t a job you can suddenly drop, and I had just been offered a 9-to-5 job, after 21 years of being freelance. We, like all our friends, suddenly had an acute childcare crisis.The announcement had been so sudden that schools had few plans or resources in place to teach remotely. Italy spends a lot less on education than almost every other western country. Spending per student (from primary school to university) equates to $8,966 per annum, compared to $11,028 in the UK and $11,502 in Sweden. The under-investment is so serious that in December 2019, the education minister, Lorenzo Fioramonti, resigned in protest.Nor did many Italian teachers seem to know how to approach this new world in which they found themselves. There is minimal teacher-training in Italy. University graduates are often thrown into a classroom without any knowledge of pedagogic theories or practical experience. Inspections are almost unheard of. The result is that Italian education is, at its worst, particularly conservative and condescending: the pupil is seen as an empty vessel to be filled with knowledge that is regurgitated in exams.But if Italian schools weren’t perfect, they were surely better than nothing. The idea that we now had to recreate formal education within the narrow walls of a city flat with no garden was daunting. We lacked the time, energy or even knowledge to replace their teachers. Nor, the kids made it clear, did they even want us to try.Parents and teachers across the country had to scramble to devise ways continue our children’s learning. But slowly – over the course of two months – something rather unexpected happened. As we started to ponder how this experiment of home schooling could best be delivered, it began to feel as if it was us, the parents and teachers, as much as the pupils, who were being educated.The first week off school was the lull before the storm. It genuinely felt like a holiday. Being pragmatic and slightly puritan, we don’t let the kids watch TV, or ourselves drink alcohol, on weekdays. When it was announced that school was closed, we lifted the rules. On 1 March, another week of school closures was announced, so we went up to the mountains, half an hour outside the city, to plant trees and play cards. On 4 March, a new government decree announced that every school in Italy would be suspended the following day.In those early days it was all fun. I left the children spelling tests under their plates or pillows, and if they wanted to watch TV they had to learn elements of the periodic table or the bones of the human skeleton or how to tie knots. It felt as if we were, finally, the right side of that ancient Roman dichotomy of “otium-negotium”, an idea to which Italians occasionally refer. Otium was the time of creative repose when you were able to freewheel and follow your fancies – unlike negotium, which was all about business and the practical side of life.We had a few advantages, I suppose. The ages of our kids mean that there are no tantrums at one end, and no alcohol or boyfriend issues at the other. We enjoy just hanging out together. I’ve also spent much of my life teaching. I’ve taught everywhere from primary schools to prisons and universities. For years, at home, we’ve had mealtime quizzes. One Christmas, Benny even gifted the family three bells of the kind they have in hotel receptions so that we could truly have “fingers on buzzers”.The few educational theories I have come from the British psychoanalyst Donald Winnicott, who believed that play is the path to a child’s wholeness and wellbeing. Games give children the chance to make decisions for themselves and provide an opportunity for spontaneity, fun, deceit and calculation. So for those first two weeks we played incessantly: perudo (“liars’ dice”), blackjack, euchre, backgammon and epic table-tennis tournaments with various handicaps (playing left-handed or subtracting your age from your score). The kids weren’t learning much, but at least poor old Leo was learning to be a good loser.Being the youngest, he needed some fun, and since at this point his class had as yet no lessons organised, I asked his teacher if we could make 10-minute English lessons for his classmates. The aim was as much to cheer them up as to learn English. We would wear wigs and teach his peers the English names for body parts by sawing them off and using lots of fake blood. We taught grammar through declining lavatorial verbs. Emma would edit the videos and we would send them to the class WhatsApp group, which had, until now, been a basic tool for school admin and parental gossip.Despite all those good intentions, it was hard not to feel inadequate, even anxious. Well-meaning messages were circulating among parents about which museums, theatres, aquariums and zoos had opened their virtual doors. Many were posting pictures of their well-behaved children clicking their way through the Guggenheim, while ours were watching House on Netflix. We quickly felt defeated by the sheer volume of offerings, and guilty that we weren’t sharing these cultural delights with our children.The following weekend, on 8 March, the government announced that the whole of Emilia-Romagna (plus Lombardy and the Veneto) was to be placed in lockdown, and that schools would be closed for at least another month. Three days later, on 11 March, the entire country went into full lockdown.We were slowly realising how dark things were becoming. On 12 March, we passed 1,000 nationwide deaths, and only four days later passed 2,000. There was defiance and denial as we sang on balconies and people hung out bedsheets with the wrong-headed slogan “andrà tutto bene” (“it’ll all be fine”), but the mood was turning as the death toll continued to rise.It was at this point that teachers dumped a load of homework on their pupils. Having had a fortnight to plan how to teach through the crisis, many decided that the best way was to send out entire chapters of books for children to learn, and hundreds of pages of exercises to complete. After a fortnight of freedom, pupils were now overloaded.The other thing that changed was that my new job started. For the first time this century, I had bosses and meetings and responsibilities. It brought to an abrupt end my educational clowning. Suddenly no one in the family had much spare time and nor, it seemed, such good cheer.The closing of all Italy’s schools meant teachers found themselves having to invent a new kind of classroom from scratch. There were no ministerial guidelines or approved websites. “The entirety of this new form of online teaching,” said Daniele Martino, a middle-school teacher in Turin, “was created by us teachers at the last minute.”At the beginning, it was chaotic. There was little coordination between different teachers within the same schools, let alone across different schools, and parents reported finding themselves boggled by a vast array of IT platforms: Meet, Classroom, Zoom, Jitsi, Edmodo. The problem wasn’t only that sites and servers crashed as the country’s almost 8 million students all logged on. Many kids couldn’t connect at all.At the start, I got the sense that no one really knew how to do what was becoming known as “DAD” – didattica a distanza, or long-distance learning. When teachers were struggling with IT, it was often their pupils who came to the rescue. “I have an exceptional digital consultant”, said Claudio Dionesalvi, a literature teacher in Calabria. “He’s 11, and is one of my students. He’s like a junior version of Mr Wolf in Pulp Fiction.”The teacher-pupil balance also shifted. In an online classroom, if pupils aren’t interested or motivated, they can hide far more easily. They can feign technological issues, freeze the camera, mute the microphone. Around this time, I did a few online lessons for various schools and saw the problem close up: when the pupils weren’t engaged they would drift away and, not having them there in front of you, you couldn’t bring them back into the circle.Teachers were having to learn new ways to draw their students out. “I could no longer do the classic head-on, knowledge-passing lesson,” said Betta Salvini, a history teacher in Parma. “I now involve them all the time, I turn the lesson upside down so that they are the protagonists, so that I hear their voices.”But school was also being reinvented because Italy’s traditional educational stick had been removed. Usually pupils are given many tests each month and if, at the end of the year, their average score is insufficient, they’re bocciato – failed – and have to repeat the year. Now, teachers quickly realised there was no way to stop students cheating in tests. When someone is in their bedroom, and all you can see is their face, you have no idea if they have the book open on their lap, or are messaging friends or Googling the answer.Traditionalist teachers were beside themselves. One parent in Umbria told me how a teacher stormed out of the virtual classroom when she discovered how many pupils were cheating. Then the new education minister, Lucia Azzolina, suggested that in the circumstances, no pupils would be sent back to repeat the year again. Between the cheating and the automatic promotion to the next school year, teachers who needed a big stick suddenly found themselves disarmed.“Many of my colleagues are really struggling”, said Riccardo Giannitrapani, a maths teacher in a secondary school in Udine. These two months, he told me, have been more about a re-education of teachers than of pupils. “Before, we used to discuss students in meetings by giving them numbers, even down to decimal points – 5.4, 5.5.” These marks, he said, became an end in themselves, creating acute anxiety among not only the children, but also their parents.There has always been a battle in Italy between hardliners and child-centred reformers such as Maria Montessori. It now seemed as if progressives had the upper hand. Salvatore Giuliano, a headteacher in Brindisi and a former deputy education minister, told me: “A child of 15 has far more creativity than we have. Every time you give them the freedom and tools to create something, they will astonish you.” Giuliano described some memorable student-led presentations he has seen in recent weeks. His favourite was an extended family – parents, siblings and grandparents – all dressed up as the planets and moving around the room.Many teachers have had to soften their approach, to take into account what their pupils were going through. “Some of them have lost a grandparent”, said Paola Lante, a primary-school teacher in Milan. “Their parents are losing their jobs or are fighting at home. At the end of the day, a teacher has to be a steadying influence, a social worker and a psychologist.”At the beginning of the lockdown, Giannitrapani, the maths teacher in Udine, published an open letter to his pupils saying that he shouldn’t be the one overloading them, but vice versa – they should be bombarding him with their questions. Sara Scotellaro, in Naples, has 120 pupils in various classes: “They no longer have a timetable and you have to be constantly available”, she said. “They have this need to be immediately reassured – that their work has been received, that it’s OK, that you’re happy with them.”That fluidity of boundaries has had advantages and disadvantages. In video lessons some pupils have found it embarrassing to share their personal spaces – their bedrooms and, in the background, even their embarrassing parents. Many teachers describe seeing a new side to their students. “There’s no longer the intimidation of the pack,” said one teacher, “and so they’re bringing out what they really know. I’ve got a 13-year-old, the son of two ex-offenders, who has produced some diaries of extraordinary depth.” Lante told me about a very timid student who never speaks in class but who, it only now emerges, is exceptional at languages. “It makes you understand”, said Lante, “that we need a very varied form of education”.By the third week of March, after a month with no school, Francesca and I were also beginning to see our children in a new light. Like most kids, they’re monosyllabic when describing their days at school – “fine” usually does it. Now, as lessons were literally taking place in the kitchen, we were unexpectedly in the classroom with them. We could see what was going on.It was both painful and funny. We realised that one of our children, exuberant and confident at home, often froze when asked a question in class. Another, usually conscientious and honest, was asked by her teacher to show her artwork. Because it hadn’t turned out too well, she held up her drawing up against the window, and held the painting she was supposed to have copied behind it, so it showed through behind her own. That mini-deceit made her work look rather sophisticated.Another consequence of lessons taking place at home was that the greatest problem in schools – boisterous disturbances – suddenly subsided. One of our children has a class that is usually very noisy: the kids misbehave and the teacher yells, and soon everyone is shouting over each other. Now, with the children subdued by their parents’ presence, and the teacher aware that parents could be listening, there was a new-found calm to the lessons and, we thought, a genuine warmth to the encounters.But there was no timetable to our children’s lessons. There were odd hours here and there, sometimes in the early morning, sometimes mid-afternoon. Our elderly laptops and wifi were often inadequate, and so the only working devices were passed around. There wasn’t a lot of rhythm or relaxation to our day. Francesca and I were still trying to take up a lot of slack, but as March turned into April, our initial energy had subsided.We had passed 10,000, then 15,000 deaths from Covid-19. Even though the kids had enough spare time to be habitually bored, they were no longer cleaning the house or doing their daily learning tasks. Spelling tests and fitness regimes were forgotten. They seemed to have become – if not agoraphobic – certainly “agora-meh”. They wouldn’t even walk around the block. They were getting up later each day, and even when vertical, it became hard to persuade them to get out of pyjamas.As often happens when you stop doing something, you suddenly wonder why you were doing it in the first place. Benny, who has been obsessive about ballet all her life and attends a dance academy, entered a profound crisis. She said she wanted to stop dancing altogether. Even Leo, a football fanatic, barely mentioned or played with a football any more. It felt as if their passions had evaporated somehow.It’s hard, as a parent, not to be frustrated, especially if – as a writer – you regret that they never read books. Every time I emerged from my office, I would see them all on their screens, headphones on. Lessons had become indistinguishable from down-time. For all the idealism about digital learning, it seemed extraordinarily passive to me.I tried to take things in hand. Mealtimes were raucous because they had so much pent-up energy, so I thought “if they’re not going to read, I’ll read to them”. I would bring a book to table, not realising that I was becoming just like one of the conservative teachers I had always scorned, force-feeding them my passions and using knowledge to sedate and subdue. They would snigger and scoff. “I just don’t get poetry,” Emma grumbled.Fortunately they have a wiser mother. We have no garden, but four balconies, and as spring came on, Francesca was planting and weeding. The children were drawn to the gardening, perhaps because it was everything their schooling isn’t – outdoors and manual. Emma propagated her succulents and so needed more shelf space, and went to the garage to do some carpentry. They began sewing, and cooking cappelletti, croissants and – their much-missed English snack – digestive biscuits.It’s hard to know how much it was more to do with psychology or spare time, but they all began rearranging their bedrooms, moving beds and desks. It was as if they were rearranging their internal and external furniture. Photographs, pictures and books were culled, others were added. They asked for new haircuts. Francesca and I watched it all and tried to work out ways to keep bringing them out of both their closed bedrooms and their private worlds.I changed my approach. I know that theatricality is sometimes helpful in teaching, so one evening, as I read a poem, I put a small shiny box on the table. They pretended to listen, but were all watching that box, wondering what the game was. I had chosen to read Seamus Heaney’s Digging. It’s a poem about how we look up to, and down on, our parents. It’s about the difficulty of a writer feeling worthy of agricultural ancestors because the pen is nothing compared with the depth of a spade. But it’s also about the need for children to go their own way and not, perhaps, feel unworthy. When I had finished, I just passed them the box. Inside I had cut up all the words of the poem. “Go on then,” I said, “write it your way.”Suddenly they were excited about poetry. They snatched words from each other, tried them out here and there. As they laughed, the slim pieces of paper flew around the table. With its farmyard diction – “squelch”, “slap”, “rump” – the poem now seemed earthy rather than erudite. Instead of being told to admire a Grecian urn, they now had the clay in their hands.As they found their new hybrid role of being both pupils and teachers, we said they could award themselves marks both for content (a letter) and effort (a number). It was really, of course, just a way to show them that marks aren’t about approval (external) but honesty (internal).The more you look at the educational conundrum in lockdown Italy, the more you see everyone’s vulnerabilities. Students have always felt fretful because of their weekly tests and the stigma of being held back a year. But now many teachers feel insecure, too: not just because education seems like the last priority of government, but because they are scared of digitalised learning and fear being replaced by screens.Even those who relish the technology, like the Calabrian teacher Claudio Dionesalvi, are concerned: “Distance-learning is a strange video game,” he said, “but in the end it’s a torture. A teacher can’t be holed up in front of a screen. They risk becoming two-dimensional – an artificial TV personality.”Many parents are anxious, not just because their children are losing out on formative months of learning, but also because – without those marks – they have no measure of their offspring’s progress. Chiara Esposito, a middle-school teacher, told me “parents are the most conservative element in the school ecosystem. They become paranoid if their child isn’t ‘an eight’ or hasn’t completed the set book. They’re the ones we really need to educate.”Surprisingly, even the education technology firms promoting digital learning platforms to schools feel apprehensive. Lorenzo Benussi is the chief innovation officer of the Fondazione per la Scuola della Compagnia di San Paolo, which promotes inclusivity and creativity in education, and a former technical adviser to the minister of education. He is concerned that teachers are using new tech to reproduce the same old teaching methods, instead of grasping this opportunity for a completely new kind of teaching. “When all this talk about digital learning began back in March,” he said, “I was very, very worried, because it’s not about technology. Technology is just a means. Its effectiveness depends entirely on your didactic approach.”Edoardo Montenegro from Betwyll, which is launching a new social reading app with educational publisher Pearson for Italian schools in September, says something very similar: “A WhatsApp video call or a Zoom meeting isn’t digital learning. Those encounters can be just as frontal and rhetorical as an old-style professorial lesson.”No one knows when formal schooling will resume, and everyone feels uncertain of what their role will be when it does. But uncertainty is, according to the great educationalist Loris Malaguzzi, actually a vital ingredient for inclusive, collegiate learning. Only “a willingness to question all your own abilities and knowledge”, he said in 1992, two years before his death, leads to humility and listening. That, he said, “is how we educate each other together.”It’s exactly two months since the schools closed in Emilia-Romagna. And to us, in our city apartment, it does feel as if, in the gentle argy-bargy of family life, we’ve been educating each other. Maybe it would have happened anyway, but it’s changed how we see ourselves. The girl destined to be a ballerina seems to be mourning the end of that dream. The perfectionist has glimpsed a goal that’s deeper than marks out of 10. The boy who seemed riotous has been revealed as nervously studious. The teacher has become an accompanist and the gardener our guide. And with almost five months to go until schools (possibly) reopen in mid-September, I’m sure we’ve still got a lot to learn.• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8526881daf2daa8f50bd3e9345fb1ad7d4d568ec/0_191_5200_3121/master/5200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f03f76549143dbbaa01f75ce69e2f8d9","title":"coronavirus detected particles air pollution","story":"Exclusive: Scientists examine whether this route enables infections at longer distancesCoronavirus has been detected on particles of air pollution by scientists investigating whether this could enable it to be carried over longer distances and increase the number of people infected.The work is preliminary and it is not yet known if the virus remains viable on pollution particles and in sufficient quantity to cause disease.The Italian scientists used standard techniques to collect outdoor air pollution samples at one urban and one industrial site in Bergamo province and identified a gene highly specific to Covid-19 in multiple samples. The detection was confirmed by blind testing at an independent laboratory.Leonardo Setti at the University of Bologna in Italy, who led the work, said it was important to investigate if the virus could be carried more widely by air pollution.“I am a scientist and I am worried when I don’t know,” he said. “If we know, we can find a solution. But if we don’t know, we can only suffer the consequences.”Two other research groups have suggested air pollution particles could help coronavirus travel further in the air.A statistical analysis by Setti’s team suggests higher levels of particle pollution could explain higher rates of infection in parts of northern Italy before a lockdown was imposed, an idea supported by another preliminary analysis. The region is one of the most polluted in Europe.Neither of the studies by Setti’s team have been peer-reviewed and therefore have not been endorsed by independent scientists. But experts agree their proposal is plausible and requires investigation.Previous studies have shown that air pollution particles do harbour microbes and that pollution is likely to have carried the viruses causing bird flu, measles and foot-and-mouth disease over considerable distances.The potential role of air pollution particles is linked to the broader question of how the coronavirus is transmitted. Large virus-laden droplets from infected people’s coughs and sneezes fall to the ground within a metre or two. But much smaller droplets, less than 5 microns in diameter, can remain in the air for minutes to hours and travel further.Experts are not sure whether these tiny airborne droplets can cause coronavirus infections, though they know the 2003 Sars coronavirus was spread in the air and that the new virus can remain viable for hours in tiny droplets.But researchers say the importance of potential airborne transmission, and the possible boosting role of pollution particles, mean it must not be ruled out without evidence.Epidemics of infectious diseases behave in different ways but the\u0026nbsp1918 influenza pandemic\u0026nbspthat killed more than 50 million people is regarded as a key example of a pandemic that occurred in multiple waves, with the latter more severe than the first. It has been replicated – albeit more mildly – in subsequent flu pandemics.How and why multiple-wave outbreaks occur, and how subsequent waves of infection can be prevented, has become a staple of epidemiological modelling studies and pandemic preparation, which have looked at everything from social behaviour and health policy to vaccination and the buildup of community immunity, also known as herd immunity.This is being watched very carefully. Without a vaccine, and with no widespread immunity to the new disease, one alarm is being sounded by the experience of Singapore, which has seen a sudden\u0026nbspresurgence in infections\u0026nbspdespite being lauded for its early handling of the outbreak.Although Singapore instituted a strong contact tracing system for its general population, the disease re-emerged in\u0026nbspcramped dormitory accommodation\u0026nbspused by thousands of foreign workers with inadequate hygiene facilities and shared canteens.Singapore’s experience, although very specific, has demonstrated the ability of the disease to come back strongly in places where people are in close proximity and its ability to exploit any weakness in public health regimes set up to counter it.Conventional wisdom among scientists suggests second waves of resistant infections occur after the capacity for treatment and isolation becomes exhausted. In this case the concern is that the social and political consensus supporting lockdowns is being overtaken by public frustration and the urgent need to reopen economies.The threat declines when susceptibility of the population to the disease falls below a certain threshold or when widespread vaccination becomes available.In general terms the ratio of susceptible and immune iniduals in a population at the end of one wave determines the potential magnitude of a subsequent wave. The worry right now is that with\u0026nbspa vaccine still months away, and the real rate of infection only being guessed at, populations worldwide remain highly vulnerable to both resurgence and subsequent waves.Prof Jonathan Reid at Bristol University in the UK is researching airborne transmission of coronavirus. “It is perhaps not surprising that while suspended in air, the small droplets could combine with background urban particles and be carried around.”He said the virus had been detected in tiny droplets collected indoors in China.Setti said tiny droplets between 0.1 and 1 micron may travel further when coalesced with pollution particles up to 10 microns than on their own. This is because the combined particle is larger and less dense than the droplet and can remain buoyed by the air for longer.Prof Frank Kelly at Imperial College London said the idea of pollution particles carrying the virus further afield was an interesting one. “It is possible, but I would like to see this work repeated by two or three groups.”Other research has indicated correlations between increased Covid-19 deaths and higher levels of air pollution before the pandemic. Long-term exposure to dirty air is known to damage lung health, which could make people more vulnerable to Covid-19.• Coronavirus and volunteering: how can I help in the UK?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d7072707fd8718820aa68d5b5dcadaa1c0aa3e8c/0_40_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e04f4f8436d0144ed8b67302342e4db0","title":"the plight of the cuckoo a 4000 mile flight followed by golf","story":"Study sheds light upon migratory cycle of bird to help understand alarming declineWhen you’ve just braved sandstorms, thunderstorms and drought during a 4,000-mile solo flight in search of romance, what is your first priority?For Carlton II the cuckoo, it appears to be a relaxing round of golf. The satellite-tagged bird became the first of a small flock of tracked cuckoos to return to his breeding grounds in record time, dashing from the Ivory Coast to southern England in seven days.The British Trust for Ornithology’s satellite tag revealed that upon nearing home, Carlton II stopped at Dulwich \u0026amp Sydenham Hill golf club in south London before a brief visit to Farnham Park golf club in Berkshire. He then moved on to another golf course at nearby Burnham Beeches.Carlton II – named after his favourite nature reserve, Carlton Marshes, in Suffolk – may have some time on his hands after overtaking two other cuckoos tracked by the BTO. PJ and Senan are currently feeding in Spain and North Africa.The nine-year tagging study in which young birds are tagged each year is shedding new light upon the migratory cycle of the cuckoo, helping scientists understand the species’ alarming decline.The call that once echoed across valleys in spring is increasingly rare: Britain has lost three-quarters of its breeding cuckoos over the last 25 years.Dr Chris Hewson, BTO lead scientist on the project, said: “It is great to see Carlton II getting back to the UK so quickly. Taking just a week to cover more than 3,000 miles from Liberia to Berkshire is an awesome feat and something even swifts don’t manage.“This shows us just how quickly these harbingers of spring can get here from tropical Africa when conditions for their journey are good. It’s a journey so full of hazards that it’s always a relief when they get back, no matter how fast or slow.“These cuckoos have taught us so much about their lives, giving answers but also raising more questions as to what might be behind their decline.”Pressures along their route, including habitat loss but also drought caused by climate change, are making the cuckoo’s epic journeying more hazardous.Carlton II has clocked up 22,000 miles since he was fitted with an ultra-light tag at Carlton Marshes in 2018 but still has a way to go to emulate the travels of Chris Packham, a cuckoo named after the naturalist and broadcaster.Chris the cuckoo returned to Britain for four successive summers, flying more than 50,000 miles and traversing 28 different countries on his migration from sub-Saharan Africa to Europe. On one occasion, the bird erted hundreds of miles off his usual course to Angola. After gaining fans worldwide, Chris the cuckoo disappeared soon after departing England for a final time in July 2015."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/750f927c955ff63a5106dccd42755208a9fcff4d/0_249_5103_3061/master/5103.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bc99acbc3bb3199783e89d3e0083846b","title":"tales of love and loss people from oceania share their extinction stories aoe","story":"The Living Archive aims to help people worldwide see the significance of species loss as it affects inidual lives and placesThe first time poet Craig Santos Perez encountered a bird native to his homeland of Guam it was in a cage at San Diego zoo.Growing up on Guam in the 1980s and 90s, Perez, a native Chamorro, had learned about the island’s lost birds at school. Children studied pictures and listened to audio recordings of their calls – but by then, the island’s forests were silent.In the late 1980s, the last siheks were taken off the island to be reared in captive breeding programmes at zoos on the American mainland. Though there are now plans to release some on Guam, they are still considered extinct in the wild.That day at the zoo, Perez finally came face to face with a real-life sihek, its gold-and-turquoise feathers shining behind the bars. “It was very profound, very touching – I talked to it, and started crying,” he says.To Perez, the bird’s fate echoed that of his people: San Diego is home to the largest diaspora of Chamorros outside of Guam. For many years, Perez was one of them. “We migrate to survive and to have better opportunities, but at the same time, we’re far from home, we’re in a new situation, and it can be very traumatic – for the sihek as well as the people.”A poem Perez wrote about the sihek is among those featured on the Living Archive, a new multimedia web platform that provides a space for people from Oceania to tell their “extinction stories”.“When a species goes extinct, so much is lost,” says Perez, who is now an associate professor of English at the University of Hawaii. “Not only from the environment and the ecosystem, but culturally as well. We lose our cultural connection to these important species, and we lose the deep meaning that they added to our lives.”The site is the brainchild of Thom van Dooren, an Australian environmental philosopher at the University of Sydney. He hopes it will be a way of creating space for others – especially the Pacific’s indigenous peoples, but anyone is welcome to contribute – to share their tales of love and loss. A storytelling competition will be held later in the year.As the sixth great extinction gathers pace, stories are more important than ever, van Dooren says. “Focusing on stories is about moving away from the simple listing of endangered species.“Multiplying voices and erse perspectives from around the world helps us to see the significance of extinction as it actually touches down in particular lives and places.”In Indonesia’s West Papua province, it is the disappearance of the sago palm that is causing heartbreak for the indigenous Marind people. To the Marind, the plant is of central significance for both subsistence and cosmology, but Papua is the new oil palm frontier, and as plantations spread across the landscape, groves of sago are being destroyed.“Even though the communities I work with are facing all kinds of adverse social impacts from this deforestation, whenever I asked them what the worst impact was, they would invariably tell me that ‘oil palm kills the sago’,” says Sophie Chao, an anthropologist from the University of Sydney who has spent a decade living alongside the Marind.“They would almost place the fate of this tree before their own lives … it was the threat to the sago, this nourishing, life-giving plant, that they considered to be the most dramatic rupture caused by deforestation and oil-palm expansion.”Together with members of the Marind community, Chao co-wrote an extinction story about sago for the Living Archive. It includes a translation of a song sung to the plant by a Marind elder: “From eating sago, we grew bone from eating sago, we knew home.”Marind call themselves “sago people”, and the palm entwines with every aspect of their life, Chao says. Children are said to grow best in the company of sago, and particular palms are named after children that came into the world at the same time. Those babies are often carried in bags made from the fronds of their namesake palm so that, as one young mother told Chao, “sago and Marind can follow each other’s lives”.People also talk about being “good food for sago”, Chao says. Palm starch nourishes the Marind through their life but when a person dies, they must be buried in a sago grove so that their body becomes food for the microorganisms that in turn feed the forest’s roots.Now, conventional palm oil companies clear-cut the groves, and even “sustainable” projects can exclude local people from conservation zones, severing the Marind’s lifelong connection to their kindred sago.“This plant is culturally meaningful, and it is politically meaningful too,” says Chao.“When people are talking about this kind of localised extinction they are also speaking about what they see as their own possible extinction as West Papuan people: the cultural dilution, forced sterilisation, systemic incarceration, and all sorts of other processes that are very much part of the collective identity of West Papuans.”And yet, the whole point of the Living Archive is to “avoid the politics of despair,” Chao says. As she tells in her extinction story, the Marind themselves have found some hope and resilience in the possibility of reaching a kind of understanding with oil palm: “So we cannot deny ourselves hope when they are finding glimmers amid the rubble!”There is power in good stories, Chao says. “They might not be able to change the status quo or the structural processes and violence that are causing extinctions, but caring matters. Fleshy stories make us care more.”And they’re more important now than ever, van Dooren says. Covid19 is seen by many as a product of a dysfunctional relationship between humans and animals, and the broader environment too.“Extinction is only part of that puzzle but it’s a significant part - it’s a symptom of a broader set of problematic relationships that we’re being reminded of, not just by Covid 19, but by climate change.“Storytelling is a big part of how we manage those relationships and how we imagine other possibilities.”Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow bioersity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/14d7962940433fb499bab4ff4445290c11b718c1/0_0_4264_2843/master/4264.jpg?width=480\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=dcdf7f0224ff456b99aedfd401281198 960w","title":"liam charles recipe for luxurious french toast","story":"It’s French toast, but not as you know it, with a distinctly Australian spin thanks to the coconut sugar coatingFrench toast is such a treat for a weekend breakfast, and I’ve found a way of making it even more decadent.

Davies leans forwards to pick it up and stares at it for a moment before turning it off and apologising. “Was that Robert Lewandowski?” Lineker jokes. Davies grins, explaining it was his German teacher, reminding him of their virtual lesson later in the day.Davies is only 19 years old but one of the most exciting prospects in world football. He joined Bayern from Vancouver Whitecaps in January 2019 in a deal worth £9m, a record for an MLS player at the time. The left-back made six substitute appearances in the second half of the 2018-19 season but has exploded into life this campaign.In February he mesmerised a world audience as Bayern took Chelsea apart and won 3-0 at Stamford Bridge in the first leg of their Champions League last-16 tie, prompting Lineker to tweet: “Alphonso Davies’ parents fled Liberia in the civil war. He was born in a refugee camp in Ghana and moved to Canada when he was five. Here he is playing beautifully for Bayern at 19. What a wonderful story.” Davies, who extended his contract with Bayern this week, is widely liked for his amiable personality and refusal to take himself too seriously, as evidenced by his daft TikTok videos. Yet he is dedicated in his support of refugees, working closely with the United Nations high commissioner for refugees (UNHCR) as a high-profile supporter. On Saturday, Davies will play three live-streamed matches in a Pro Evolution Soccer tournament against Milan’s on-loan goalkeeper Asmir Begovic, a former refugee himself, to raise funds for UNHCR’s Covid-19 response. Gary Lineker Alphonso, it’s lovely to sort of meet you, even though it’s in these circumstances. First of all, how are you doing in isolation?Alphonso Davies Yeah, I’m good. The team started training a couple of weeks ago so I’m happy for that. But it’s a tough situation right now, so I guess we just have to play our part and stay inside.Lineker I’m sure we’ll all get back to playing football once again. You have obviously had some hardships in your life, particularly growing up as a refugee. Do you remember your formative years in the Buduburam refugee camp?Davies I can’t really remember too much about those years. I wish I could. I can’t even really remember kicking a football around, although I know I did. It’s not a memory they want to share with their kids too often, but they talked about it a little bit because it’s part of our story.Lineker Do you ever feel the urge to go back to Ghana or Liberia?Davies I asked my parents about it because we still have family in both countries but the way things are going right now I will have to wait a little bit longer.Lineker Things have gone amazingly well for you since your family moved to Canada, but it must have been a massive step for them.Davies Yeah it was tough, but it was also an amazing feeling – being able to go to a country and do what you want to do, be who you want to be. I think my family did well. I’m very proud of them.Lineker And you finally had the chance to go to school, which should be an important part of any child’s life.Davies Exactly. I enjoyed every moment of being at school. Football doesn’t last for ever, so you need an education longer term.Lineker When did you start to realise that you were quite good at this game?Lineker You were just 14 when you left home and moved to Vancouver. I heard that your mother was particularly worried that you might go astray and become a bad boy.Lineker Who did you support when you were younger?Lineker Really? And look at what you just did to Chelsea!Davies Exactly! My dad really liked Didier Drogba and there was always a Chelsea game on when I was growing up. There were so many amazing teams to watch but I didn’t particularly have a team. So it was Chelsea by force.Lineker You were just 15 when you made your Major League Soccer debut for Whitecaps and, in 2017, after receiving Canadian citizenship, you became the youngest player to appear for the Canadian men’s team. Then, in 2018, when you were 18, you were Canada’s men’s player of the year. You must have been incredibly proud.Davies It makes me feel like all the hard work I’ve been doing over the years is really paying off. The coach saw something in me when I became a citizen of Canada and he took me to the national team camp… Being men’s player of the year was a shock!Lineker And, of course, in January 2019 you moved to Bayern Munich. How did that come about? I think a lot of European clubs, including Manchester United, Chelsea and Liverpool, were looking at you at the time.Davies There were rumours in the air that all these different clubs were looking at me but I didn’t know which specific clubs. No one told me anything. And then I got a message: “Bayern Munich want to meet you.” I was like: “Oh my god. Really?” It was both exciting and scary. I just had to prove to myself that I could compete at this level.Lineker What was it like on the first day? Was it intimidating meeting all the superstar Bayern players like Lewandowski and Neuer?Davies Yes! I’d watched these guys on TV since I was a kid and there I was, seeing them in person, training with them and playing with them. I was very intimidated. When Arjen Robben introduced himself to me, I just couldn’t believe it.Lineker Do you think your previous experiences in life, as a refugee and then moving from Edmonton to Vancouver as a boy, helped ease your move to Germany?Davies I think so. Those moves definitely prepared me for moving overseas. If I hadn’t already made those moves, I’d be very homesick every single day. I am still homesick but I can deal with it.Lineker We live in such challenging times. You are a supporter of UNHCR. Did you want to give something back perhaps?Davies I want to use my platform to talk about refugees and my personal story to inspire people to reach out and help. It’s so hard for people in refugee camps to do any kind of social distancing. They need clean water, soap to wash their hands and food.Lineker I’ve seen some of your videos on TikTok and you’re quite the personality on there aren’t you? Singing, dancing, all sorts …Davies Football comes first, but I want to be an actor eventually.I like entertaining people and TikTok gives me the platform to do so. It allows fans to not only see what I do on the field, but also to get to know my personality a bit more.

The content of his exchanges with the government’s stand-in shot-stopper Dominic Raab is best discussed outside the sports pages – though I’d summarise it as a knight against the benighted – but the atmosphere also intrigued. For there was hardly anybody there, a scant scattering of suited souls in the historic old chamber while the rest called in their questions, a situation that contrasted with the appearances in the same forum of some modern PMs, who have metaphorically phoned in their answers.The absence of so many people resulted in a lack of the noise and bluster they normally bring with them. The whole thing was of course less of a spectacle as a result – with not as much to see and hear to distract us from the fact that watching a bloke talk evasively is not in itself particularly exciting – but also more instructive. With nothing to watch but the action, and denied the shortcut of ranking contributions by the amount of cheering and paper-waving they provoke, observers were left with no way of judging anything except by its own merits.Residents of cities around the world are reporting that the reduction in pollution during lockdowns has allowed them to see clearly for the first time in years, and viewers of the action in parliament found themselves experiencing, in a manner of speaking, a remarkably similar phenomenon. But the situation facing football is precisely the opposite: deprived of the action that once entertained us, now all we can see is the pollution that surrounds it.It would be easy to go overboard here, ignoring the fact that clubs are at heart relatively small-scale community organisations largely staffed by considerate people. Hence initiatives such as #PlayersTogether, launched this month by the 20 captains of Premier League teams, and all sorts of smaller, less publicity-hungry schemes including antenatal appointments being quietly relocated from North Middlesex University hospital to the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, David Moyes delivering fruit and veg to Lancashire residents, and Watford providing food and refuge for staff at the neighbouring hospital. But it is also impossible to avoid the conclusion that at some level above this sport hangs a foul and corrosive fog.The Saudi Arabia Public Investment Fund’s attempt to buy Newcastle United is the latest kick in English football’s moral goolies, an ordeal the sport has repeatedly submitted itself with apparent alacrity but of which one can only hope it will one day tire.Newcastle’s potential sale brought protests from Amnesty International, protests about Amnesty International from the portion of Newcastle fans who have already decided that getting rid of Mike Ashley is worth the occasional mass execution, and an angry letter from Yousef al-Obaidly, chief executive of the Doha-based broadcaster beIN Sports, telling the Premier League and its constituent clubs that “the industrial-scale theft of the Premier League’s intellectual property by Saudi Arabia” – in the shape of state-endorsed unofficial match broadcasts – “is, sadly, now notorious”. Obaidly, who also sits on the board of directors at Paris Saint-Germain, was last in the news in 2019, when he was reported to be under judicial investigation in France for “aggravated money laundering”, related to Doha’s bid for the World Athletics Championships. He “completely and categorically denied” the allegations.There seems no obvious remedy for a sport that has simultaneously not enough money and way too much in which elite players are so used to getting three cherries in life’s fruit machine that any spin without a jackpot payout is incomprehensible beyond the kind of wholehearted wealth redistribution that would, among other consequences, very swiftly have Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund seeking alternative methods of reputation management. For now, though, we can only watch in horror at a situation akin to a wedding disco from which all the music and all the lithe, young bodies have disappeared, leaving the awkward, ugly movements of those usually glimpsed only on the edge of the dancefloor. The hope from here is that we don’t take too many elbows in the face before someone gets the music going again."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4cc595d29424e5312d10a1afb4ad87799c4b7658/0_133_3680_2207/master/3680.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=064fbf75497cc8e37fe0087956a78ade","title":"everyone needs a distraction right now and for me its a jane fonda tracksuit","story":"I would argue strongly in defence of thinking about extremely stupid stuff that has nothing to do with the current hellishnessGiven that my response to the start of the Gulf war was to write that night in my diary, “Renewed my membership to the New Kids On The Block fanclub!!!!”, I am very familiar with being accused of caring too much about frivolity in times of gravity. The day Diana died, I made the schlep to Kensington Palace to see the flowers but I also stopped in at Tower Records afterwards to buy an album (Backstreet Boys by the Backstreet Boys: Diana would have approved). Even now, when I know I should be spending every spare minute studying a long read about contagionChinacapitalism, I am instead reading Craig Brown’s ridiculously enjoyable new biography of the Beatles, One Two Three Four. Because, sure, we’re living through history. But did you know that Ringo once tried to save money on house repairs by buying his own building company?At the time of writing, the British lockdown has lasted a month and, initially, it was pretty much all I could talk about: the fear, the weirdness, the uncertainty. “It is what it is,” my friends and I would sigh down the phone to each other, because when you have no idea what to say but think you need to say something, you turn into an Alison Steadman character. But after a certain point, there isn’t – if you’re lucky – much else to say. If you and your family are well and have enough to eat, what’s your conversation going to be? “Yup, still inside. Still washing my hands. Doing the same tomorrow – catch up then?” If the lockdown experience was a movie, even Terrence Malick would be thinking, “You know what? This story really needs some plot.”Slowly, we have started talking about other things: celebrity gossip, sharing photos of outfits and hair experiments – things that have nothing to do with the virus. “Sorry for mentioning this now…” a friend will begin, a version of a sentiment you see a lot on social media, usually in relation to any article that dares to be about something other than the virus. “Does this writer not know people are dying?” is the traditional format. It’s always tempting to respond, “No, they totally didn’t! Thank God you’ve let them know – they thought the whole world was doing a re-enactment of Shaun Of The Dead!”I may have mentioned this once or a million times, but I recently published a book about my family’s lives through the 20th century, including during the second world war. I don’t have much time for politicians who make the link between all of us having to stay inside and our grandparents trying not to be bombed, but one of my favourite discoveries while researching the book has been on my mind recently. Throughout the war, despite being in hiding in Poland and France, my relatives somehow managed to write to one another. They were in enormous danger, and yet their letters were only occasionally about the conflict. Instead, they mainly complained: which daughter-in-law wasn’t showing enough respect, which father snored too loudly. I loved all this, not just because it confirmed that I come by my pettiness naturally, but because it proves that human nature will always reassert itself, like weeds re-growing on a charred landscape after a natural disaster.For this reason, I would argue very strongly in defence of thinking, talking and writing about extremely stupid stuff that has nothing to do with the current hellishness. I don’t mean posting twee photos of just-baked bread, or attempting to read Finnegans Wake. You are only doing those things because of the virus they are coronactivities, and therefore do not count. I’m talking about spending at least half an hour going through the Instagram of Elizabeth Hurley’s fascinating mini-me son, Damian. I’m talking about very seriously considering buying one of Jane Fonda’s self-branded tracksuits. I’m talking about falling asleep thinking about what colour you’d like to repaint the kitchen. I’m talking about the stuff of real, normal life.This isn’t just about giving yourself a break from thinking about the coronavirus, although God knows we could all do with one. You cannot read dystopian headlines all day without collapsing in on yourself like a dying star. Instead, it’s about giving yourself permission to still be a human being, because human beings are capable of being very concerned about one thing (a global plague), and also quite interested in something else (Cameron Diaz’s new baby).When I watch people picking fights with one another online about Rishi Sunak’s latest announcement, or hear them griping about how their neighbours aren’t sufficiently socially distant, what I’m really seeing are people who desperately want to think about something else, but who don’t feel allowed to do so when you suppress this natural desire, it curdles and twists. Then, before you can say, “Someone, please, get me a copy of Grazia,” you’re falling out with a colleague online over the government’s withdrawal plan.Free yourselves: talk for hours about how you reckon Harry and Meghan are coping.

Am I alone? It’s seven years too late to askMy wife and I decided to see what all the fuss is about with this show called Game Of Thrones. I would like to say I haven’t seen it because I haven’t got round to it, but the truth is I have a history of not engaging with things for the sake of being a contrarian. Everybody was talking about it and so I wilfully avoided it, although I was pretty sure I would like it.I have given up on that philosophy. I saw a post on Facebook, something like: “I have never seen a single episode of The Sopranos and people look at me like I’m a unicorn.” I realised I didn’t want to be that unicorn and watched all six series of The Sopranos in a single sitting.You can get misled by the hype. For the best part of last month, social media was comprised entirely of “How mental is Netflix’s The Tiger King?!” posts. I was so suckered by it that I was expecting the story of a man who ejaculates wild cats and raises them as his gay lovers. It was a great show, but the effect had been softened for me.I had no such problems tucking into Game Of Thrones. All I remembered from the days when everyone was talking about it was that it has dragons, bare breasts and a terrible ending. So we sat down to watch it with little expectation beyond that.It is, of course, brilliant. But I have issues, mainly that it was only in season six that I began to understand who everyone was. The sheer quantity of character information and backstory that the show is constantly smashing into your head is hard to take. It makes me acutely aware of the fact that you can hold only a finite amount of working information in your head one day very soon, I am going to forget my online banking password because I know way too much about the Targaryen family tree.But the main thing that has shocked me has been the brutality of the violence. You see people getting their throats slit as often as you see them eating. Everybody dies, and rarely peacefully. One character gets arrowed to death on the toilet. Unexpected death and violence seems imminent for every single person, yet none of them seem to show the slightest degree of anxiety.It’s my reaction to the violence, however, that I have found most surprising. I have gone from somebody who doesn’t mind any level of gore to a pearl-clutcher of the highest order. On occasion, I have looked away from the screen or gasped. It has been a voyage of discovery. My wife feels the same way, and we have wondered if we are weirdos, but the problem with watching a show so late is that you can’t discuss it with other people. I’m not going to phone my friends and say, “Do you remember in Game Of Thrones about seven years ago when they had that Red Wedding? That was mad, wasn’t it?”I presented an award alongside Maisie Williams, who plays Arya Stark, a few years ago. I had not watched a single episode of Game Of Thrones at the time. I am so annoyed now that I didn’t tell her how brilliant she was, even if I know I would have fan-boyed horrifically, before saying: “Isn’t it ever so violent, though?”We will be sad to say goodbye to Game Of Thrones this week, as we watch its final episodes. We are, however, looking forward to starting on our next brand-new show: Breaking Bad."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a2104a1c6efc717d24bc29b9766fa8f8cd068ca/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bf57269c41d6b52a7b8711c9a5344f06","title":"i slept with my best friends ex now im terrified of confrontation","story":"Your reluctance to have a conversation with her could mask a deeper desire to always be in control, says Annalisa BarbieriI have a fear of confrontation. Recently, this destroyed my relationship with my best friend, after I slept with her ex. I did not tell her for several months, and developed my own twisted logic that I was somehow protecting her from the painful truth. When I did tell her, she made me realise my refusal to tell the truth had hurt her more than the action itself.It’s been a year, and I haven’t spoken to her or her ex (who was also my friend). My way of dealing with the situation was to suppress thinking about it for months and continue with my life. However, partly owing to my relationship with my new partner (who is highly emotionally intelligent), I have started to reflect on the situation. I know I have to recognise my responsibility to myself and others, and become an active, not passive, force in my relationships. I hate the idea of ruining that with my new partner, which is one of the best relationships I have had.This brings me to my main issue. I live with the fear that my best friend will want another confrontation as part of her way of moving on. I am scared of bumping into her in my home town, or having to respond if she messages me. I am conflicted over the fact that perhaps I owe it to her to instigate a meeting. But I am scared that I will talk too much about myself, not listen well enough, or fail to offer anything new, making her feel disappointed for even bothering with me. What can I do?There’s a lot of living in your head going on. Your friend hasn’t made contact with you, and if she did, you are imagining that she wants confrontation. Often when people fear confrontation, it can be traced back to something that happened earlier in life, but it may not be as simple as that, as psychotherapist Lucy Beresford (psychotherapy.org.uk) helped me understand.“I did wonder if your idea of not wanting to have another conversation was less about fear of confrontation and more a masking of a deeper desire to always be in control,” Beresford explained. She went on to say that the way you conducted the affair with your friend’s ex, and then didn’t tell her, was also about “controlling the situation”. This can stem from a fear of angering others and wanting to be liked.This is really worth exploring: think about your interactions with people, and which of these you deem to be successful and which aren’t, and what the difference between them is. What is it about your new partner that has allowed you to learn more about yourself? You may find that, actually, you can talk in a “confronting” way with some people and not with others the reason for this may be telling. It may be down to the combination of personalities rather than just yours.What to do? Beresford suggests sitting down with your partner and exploring exactly what you are afraid of. I know, you think you know, but I want you to really unpack it. Go through each imagined contact with your friend, talk about what it is you fear, what it brings up, and then get your partner to ask you: “And then what?” Being gently challenged to really think, and not come up with hackneyed answers, can throw up surprises.Your friend hasn’t contacted you yet, and she might not. If you wanted to be less passive, you might consider writing her a letter, asking to meet. You can be in control of what you say, and you can even say you fear meeting and not listening, or talking about yourself, so you are writing this letter first. Then, when you do meet, allow both of you the luxury of not talking much and just listening. Don’t justify yourself, don’t answer back, don’t excuse.• Send your problem to annalisa.barbieri@mac.

There are things you can persuade a four-year-old to do with a sticker that, by the time they are six, would be more like a quid if you wanted to bribe a 12-year-old to do a daily plank, from a baseline of no-daily-plank, that would cost you roughly £1m. Unfortunately, to really make use of this excellent advice, I would have to go back to 2013.I have two 12-year-olds and one 10-year-old. The older two are less biddable, but each has a sport (C has karate, TJ has tennis and cycling) and some semblance of a sport ethic to go with it. The youngest has nothing of the sort. We used to call her H the Quitter, and don’t write in to explain why that is wrong because we knew it was wrong at the time.To concentrate on the big ones: stick to their sport and make it their thing. Even the most rebellious soul cannot help forming habits if there is any livestreamed version of a class they used to take, that timetable will be its own tyranny, so you don’t have to be the tyrant. Tennis courts are closed, of course, but if you have a garden big enough (I don’t, but my ex does), string a badminton net across it. Even a tiny amount of competition is useful for exercise refuseniks. If your children really can’t stand one another, marshal that rivalry into something useful, such as a press-up competition.Younger kids will want you to take part older ones will want privacy. With H, I give her a mat and stick her in front of a yoga video, then leave the room. I have no idea whether she does it or not, but it’s better not to know than to get into endless standoffs about it. Resistance bands have been quite a hit with her but I would advise researching the exercises beforehand because it really torches your authority to be scratching your head in front of YouTube while yelling at someone to remain focused.The New York City Ballet home workouts on YouTube are incredible. One day, when I have £1m, I will tell you what the 12-year-old made of them."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4009b3187ced51fb7ad808f3b0096984f5785dc1/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1eeb13d6c7a0aa890f043a5f5bbd34f5","title":"singing with people connects you how four uk streets are living with lockdown","story":"Singalongs, curry clubs, seed swaps: neighbours are coming together in a way they hope will live on. Four photographers capture a community near them. Interviews by  Emine SanerSome put out bunting, others brought out a mirrorball, many dressed up. Banner Road’s second street disco, held on a sunny weekend in Bristol, brought people out to dance and chat (all spaced by social distance markers painted on the road) and eventually join in the Macarena together.“I was thinking of a group dance we could do and everyone knows the Macarena,” says Jesse Meadows, one of the organisers, along with her three housemates. An actor, Meadows has lived on the street for six years and has been a driving force behind its community feel. A few years ago, keen to meet more neighbours, she organised a street drink. Last month, she helped set up a support group one neighbour printed flyers, another delivered them, and their WhatsApp group now has more than 70 members who can ask for help with anything from shopping to collecting prescriptions. Meadows currently shops for a woman she has never met, leaving her groceries outside her front door. Neighbours have been sharing seeds one resident left Easter eggs on doorsteps for the children. Before the one-hour street disco, residents from the whole street took part in a clean-up.Nurse Maya Vaitilingam has lived on Banner Road for 21 years, and the Easter weekend disco was a godsend. She is currently unable to work, while she looks after her disabled daughter. “She has not been at school or had any respite for nearly a month now, so for me to feel I have support from the local community is great,” Vaitilingam says. “The ability to get together and have a chat at a distance… everyone is really conscious of protecting the vulnerable.” The street disco has become something for her daughter to look forward to. “She is non-verbal, but she really enjoys music. So for her to be outside and have a bit of a dance is lovely.”Most of the terrace houses on Banner Road have steps leading up to the front door and people have taken to sitting on them and chatting to neighbours passing by. “Hopefully, when this is all over, this sense of community will remain,” Meadows says. “And this time, we can do things in close proximity.”“Our worlds have shrunk and our street has become our world,” says photographer Christian Sinibaldi, who works regularly for the , and shot Pope Francis for Weekend magazine. Last month he started taking portraits of the people who live on his road, having found the idea of lockdown difficult at first he was used to travelling and meeting people for work. But if he couldn’t go anywhere, he could at least turn his attention to what was happening outside his front door.For the past eight years Sinibaldi has lived on Evering Road in Hackney, east London, a long residential street which links the rapidly-gentrifying Clapton at one end and the more affluent Stoke Newington at the other. An attractive, leafy stretch with a mix of Victorian houses, mostly converted, and small blocks of flats, it also has a notorious past: Reggie Kray murdered Jack McVitie here in 1967.So far Sinibaldi has photographed around 35 households, with plans to shoot many more, posting them on Instagram (@everingroad). Before lockdown, he knew four or five people on Evering Road now, he’s met around 100. While there has been a large influx of younger people, he was interested in the residents who were here long before the coffee shops and pop-up art galleries. Joyce has lived on the road for 50 years and is close to her neighbour, Helena. Desmond has lived in the area for 63 years, and told Sinibaldi he is “simply missing the freedom to walk around. We don’t think about freedom, in the same way we don’t think about our feet until we are unable to walk.”Taking these photographs has changed his relationship with his street, Sinibaldi says. It’s one thing to walk down it on the way to somewhere else, “it’s another to ‘observe’ it. I’ve made a lot of new friends, and been promised lots of barbecues and beers when we’re all allowed to meet up in the future. London, generally, is a fairly inidualistic place and everybody minds their own business. Now, when I walk up and down, people say hello all the time.”It was Al Lewis’s turn to lead the Friday-night singalong, and the Beatles’ All You Need Is Love was the song that got sung the loudest. “Because of the sentiment,” he says. “And that was the last one, so everyone had loosened up and their inhibitions had gone.”Organised by Eoghan Walsh, a primary school teacher who has lived on this pretty row of bay-fronted terrace houses for three years, it was Northumberland Street’s third singalong. Walsh is a member of a Facebook group set up for the wider Canton area in west Cardiff, where someone had suggested communal singing as a way to lift the spirits during lockdown. They asked Walsh to take care of it, “because they know I’m not shy. We saw song being used in Italy in the bad times, and I know that this whole thing has really brought us together. People aren’t getting out. But they know that on a Friday at 6.30pm, they’re going to come out and see smiling faces.”The Canton Community Singers Facebook group has since grown, and Walsh hopes other streets will join them. This week, Lewis, a singer-songwriter, chose Valerie by the Zutons, Delilah by Tom Jones, and the Beatles’ classic. “You try and choose songs that everyone will know,” he says. “We had lots of people come out of their front doors, or at their windows. The sound bounces off the houses.” One resident joined him on a kazoo.Adrienne Earls, who runs a charity matching volunteers with different projects, has lived on the street for nine years. Until last month, she knew only her next-door neighbours and a couple of other people now she is part of the street’s WhatsApp group, set up since the lockdown to offer support to anyone who needs it. (There are other street-based initiatives, including one woman who collects weekly donations for the local food bank.)Earls’ two-year-old son has chronic lung issues, which means she and her husband decided to self-isolate early. The WhatsApp group has brought them a joyful sense of community, “and the security of knowing, because we’re both non-drivers, that if anything was to happen to our son, there are lots of people on the street who could help”. Another resident, Lynne Williams, who is in her 70s and self-isolating with her dog Gryff Rhys Bones, hasn’t needed help yet. “But I know that if I was ill, Gryff would get his walk. It’s a security blanket.” She also loves the weekly singalong. “Delilah was a brilliant choice, it’s just so outrageous. It’s a bit of much-needed fun right now.”Friday night, Earls says, “is the highlight of my week. Singing with people connects you – the smile you can see on everyone’s faces. People really look forward to it and the numbers grow every week. We can hear people in other streets singing as well. It just makes you feel a bit more united.”There is bunting strung between the houses of the two men who take it in turns to DJ at the street disco held every Sunday morning on Kingsmead Road in south London. It is already a road with an active community spirit: there have been annual street parties since 2012. Once the country went into lockdown, one resident, Sonia, coordinated the delivery of flyers to every house, offering support to people. Those with gardens have been cutting flowers and leaving them on the doorsteps of neighbours who live in flats. Others have been sharing the bread they’ve baked, or swapping plants. People have been decluttering and recycling things to other households. One man, Parin, who lives in a neighbouring street, has been running a popular curry-cooking club on Google hangouts. And now there is the Sunday-morning disco.“I think there are a lot of good things coming out of what is a very difficult time,” says Rob Cockburn, a lawyer and one of the DJs behind the event. “There’s no reason why we should only have this strength of community in adverse times. We should remind ourselves to keep this going.”People observe social distancing but come out in the street to dance, or just sway by their front gates. “Rob normally puts on a costume,” says Simon Lycett, who runs an event floristry company. “Some of the kids will get their coloured chalks out and scribble on the pavement, and people will jig around in the street.”Clare Timmins, a civil servant, has lived on the street for 15 years. She is a single mother to two children, and a rescue bulldog. She lives with several chronic health conditions and recently spent 10 weeks in hospital, before being discharged into the lockdown, so needs to shield herself. Timmins kept in contact with her neighbours through the street WhatsApp group while she was in hospital. “It was wonderful to know that I was coming back to this street with people who cared for each other,” she says. As we talk, a neighbour comes by to drop off a roast chicken. This week it was the turn of Barny North, who works in digital media and has lived on the street for nine years, to DJ. He says he spent a lot of the week thinking about his playlist. “It’s very eclectic. A bit of pop. Mostly jazz, a bit of RnB, a bit of reggae.” His final track was Nina Simone’s Feeling Good.North’s neighbour Andrea Mulligan says Barny and Rob have mastered the art of DJing for a motley lockdown crowd. “In this time of not being physically close to people, you are enjoying a moment at the same time. We come to our gates and give people a wave and just enjoy the music. It’s a nice moment of unity.”• Comments on this piece are premoderated to ensure the discussion remains on the topics raised by the article.

All flights on EU carriers within, or into the EU, and all flights leaving from an EU airport, are protected by the EU’s “denied boarding” rules, which require a full refund in seven days when flights are cancelled.The problem for consumers is that enforcing these rights is proving very difficult. After initially promising to refund passengers within 20 working days, Ryanair has now said passengers should accept vouchers valid for 12 months, or wait until the Covid-19 pandemic is over for a refund.Refunds at British Airways are only being processed by customer services which, of course, is impossible to contact. easyJet, initially only offered refunds through customer services but now has a web portal to request refunds.Note: the EU cancellation rules do not apply to non-EU carriers where the flight started outside the EU – for example, a Korean Air flight from Seoul to London.Taking the offer of replacement vouchers in the current climate is highly risky given the airline may not be around in six months. While some will be happy to accept vouchers, many will not.Coby Benson of the specialist flight compensation lawyers, Bott and Co, advises passengers to submit their refund request in writing, using the following text:If the airline does not respond or does not agree then the passenger can either issue court proceedings or use Alternative Dispute Resolution.If your flight cost more than £100 and was booked using a credit card, you can hold the card provider jointly liable. When things calm down we suspect many passengers will be forced down this route.The fact that the government advised against all but essential travel means travel insurance policies should pay foreign trip cancellation claims provided you bought your policy before the pandemic was declared on 11 March."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7fb60eb89c86a0767b8c3d5e29d72959c309a3f9/0_0_3315_1990/master/3315.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d844a34596a25742ac12c2d76a9f73e1","title":"coronavirus refunds fans ticket policies","story":"With thousands of live events axed or rescheduled, many fans are finding it tricky to get money backThe coronavirus shutdown has cut a swathe through the world’s cultural events, with UK casualties ranging from the Glastonbury festival to thousands of gigs and theatre performances.Theatre and music fans whose plans have been dashed are reporting long waits for refunds, with some claiming that companies are trying to fob them off with credit vouchers rather than giving them their money back.With the original dates for some events having passed, ticket firms, promoters and venues have been contacting affected customers – but they often seem to be reluctant to address the “R” word: refund.The UK’s Society of Ticket Agents and Retailers (Star) – to which almost all leading ticket companies belong – has made clear that if an event is cancelled customers are entitled to a refund of at least the face value of the ticket. The same is true if an event has been rescheduled and you are unable to attend the new date.Some acts have avoided leaving fans in limbo. On Monday, Bon Jovi axed their 2020 tour, saying that cancelling, rather than postponing, “will enable ticketholders to get refunds to help pay their bills or buy groceries”.But many concerts and other events have been rescheduled for later this year or 2021, with existing tickets valid for the new date.Many fans will be happy to stick with their booking. Glastonbury has offered the 135,000 people who had paid a £50 deposit for this year’s event the chance to roll it over, guaranteeing the opportunity to buy a ticket for 2021’s festival. Given the annual scrum to buy tickets, the vast majority will probably do that.But some who bought tickets for an event are now in a much more difficult position financially and want their money back as soon as possible.One of the companies facing criticism is ATG Tickets, part of the Ambassador Theatre Group that operates dozens of venues including many West End theatres hosting shows such as The Lion King, Wicked and Pretty Woman: The Musical.Many ticketholders have complained on social media that they have been waiting weeks for refunds. On Twitter there are scores of unhappy customers, some of whom say they have been sent credit vouchers they do not want.One, with the username Just Jack, claimed: “I’ve now had to ask @ATGTICKETS three times for a refund on my cancelled show from nearly three weeks ago because they’re dodging the issue or offering freebies so they don’t have to give me my money back.”The same day another, Dan Clarke wrote: “I made my refund request several weeks ago but have still had no reply.” AndMeg Potter tweeted: “I’ve been on hold for nearly an hour trying to get a refund for my performance that has been rescheduled for two years’ time! Is there any other way I can get my refund?” ATG is responding to people on Twitter, telling them that if they have emailed in a refund request, this will be processed and they should disregard any vouchers.But you would not know that from the long statement and Q\u0026ampA about Covid-19 on the firm’s website. At the time of writing it does not mention refunds once – it talks about either switching to a future performance or receiving a credit voucher. And calling the company is not easy: on Monday,  Money rang customer services and was put into a queue. We gave up holding after 55 minutes.Asked about customer complaints, an ATG spokesperson said: “We’re really sorry about the delay. At the moment we are dealing with approximately 300,000 inidual bookings, which means we are taking a little longer than we hoped to react to every customer. We have brought in additional teams to respond as quickly as we can.”ATG said it was prioritising ticketholders for performances that had been due to take place up to 2 May, so customers with events beyond that date may not have received an email yet.In the US, Ticketmaster has been at the centre of a row over allegations it changed its terms on refunds after the coronavirus shutdown began. While that relates only to the US, the Covid-19 statement on Ticketmaster’s UK website this week said little about refunds, other than that because of the high number of cancellations and rescheduled events, “we encourage you not to reach out directly with a refund request”.Again, unhappy customers have been tweeting about their experiences, with many saying they are waiting for refunds for cancelled perfomances and that their emails to the company have been ignored. Ticketmaster UK says that for cancelled events customers will automatically receive a refund on to the card they used to buy the tickets – they do not need to do anything. If a show is rescheduled, tickets will remain valid for the new date, though if the booker cannot attend they can ask for a refund.While scores of ticket companies and venues are signed up to Star and abide by its code of practice, there are smaller festivals, local theatre shows and other events where the organiser is not a member and will have its own terms and conditions. In some cases these will be facing a precarious future. Some people have donated the value of their tickets to venues to keep them going.In terms of what is a “reasonable” period within which refunds have to be made, one ticketing expert says normally it would be about 14 days, however, these are extraordinary times.While many events have been cancelled, others are still scheduled to take place but with no guarantee that they will, leaving some ticketholders in a quandary. Some would argue that summer festivals now look less likely to take place after the government’s chief medical officer said on Wednesday that social distancing will be needed until at least the end of the year.At the time of writing, the Latitude festival in Suffolk was still scheduled to take place on 16-19 July, with headliners including Liam Gallagher and the Chemical Brothers. Inevitably, this is causing some concern. On 21 April, one fan, Elisa Schwarz, tweeted “… Latitude festival have mine and a lot of others’ ticket money and have not communicated with anyone if they will cancel and refund, £240 is a lot of money to some of us”.It is a similar story with the Reading festival, whose headliners include Stormzy and Rage Against the Machine. However, this event is scheduled for 28-30 August, so it could still proceed as planned.The websites of both festivals stated that the events would go ahead as planned, although the organisers were monitoring the official guidance from the relevant bodies. The Latitude website added that “there are no refunds, other than for cancellation or significant alteration of the festival”. The Reading website issued a similar warning.There is no guidance on how much notice of cancellation has to be given, though one small consolation is that in most cases, particularly with bigger shows, events are not being axed at the last minute. But for the time being, most ticketholders will have to wait and see.

Stephen Robinson, a care home assistant, enlisted the help of 93-year-old Mary Hurst and 82-year-old Brenda Finch to make a series of videos, which have been viewed thousands of times on the platform.In one video, Robinson and Hurst take part in the “flip the switch” challenge, in which people swap clothes to the sound of Drake’s Nonstop. The clip has already received 20,000 views on TikTok.In another clip, Finch acts out the lyrics to Dolly Parton’s 9 to 5, complete with an early morning glass of wine.“We had a ball of a time making the videos with Stephen, and hope they bring a smile to people’s faces,” said Hurst, who praised the staff at Anchor’s Heyberry House in Birkenhead for their dedication.Robinson said residents enjoyed keeping up to date with the latest social media trends: “I have a very close connection with both Mary and Brenda … When I told to them both about TikTok they were more than willing to jump onboard.”Family distributes hundreds of plants to neighbours with home ‘garden centre’When Craig Sullivan, a keen gardener, realised he had a surplus of plants, he put out a call on the hyperlocal social network Nextdoor to ask if any of his neighbours wanted any – and was inundated with more than 100 responses.He and his 20-year-old daughter, Marcella, set to work growing and distributing, and in just a few weeks they have given 230 plants to more than 100 local people, prioritising those who are vulnerable or self-isolating and families with children.“We’ve become a tiny two-person garden centre,” said Sullivan, 52, an internet consultant who has a large garden in Blackheath, south-east London. “But I sensed this need was about more than plants – it’s about people having something to look after, nurture and care for when all the world is in chaos.”Many are first-time gardeners, or are growing with few resources on balconies, so Sullivan provides growing guides to help people care for their plants. “We’re just going to keep going until we run out of seeds,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1fb9e77c4d61627062febe85cb15d6ddf013df8a/0_132_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9e846f386dd3b1c165e5721803385ca8","title":"how the 5g conspiracy theories took hold","story":"’s media editor Jim Waterson looks at why conspiracy theories linking 5G technology to coronavirus have taken hold in the UK, with dozens of phone masts vandalised across the country over the past few weeks Last week a mobile phone mast serving the emergency NHS Nightingale hospital in Birmingham was one of the latest targeted by arsonists who wrongly believe 5G technology is linked to the spread of coronavirus.

The transition can be extended by up to one or two years by mutual agreement.“Finally, we are ready to work to agree a fisheries agreement which reflects our rights under international law to control our own waters, \u0026amp provides for annual negotiations over access based on scientific principles. We won’t agree to continuing the Common Fisheries Policy.”The two negotiating teams have been conducting only the second full week of structured talks since the UK left the EU on 31 January. Barnier cited four areas where progress had been “disappointing”, including on a deal for future trade in goods.Barnier said the EU’s offer of zero-tariff, zero-quota access to its market in exchange for respecting social, environmental standards and state aid rules would give the UK unprecedented access to the European market.But he said the UK had “failed to engage substantially on this topic” and had even “denounced” the basic premise of fair competition.“It argued that our positions are too far to reach an agreement,” Barnier said. “It also denounced the basic premise that economic interconnectedness and geographic proximity require robust guarantees.”Throwing back the often-repeated words of British negotiators, Barnier noted the disparity in size between the two sides.“The UK negotiators keep repeating that we are negotiating as sovereign equals,” Barnier said. “That’s fine, but the reality of the negotiations is to find the best possible relationship between a market of 66 million consumers on the one side of the channel and the market of 450 million consumers on the other side. That is the reality.”Barnier added that devising such level playing field commitments had been agreed as a necessity “with Boris Johnson in our joint political declaration”, ratified at the time as the withdrawal agreement.After 47 years and 30 days it was all over. As the clock struck 11pm on 31 January 2020, the UK was officially orced from the EU and began trying to carve out a new global role as a sovereign nation. It was a union that got off to a tricky start and continued to be marked by the UK’s sometimes conflicted relationship with its neighbours.The French president, Charles de Gaulle, vetoes Britain’s entry to EEC, accusing the UK of a “deep-seated hostility” towards the European project.With Sir Edward Heath having signed the accession treaty the previous year, the UK enters the EEC in an official ceremony complete with a torch-lit rally, dickie-bowed officials and a procession of political leaders, including former prime ministers Harold Macmillan and Alec Douglas-Home.Lisa O\u0027CarrollMargaret Thatcher negotiated what became known as the UK rebate with other EU members after the iron lady marched into the former French royal palace at Fontainebleau to demand “our own money back” claiming for every £2 contributed we get only £1 back” despite being one of the “three poorer” members of the community.It was a move that sowed the seeds of Tory Euroscepticism that was to later cause the Brexit schism in the party.\u0026nbspCollapse of Berlin wall and fall of communism in eastern Europe, which would later lead to expansion of EU.Divisions between the UK and the EU deepened with Thatcher telling the Commons in an infamous speech it was ‘no, no, no’ to what she saw as Delors’ continued power grab. Rupert Murdoch’s Sun newspaper ratchets up its opposition to Europe with a two-fingered “Up yours Delors” front page.A collapse in the pound forced prime minister John Major and the then chancellor Norman Lamont to pull the UK out of the Exchange Rate Mechanism.On 1 January, customs checks and duties were removed across the bloc. Thatcher hailed the vision of “a single market without barriers – visible or invisible – giving you direct and unhindered access to the purchasing power of over 300 million of the world’s wealthiest and most prosperous people.Tory rebels vote against the treaty that paved the way for the creation of the European Union. John Major won the vote the following day in a pyrrhic victory.\u0026nbspTony Blair patches up the relationship. Signs up to social charter and workers\u0027 rights.Nigel Farage elected an MEP and immediately goes on the offensive in Brussels. “Our interests are best served by not being a member of this club,” he said in his maiden speech. “The level playing field is about as level as the decks of the Titanic after it hit an iceberg.”Chancellor Gordon Brown decides the UK will not join the euro.EU enlarges to to include eight countries of the former eastern bloc including Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic.EU expands again, allowing Romania and Bulgaria into the club.Anti-immigration hysteria seems to take hold with references to “cockroches” by Katie Hopkins in the Sun and tabloid headlines such as “How many more can we take?” and “Calais crisis: send in the dogs”.\u0026nbspDavid Cameron returns with reform package.In response a UK spokesman said there would be no progress until “the EU drops its insistence on imposing conditions on the UK which are not found in the EU’s other trade agreements and which do not take account of the fact that we have left the EU as an independent state”.A second problem area, Barnier said, was the UK’s insistence that the future relationship should be made up of a series of separate agreements rather than a single deal with a single arrangement for ensuring compliance by both sides.A third area of “serious difficulty”, he continued, was the UK’s refusal to put into the future treaty that the UK will remain a signatory of the European convention on human rights or recognise the role of the European court of justice in protecting EU citizens’ data when flowing between the bloc and the UK.“This creates serious, serious limitations for our future security partnership,” he said. The UK has said it would be unprecedented for a deal to include a commitment to remain part of the ECHR.“We made no progress on fisheries,” Barnier said of a fourth problematic issue. “On this essential topic the UK has not put forward a legal text. We have made no tangible progress. Despite the political declaration stating that we should make our best endeavours to reach an agreement by July.”He added: “The EU will not agree to any future economic partnership that does not include the balanced, sustainable and long-term solution on fisheries,” Barnier said. “That should be crystal clear to the UK.”The UK spokesman warned that Brussels had to accept that the status quo of the common fisheries policy would not endure but that legal text setting out the British paper could emerge in the coming weeks to aid progress.“The EU’s mandate appears to require us to accept a continuance of the current quotas agreed under the common fisheries policy,” the spokesman said. “We will only be able to make progress here on the basis of the reality that the UK will have the right to control access to its waters at the end of this year.” The negotiations are scheduled to continue on 11 May."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/99dc6dbd1fa729a771a3d16684ab84a5e1b2c46a/0_379_5726_3437/master/5726.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8bf3e5f144ea515f17ca304de91e774b","title":"children could be recruited by gangs during lockdown report says","story":"Children’s commissioner says thousands of young people are at a heightened riskA “real risk” exists of criminal gangs recruiting young people out of school during the coronavirus lockdown, the children’s commissioner for England has warned in a report on deprivation in England.The report by Anne Longfield said hundreds of thousands of young people are off the radar of “early warning systems” such as schools, putting them at heightened risk. It calls for the government to ensure that councils and teachers stay in touch with those most vulnerable to exploitation, and those suffering the “toxic trio” of domestic violence, substance misuse and mental illness at home. The findings are part of a paper focusing on the deprivation endured by England’s most vulnerable families“While the government’s decision to keep schools open for the most vulnerable children is welcome, sadly most of them are just not showing up,” Longfield said.“They are most likely at home, often exposed to a cocktail of secondary risks – a lack of food in the house, sofa-surfing or cramped living conditions, neglect, or experiencing acute difficulties due to parental domestic violence, substance abuse and mental health problems. Many will be caring for parents or siblings themselves in these incredibly difficult circumstances.”The report said the lockdown has removed many of the usual ways of identifying children at risk, with schools and other community hubs, including doctors’ surgeries, youth centres, children’s centres and libraries also closed.Longfield said she wants to see schools working with local authorities to ensure that all children known to be vulnerable are still being seen by professionals.“I applaud the efforts of some schools and councils to ensure vulnerable children are still being visited by teachers or social workers. I’d like to see this extend throughout the country,” she said.The report and data collected by the children’s commissioner found huge variations among local authorities in different categories of deprivation and vulnerability throughout England.The DfE said local authorities were receiving additional funding of £3.2bn to cope with pressures caused by the coronavirus lockdown, including in children’s social care, and that it had set up teams around the country to improve its information on the risks facing vulnerable children.“Schools and early years settings remain open for vulnerable children, who are encouraged to attend where it is appropriate for them to do so. We thank social workers and everyone involved in keeping these children safe at this time for their hard work, including continuing to conduct risk assessments and home visits where needed,” the DfE said.But Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow education secretary, said the government could not ignore Longfield’s warnings of the heightened risks.“Yesterday, the government significantly relaxed statutory duties on local authorities to protect vulnerable children. In light of this report, it is even more urgent that the government guarantees these changes will not adversely impact children in need and commits to reversing them if there is any evidence they are doing so.“Ministers must also alleviate the financial pressures on families which may be making the situation even worse, including ensuring urgent access to food where the free school meal voucher scheme is failing,” Long-Bailey said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ec5cda3058067202f43ff7cf1f28d4d813cb6a23/0_204_3701_2221/master/3701.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1f920e0aebfb309f69d2734c828cc92f","title":"london marathon race director admits event may include only elite runners","story":"The race director of the London Marathon has refused to rule out staging the event as an elite-only race in the autumn if social distancing rules make it impossible to run as normal.Hugh Brasher told the  that while organisers still hoped to hold the event with 45,000 mass participants on 4 October, they were now scenario-planning around 10 other options because of the global pandemic.“The flame is still burning,” said Brasher. “And is there hope? Absolutely. But you have to do what’s right for society. You usually have 750,000 people out in central London watching 45,000 runners. Then there’s the medics, the 6,000 volunteers and the transport system. There’s masses to take into account when making any decision.”When asked directly whether the London Marathon – which was due to take place this Sunday before being pushed back – might have to be only for elite athletes if social restrictions had not eased completely, Brasher replied: “Honestly, I don’t know. But in today’s society, you can never say never. We are trying to stay really agile and to keep scenario planning. And at the moment, I don’t want to discount anything until it becomes really impossible.”Last month’s Tokyo marathon was staged as an elite-only race, with the field reduced to just 300 runners and the streets largely deserted. Most major spring marathons subsequently decided to postpone their races to the autumn – but those events also look in doubt with no vaccine in sight and, ominously, the Berlin marathon has already cancelled its race in September.“Our decision will be made by the back end of August at the latest,” explained Brasher. “It will be based on the government guidelines, and what we and society think is right and what feels right.”Brasher would not confirm whether Eliud Kipchoge and Kenenisa Bekele, who were due to meet on Sunday in a clash for the ages, had signed up for October’s revised race. However he told the : “We always want to get the most competitive race. This was going to be the 40th London marathon, and its greatest race. It was going to be spectacular. But we want to make October 4 spectacular too. So that’s what our focus is.”Last year the London Marathon raised £66.4m for charities, again making it the biggest single-day fundraising event in Britain. And while Sunday’s race will not take place, organisers are still hoping that thousands of people will spend the day raising and donating money for charities as part of a nationwide 2.6 Challenge – in which people tackle something related to the numbers two and six.More than £1.5m has already been raised for the campaign, and Brasher said he hoped it would prove a lifeline for many charities which usually rely heavily on the race to fund their work.“The London Marathon is normally about so many scripts and so many stories,” said Brasher. “It’s the greatest athletes in the world with the everyday athlete – who are doing this incredible challenge with the gods of the sport such as Kipchoge, Bekele and Brigid Kosgei, on the same day, on the same course, with the same crowd. In fact, the everyday person gets more people watching them. That’s the incredible thing. And, of course, they are raising so much money for charity too.”“Sadly it’s estimated charities will lose £4bn in income as a result of the pandemic. But they are needed more than ever – and they will be needed more than ever as we come out the other side. That’s why we came up with the idea of the 2.6 Challenge, because charities are such an intrinsic part of society and they need our help.“The response has been fantastic,” he added. “And we really hope that Sunday and beyond will show how much we care as a society for all the charities that exist across the UK that underpin a huge part of what makes Britain great.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8079f7cf403ffa200ad5daf3867cbf08eae89c94/0_371_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cdd0018534a29527d2396d43e54f1e5c","title":"coronavirus has given cricket chance to rationalise crazy calendar","story":"The pandemic has underlined what we have have long tacitly known: that the schedule is full well beyond breaking pointTom Harrison is the sort of guy you want in a crisis. Mainly due to his masterful refusal to acknowledge the fact that there’s a crisis at all. As the chief executive of the England and Wales Cricket Board delivered his latest update on how the game intends to weather the coronavirus pandemic, you wondered whether he had been watching the same sombre bulletins as the rest of us.The forestalment of the season until 1 July, with the prospect of further setbacks to come, provided “an opportunity, as much as anything”. The challenge of rejigging a schedule already ransacked by cancellations and postponements was “an interesting experiment”. The spirit of cooperation within the game, Harrison insisted, was “very, very positive and optimistic”. By the end of it, you felt weirdly buoyant about the whole scenario. Hurrah for Covid-19! Three cheers for cricket! A clap for our brave, heroic stakeholders!There was something strange about the room Harrison was sitting in. Hanging on the wall behind him, in what you had to assume was his living room or home office, were about half a dozen framed photographs of idyllic, sun-kissed landscapes: the sort of generic pictures that often come free with the frame when you buy them. Blissfully deserted beaches. Swaying palm trees. Postcard sunsets. It felt like a subliminal attempt to convey a message of extreme calm.Of course, there is plenty to be said for maintaining a certain optimism at a time like this, particularly when there are some gut-wrenching decisions to be delegated in the weeks ahead. On the substance of those decisions, however, there was rather less to go on. Still no word on where things stand with the broadcasters. Still no word on the Hundred, whose fate will be decided at a further meeting next Wednesday. Still no word on what, if any, domestic cricket would take place in a truncated season.There are no answers, because at present there can be no answers. English cricket, like many of its overseas counterparts and in common with many other sports, has its hands tied by a schedule and a wider culture that for years has been geared in just one direction: towards more of everything. More formats and more fixtures, stretching ever earlier into spring and ever later into autumn, squeezing the gaps in the calendar until players are delirious with fatigue and the red-ball and white-ball games have been driven irreconcilably apart.Until now there has been no incentive to rationalise any of this, because nobody ever made their fortune in cricket by arguing for less of it. In a way, the pandemic has merely underlined what we have long tacitly known: that the schedule is full well beyond breaking point. That when you are blithely insisting it is possible to schedule four domestic competitions and four men’s international series in the space of three months, when you are unable to extend the season by more than a few weeks because that would bring it in direct conflict with a Twenty20 World Cup in Australia, a point of absurdity has long been passed.The only real questions, then, are what we lose, and in what order. The County Championship and the One-Day Cup, almost certainly. The Hundred will surely have to go back in the can for a year. In practice, it’s hard to see how the epidemiological tide could turn in time for a white-ball series against Australia to be sanctioned. England’s international summer could well consist of four four-day Tests, two against West Indies, two against Pakistan – the minimum length for a World Test Championship series – held without crowds at a bio-secure Rose Bowl or Old Trafford in September.As for women’s cricket, the ECB will surely be aware of the optics of busting a gut to salvage the men’s international calendar, while simultaneously allowing the women’s summer – six ODIs and six T20s against India and South Africa – to disappear without comment. But when asked whether he could offer a guarantee that if all the men’s international fixtures could be scheduled, all the women’s games would be played too, he pointedly could not.You could ask similar questions about other areas of the game: about counties going under, players and staff struggling to make ends meet, clubs shutting their doors never to open them again. But that’s not really the “growth mindset” the ECB wants to engender right now. This is, after all, a huge opportunity to imagineer the future of English cricket. And it’s only right we embrace it with the enthusiasm it demands."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6afdc07f8754579e9efe192089997ae31d5d41c3/0_323_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=85a2066a2d90ed34228bf3e7415d531b","title":"talking horses playa del puente can lift the qeii cup at generous odds horse racing tips","story":"The 25-1 available about Playa Del Puente in the QEII Cup, the most valuable contest on Sunday morning’s Sky Sports Racing-televised card form Hong Kong, is well worth taking.There is something damning about the “enterprisingly ridden” tag, in relation to a racehorse, the implication being that he couldn’t have achieved the same placing on merit. Surely that explains the 25-1 available about Playa Del Puente (9.40am) in the QEII Cup, the most valuable of three Group One races on Sunday morning’s card at Sha Tin in Hong Kong, to be shown live on Sky Sports Racing.It is worth considering that the progressive four-year-old deserved his second place in last month’s Hong Kong Derby, for all that Blake Shinn showed good awareness of the muddling early pace. Yes, the jockey made an astute decision to press the button before the end of the back straight. But it was Playa Del Puente who had the ability to pass the entire field in the space of about a furlong and then to pull clear as those rivals were asked to chase him.The favourite ran him down in the end but he finished three lengths clear of the rest. Is it impossible he could have done as well under conventional tactics? After all, he was a Listed-race winner in Ireland on his only run at three, with Western Australia and Numerian behind him. The absence of international raiders means there is not much depth to this contest. Playa Del Puente, the only representative of his generation, can get involved.5.45 The answer to a wide-open first race could be Telecom Rocket, who has a handy inside draw for the first time since he was beaten a head here in January. He has continued to run well but was coming from too far back at the end of races in which he was drawn 13 and then 12. From nine last time, he got into contention at the home turn but a bumping match with the eventual winner finished off his challenge. This race may work out better.6.15 In his five runs in Hong Kong, War Of Courage has shown progressive form against quality rivals over five furlongs. Stepping up in distance to six furlongs on the round course is a significant change but it must be a help for the son of Declaration Of War. His early pace can help him gain a good early position, despite a wide draw, with the canny Chad Schofield aboard.6.45 Schofield may feel he has his work cut out on Casa De Forca, who has been hard to win with since leaving Ed Walker in 2018, when he was known as Hombre Casado. Joao Moreira was beaten on him three times in a row earlier this year but the step down to six furlongs seemed to help when Casa De Forca was second to a hot favourite a fortnight ago and this could be a better opportunity.7.15 Though he won a couple of races at seven furlongs early in the year, Joyful Heart has been crying out for this step up to a mile since he moved up a grade. This could be a fruitful return to his saddle for Zac Purton, who has not been aboard since their comfortable success two months ago.7.50 The biggest talent on show here may be Aethero but this imposing youngster may need time to mature. He was odds-on for a Group Two against some of these rivals three weeks ago but missed the kick and then ran far too free, finishing last. A better show is likely here but he is hard to trust and will surely be a short price again. Hot King Prawn is rather more reliable and can get his first success at the highest level, having been placed three times this season. He couldn’t get to Voyage Warrior that day but that rival has a tougher draw now.8.25 Unbeaten in three runs at Sha Tin, Wellington looked a fair way ahead of his mark in his most recent victory, over a subsequent winner. The 10lb rise should be manageable. There is more danger in the step up in distance to seven furlongs, for a horse who can take a firm grip in the early stages, but opposing him does not appeal.9.00 The world seemed upside down when Beauty Generation was beaten four times in a row this season, twice at odds-on. But John Moore’s star is seven years old and can’t be expected to produce a peak effort every time, all season long. Consecutive wins suggest the ship has been righted and it’s worth noting that he was giving weight to some of these when he beat them in a Group Two three weeks ago.10.15 A memorably impressive Listed winner for Jane Chapple-Hyam at the July meeting in 2018, when he was called Naval Intelligence, Gold Chest has become a sprinter. Five furlongs proved a shade too sharp last time but he scored over six here in February and has more to offer. 10.50 Stepping up to a mile proved a help to Monica, a winner in February before two good efforts in defeat. This step up in class could also prove to be good news, if it provides the inaptly named gelding with a marginally stronger early pace, as his powerful finish may be seen to still better effect. Chris CookFrance Galop, French racing’s ruling body, has published a revised fixture list from a proposed resumption behind closed doors on 11 May until the end of August, with either one or two meetings each day and the first Classics of the season rescheduled for Monday 1 June, a public holiday.The revised schedule, which depends on government approval for a resumption, includes several trials for the French 2,000 and 1,000 Guineas at Longchamp, as well as the Prix du Jockey Club (French Derby) and Prix de Diane (French Oaks), which will now be run at Chantilly on 5 July.

He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that the government’s handling of the situation is worse than the Suez crisis or the Iraq war.Hare said: “To watch a weasel-worded parade of ministers shirking responsibility for their failures and confecting non-apologies to the dead and dying has seen British public life sink as low as I can remember in my entire lifetime.”The playwright, who has had a 50-year career in theatre – writing plays including Plenty, Racing Demon and Stuff Happens – said that “in return for lockdown, isolation, commercial disaster and social distancing” the British public deserves honesty.“They must own up to their mistakes, stop dodging and waffling and start to trust us with the truth,” he continued.Hare spoke about what it was like to have the virus, which he said would evolve rapidly and unpredictably. “One day it would be fever, next day it would be arctic cold, then it would be vomiting, then coughing, then conjunctivitis, then breathing problems,” he said. “Day 10 was five times worse than day five.”He dismissed those who claimed that “courage and love of life” had seen Boris Johnson through his coronavirus illness. “Those of us who’ve had the virus know you don’t under any circumstances ignore it,” he said. “What helped me survive were pure luck and the assiduous expert care of my first-class GP. Those two things only, not my fabled resources of character.”Hare has been an outspoken critic of the Conservative party since the 1970s and in 2016 wrote a  long read which argued that Thatcher and her heirs had created a selfish and ided society in which politicians and the people regard each other with mutual contempt.Hare also criticised austerity while praising doctors and nurses who have been “nobly putting their grievances behind them” to care for the sick. He also called for more research so that the Covid-19 virus is understood. “Unless we seek not just to treat the virus’s symptoms but to understand its hold and spread we are doomed to fail,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c9268bbaf07368817b86df4c06e1ba2df4d045cd/1_0_2601_1562/master/2601..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e25184c2d9aaa983a5f5acd01cc4a4b8","title":"dont let a weak bladder stop you doing the things you love","story":"Avoiding playing vigorous sports? Sex life gone from G-spot to pee spot? The London Clinic’s Jane Simpson explains what we can do to tackle incontinence – including kegel exercises that you can do wherever you are As a continence nurse specialist, I’ve seen firsthand how overwhelming and upsetting incontinence can be. Patients visit me when things have gone too far – their behaviours change and they’re suddenly avoiding activities such as playing tennis, having sex or even going to the cinema because they’re worried about having to race to the toilet. When you start avoiding things you enjoy, it’s time to take action.Of course, leakage can be troubling at any moment, but during sex it’s particularly distressing (it tends to happen during an orgasm or because of the physical pressure). But the good news is, it doesn’t mean the end of your sex life. In fact, patients always say they wish they’d sought treatment sooner. Even if you don’t experience leakage, sexual sensation and satisfaction can be improved, too – and who wouldn’t want that? As well as increasing blood supply to the vagina and penis, pelvic floor muscle training (or “kegels”, as they’re also known), can improve muscle tone and maintain nerve activity, meaning better sex.When it comes to treatment for accidental leakage, it depends on the type of incontinence people are dealing with. “Stress incontinence” is when we suffer leakage while doing things such as sneezing, coughing or laughing, and it’s common for women to experience this after having a baby, when the pelvic floor is weakest. Leaking during sports or sex falls under this category, due to weakened pelvic floor muscles. The other common type is an overactive bladder, or “urge incontinence”, which feels like you have to urinate suddenly and often.Pelvic floor exercises can help in both instances, but it’s really important to make sure you’re doing them properly – speak to a women’s health physiotherapist or a continence specialist if unsure. They’re simple – just squeeze, lift and hold the anus and vagina, count to five and repeat five times. Improvement is fast – you’ll notice a change in six weeks if you do them regularly. There’s also a brilliant app called MyPFF, which reminds you to do your exercises.If an overactive bladder is the problem, lifestyle changes are key – symptoms can be worsened by too much caffeine, alcohol, fizzy drinks, spicy foods and stress, for example. Certain medications can also play a part, as well as conditions such as constipation, urinary tract infections and vaginal atrophy. Bladder retraining is great – when you have an urge to pee, you teach yourself to hang on, which slowly expands your bladder capacity. It might also be worth avoiding high-impact sports until your pelvic floor is stronger, since too much exercise can make things worse. Medication and surgery could be considered with a specialist, too.I definitely sense a change coming in the way we discuss women’s health issues and incontinence, and it’s great the conversation is becoming more open. There shouldn’t be any shame or stigma around it any more – this sort of condition affects so many of us. I hope people realise improvement is possible and that once the issue is tackled, it really can be life-changing. Recently, a woman visited me in my clinic and said that just having a treatment plan in place has made her feel better. It really is the very least we deserve.As incontinence affects one in three women over 35, we should all be having more open conversations about this everyday condition that impacts women of all ages.

It implies it’s a time of things “winding down”, “ending”, “drying up”.Well, most things. Because often, along with menopause, comes bladder weakness. And for many women that means that things get decidedly less dry.Unlike when a girl starts her period, which in many cultures is celebrated, and in the UK is now respected with a government campaign to provide sanitary products in schools, when a woman’s periods begin to end, it’s seen as a change towards old age, towards a body that’s “done”. And even for those going through menopause, it has often felt pretty taboo to talk about the daily problems – especially bladder weakness.“Don’t make me laugh, I’ll wet myself!” might seem like an age-old joke, but it’s one that’s true for menopausal women. And when it comes to our sex lives, it’s no laughing matter. There’s fear and shame and women shut down, choosing not to be intimate for fear of leaking urine during a passionate moment.After all, when do you slip “I’d love to have an early night but I’m worried I’ll wet the bed!” into the conversation, whether you’re with a long-term partner or someone new?The good news is this conversation is being reclaimed by women in the spotlight, who are starting to talk about the final menopause taboo of bladder weakness. Well, we talk so much about starting our periods – why would we not talk about stopping them, and how this affects your love life?It seems there has been a realisation that no matter whether you grace the red carpet and TV screens or you’re on the school run with grandchildren or off to the office, menopause will happen to every woman. Take Gwyneth Paltrow, for example, who released a video for her wellbeing site Goop, saying: “I think menopause gets a really bad rap, and needs a bit of rebranding.” Her video Madame Ovary spoke about mood swings and sweats, while British actress Emma Thompson has joked how hot sweats mean she’s not cold on the red carpet.OK, so the conversation is shifting – just like we can now see a tampon string in a TV ad (thanks to Sport England’s This Girl Can campaign), women are no longer sitting quietly while they deal with the side effects of menopause. But there is one subject that still has to work hard to find its way into our vocabulary – bladder weakness.We can talk hot flushes, night sweats, mood swings – all with increasing honesty. But then there’s Nadia Sawalha, who struggled with incontinence in silence. The usually outspoken TV presenter kept quiet about bladder weakness until she was forced to speak about it after having an accident on national TV.Why is it the one part of menopause women can’t talk about? Well, leaking during the day is one thing – the embarrassment of needing to find some alternative underwear, for example – but when it comes to sex, it’s a different matter altogether. Women who have bladder weakness and might have an accident during sex are likely to close off to their partner, so worried they’ll spoil the intimacy that they don’t have sex and even make up excuses, or “blame” menopause. Intimacy is not synonymous with leakage.After all, when you’re not sure whether you might lose control of your bladder, being intimate isn’t always top of the list. Talk about mixed messages! Women are encouraged to embrace their ageing, to love who they are and how they look – to go grey with glamour and grace, or to wear a bikini with pride. Just don’t mention the bladder weakness, right?!As periods end and change, we have to adjust. The problem is, the world doesn’t seem to adjust with us. And women are left in a strange quagmire of going through something so natural and even primal in silence and, often, shame.And with two-thirds of women over 40 affected with bladder weakness, and many revealing it has affected their mental health, it’s time we became more open and honest about how bladder weakness affects us.Meg Matthews, who has been campaigning about the menopause and runs megsmenopause, says: “Bladder weakness, also called bladder incontinence, is a very common consequence of menopause. It’s not easy to talk about this topic, and, because women don’t always feel confident talking about it, they can feel alone. We need to understand that having bladder weakness is OK. This is the message we need to spread.”But just like when we’re younger, confidence can come back when we use the right products. Once a girl knows she can use a tampon or pad, she’s less worried about her period affecting her day-to-day life. And for women with bladder issues, it’s about a pad that can help you forget there’s even a problem. Then you’ll feel freer to have those more difficult intimacy conversations that you’ve been putting off – and perhaps that early night …As incontinence affects one in three women over 35, we should all be having more open conversations about this everyday condition that impacts women of all ages.

Ulay found Abramović witchy and otherworldly she found him wild and exciting. Even their initial encounter was propitious: they met in Amsterdam on their shared birthday of 30 November.The pair began to perform together, describing themselves as a “two-headed body”. For years they lived a nomadic lifestyle, travelling across Europe in a corrugated iron van and performing in villages and towns. Their artistic collaborations matched their personalities: they focused on performances that put them in precarious and physically demanding situations, to see how they and their audience would respond. In one, called Relation in Time, they remained tied together by their hair for 17 hours. They explored conflict, taking their ideas to extremes: running full pelt into each other, naked, and slapping each other’s faces until they could take no more.One of their pieces, Rest Energy, performed in Dublin in 1980, saw them balance each other on opposite sides of a drawn bow and arrow, with the arrow pointed at Abramović’s heart one slip from Ulay and he could have killed her. Uncomfortable viewing, this was relationship therapy played out as art – and, perhaps, vice versa.In 1983, Abramović and Ulay announced their ultimate collaboration: The Lovers. They proposed to be the first people to walk the Great Wall of China. Setting off alone from opposite ends, they planned to meet in the middle, where they would marry. Exhilarated by the emotional and physical scale of The Lovers, the pair imagined themselves walking alone across great expanses of the Chinese landscape, camping under the stars and concluding the journey with the ultimate commitment. They saw The Lovers as an odyssey and a performance in which they alone would be both players and audience.Eager to prepare, and ever-practical, Ulay laid in a year’s supply of dried tofu and seaweed, together with tents and camping stoves. What the pair were less prepared for, however, was Chinese bureaucracy. The Beijing authorities struggled to comprehend the pair’s motives for the journey. No one camped or walked the Great Wall as an “art project”. And who in their right minds would want to get married on it? Paper trails were endless. Permissions and visas were granted then denied. The pair were told that it would be too dangerous to do the walk alone and they would be required to have an accompanying crew. As phone calls, letters and documents were fired back and forth between China and the artists, years rolled by.In 1986, they went to China to visit parts of the Great Wall, to familiarise themselves with it and meet some of the villagers they would be staying with. Permission was finally granted for the walk to take place the following year. Then, inexplicably, the authorities postponed it again. A frustrated Ulay confessed: “I have been living with the wall in my thoughts for five years. Already I feel I have walked it 10 times. Already it is worn, it is polished.” Finally, having also agreed to participate in a film of their “study” of The Great Wall for Chinese Central Television, they were granted permission.Abramović and Ulay began their walks on 30 March 1988, from either end of the Great Wall, known to the Chinese as The Sleeping Dragon. Abramović, set off westwards from the dragon’s head at the Bohai Sea, an extension of the Yellow Sea between China and the Korean peninsula. Dressed in baggy red clothes, she was given the nickname Pa Ma Ta Je – big fat sister mother.Much of her trek proved arduous. Abramović was walking through the mountainous regions of eastern China. On such difficult and inaccessible terrain, she had to watch every step. On her fourth day, after slipping on rocks as slippery as polished ice, Abramović and her guide found themselves hanging by their fingertips over an abyss. She found homes and stables built into sections of the winding wall, and other parts that had been dismantled by locals who, under Mao’s encouragement to “kill the dragon”, had removed the clay and stones to build with. Once, Abramović claimed to have walked through a kilometre of human bones. Her accommodation in villages and hostels each night was often a two-hour trek from the wall.At every village she stayed in, Abramović asked to meet its oldest resident and for them to share a local legend. Inevitably these were dragon stories, often related to the wall itself. While built more than a 1,000 years as a defence against invaders from the north and west, the serpentine spine of the Great Wall had been carefully mapped out by geomancers for its “dragon energy”. Abramović would occasionally find copper pots placed along the wall, as energy spots: acupuncture points to control the forces that rippled up and down the creature’s back.Five thousand kilometres west of Abramović, Ulay had started his walk at the dragon’s tail in the Gobi Desert. Moustachioed and lean, with long hair and matching bright-blue drawstring trousers and cape, Ulay would have looked to a westerner every bit the bohemian traveller. Most of his journey would be spent trekking through China’s deserts. Rickshaws and donkeys were familiar sights, as were camels pulling ploughs. Ulay crossed the great Yellow River on a raft covered with sheepskins and, like Abramović, saw families living in caves within the wall itself. He managed to sleep under the stars some nights, while his bemused crew watched over him from their jeeps. Most of the time, however, Ulay also had to sleep in nearby villages. While the simplicity of the trek stirred Ulay’s soul, its fragmentation by bureaucracy and restrictions meant it was not the romantic sojourn the pair had dreamed of.To the Chinese who encountered the artists, they were of great curiosity. Having originally believed themselves to be the sole players and audience for their walk, they found everything they did was witnessed as if a performance. In towns and villages, silent crowds followed them wherever they went. In one settlement, villagers gathered to watch Abramović sleep. When she awoke, a different group were present, silently observing her.More by happenstance than planning, Ulay and Abramović met at the centre of a stone bridge in Shenmu in Shaanxi province, among a series of temples built in the Ming dynasty. They had averaged 20km a day, walked 90 days and covered roughly 2,000km each. As they embraced affectionately, Ulay shared with Abramović his desire to continue the walk “forever”. Abramović was unequivocal in her desire to get home. Ulay made a comment about her shoes that seemed to annoy her to his irritation she began to cry.While musicians, the Chinese press and even a fireworks display had been laid on for the pair, there would be no wedding ceremony. After a press conference in Beijing, they returned separately to Amsterdam and didn’t speak or see one another for 22 years. What had gone wrong?In the five years that Ulay and Abramović had been waiting for permission for the walk, their lives had changed irrevocably. Their work had became internationally renowned. Abramović was fed up with being the archetypal poor artist, so she welcomed the success, but Ulay had no interest in celebrity. An anarchist who enjoyed solitude, he rebelled against what he saw as a growing commercialisation of their work. In short, they had grown apart. Both had had affairs communication and trust had broken down.Ulay and Abramović were not, however, the kind of couple to be easily defeated. They decided to go ahead with the walk, not in order to marry but to spilt up. The Lovers transformed from wedding to orce. “Why didn’t you just make a phone call and break up like normal people?” one friend allegedly quipped. Because that simply wasn’t their style.To the Chinese, the dragon is an auspicious symbol, representing strength, good fortune and the elemental forces of nature. Walking the dragon’s spine had, for Ulay and Abramović, been intended as a great motif for transcending the barriers that ide us – it was to be a totem of love and reconnection. Instead, the wall came to represent a ision in myriad forms, not just physical but also the political barriers they then perceived between east and west, as well as the emotional barriers that had grown between the pair. Since planning to walk the wall, their differences had become more apparent and more difficult to reconcile. Abramović embraced the growing success of their work Ulay withdrew from it.Unlike in China, the dragon in western mythology is perceived as a symbol of malevolence, a destructive creature to be hunted down and destroyed. Abramović claimed that the idea for The Lovers came to her in a dream, a vision in which the pair would wake a sleeping dragon through their epic walk. They had, it seemed, woken the wrong dragon.Over the next two decades, Abramović’s work continued to reach larger and larger audiences her celebrity grew. Her work inspired Lady Gaga and Jay-Z, she made adverts for Adidas and she came to be known as “the grandmother of performance art”.In 2010, at a New York Museum of Modern Art retrospective of her work entitled The Artist Is Present, Abramović sat for eight hours a day – 750 hours in total – in silence, at a table. Members of the public were invited to come, sit and hold her gaze. They were kept two metres apart at opposite ends of a table. Contact was not permitted. The show was spiritual and cathartic for some, pretentious and self-indulgent to others. Many queued for hours for the opportunity to sit opposite Abramović for a few minutes or, in a few cases – and to the irritation of those in the queue – the whole day.One moment, however, was to capture the world’s attention and amass close to 20 million views on YouTube. On the opening night of the show, Ulay made a surprise appearance,  steppping from the audience to sit and face his former lover. He nervously stretches his legs, adjusts his jacket and, as Abramović opens her eyes to see him, the pair smile. It is the first time in 22 years that they have seen each other. Tears fill their eyes.Finally Abramović, in a flowing blood-red dress, leans across the two-metre ision and – breaking her own rule of non-contact – takes Ulay’s hands. Onlookers begin to applaud. It is impossible to watch this moment without also being moved to tears. After their arduous journey and a long time apart, they are finally reunited. A new dragon is awakened. Intimacy is rekindled.While their separation was a choice, ours – for now – remains a necessity. In time, physical intimacy will return to us all.

The navy said in a statement, “no final decisions have been made”.The House armed services committee chairman, Adam Smith, a Democrat, called for Crozier’s immediate reinstatement.“During this time of crisis, Captain Crozier is exactly what our sailors need: a leader who inspires confidence,” he said.A senior US defence official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Esper wanted to be sure that the final navy report would stand up to public scrutiny before signing off and stressed that the Roosevelt outbreak inquiry went far beyond Crozier.But Esper’s deliberations raised questions about whether political or other considerations might override the navy’s recommendations in a case that has seen Democrats vocally critical of the Trump administration’s handling of the matter.Crozier is one of the 856 sailors from the Roosevelt’s 4,800-member crew who have tested positive for the coronavirus, effectively taking one of the navy’s most powerful ships out of operation.Crozier was fired by the navy’s top civilian, then-acting navy secretary Thomas Modly, against the recommendations of uniformed leaders, who suggested he wait for an investigation into the letter’s leak.Modly’s decision backfired badly, as members of the crew hailed their captain as a hero in an emotional sendoff captured on video that went viral on social media.Embarrassed, Modly then compounded his problems by flying out to the carrier to ridicule Crozier over the leak and question his character in a speech to the Roosevelt’s crew, which also leaked to the media. Modly then resigned.News of the navy’s recommendations could boost morale among sailors on the Roosevelt, who were caught between the navy’s desire to keep the ship operational and its duty to shield them from unnecessary risk in peacetime.“When you are in the military you sign away a lot of your choices and your (ability) to share your opinions about some things,” said one sailor, speaking on condition of anonymity.“It is nice to see that us standing together for this (shows) that our voices matter.”The disclosure of the navy’s recommendation came just hours after the Pentagon announced that at least 18 sailors aboard a US navy destroyer – the Kidd – had tested positive for the new coronavirus.It was another blow to the military as it faces fallout over its handling of the Roosevelt, raising additional questions about whether the revamped safeguards in place to protect US troops are sufficient."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ac9d9960e4882b4eb6451c3b4653d7b8b2b396b/0_169_2617_1572/master/2617.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=25d86b4329b02e627a43afb980f406ef","title":"chloroquine study coronavirus brazil","story":"Concerns grow as the journal Nature raises alarm on serious heart risks associated with Covid-19 patients taking the drugsA Brazilian study investigating whether the anti-malaria drug chloroquine was effective in treating patients with Covid-19 was halted on safety concerns, after a high dose of the drug proved lethal for some patients.Chloroquine, and a related drug, hydroxychloroquine, in combination with the antibiotic azithromycin, has been touted as a potential treatment for coronavirus by Donald Trump despite a lack of evidence.The findings were published as a letter in the journal Nature raised alarm about serious heart risks associated with Covid-19 patients taking the drugs and the US Food and Drug Administration warned of serious heart complications.Donald Trump has previously urged Americans to take hydroxychloroquine, although he has apparently backed away from the drug in recent days, and on Thursday even suggested that injections of disinfectant could cure Covid-19 – an idea that was swiftly refuted by experts, who warned the public “please don’t inject bleach”.Researchers planned to assess their outcomes after 28 days.But after 13 days, six of 40 patients in the low-dose group had died, compared with 16 of 41 patients in the high-dose group. Furthermore, five patients in the high-dose group had underlying heart disease, three of whom died.“Despite these discouraging findings, several other observations prevent concluding categorically that high-dose chloroquine was toxic,” authors of a comment article said.Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine in combination with azithromycin were first put forward as potential treatments for Covid-19 in a French study described as “meaningless”. The journal later said the study did not meet standards for publication.But by the time the journal disavowed the study’s flawed design, media outlets had already promoted the unproven and risky drug combination. The treatment was tweeted by the tech billionaire Elon Musk and picked up by Fox News. It was then touted by Trump as a potential “game-changer” despite serious risks and lack of safety and efficacy data. At least one man has died and a woman was hospitalized after taking chloroquine.The letter published in  Nature warned of serious heart problems and risk of “sudden cardiac death” in patients treated with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin. In the letter, which unlike a study is not peer-reviewed, a New York City doctor described 84 Covid-19 patients’ reaction to a five-day, twice-daily regimen of the drugs. The patients were monitored on electrocardiogram. Both drugs have independently been shown to increase patients’ risk of “drug-induced sudden cardiac death”.Among the 84 patients, nine showed signs of potentially severe heart “malignant arrhythmia” which could increase risk of cardiac arrest, although none had heart attacks. At the end of the study, four patients had died of multi-organ failure, 16 patients were discharged and another 64 remained in hospital. The authors concluded patients on the regimen need to be “constantly monitored” for heart problems.Despite the lack of evidence that it is an effective treatment for Covid-19, some American hospitals have used hydroxychloroquine to treat seriously ill patients in the hope of some benefit.However, scientists have repeatedly urged caution. The American Thoracic Society (ATS) and the Infectious Diseases Society of American have both called for the drug to be used only in clinical trials.In clinical guidelines to doctors, Dr Kevin C Wilson, chief of documents and patient education at the ATS, said that while some lab results showed antiviral effects against the virus, they have yet to be replicated with patients.“Thus, the bottom line is, whether hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine confer benefits to patients with Covid-19 are unanswered questions.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dc640b85dfe81feb20d2717a2187292c25d056a3/0_0_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5dc224f092a77797bb80d59136b0ee6e","title":"coronavirus sparks perfect storm of state led disinformation","story":"Russia and China among state and other actors spreading fake news and disruption, say expertsThe coronavirus crisis has sparked a “perfect storm” of global online disinformation, cyber-espionage and disruption, involving up to a dozen states but most prominently Russia and China, experts have warned.In the midst of a pandemic that has killed tens of thousands of people, analysts have witnessed a sharp rise in deliberate misinformation campaigns on social media, which have occurred in parallel with attempts to hack international organisations at the forefront of the coronavirus response.Senior executives from Facebook, Google and Twitter are scheduled to appear before UK MPs next Thursday to answer questions about the spread of coronavirus disinformation.A report published by the EU on Friday accused Russia and China of targeting European citizens, including Britons, during the pandemic, and provided a range of examples.Echoing other experts, the bloc’s foreign affairs wing, the European external action service, said there had been a “proliferation” during the month of April.“Despite their potentially grave impact on public health, official and state-backed sources from various governments, including Russia and – to a lesser extent – China, have continued to widely target conspiracy narratives and disinformation both at public audiences in the EU and the wider neighbourhood,” the report sad.In the last week alone reports have emerged of hacking attacks on the World Health Organization and the US National Institutes of Health. The WHO has reported a fivefold increase in cyber-attacks on both itself and on the public.While some of the activity has been criminal, or linked to “dark PR” firms who work with governments and the far right, other attempts to sow discord have been laid at the door of governments – including disruptive messaging to US mobile phones that has been blamed by US officials on China.In that incident, according to the New York Times, millions of mobile phone and social media accounts were bombarded with fake messages in March, including one saying the Trump administration was about to deploy troops to enforce a lockdown.While Russia and China have been the focus of scrutiny for some of the attacks, others have originated in the US and mirror misinformation and untruths propagated by Donald Trump and some of his most prominent supporters in the US media.The EU report examined material published in nine languages and found that even fact checkers were being fooled by false or highly misleading content that was reaching millions of people on social media.EU officials cited the fact that a third of UK citizens believe that vodka can be used as hand sanitiser as an example of the effectiveness of the disinformation. Conspiracy theories about 5G telecommunication masts facilitating the spread of Covid-19 were also being boosted by actors seeking to promote false narratives, the report said.“In the period covered by this report, it was confirmed that pro-Kremlin sources and Russian state media continue running a coordinated campaign with the twofold aim of undermining the EU and its crisis response, and to sow confusion about the origins and health implications of Covid-19coronavirus”, the report said.The WHO and its director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, have been among the main targets for digital attacks since the outbreak began.The attacks have included racial abuse and the publication of cartoons of Tedros, an Ethiopian microbiologist and diplomat, as a dog on a lead being held by the Chinese president, Xi Jinping.Earlier this month, Tedros said he had been subjected to racism and death threats and said many of the attacks had originated in Taiwan, which has complained of being excluded from critical WHO deliberations.Tedros noted that Taiwan’s foreign ministry had not disassociated itself from the attacks, an observation Taipei rejected as “slander”. The attacks appear to have gathered momentum since Trump began blaming the WHO for the slow US response to the pandemic.First Draft, a nonprofit coalition investigating internet disinformation, carried out an analysis of 15,000 tweets in the week beginning 14 April which used the hashtags #tedrosresign and #tedrosliedpeopledied.Deibert cautioned that such campaigns have been seen before, even in the pre-internet era, around for instance well-documented attempts by Russia to spread disinformation blaming the US for Aids. But a combination of global connectivity and anxiety has amplified the intensity of the disinformation war over Covid-19.“This is a global event that touches everyone directly,” Deibert said. “The heightened level of anxiety means citizens are dependent on getting access to health information, often working at home. That anxiety means people are more likely click on something malicious.“We’ve been tracking it closely and you can see several different strands connected in various ways. There are different aims and different technologies. But what you can say is they all work in a communications ecosystem which, by design, has created an environment almost irresistible to malicious actors trying to manipulate, confuse and spread disinformation. Everyone is trying to further their strategic aims.”Paul Barrett, a New York University expert in disinformation and fake news, has identified similar trends and said that some malicious actors are feeding off each other’s disinformation for their own ends.“It’s a three-ring circus of disinformation,” he said. “It is almost impossible to pick out one strain and isolate it, because simultaneously Russian and China and Trump are getting in on the act and imitating each other more and more. It is incredibly difficult for an ordinary citizen to navigate what’s true.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bd2319a366952574a2a698a6174776750460fd34/0_283_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=d971aa69c28a281bdad764673215d506","title":"matt hancock can count on powerful support if not 100000 tests a day","story":"NHS chiefs and No 10 endorse the health secretary as flaws emerge in the structure he leadsMatt Hancock sounded tetchy and exhausted on Friday morning as he took to the airwaves once again to explain the latest swerve in the government’s strategy for tackling coronavirus: recruiting an army of contact-tracers in an attempt to track its spread.Asked whether his self-imposed target of testing 100,000 people a day by the end of next week would be met, he let out a self-deprecating laugh. The health secretary knows there’s a lot in the balance: the health of millions, his standing among the public and colleagues, perhaps even his career.Hancock honed his politics as George Osborne’s chief of staff, at the centre of the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government, with a desk in the office that linked Osborne’s rooms and David Cameron’s, and a seat at the table for key meetings.His Labour shadow, Jon Ashworth, who once worked for Gordon Brown, recognised Osborne’s talent for framing the political debate in that 100,000-a-day target, which helped to halt a growing sense of government drift.But he describes it as “a big figure, plucked out of the air” and he complains that contract tracing, which both Labour and Hancock’s predecessor Jeremy Hunt have been calling for for weeks, is only just being implemented. “Why are we only doing this now?” he says.Even at the time it was made, the 100,000-a-day promise was regarded by some colleagues as rash. But as the deadline approaches, Hancock’s team insist there is a fighting chance that it can still be met – with capacity dramatically increased, and all key workers now allowed to apply.And No 10 is, for now, throwing a protective arm around the careworn health secretary. One Downing Street source described Hancock’s work as “incredible” in an “unprecedented situation”, saying: “I would point you to our original plan to lower the curve and increase NHS capacity, this was our original aim and it’s been handled very well.”A cabinet source acknowledged that Hancock can seem “irritating” to fellow ministers, rubbing them up the wrong way in part because of his insistence on keeping lockdown measures in place to guard against a second peak. But they insist he is not becoming the fall guy in a growing blame game.“He might be rather irritating some of his colleagues but I don’t detect an operation against him in No 10,” the source said. “People are knackered and some very difficult conversations are going on about how things could and couldn’t have been done. But that doesn’t mean he’s being lined up to go.”Hancock, 41, is known at Westminster for his Tiggerish ebullience, and the iron-clad self-confidence that propelled him into the Tory leadership race last year (slogan: Let’s Move Forward).After he shuttered his campaign and quickly fell in behind the frontrunner, Johnson, he was rewarded with the privilege of remaining in his job – and now finds himself at the centre of the biggest public health crisis for a generation.Perhaps surprisingly there is sympathy, not brickbats, for Hancock among NHS bosses, who lay most of the blame for the shambles over testing elsewhere.The chief executive of one NHS hospital trust told the : “I think he’s doing a good job and most of the public think he’s been open and transparent. When he first became health secretary he seemed too young for such a big job. But, just like Jeremy Hunt before him, he’s really learning his brief.The CEO, however, fingered the department that Hancock leads – and the confusing array of NHS bodies that are a legacy of his predecessor Andrew Lansley, who reorganised the health service in 2012-13 – reserving particular ire for Public Health England (PHE).“The problem is that all of these arm’s-length bodies are separate to the rest of the NHS,” the CEO said. “PHE is a body made up of scientists yet it became responsible for the whole operational response to coronavirus, and left to operationalise its pandemic theory in the NHS, even though NHS England, not them, are the operational delivery arm of the NHS. Why did that happen?“Also, why did the Department of Health decide to commission these testing centres themselves? Why didn’t they just leave it to the NHS, who would have found a few hospital chief executives who know what they’re doing and they would have done it probably pretty well?”The chair of the board at another trust, a senior figure in the NHS for many years, said on Friday : “If you had asked me 48 hours ago I would have said that Matt Hancock was dead in the water over testing. But bringing in the army, increasing the number of testing centres and, especially, finally making it clear who is eligible for a test, means he will probably survive, because the capacity – if not the number of tests carried out – will probably go up to 100k.“Jeremy Hunt is right that we should have had mass testing from the start, like in Germany, so everyone who wanted a test could have had one. But I don’t blame the politicians on this. What advice were they being given on this by their so-called advisers and by PHE?“I feel sorry for the secretary of state in a way. He can only make decisions based on the evidence that he was given. Was he advised to ramp up testing and decided not to do so? If so, that’s one thing. But did PHE say that it wasn’t worth doing that or that there wasn’t the capacity to do so?”Ashworth agrees that it is difficult to disentangle which of the government’s failings lie with Hancock, and which with No 10 or the government’s scientific advisers.But he wonders whether the health secretary has challenged the scientific advice robustly enough. “Scientists are making judgments, based on data, and they’re making judgments about human behaviour,” he says. Asked whether a non-medic – the health secretary is an economist – would have the capacity to do so, he adds: “Hancock is immensely self-confident.”Perhaps the biggest judgment about how to weigh the scientific advice is still to come, however, as ministers debate which of the stringent lockdown measures to lift, and when.Hancock is described by colleagues as particularly exercised about the risks of a second peak of the virus – something Dominic Raab, deputising as prime minister, has also stressed.His allies reject the idea that Hancock has clashed with the chancellor over how soon constraints should be lifted. “You couldn’t get a fag-paper between them,” one ally insists, adding that he understands very well the risks to the economy and society of an extended lockdown. “It’s not as if Matt goes into the room thinking about everything through the prism of health.”They express frustration, too, that the government’s successes – including the dramatic expansion in NHS capacity as the huge organisation was repurposed to tackle the outbreak – are skipped over.But Peter Kyle, a Labour MP who has been critical of Hancock’s promises on testing and personal protective equipment in care homes, complains that his approach hasn’t served the public well.“He does not seem to be learning from his mistakes. Just as we saw with Theresa May’s government on Brexit, he overcomes one undeliverable promise by making a bigger one and it becomes a house of cards,” he said.“The inevitable public inquiry will have to look at how these promises came to be made. The system has infected care home residents and led to widespread loss of lives. There was nobody banging on the cabinet table about it for a long time. It was all about the macho posturing of who can make the biggest promise and say the biggest number and who can put up the most bravado for the cameras.”Born 2 October 1978 in CheshireCareer Educated at the independent King’s School in Cheshire before studying politics, philosophy and economics at Exeter College, Oxford, then an MPhil in economics at Christ’s College, Cambridge.He worked at the Bank of England before being hired as an advisor to George Osborne, rising to the position of chief of staff to the then-chancellor.

The inclusion of Downing Street advisers on Sage will raise questions about the independence of its scientific advice.There has been growing pressure on Downing Street in recent days to disclose more details about the group, which provides scientific advice to the upper echelons of government during emergencies. Both the membership of Sage and its advice to ministers on the Covid-19 outbreak is being kept secret.Warner, a data scientist, was reportedly recruited to Downing Street last year by Cummings after running the Conservative party’s general election campaign model. He is also said to have worked closely with Cummings on the data modelling used in the Vote Leave campaign for the UK to leave the European Union.The government’s former chief scientific adviser Sir David King said he was “shocked” to discover there were political advisers on Sage. “If you are giving science advice, your advice should be free of any political bias,” he said. “That is just so critically important.”Told that Cummings was in the 23 March meeting, King replied: “Oh my goodness. Isn’t this maybe why they don’t want us to know who was there?”King said political advisers were never on the equivalent committees of Sage when he chaired them and argued that Cummings, who is not a scientist, could report his own interpretation of Sage advice back to the prime minister.Other former members of Sage also said they could not recall political appointees being on previous committees. David Lidington, a former Cabinet Office minister and de facto deputy to Theresa May when she was prime minister, said: “I’m not aware of any minister or special adviser, certainly not in Theresa May’s time, ever having been involved in the scientific advisory panels.”In a statement provided by Downing Street, a government spokesperson said: “Expert participants often vary for each meeting according to which expertise is required. A number of representatives from government departments and No 10 attend also.”Late on Friday, Downing Street released a second statement. “It is not true that Mr Cummings or Dr Warner are ‘on’ or members of Sage. Mr Cummings and Dr Warner have attended some Sage meetings and listen to some meetings now they are all virtual. Occasionally they ask questions or offer help when scientists mention problems in Whitehall,” a No 10 spokesman said.“Sage provides independent scientific advice to the government. Political advisers have no role in this,” the spokesperson added. “Public confidence in the media has collapsed during this emergency partly because of ludicrous stories such as this.”Downing Street declined to say how many Sage meetings Cummings and Warner attended, or whether any other political advisers took part.Sage participants told the  the Downing Street advisers were not merely observing the advisory meetings, but actively participating in discussions about the formation of advice.In a letter to parliament this month, Sir Patrick Vallance, the UK government’s chief scientific adviser, who chairs Sage, said the “decision not to disclose” membership of the committee was based on advice from the Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure.“This contributes towards safeguarding inidual members’ personal security and protects them from lobbying and other forms of unwanted influence which may hinder their ability to give impartial advice,” Vallance wrote. “Of course, we do not stop iniduals from revealing that they have attended Sage.”On Friday, England’s chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, appeared to signal a change in direction, saying the public had a right to know who sat on Sage. He told a Commons science select committee that while it was important to consider security concerns, there was “absolutely no barrier” from him or Vallance. Asked if in the current climate revealing the names of who was on the group would boost public confidence in the scientific advice being given, Whitty replied: “Yes.”Several members on Sage, as well as scientists on its advisory subcommittees, are known to be frustrated at what they view as a culture of secrecy that risks straining public trust in the government’s response to Covid-19.Since the outbreak, ministers have stuck to the script that their policies are guided by scientific advice, while declining to reveal where the advice is coming from or what exactly it contains.Other countries have been more open about the scientific evidence behind their decisions, and the UK’s approach has raised eyebrows overseas.The New York Times reported on Thursday that Sage operates in “a virtual black box”. “Its list of members is secret, its meetings are closed, its recommendations are private and the minutes of its deliberations are published much later, if at all.” understands that Sage first met for a precautionary meeting to discuss Covid-19 on 22 January, then again on 28 January. It met a further nine times in February, and 10 times in March. It is currently meeting around twice a week.It understood that while the chief medical officers and chief scientific advisers of the devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have been allowed to listen in on Sage meetings, they have been doing so as observers. Unlike Cummings and Warner, they were not allowed to ask questions, having to instead submit them in writing in advance.While core members of the committee, such as Whitty, attend all meetings, other clinical experts, scientists and epidemiologists do not attend every meeting, but can be asked in on a rotating basis to provide specific advice. Sage tends to be guided by specific questions that they are asked to consider by the Cabinet Office’s emergency Cobra meetings.Other Sage participants at the 23 March meeting included Sharon Peacock, the director of the National Infection Service at Public Health England, and Ian Diamond, the head of the Government Statistical Service. Neil Ferguson, the Imperial College epidemiologist whose models have been central to government decision–making, was also present, along with fellow infectious disease specialists, Graham Medley and John Edmunds.Others attendees included Brooke Rogers, a professor of behavioural science at King’s College – who also chairs the Cabinet Office’s National Risk Assessment Behavioural Science Advisory Group – and James Rubin, also at King’s, who chairs a Sage subcommittee that provides specific advice on behavioural science.However it is the inclusion of two Downing Street political advisers that will raise questions over whether the structure of the government’s scientific advisory process is free from political interference.A source in Downing Street said that in March Cummings was playing a commanding role in responding to the Covid-19 outbreak. Cummings is understood to be close to Warner, whose brother, Marc, runs Faculty, an artificial intelligence company that the  revealed is involved in an “unprecedented” data-mining operation as part of the government’s response to the coronavirus outbreak.An accomplished data scientist, Ben Warner previously worked at his brother’s AI company, which has teamed up with Palantir, the US data firm founded by the rightwing billionaire Peter Thiel, to consolidate UK government databases to help ministers respond to the pandemic."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c893a4163c53847ad9362754d38133804fac7777/0_72_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=93ff1392808cb71f7d26e4383ea75b89","title":"tell us what are your experiences of private covid 19 testing centres coronavirus","story":"If you’ve used a private coronavirus testing centre, we’d like to find out what the service was like.

It is no exaggeration to say that the fate of many millions of people rests on the discovery of a vaccine for Covid-19 – the only sure escape route from the pandemic.Yet the optimism that accompanied the launch of Oxford University’s human trials this week has to be put in context, and the hurdles facing the scientists need to be understood.The vaccine hunters are trying to outwit an invisible enemy so small that a million viral particles could fit inside a human cell, but whose biological ingenuity has brought everyday life to a standstill.So what is the path to success?Traditional vaccines work by creating a weakened version of a virus, similar enough to the original that the immune system will be forearmed if the person is exposed to a full infection in future, helping prevent actual illness.The approach has led to some of our best vaccines, but is also fundamentally risky because there is always a chance that a newly developed attenuated virus won’t be as innocuous as hoped. Clinical trials have to be approached cautiously and slowly – especially when there are no effective treatments for a disease.A slow approach is not ideal in a pandemic.So it’s perhaps unsurprising that only two of the 76 vaccine candidates that the World Health Organization has on its radar have opted for this traditional approach.The rest rely on the fast-track idea that the immune system doesn’t need to see the entire virus to generate the ammunition to fight it off in the future. If the virus is the warship, the theory is that the immune system needs only to see the enemy flag to form an indelible immune memory. In the case of Covid-19, this flag takes the form of prominent protrusions, known as spike proteins, that form a halo or “corona” around the virus.Advances in genetic engineering have given full flight to scientists’ creativity in developing this defence.Teams around the world have moved at unprecedented pace, going from having the genetic sequence for the spike protein in January to vaccine candidates a matter of weeks later.But many of these technologies are unproven and the success of any trial is far from guaranteed, as this week’s disappointing results for the drug remdesivir show. Ethical questions need to be navigated to ensure the safety of volunteers.And then, potentially the most contentious question of all: if a vaccine is found, who gets it first?First into clinical trials, just eight weeks after the genetic sequence for Covid-19 was published in January, was the US biotech company Moderna, with its RNA vaccine.RNA is a single-stranded messenger molecule that normally delivers genetic instructions from DNA, coiled up inside cells, to protein-making factories that sit outside cells.In this case, the RNA instructs the muscle cells to start churning out the harmless spike protein as a warning to the immune system. Imperial College London’s team, this week backed by £22.5m government funding, is also developing an RNA vaccine, but in a form that hasn’t been tested before in people.“Some groups have skipped animal studies because their technology has been used in human studies,” said Prof Robin Shattock, who is leading the Imperial team. “We don’t have that luxury. It’s probably cost us one or two months, but it’s much better to be cautious and be sure you’ve got something that’s really safe.”Also testing their candidates in human trials are the Chinese vaccine company CanSino Biologics, and a team at Oxford University led by Prof Sarah Gilbert.Both are using harmless viruses that have been disabled so that they don’t replicate once they get inside cells. These delivery vehicles are known as “non-replicating viral vectors”.These teams had already tried and tested the approach for other diseases, such as Ebola, and had flasks of their vectors sitting in freezers, ready to go. A third approach is that of the US biotech company Inovio, a firm that has existed for four decades without developing an approved product, but whose stock soared after it started its trial earlier this month.Its vaccine uses DNA to carry instructions for making the spike protein into cells, which gets transcribed into messenger RNA, which then orders the protein factories to start pumping out the enemy spike protein.This might seem an unnecessarily elaborate cascade, but some think that getting the enemy flag inside cells and not just into the bloodstream could be important .“Clearly it is true that there are no approved RNA or DNA vaccines on the market today,” said Joseph Kim, Inovio’s CEO. “But I think it’s just a matter of time.”Finally, a fourth strategy simply manufactures massive supplies of the spike protein itself, and injects a dose directly into people.This is what the big pharma team-up of Sanofi and GSK are betting on. Sanofi is repurposing a vaccine candidate that was developed for Sars in the early 2000s, while GSK is providing an ingredient, known as an adjuvant, that boosts the immune response, which has also been tried and tested.It’s too early to say which option looks the most promising, according to Richard Hatchett, chief executive officer of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (Cepi), which is funding the development and testing of eight candidates.“Some vaccines are going to be very fast to clinic, others have tremendous potential to scale up,” he said. “And the challenge that we face is that there’s going to be a great deal of urgency and pressure to roll out vaccines quickly for obvious reasons. You’re talking about giving a medical product to someone who is well.”A few candidates will be filtered out in toxicology testing in animals. Others might fail because phase one trials in people produce unexpected side effects.There is a chance none of them will work.For some illnesses, including other circulating coronaviruses, the immune system wages its battle, then a few months later forgets it ever happened. Others, like chicken pox or mumps, trigger lifelong immunity.The truth is we’re not yet sure where on this spectrum Covid-19 lies.“Reasonable guesses are that there might be partial protection for close to a year,” according to Marcus Lipsitch, a professor of epidemiology at Harvard, whose team recently predicted that, in the absence of a vaccine, social distancing may need to continue until 2022. “On the long end, it might be several years of good protection. It’s really speculative at this point.”On the positive side, Covid-19 appears quite stable genetically, meaning that the spike protein that vaccines are built around should still look the same next winter.This isn’t the case for flu, which shuffles its genes around so rapidly that new vaccines are needed each year.There are also questions around the type of immunity required.The body overcomes illness through antibodies, which see off the virus itself, and killer T-cells, which eliminate cells already infected by the foreign invader. For some illnesses, antibodies do the heavy lifting, but the balance varies depending on pathogen and even across people.“An ideal vaccine should generate a response in both arms of the immune system - antibodies and T cells,” said Kim. He predicts this could be a weakness of RNA and protein vaccines, which are delivered outside of cells, meaning that killer T-cells are not likely to be recruited.There is also a chance that some trials could grind to a halt, simply because the pandemic has been so well controlled by lockdowns and other measures. “You need a certain hit rate in the population you’re vaccinating to get the statistics to show your vaccine is having protective ability,” said Miles Carroll, head of research at Public Health England’s National Infection Service at Porton Down.The possibility of “challenge trials”, in which people are deliberately infected, have been considered, but there are obvious ethical issues with exposing volunteers to a potentially deadly disease. “There’s a lot of interest in this … because it would really accelerate vaccine development, but there are some major hurdles to ensure the safety of the volunteers in that setting,” said Prof Andrew Pollard, chief investigator on the Oxford study.Vaccine manufacturers talk in terms of yield: how many doses of vaccine do you get out per litre of culture. And there could be significant differences in the ability of teams to produce the number of doses required to make a difference.Shattock believes this will be a strength of Imperial’s RNA vaccine candidate, which has the unique feature of replicating itself thousands of times once inside the body.“We can make the equivalent of a million doses within a litre of material,” said Shattock. “Many other vaccines would need hundreds or thousands of litres for that. It’s the scalability. Towards the end of the year we’ll be hoping to make tens of millions of doses.”“If our vaccine were shown to be successful, if everything goes well – and that’s still a big if – we could deploy it in the UK this winter,” said Shattock. “All these smaller approaches will hold the fort until a larger global solution comes.”By September there could be a vaccine – maybe several – that appear broadly safe and effective.That’s not enough to get a vaccine licensed, but governments are already talking about the potential for rolling out such candidates to high-risk groups, potentially including millions of health workers, under “emergency use” rules in the absence of this ultimate seal of approval.There are precedents for this – in the 2018 Ebola outbreak, more than 200,000 people in Democratic Republic of Congo received the Merck vaccine before it was licensed in 2019.“That might be enough if you are an intensive care nurse or living in an old people’s home, to say that for you, because you have the most to gain from being vaccinated, the risk-benefit balance is favourable,” said Sandy Douglas, an Oxford vaccine researcher.But very rare side-effects cannot be ruled out. And there have been vaccine calamities in the past – recently the GSK vaccine Pandemrix, given to millions during the swine flu pandemic of 2009, which was linked to narcolepsy in one in every 55,000 jabs.The principle of transparent informed consent will be critical, Douglas added. “In this case, that would include the fact that if you’re being offered a vaccine in October that didn’t exist in April, there will not yet be long-term safety follow-up experience, although we do have longer term experience with several similar vaccines.”Iniduals could be faced with tough choices – take an experimental vaccine or leave themselves at risk of infection.At the moment, many teams are trying all sorts of ways to develop a vaccine, but there is no coherent solution for the whole planet. Some are banking on big pharma swooping in with a blockbuster product. Sanofi and GSK, as a joint force, are unique in having the ability to manufacture hundreds of millions of doses without relying on external support.But multinationals are not built for speed and their reputations depend on absolute safety, so there is no prospect of this team making its vaccine widely available before mid to late-2021.Others urge a unified approach governments, the UN, the World Bank and the WHO need to agree a way forward before a lead candidate emerges.National governments are already making advance purchase agreements and looking to secure their own supply chains.Hatchett and others are arguing for a global commitment of tens of billions of dollars to ensure that any successful vaccine is distributed globally and according to need. “In global health terms that’s a very big number,” he said. “But if your point of reference is the global impact that this pandemic is having on the economy, then that’s a very small number. If you buy into the idea that the vaccine is the escape route from the pandemic then that’s a really good investment.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/50f5e6aa67340398d40838436fe49fff5a13738b/66_114_2719_1632/master/2719.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=dafd673feab558d9989110fdf6e7c645","title":"ourselves scientist says human intrusion nature pandemic aoe","story":"Leading US biologist Thomas Lovejoy says to stop future outbreaks we need more respect for natural worldThe vast illegal wildlife trade and humanity’s excessive intrusion into nature is to blame for the coronavirus pandemic, according to a leading US scientist who says “this is not nature’s revenge, we did it to ourselves”.Scientists are discovering two to four new viruses are created every year as a result of human infringement on the natural world, and any one of those could turn into a pandemic, according to Thomas Lovejoy, who coined the term “biological ersity” in 1980 and is often referred to as the godfather of bioersity.“This pandemic is the consequence of our persistent and excessive intrusion in nature and the vast illegal wildlife trade, and in particular, the wildlife markets, the wet markets, of south Asia and bush meat markets of Africa… It’s pretty obvious, it was just a matter of time before something like this was going to happen,” said Lovejoy, a senior fellow at the United Nations Foundation and professor of environment science at George Mason University.His comments were made to mark the release of a report by the Center for American Progress arguing that the US should step up efforts to combat the wildlife trade to help confront pandemics.Wet markets are traditional markets selling live animals (farmed and wild) as well as fresh fruit, vegetables and fish, often in unhygienic conditions. They are found all over Africa and Asia, providing sustenance for hundreds of millions of people. The wet market in Wuhan believed to be the source of Covid-19 contained a number of wild animals, including foxes, rats, squirrels, wolf pups and salamanders.He told the : “The name of the game is reducing certain amounts of activity so the probability of that kind of leap becomes small enough that it’s inconsequential. The big difficulty is that if you just shut them down – which in many ways would be the ideal thing – they will be topped up with black markets, and that’s even harder to deal with because it’s clandestine.”The pandemic will cost the global economy $1tn this year, according to the World Economic Forum, with vulnerable communities impacted the most, and nearly half of all jobs in Africa could be lost. “This is not nature’s revenge, we did it to ourselves. The solution is to have a much more respectful approach to nature, which includes dealing with climate change and all the rest,” Lovejoy said.His comments echo those of a study published in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B earlier this month that suggested the underlying cause of the present pandemic was likely to be increased human contact with wildlife.Experts are ided about how to regulate the vast trade in animals, with many concerned the poorest are most at risk from a crackdown. Urgent action on the wildlife trade is clearly needed, said Dr Amy Dickman, a conservation biologist from the University of Oxford, but she was “alarmed” by calls for indiscriminate bans on the wildlife trade.She is one of more than 250 signatories of an open letter to the World Health Organization and United Nations Environment Programme saying any transition must contribute to – and not detract from – the livelihoods of the world’s most vulnerable people, many of whom depend on wild resources for survival. Other signatories include representatives from the African Wildlife Foundation, the Frankfurt Zoological Society and IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature).The letter reads: “Covid-19 is inflicting unprecedented social and economic costs on countries and communities, with the poor and vulnerable hardest hit. The virus’s suspected links with a Chinese ‘wet market’ has led to calls to ban wet markets and restrict or end the trade, medicinal use and consumption of wildlife. However, indiscriminate bans and restrictions risk being inequitable and ineffective.”Scientists and NGOs are concerned that over-simplistic and indiscriminate restrictions will exacerbate poverty and inequality, resulting in an increase in criminality. This could accelerate the exploitation and extinction of species in the wild, authors of the letter warn. “People often seem more willing to point the finger at markets far away, as bans there will not affect their everyday lives – although they will often affect the rights of extremely vulnerable people,” said Dickman.There are also concerns about the impacts of an outright ban on a number of indigenous populations, such as tribes in Orinoquia and Amazonia, with representatives describing it as an “attack” on their livelihoods.Mama Mouamfon, who is based in Cameroon and directs an NGO called Fondation Camerounaise de la Terre Vivante (FCTV), said banning the trade would damage livelihoods: “Bush meat is very important for people in the forest because it’s one of the best ways to get animal protein. With this issue of poverty and people living in remote areas, it’s not easy for them to look for good meat,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/960c652e1798eb228615535fc838451a1eed2f2d/0_243_4320_2592/master/4320.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d2f3b4aa65230457a71e09d77f133eb9","title":"outcry as rich saint tropez residents given coronavirus tests","story":"Neighbourhood of Les Parcs de Saint Tropez reportedly screened as local hospital staff do withoutOn the sunny Côte d’Azur, playground of the rich and famous, lockdown life in Les Parcs de Saint Tropez is good.The Mediterranean – accessed via a private beach – is a little cool this time of year, but the luxury mansions and château here on the Cap Saint Pierre have swimming pools and if the temperature drops below 70F, as it did briefly this week, there is always the tennis courts or vast landscaped gardens.There is no need to carry an authorisation letter to go jogging when the 270-acre gated and guarded domain is chez vous.Now local officials are investigating reports that super-wealthy residents of the complex overlooking the Bay de Canoubiers on the French Riviera also had access to private coronavirus tests at a time when even local hospital staff face a lack of screening.The local newspaper Var-Matin reported around 60 of Les Parcs’ residents and their friends had been offered Covid-19 tests at a private unit on the grounds staffed by a doctor and technician. This was carried out as part of a “totally private screening operation” allegedly organised by the president of Les Parcs Association, Jean-Louis Oger, a wealthy French pharmacist who has several clinics and laboratories in the south of France.Less fortunate neighbours reacted with anger. “Testing reserved for residents of Les Parcs and their friends under the noses of Tropéziens … a great example of solidarity,” one told Var-Matin.At the Saint-Tropez hospital, medical staff told the paper they were scandalised. “It’s not right that we don’t have a single test and it’s a nightmare to get hold of one,” a nurse said.Saint-Tropez’s mayor, Jean-Pierre Tuveri, attempted to defuse the row. He defended the tests, claiming the wealthy residents were willing participants in a clinical blood trial and accused social networks and the press of distorting the facts.In a statement published on the town hall website, he said the blood tests had been carried out on people “in a private domain and unpaid” as a sample to be analysed by certain, unnamed “laboratories”. And he insisted the operation was carried out “under the aegis of the Pasteur Institute” to whom the results would be sent.The test could not be used by local hospital staff because it had not been approved by the health authorities, he added.However, the Pasteur Institute in Paris, a national centre for developing and authorising tests, said it knew nothing about those carried out at Les Parcs.“This is a trial carried out by a private laboratory. The laboratory is doing its own thing in its own corner. We’re not advocating wildcat studies they need to be evaluated with the results of baseline tests,” it told French journalists.“He quotes us and links us to this when we were not at all aware of it,” the institute added.The regional health authority, ARS Paca, also said they had not heard of or approved the Les Parcs Covid-19 testing.“We don’t know anything about it and we’re going to conduct an investigation to get to the bottom of it,” an ARS spokesperson said.Sébastien Debeaumont, director of ARS Paca, confirmed this, adding that any Covid-19 centre had to be meet very specific regulation. “We knew nothing about this local initiative, having not been informed in advance, he said.The starting price for a basic 400 sqm house with a 5,000 sqm garden but no sea view in Le Parcs, first built in the 1950s, is around €5m, a price that doubles for sea view. Properties, some of which have tennis courts on the roof and swimming pools that cover to become terraces, rent for €200,000 a week, according to Capital magazine. Six heliports are authorised in the grounds as long as there are no more than two take-offs a day. Capital magazine reported that some residents are happy to pay €1,000 a month for 100 Mbits a second internet connections.France has more than 119,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19 according to government figures.

Instead these remaining assessment components will be graded by students’ teachers and feed into a school-issued Junior Cycle Profile of Achievement (JCPA), which is given to all students.This JCPA captures student achievements in a number of assessment elements undertaken over the three years of the junior cycle. Instead of traditional grades, students are recorded as having either “achieved” or “not achieved” an area of learning.Academic yearThe decision represents a major roll-back from Minister for Education Joe McHugh’s announcement earlier this month that junior cycle school-based tests would delayed until the new academic year.On Monday a secondary school in Co Galway – Coláiste Bhaile Chláir – announced that it would set its own junior cycle tests for students in May instead of waiting for exams in September.It was followed by Presentation Secondary School in Kilkenny, which also announced on Wednesday that it was going ahead with its own exams for its junior cycle students.Principal Shane Hallahan said the school was taking the move to avoid students being placed under “extreme pressure” over the summer.“The current circumstances are difficult and stressful for students, especially being separated from their peers as they try to prepare. I think we have to be conscious that so many young people have worked so hard for this,” he said.This prompted an appeal by Mr McHugh for schools to hold off cancelling junior cycle tests due next September until discussions took place with representatives of students, parents and schools.Official guidanceThis group met on Friday, and is due to meet again before official guidance is issued next week.In a statement following the meeting, the department confirmed that issues concerning junior cycle assessment were discussed and would continue when the group meets next week.In a statement, Mr McHugh said: “I welcome the progress made in several areas today, including issues concerning the junior cycle final examinations. As I stated earlier this week, I would urge schools not to make any local decisions concerning assessment at junior cycle level until the advisory group has concluded its discussions on that part of its work.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4231405.1587117157!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"have howth s red squirrels succumbed to invasive greys","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe narrow entry corridor for grey squirrels at Sutton Cross offered hope for the reds at a crucial balance in their breeding.Where viruses came from, in all their erse billions in a teaspoonful of sea, a forkful of soil, is still mysterious, even to virologists.In one hypothesis, they mght have been archaic, free-living organisms that evolved into parasites in another, they started as fragmentary genetic elements that united to move between cells and invade them. Either way, they reproduce, spread, and evolve to do it more effectively.Why some viruses evolve to cause disease is another mystery. But infectious diseases can limit or reduce populations of humans or wildlife .Researching last week’s column, for example, innocently prompted by the chirping of sparrows, I was led to the latest scientific hypothesis on their modern city decline. It proposed infection by a parasite, found at high levels in the sparrows of suburban London and giving them avian malaria.Today’s column prompted by wondering about the last red squirrels of Dublin’s Howth Head. Have they finally succumbed, like so many in Leinster, to the advance of alien grey squirrels?Even a decade ago, the native reds had already disappeared from many Dublin parks. At the Phoenix Park, for example, the first grey was sighted in 1979 and the last red around 1987.On the Howth peninsula, the reds’ last stronghold in Dublin, the first greys were seen in 2007. In 2011, an assessment for Fingal County Council by ecologist Dr Wiliam Carr, estimated some 25 remaining in the woods.The narrow entry corridor for grey squirrels at Sutton Cross offered hope for the reds at a crucial balance in their breeding. Grey squirrels were regularly removed from the peninsula by Dr Carr, rising to 38 in a year. But his traps caught only two male reds. The Howth colony, he reported in 2017, “will not recover”.Grey squirrels have been commonly thought to oust the reds by competition for acorns and beech nuts. A more insidious reason, as seen in the UK, is cross-infection with the squirrel-pox virus, SPQV. The greys can carry this without much effect, but it’s fatal to the reds, afflicting them with something like the rabbit myxomatosis.Although the American greys were introduced to Ireland at Castleforbes, Co Longford, in 1911, SPQV was not discovered until 2011, found in two grey squirrel populations in Northern Ireland. At one location, 90 per cent of the reds were infected and lost.In 2012 came reports from Co Wicklow and Co Dublin. Testing levels of virus in greys from these areas, a team from UCD warned of “a wave-front of grey squirrel expansion from Wicklow” to threaten the surviving eastern reds.By 2012 just three reds – two males and one female – survived on south Dublin’s Killiney Hill. However, with greys removed by Dr Carr, that year saw reinforcement. Fifteen reds, brought from the Raven Point nature reserve in Wexford, were released in a move supported by the National Parks and Wildlife Service.Elsewhere in Ireland, and notably in the midlands, the resurgence of the pine marten, a native predator, has proved a potent ally in removing grey squirrels and allowing the smaller, more agile, reds to share the woods.But meanwhile, another wildlife virus has arrived in Ireland, threatening not only wild rabbits but also the Irish hare.This is RHDRHD2, joint acronyms for rabbit haemorrhagic disease, a horror like myxomatosis. The first form killed millions of farmed rabbits in China in 1984 and then spread globally. RHD2, a form killing rabbits even faster, emerged in France in 2010.RHD was found in domestic rabbits in Ireland in 2018 and in wild rabbits in July last year RHD2 killed a hare on the Wexford Slobs nature reserve in August and another 17 fatally infected hares were found in eight weeks after that. The disease has been confirmed from at least eight counties, from Cork to Leitrim.Apart from the trysts of mating, the Irish hares lead solitary lives. But rounded up in nets for coursing, contagion could be inevitable. The first deaths from RHD2 last summer brought an immediate ban on coursing from Minister for Heritage Josepha Madigan.By October, however, a deal was reached with the Irish Coursing Club. A ban remains on netting within a 25km radius of finding the disease in hares or rabbits. It was lifted for Kilkenny and for other clubs enlisted in a hare monitoring programme supervised by vets.Moving west 40-odd years ago brought me encounters with dying rabbits, blundering around my feet in the dunes. They were victims of myxomatosis, imported by Irish farming interests. Natural selection of survivors brought their species eventual genetic resistance, as it will beat the even deadlier numbers game of RHD2.There are vaccines against the virus for domestic rabbits, but these remain untested for wild rabbits or hares and netting them for injection is thought too risky. I watch their solitary scampers on the hillside – a sign of the wild I hope will never grow less."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4237511.1587752355!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"an angel at the door one family s experience of night nurse","story":"Carmel Costello was “a very young” 73-year-old when she was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2016. It marked the beginning of a long interaction with the health system. When it became clear the illness was terminal, Carmel’s daughter Caroline explains, her only wish was to stay and die in her own home.That was not a surprise to the family given their mother had lived in her Artane house in north Dublin for 49 years. She declined hospice care and so Caroline and her sister Charmaine all but moved in permanently, taking turns to care for her.“She was never on her own,” Caroline says, looking back. “As she got worse it got to the point where the two of us needed to be there together. One of us would go to bed and the other would stay up with mum.”Things took a turn after one particularly challenging weekend. The palliative team pointed her family towards the Irish Cancer Society’s Night Nurse service. The nurse, who was called Deirdre, arrived and took over from 11pm to 7am.“I can only describe it that an angel came to the door,” says Caroline.“I can’t express how much of a difference it made to all of us as a family. It meant that we were actually able to go to bed but knowing that someone was going to be able to provide her with the care that we were able to give her during the day.”The family felt cared for, too, such was the level of quiet support. They had the comfort of knowing that they would be woken in the middle of the night if there was any deterioration in Carmel’s health.She died on a December afternoon in 2017. “She stayed in her own home until the day she died.

Photograph:  Crispin Rodwell Fifty days after nursing homes closed to visitors – with management acting themselves and not at the State’s direction – health officials are only now getting a handle on the scale of the devastation caused by the coronavirus pandemic among the country’s most vulnerable citizens.That decision by nursing homes to close their doors to visitors on March 6th was criticised at the time by Dr Tony Holohan, the most senior health official leading the State’s emergency response to the disease that has killed more than 1,000 people, almost half of them nursing home residents. This week, following the belated decision to mass-test residents and staff, and to examine in detail deaths in nursing homes, a grave picture has begun to emerge of the impact on the sector, just six weeks after Ireland’s first death from Covid-19.On Friday, new figures showed that almost half – 48.1 per cent – of probable and confirmed Covid-19 deaths in the State, 488 out of a total of 1,014, were nursing home residents. There were 2,500 confirmed coronavirus cases in the sector, which has 28,000 residents and 30,000 staff. By this week, there were outbreaks of Covid-19 infections in 198 nursing homes, more than one in every three of the 420 private homes and the 120 homes run by the Health Service Executive. The response of the Government, the HSE and public health officials to the crisis in the sector has been criticised as lacking urgency.The Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA), the regulator for the nursing home sector, has been criticised too for, at this stage in the pandemic, asking nursing homes to fill out a 21-page questionnaire on Tuesday to assess preparedness levels. HIQA is also going to be carrying out inspections of nursing homes.“HIQA talks about preparedness on April 21st? We were surprised that they were issuing documents on preparedness at this stage,” said Tadhg Daly, chief executive of Nursing Homes Ireland (NHI), the group representing owners of private nursing homes. RedeployedDr Jack Lambert, specialist in infectious disease at the Mater hospital, Dublin, said nursing homes could not wait two weeks for HIQA inspections they urgently needed GPs and nurses to be redeployed from community assessment hubs, most of which, he said, were “superfluous” given how the virus has been suppressed in the community. “If somebody dropped a bomb in Dublin today, would you go out in two weeks and count the dead? You would form a war cabinet and have a response at the end of the day to fight the war.” The doctor, who has been treating nursing home residents on his wards, said Government and health officials had got the nursing home problem “terribly wrong”. The solution required is not the €72 million promised to the sector by Government, he said, but “boots on the ground” in the form of medical staff and expertise.“This has not been dealt with the urgency it needs. There are lots of good-meaning people in the Government but they are acting too slow or are too disorganised or they just don’t know what to do. They have lost the plot on what to do with the nursing homes and none of the strategies they come up with to fix the nursing homes are viable options.”The deepening crisis in nursing homes was overlooked because the focus was on preparing the acute hospital system for an overwhelming surge in cases that has not materialised. “The nursing homes got hit when our eyes were on the acute-care hospitals,”he said. One midlands nursing home has been waiting 28 days for a test result for a suspected Covid-19 resident. Dr Lambert said agency nurses working in multiple homes contributed to infection rates among residents and staff of different homes. A NHI survey released on Thursday found that more than 100 nursing homes were missing hundreds of essential nursing and healthcare staff due to Covid-19. Some 96 per cent of nursing homes (227 out of 236 surveyed) said staff had not been available or had been redeployed. The Department of Health’s National Public Health Emergency Team briefing heard on Friday that 120 staff had been redirected from HSE community teams to work in nursing homes. A HIQA spokesman said staff issues were a matter for the HSE. "},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"\u0026lsquoEvery part of me hurt. It hurt to open my eyes.

Photograph: Leon FarrellPhotocall IrelandPA WireThe HSE has expressed concern over the recent announcement that testing for Covid-19 is to be significantly expanded to cover 100,000 suspected cases a week.HSE chairman Ciarán Devane wrote to Minister for Health Simon Harris in recent days, it is understood, while HSE chief executive Paul Reid wrote to the department’s secretary general, Jim Breslin.On Friday last week the National Public Health Emergency Team, which is chaired by Chief Medical Officer Dr Tony Holohan, decided the level of testing for Covid-19 should be increased to assess 100,000 people a week, operating on a seven-day-a-week basis, for a minimum of six months.Within the HSE there is understood to have been worries about capacity and concern at the process that led to the announcement of the move, as well as what was seen as a lack of consultation.Both the HSE and the Department of Health declined to answer specific questions about the letters on Friday.Government sources said the Minister had received two letters from Mr Devane in April and that neither mentioned the commitment to increase testing for Covid-19.However, other highly placed sources said the concerns were about the process that led to the announcement of the 100,000 tests per week on Friday of last week.Labour leader Alan Kelly, who raised issues around accountability in the emergency team in the Dáil on Thursday, called for the letters to be released.“I asked the Taoiseach in the Dáil if there was any correspondence from the HSE to the Government regarding governance issues. Now we know that there are, and I am calling on the Taoiseach to publish these letters and address all the issues that arise as a result of them,” Mr Kelly said.Over 1,000 deathsSeparately, the Department of Health has been notified of a further 37 deaths of people diagnosed with Covid-19. The number of people who have died with confirmed or probable coronavirus in the State has exceeded 1,000.The number of additional confirmed cases of the virus is 577, bringing the total number of cases in the State to 18,184. Adjusted testing criteria, to be introduced early next week, will lead to increased referrals for testing from GPs. Dr Holohan said: “We think we should be able to do that within the existing capacity that the HSE has in place now, both in terms of the capacity to take the sample, and to test it in the laboratory.”Health officials also confirmed that five healthcare workers had died from the disease as of last Saturday evening. Some 3,830 healthcare workers had tested positive, 159 of whom had been hospitalised, and 24 were placed in intensive care.Dr Holohan reiterated concerns about complacency creeping in, and said that were the decision to be taken at the moment, “we would be sticking with the restrictions that are in place as they are”.However, Government officials are considering extending the 2km travel limit on households to 5km or possibly 10km as part of a potential future easing of restrictions. The State may also change its advice to over-70s who are “cocooning” at home so they can go outside for walks and possibly shop in supermarkets during restricted hours. They may be asked to wear masks outside their homes.Further relaxations being discussed include allowing older people to interact more with other family members.Outdoor, non-contact sports such as golf and tennis, which involve natural physical distancing, could also be permitted when restrictions start to lift.The partial reopening of primary schools with limits on class sizes and secondary schools only to Leaving Cert students ahead of exams starting on July 29th could also be permitted.

A Co Tipperary farmer has joined a class action lawsuit against the Austrian ski resort of Ischgl after he and four friends contracted Covid-19 during their week-long stay last month.At least 5,000 people, hailing from Iceland to Israel, have registered interest with an Austrian lawyer who suspects the village, local businesses and the region of Tyrol ignored health warnings about Ischgl being a Covid-19 hotspot.“This isn’t about monetary gain, someone has to be answerable because there was wrong done,” said Brendan Bourke (53), from Killea near Templemore.Mr Bourke and four friends flew out from Dublin on February 29th for a week’s holidays in Ischgl. They had four good days of skiing and spent their evenings in village bars, where there were occasional coronavirus jokes but no real concerns.He said the bars were “always jam-packed with people” and that “from a certain time of the evening staff have to blow whistles to get through with their glasses”.On March 6th, a day before they left, one of Mr Bourke’s group developed a cough just as they first heard about Covid-19 cases in Iceland among people returning from Ischgl.A day earlier Icelandic health officials warned their Austrian counterparts of 14 skiers having returned from the village with Covid-19. The Austrians suggested they could have picked up the virus on the plane back.Similar clusters were soon reported among Ischgl returnees in Sweden, Germany and Denmark. Norway believes 40 per cent of its Covid-19 cases can be traced to the Alpine village.Mr Bourke says he fell ill three days after returning, experiencing a cough, back and neck pain, shortness of breath and pressure in his chest.Between returning and falling ill, he attended two rugby events, visited a meat factory and at least one farm and did two school runs. He had tea with his neighbour but told his 91-year-old mother, who lives next door, to keep her distance.Super-spreaderOnce diagnosed, Mr Bourke self-isolated and neither his wife nor children have developed symptoms, nor have those with whom he had contact on his return.All four of his friends tested positive after returning and had mild symptoms one infected his wife and 10-month-old baby as well as four people in his office.While sick at home on around March 12th, Mr Bourke logged on to the Ischgl website and, via a webcam, was amazed to see skiers still on the slopes. Days later, Ischgl made world headlines as a super-spreader Covid-19 “catapult village”.Austrian lawyer Peter Kolba, organiser of the class action suit, says he is aware of 11 Covid-19 deaths to date of people with direct or indirect links to Ischgl.More than 500 people have already given him power of attorney in his suit, seeking answers on the eight-day gap between the Icelandic warning and the Ischgl shut-down.“Our main focus is on the authorities who, we suspect, acted too slowly with massive pressure from the tourism industry and powerful ski lift companies,” said Dr Kolba.Local mayor Werner Kurz has hit back at international criticism, saying the village acted in line with official advice as quickly as possible.“No one knew this virus, it was a new situation for all,” he said.Apart from a persistent cough, Mr Bourke says he has recovered from Covid-19 but has mixed feelings now.“There’s a sign in the main street in Ischgl, the first thing you see, that reads ‘Relax if you can’,” he said. “I can’t relax because of what happened there. I just hope there’s no longer-term health damage.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4231819.1587147602!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus brexit a key issue says us special envoy","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tUS special envoy for Northern Ireland Mick Mulvaney: “The president knew that Brexit is going to be a big deal.”  Photograph: Al DragoBloombergThe US special envoy for Northern Ireland, Mick Mulvaney, has said he intends to travel to Northern Ireland as soon as the coronavirus restrictions are lifted, as he prepares to assume his post.Mr Mulvaney said a key focus for him in the coming weeks is how the Covid-19 crisis will impact on Brexit. The British government’s plan to deal with legacy issues from the Troubles, announced on March 18th, also promises to be a focus when normal life resumes, he said. Mr Mulvaney, who was appointed by President Donald Trump in March, had been scheduled to make his first visit to Northern Ireland as US special envoy next month. But the coronavirus has put that plan on hold. “I have been using the time to familiarise myself with the issues. Obviously, Covid-19 is the focus of everyone’s attention right now. It’s a very fluid situation,” he said, speaking from his home in South Carolina, the state he represented in Congress before joining the Trump administration. Like millions of people across the United States, the former White House chief of staff has been working from home where he is based with his wife and three children, as states have imposed stay-at-home restrictions. He says he will visit Northern Ireland “as soon as the door opens”.Interest in positionThe Irish-American politician has been communicating with Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney, and Northern Ireland secretary Brandon Lewis in the past few weeks.He has also spoken to previous holders of the post, such as Richard Haass, chairman of the Council on Foreign Relations, who was appointed by George W Bush. Mr Mulvaney (52), who reportedly had expressed a long-held interest in the position that had been vacant since the end of the Obama presidency, said his appointment was a measure of the Trump administration’s interest in Northern Ireland and Brexit in particular. He said Mr Trump views the post as akin to the role held by his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who he appointed to manage the White House strategy on the Middle East. “The president knew that Brexit is going to be a big deal – it’s a big deal just generally, and in terms of North-South relations – so he said to me: ‘Jared is going to go and take care of the Palestinians and Israelis, you make sure things go smoothly over there,” says Mr Mulvaney. The husband of Mr Trump’s daughter, Ivanka, is widely viewed to have had minimal success with bringing peace to the Middle East. Trump and PompeoMr Mulvaney visited Northern Ireland in February ahead of his appointment, where he met with First Minister Arlene Foster, Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill and the new permanent secretary at the Northern Ireland Office, Madeline Alessandri. He also met Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and US ambassador Ed Crawford, a Trump appointee, at Farmleigh.The role of Northern Ireland envoy falls under the remit of the US state department, and Mr Mulvaney will report to Mr Trump and US secretary of state Mike Pompeo. Mr Mulvaney was replaced as Mr Trump’s chief of staff by congressman Mark Meadows last month. Like many in the administration, Mr Mulvaney played down the risk of coronavirus as recently as late February.Asked if he missed working at the White House, he replied: “I’m always happy to be home, but it’s kind of strange to be out of Washington at this time.” He says he still talks to the president and points out that Mr Meadows is a friend of his. Both were co-founders of the Freedom Caucus on Capitol Hill, a group of conservative, Republican lawmakers.

An EU official said Mr Barnier was concerned about the prospect of not reaching agreement ahead of June extension deadline. Photograph: Olivier MatthysPoolAFP via Getty ImagesNo progress has been made in the areas of starkest disagreement between the European Union and the UK in week-long talks on the post-Brexit relationship, held over video conference due to the coronavirus pandemic.Lead EU negotiator Michel Barnier accused the British side of failing to engage seriously on some aspects, and said never before had such high-stakes talks had to take place under such time pressure, which was all the more difficult given the need to battle the pandemic and its severe economic fallout.“In this context, the negotiation that has occupied us this week may appear out of touch. It has even been qualified as surreal,” Mr Barnier said following the talks on Friday.Both EU and British sources said progress would have to seriously speed up in order for sufficient progress to be made, and an EU official said Mr Barnier was seriously worried about the prospect of not reaching an agreement.“They listen politely to us presenting our text, but they don’t engage in some of the areas where they don’t have an interest to reach an agreement,” a senior EU official said.“We don’t have much time, and we see that in some of the aspects that the British authorities know for us, the EU side, are indispensable to have an agreement in the end, they don’t want to move. This is why Michel Barnier is concerned.”It was the first of three rounds of talks scheduled to be held before June, when Britain will have its final chance to opt for more time to negotiate its future relationship with its biggest trading partner.British sources insisted that under no circumstances would they accept an extension of the transition period, which expires at the end of this year.If no deal can be agreed between the UK and the EU by then, they will automatically begin trading on default World Trade Organisation terms, which is forecast to deliver a deep blow to the British economy and to its nearest neighbours, particularly Ireland. Even if a deal is agreed, British negotiators say they are perusing an arrangement like those the EU has with Canada or Japan, which would entail significant barriers to trade.‘Level playing field’The four areas of greatest contention are on the so-called “level playing field”, on the governance of the deal, on police and judicial co-operation, and on fishing rights, an area on which Britain has yet to submit a legal text of its position for negotiation.The EU has said it will not grant tariff-free access to its single market unless Britain maintains labour and environmental standards and guarantees it will not intervene to give companies an unfair advantage. Britain has dismissed this as unacceptable.On governance, the EU wants a single overarching framework while the UK wants a series of separate arrangements. The EU insists that Britain should guarantee continued adherence to the European Convention on Human Rights, and that the European Court of Justice should be the final arbiter on disputes that touch on EU law. Britain rejects the jurisdiction of the ECJ entirely.“We will not make progress on the so called level playing field and the governance provisions until the EU drops its insistence on imposing conditions on the UK which are not found in the EU’s other trade agreements and which do not take account of the fact that we have left the EU as an independent state,” a British government spokesperson said.British sources said they had used the latest round of talks to challenge the EU’s argument that Britain’s size and proximity to the EU made level playing field commitments essential, and they defended British labour and environmental standards.They said there was no question of Britain continuing fishing quota agreements with other EU countries, which Brussels has proposed.The two sides meet for further rounds of talks starting on May 11th and June 1st ahead of a high-level meeting before the end of June which will make the final decision on extending the transition.Separately, the Specialised Committee on the Protocol on IrelandNorthern Ireland will meet next Thursday. The EU has emphasised that agreement of a deal depends on Britain demonstrating that it is enacting prior agreements, including on arrangements for trade between Britain and Northern Ireland, which the EU insists entails regulatory, sanitary and phytosanitary checks on goods entering the North from Britain.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

No joint statement by the national leaders would be put out (a nightmare to thrash out over video, they said). Besides, the matters at hand were complex, and one meeting was not going to solve them.The leaders were bought the luxury of more time by a European Central Bank intervention in the form of actions to keep down the cost of borrowing for weaker economies and to support struggling banks.Ultimately, they indicated their assent for a package of measures that had already been agreed by their finance ministers. On the most contentious issue, of a recovery fund to counter a deep economic slump due to the pandemic and how to pay for it, profound questions remain.In recent weeks a group of states led by Italy had pushed an ambitious aim: eurobonds. This issuance of shared debt has long been a hope of those who believe it would even out the economic imbalances of the euro zone. In this instance it was promoted as a way to come to the rescue of the weaker economies of Europe worst hit by the pandemic.The push failed. But its supporters hung their hopes on two sentences in the speech of European Council president Charles Michel following the summit.“We also agreed to work towards establishing a recovery fund, which is needed and urgent,” Michel said. “This fund shall be of a sufficient magnitude, targeted towards the sectors and geographical parts of Europe most affected, and be dedicated to dealing with this unprecedented crisis.”Tied to budgetMichel’s remarks signalled two steps forward: that this recovery fund would go to the technical experts of the European Commission to be thrashed out in detail, and that it would be tied to the seven-year EU budget.This is convenient for the commission, which had been calling for a higher EU budget even before the pandemic hit.Money for the budget is raised from member states through contributions, and is then parcelled back out in grants according to joint priorities of the bloc. The commission can increase its firepower by using some contributions as collateral for borrowing, which it can lend out to member states at low interest rates in times of pressing need.This makes it likely that any recovery fund will be primarily in the form of loans rather than grants, contrary to the hopes of countries such as Spain, which have said direct infusions of cash are the best way to help struggling countries that already have more than enough debt.The commission has said it will lay out its plan for consideration next month. But the wrangling is likely to last much longer. The move has combined the ision over the recovery fund with the existing standoff over the EU budget, between states that want a cheaper EU and those that want to increase funding. And a minefield of differences will lurk in the detail.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons april 2020","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178Coronavirus latest news: Public should continue to seek treatment for serious illness, NHS chief says Contact tracing: how has it worked for other countries, and could it really help ease UK lockdown?Boris Johnson and coronavirus: what we know about his recovery and when he will return to work What needs to happen for UK lockdown to be lifted - and when is it reviewed?Coronavirus Q\u0026ampA: Is there a PPE shortage, and how can NHS workers use it safely?How does a coronavirus antibody home test kit work, and how do I get one?Has the UK passed its coronavirus peak?How long will the UK coronavirus lockdown last?

But potato farmers are hard hit by the country’s lockdown measures, which were imposed in mid-March and closed restaurants.“Let us all eat French fries twice instead of once a week, Romain Cools, secretary general of Belgapom, the trade association for potato growers, said. Even though the country’s iconic frites shacks were given special dispensation to stay open, many shut because of the pandemic. Those that stayed open have seen customer levels drop. The damage was compounded by the cancellation of Belgium’s many music festivals, where frites are eaten in huge quantities.  Belgium is one of the largest exporters of frozen fries in the world, exporting 2.3 million tonnes every year. But Mr Cools told the Het Nieuwsblad newspaper that the freezers were full and that the potatoes risked going to waste.He said a campaign with an anti-food waste organisation and supermarkets would soon be launched to ask Belgians to eat more chips at home, rather than at the traditional fritkot. Even Belgians cannot be expected to munch through three quarter of a million tonnes of tatties, Mr Cools admitted. “We are also working on sales to Central European countries that want to make starch from it, and it is also used to make animal feed and even electricity,” he said. Belgapom is also sending 25 tonnes of potatoes to food banks every week until the end of May and possibly longer. “Our entire potato chain is happy that, thanks to this action, we also contribute to providing the weakest in our society with tasty and healthy potatoes,” Mr Cools said.Frites are thought to have been fried in Belgium since the 17th Century.

It was his first time - and he was up for the challenge - but there was no way he was going to do it nude. In his battle to keep fit and fuel his desire to perform for a captive audience, the Yorkshire-born principal - who controversially made headlines after becoming the first Briton to join the Mariinsky Theatre in Russia - has revealed that he has temporarily swapped ballet dancing for life modelling. “It’s great fun, but jolly hard work because as a dancer, you’re just not used to holding poses because you’re always moving,” Mr Parish OBE told The  from the flat owned by his dance company. “Most of the holding poses we’d do for only three or four seconds. I mean, apart from holding a plank in the gym, I don’t really hold anything! So what may seem like a simple pose - holding for one or two minutes - had me sweating! I was like, ‘oh my goodness!’ this is like one of those hard pressure positions.”Mr Parish, who lives alone, has taken to reading the Bible, running circuits around St Nicholas Cathedral, and said that the global lockdown has left him missing not only the luxuries of Marks and Spencer’s Foodhall, but also the company of his fellow dancers and family back in Hull.He is also struggling to keep fit, feels his muscles are becoming “floppy”, and has begun using the radiator in his bedroom in a desperate bid to recreate a barre class. Yet now in his new lead role as a life model, Mr Parish has what every performer craves: an audience. The principal dancer was asked to pose as a life model over Zoom by his friend, the curator, Sasha Galitzine, co-founder of Quarantine Arts, a project to encourage members of the public to be creative during the pandemic. The proceeds of her weekly life drawing sessions are split between the models, and local London charities to help support vulnerable people.“It felt like I was giving a small performance,” Mr Parish said of last week’s life-drawing session. “It was nice to have an audience again. Dancers thrive on audiences so actually it was a nice experience to have one watching. “I was doing my ballet barre while holding my radiator and trying not to break it while doing my Rond de jambes, and actually I had a purpose, it wasn\u0027t for nothing you know, which was really nice. There was a cool audience watching and even painting.“Sasha asked me to pose a couple of weeks ago for a Zoom life drawing session, and I said ‘yes… but not naked! I’m wearing tights okay!?’ And she was like, ‘yeah sure, of course, no problem’.” Speaking of his struggle during isolation, the principal added: “It’s really hard. I mean, we’re not used to this. For any dancer to not be able to dance is like a fish out of water. It’s uncomfortable because you can feel your body changing and you’re trying to battle against it to keep your fitness.” Just before Russia began to impose its own social distancing guidelines in response to the coronavirus pandemic around four weeks ago, the Mariinksy company was in the middle of its busiest period, its annual festival where foreign guests are invited come to dance. “We were all knackered,” Mr Parish said. “Doing all these shows and training, and suddenly we stopped - out of the blue. It was like falling off a cliff, and there was nothing. I was like, ‘oh I should get some rest’, because I haven\u0027t rested in years, and I thought I’d feel better, but instead I just felt more and more lethargic.    The 33-year-old dancer grew up in the East Yorkshire village of North Ferriby, which earned him the nickname ‘the Billy Elliot of Hull’. In 2005, he joined the Royal Ballet.  Five years later he made headlines when he defected to St Petersburg’s Mariinsky Ballet after he was earmarked as “a raw talent” by Yuri Fateyev, then deputy director of the company, which has now catapulted him to global fame in his role as principal. Mr Parish has previously spoken out about how he was plucked from obscurity in England - where dancers were left “to develop, like a good wine or something” - to become a star in Russia where they were keen on nurturing “raw talent”. Now he said that in an “ideal world” he’d be able to have a relationship with both the Mariinsky, as well as his home theatre, the Royal Ballet. Last week, the Russian company began hosting its first of now daily midday Zoom classes run by dance coach and répétiteur, Igor Petrov. Perhaps more important than the fitness they provide, the ballet dancer said, is the company.“We’re like a big family and then suddenly when we’re all sent to our own places and we don’t see each other, it’s like being away from family,” he said. “But on Zoom, it’s just like normal, everyone’s joking around, pulling faces, cracking jokes, it’s nice. “Obviously if you haven’t seen your closest friends or colleagues for the past four weeks, and then suddenly you get a Zoom conference call with 90 people on it, everyone’s going to be joking around doing stupid stuff,” he added laughing.He may have swapped the grand stage of the Mariinksy for the social media platform, Zoom, but Mr Parish is clear on the differences between his respective audiences. “The art crowd is a little more… bohemian,” he said, regarding one artist’s request for him to turn around ‘so we can see your bum’. “We like that,” he added with a laugh. “Usually we have the coaches saying ‘jump high! What are you doing!?’.“The thing about shows is you don\u0027t know who\u0027s watching, you\u0027ve got an audience of 2,000 people in front of you in a big black hole, and the only way you can gage their response to your solos is how they applause. “When you’re playing in America, it’s a bit more whoopy and cheery, when you’re in Japan, it’s a bit more loud but without any sort of whooping, and when you’re in Russia, it’s sort of just claps in synchronisation.”However with the life drawing class, he said the direction “is brilliant”. “Dancers are used to it, and thrive on it, it’s just like being in rehearsal where your coach is always yelling at you to make corrections.“Since I was 11 years old, I’ve been programmed to take direction from different teachers, coaches and ballet masters - and being beaten into shape by them - so at least I know what to do!”Asked if he will continue life modelling, Mr Parish replied: “I’d do it again today if I could, I loved it, it’s great fun and it gets me back into shape. It definitely makes training a lot more interesting.”More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2020/04/24/TELEMMGLPICT000230145735_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqwD2sfO9joeQ6RY-qlTATNB2cSHopZMn-aCc647VHTAY.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"next phase government must give us three word mantra","story":"For this next phase, the government must give us more than a three-word mantra Having rightly decided that we should not see the NHS overwhelmed, there are only two possible futures until there is an effective treatment or vaccine.  The first is to let the virus smoulder along, with the NHS able to cope with the resulting hospitalizations and deaths at a level compatible with resuming treatment of all the other health conditions local flare-ups will need to be stamped out.  The second is to go further and attempt to eliminate the virus in the UK, recognizing that permitting any international travel will result in at least occasional small outbreaks. Loosening the restrictions will be far more difficult than imposing them. Most people who can work from home should continue to do so. Those working in the most essential jobs where physical distancing is possible should go back to work first. People in less essential jobs where physical distancing is not possible may need to wait much longer. Children and teachers may have to maintain distance at school, with obvious implications for class size, play breaks, and methods of instruction.  Temperatures will be checked at the factory gates or office entrance.  Face coverings will be a new normal.  Virus testing and contact tracing may be a condition of going to work. Congregating in pubs and restaurants, theatres and cinemas will be greatly limited.  Mass gatherings will remain banned. Some of these steps will create economic winners and losers and risk social cohesion.  However, these steps will lead to the first future.  To get to elimination we will need to add saturation testing and isolation, and quarantine of international arrivals.Who will determine what happens next?  We are told the government is “following the science”.  Was it the scientists that told us mass gatherings should go ahead, that shaking hands is fine, and that it was too late for testing and contact tracing? Or did the Government not take the scientists’ advice? We cannot know because the background documents and recommendations of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE) will be kept secret until after the pandemic.Duke and Duchess of Cambridge clapping for the NHS, in picturesIn an case, confronted with a new virus, it is unreasonably to pretend that even the best scientists can provide more than educated guesses.  At this point in the pandemic the best guide for policies will be the experience of China, South Korea, Taiwan, Australia, New Zealand and other countries that appear to have contained the initial virus surge.What matters now are the decisions going forward, and communicating them to the public in a persuasive and factual manner.  The first rule of public health communication in an epidemic is that maintaining the trust of the public is paramount.  This was the hard-won lesson of the Ebola epidemics – when we ask people to change long-held social norms we have to do it through a process of community engagement and consultation, and explain the rationale for these measures in plain terms with transparent motivations.  Transparency includes communicating the uncertainty involved in the scientific predictions.In the US, President Trump’s daily ramblings make the UK briefings look like models of cogency.  The leader who has been giving a masterclass in public health communications has been Andrew Cuomo, Governor of New York State.  Similarly to the UK leadership he was caught short with a crisis that threatened to overwhelm the hospitals, but since then he has kept on the front foot.Now in his sixth week of consecutive daily press conferences, Cuomo lays out the facts, mixes in empathy and occasional humour, and has not shied away from looking ahead.  He acknowledges the strengths and weaknesses of statistical models.More than a week ago he started preparing his audience for a staggered return to work based on job description and workplace risk.  He realized that perfect scientific information can be the enemy of the good and ordered mandatory face covering when social distancing is not possible. On Thursday this week he revealed and interpreted the first results of antibody testing within a day of the tests. Most importantly, he prefers persuasion to proscription, and acknowledges that preparing the public takes time. The UK Government successfully galvanized us around the slogan “Protect our NHS”.  The next weeks and months will be much more difficult, and not so easily reduced to a three word mantra.  Communities, and iniduals, will be asked to maintain the lockdown while they see others partially released.  There will be setbacks.  People will only go along with this if they feel they are stakeholders in the larger enterprise, and they will do so voluntarily only if the logic, including the uncertainty, is transparent. If the slow initial response was partly due to a fear of looking like a “Nanny State”, this is no time to treat us like infants who can’t be trusted with the facts.  Apparently, the Scots have a greater ability to absorb complex information, and Nicola Sturgeon has admirably shared her framework for decision making.As we approach the “end of the beginning” our Government needs to radically improve its communications strategy.  In this first phase, one size fits all edicts have worked.  As we ask people to change their lives in nuanced and variable ways, public debate, community representation, the experience of public health professionals, events in other countries, and transparency of decision-making must be given equal standing to SAGE. Uncertainty needs to be acknowledged. The messaging needs to move from beleaguered and proscriptive to candid and flexible. If not, we will lose the public trust, the advice will not be followed, and we will delay the “beginning of the end”.David J.

The Prime Minister had issued what he called a “simple” instruction to the country to “stay at home”. But he had also added a caveat. People could go out to work “where this is absolutely necessary and cannot be done from home”.The business in question was a manufacturer, definitely not a work-from-the-sofa-in-pyjamas sort of operation. So perhaps the answer was yes. The legislation came out and, after scouring it, the owner could see nothing forbidding him from operating, so long as he took some social distancing measures. He had two months’ cash and a full order book and who knew how long the lockdown would last? So he told staff that work would continue. But the workforce had been bombarded by messages telling them they risked death if they went outside. The message came back loud and clear: “No.”The Government has now explained that its main virus control strategy after the lockdown will be to test, contact-trace and isolate potential cases, along the lines of successful Asian examples. This is the only viable exit route from lockdown. What we do not yet know is what can reopen and when. As the business example above shows, it is not as simple as it seems when reading a script into a camera lens at Number 10.For one thing, the Government has been bashing us over the head with the same message for a month: “Stay at home or you’ll die!” We get it constantly from letters, TV ads, radio ads, online ads, text messages and all the rest. This campaign has been extraordinarily successful. Contact between households has all but evaporated, deaths and new cases have levelled off, the NHS is still functioning and polls show enormous public support for the measures. At some point, however, even though the risk of getting the virus can never be wholly removed, the message will need to change and the new rules need to be clear. Let’s not come out of lockdown in the same way we went into it, with some garbled message like, “It’s probably fine to reopen.”This won’t be easy to manage because, as chief medical officer Chris Whitty has said, we don’t yet know what mix of activity will optimise economic and social wellbeing while keeping the epidemic under control. What is clear is that the new regime will have a very low tolerance for any rise in transmission rates because of the worry that growth can quickly become exponential and overwhelm the health service. This low risk tolerance is necessary for the economy too in order to build public confidence and improve the working and business environment. If we are living in constant fear of a second lockdown, furloughs will start to turn into redundancies.There is some evidence that the extent of the lockdown we are in is not necessary to keep the epidemic under control. A handful of European countries have implemented slightly softer regimes. Sweden, at the most liberal end, is probably not an example to follow, given its relatively high death rate compared to its direct peers. But the Netherlands, whose epidemic is now shrinking, may have achieved a good balance.On paper, the Dutch rules are similar to Britain’s, but its regime is actually somewhat less severe. Whereas the Netherlands acted early and saw the volume of shoppers and commuters halve, the UK acted a little later and then saw falls of 70-80 per cent. We swung from insouciance, when parks and street markets were packed in defiance of the Government’s advice, to immediate docility when the cops were sent out.The Dutch government’s analysis of various distancing measures has now concluded that whereas banning large gatherings and encouraging people to work from home were essential to control the epidemic, closing cafes and schools probably had little effect. School closures, of course, have a huge economic impact since they deprive most families of childcare.Aside from getting the rules right, the Government needs also to create the right incentives and communicate them effectively. Managers should not be in the dark about whether they are allowed to operate. The Government should not be sending letters, as business secretary Alok Sharma did last week, suggesting in one breath that “there is no restriction on manufacturing continuing under the current rules” and then implying, in the next, that active businesses should be “playing a direct role in combatting Covid-19”. Businesses should not be left worrying about whether they are legally liable if they ask staff to work and then get sued by an employee who gets ill.This is all the more delicate because although it has undoubtedly saved millions of jobs, the furloughing regime has also created a new set of incentives. Many employees, especially those with medical conditions, elderly relatives living with them or children to look after, might rather be at home on 80 per cent of pay than at work for the extra 20.Most businesses do not want to have threaten to fire their staff in order to get them into work and do not want workers to feel they are risking their lives at work or on the transport method they use to get in. At some point, it will have to be made clear that the country cannot allow millions of workers to stay at home at taxpayers’ expense, even if the risk of contagion can only be minimised and never eliminated. The furloughing system will have to taper off. Managed wrongly, this could become toxic, especially given that it is disproportionately working-class jobs that really cannot be done from home.The future is moving slowly into view. It is one where schools, restaurants and factories are up and running, where life has returned to some semblance of normal. But it is also one where we are still obsessing over clean hands, walking oddly far apart from one another and dreaming idly of the day when we can go abroad, attend a sports match or even just convene a book club and have tea with granny.The precursor to any economic recovery and growing confidence is a public released from living in confusion and fear.

He said: “Neither of us have any problem in principle with the names being made public.”However, Sir Patrick has separately told MPs that disclosing the list of Sage members could leave them vulnerable to outside lobbying interests. The Daily  has found that a number of those on the committee and its sub-committees already have links to pharmaceutical firms that could be perceived as conflicts of interests.Those on the SAGE committee include Professor John Edmunds, an epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) who sits on Sage as well as two of its sub-committees. His partner Jeanne Pimenta works for the pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) and also holds shares in the company. Prof Edmunds said that his partner had recently resigned from GSK and was working out her notice.Others on Sage include Professor Graham Medley, also at LSHTM, Peter Horby, Professor of Emerging Infectious Diseases and Global Health at the University of Oxford, Neil Ferguson, mathematical modeller at Imperial College, Dr Jim McMenamin of Health Protection Scotland, Sharon Peacock, the director of the National Infection Service at Public Health England, and Ian Diamond, the head of the Government Statistical Service.Sir Patrick claimed in a letter to MPs that the government does not disclose membership of Sage partly to protect “them from lobbying and other forms of unwanted influence which may hinder their ability to give impartial advice.”Sir Patrick’s warning was apparently intended as a defence of the Government’s decision not to disclose the scientists’ names, but it backfired on Friday as MPs warned that this was all the more reason for the list of members to be subjected to public scrutiny.Chi Onwurah, the Shadow Science Minister, said: “There will already be lobbying going on and the response to lobbying is greater transparency, not less. We are calling for the people who make up Sage to be known and for Sage\u0027s advice to be shared with the Opposition.”Sir David King, the former Chief Scientific Adviser, added, “I do not see or understand the secrecy around who the science adviser is getting advice from.“I think it would be so important to gain the trust of the public by acting openly. It’s very simple, but at the moment we are not privy to the discussions.“I think I can’t help feeling that the Chief Scientific Adviser and the Chief Medical Officer are under political pressure not to be frank with the public. I think that’s the bottom line.”Professor Whitty told MPs on the Science and Technology select committee on Friday that he and Sir Patrick had no objection themselves to the names being released “in principle” but that the Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure had said the names should not be disclosed.He said this was because some non Covid-19 meetings of Sage may occasionally involve matters of national security so “the principle needed to be thought through quite carefully.”But the calls for transparency were echoed by several senior figures on Sage and its sub-committees – the very people the government claims it wants to “protect”.They said it was “counterproductive” to keep their identities private, and that the Government should publish their names in order to shore up public trust.Professor Susan Michie, who has attended one Sage meeting and sits on the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Behavioural Science, or “SPI-B” – one of four highly influential committees that feeds into SAGE, told the  that she has spoken out on the issue.“Given openness and transparency are important for trust and trust is important for adherence to Government advice, it makes sense to me to publish names and papers agreed by the committees in timely manner,” she said.A few members told the  that they had faced threats from the public, and a couple said that as a result they preferred not to be named.However, others – such as Professor Robert Dingwall, who sits on the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (NERVTAG) - said they supported transparency regardless. “I think as a matter of principle that membership of such advisory groups should be in the public domain.”Professor Whitty told the select committee y that “all of the sub committees are extremely open.”But the Government has also repeatedly refused to disclose the membership of SPI-B or name the five members of the Covid-19 Clinical Information Network, another of the four sub-committees referred to as CO-CIN, which is kept so secret it is not even referred to on Sage’s website.It does, however, publish the full membership of NERVTAG, along with register of interests.Prof Edmunds is one of those who fully disclosed his interests, including his partner’s employment and shares, in the register when it was last updated in November 2018.It used to publish the membership of the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling – or SPI-M – but deleted the page three weeks ago.The lack of complete transparency has echoes of the way the World Health Organisation operated during the 2009 swine flu crisis, when it refused to disclose the names of the scientists it relied on for advice.At the time, critics raised fears that there may have been conflicts of interests that would have enabled pharmaceutical companies to influence decisions to buy up vast amounts of vaccines against the illness.However, WHO claimed that it had to keep the membership secret in order to protect them from undue pressure, and insisted that it had vetted them. In Britain, the Government spent more than £500million on supplies of two flu drugs - Tamiflu and Relenza – following WHO’s recommendations, amid warnings that the UK death toll would reach 65,000. In the end it claimed around 450 lives.After the crisis was over, it emerged that five of the 15 scientists who sat on the emergency committee had previously received funding from pharmaceutical giants, or were linked to them through their research.Those specialists included Professor Neil Ferguson, the Imperial College modelling expert who sits on SAGE and two of its sub-committees, and whose coronavirus predictions led to the country’s current lockdown.He had acted as a consultant for Roche, a drugs firm that manufactured Tamiflu, as well as Glaxo Smith Kline Biologicals until 2007.Another of the scientists named was Professor Maria Zambon, who now works for Public Health England and sits on NERVTAG.Her laboratory at the UK Health Protection Agency Centre for Infection had received funding from several vaccine makers, including Sanofi, Novartis, CSL, Baxter and GSK.The WHO said at the time that those interests do not give rise to a conflict of interest such that the experts concerned should be partially or totally excluded from participation in the Emergency Committee. A government spokesperson said: “During this crisis, the government has rightly consulted expert advisors with a wealth of academic, scientific, medical and private sector experience to tackle COVID-19 and save lives. It is wrong and unfair to those advisors to suggest that scientific knowledge and experience is being shared for any other reason than to aid the national effort to beat this virus.“The decision to not disclose SAGE membership is based upon advice from the Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure and is in line with the standard procedure for COBR meetings, to which SAGE gives advice.“This is to safeguard inidual members’ personal security and protect them from lobbying and other forms of unwanted influence which may hinder their ability to give impartial advice. Of course, we do not stop iniduals from revealing that they have attended SAGE.”A Number 10 spokesperson said Mr Cummings had attended some SAGE meetings and listened to some meetings now they are all virtual.He did this in order to understand better the scientific debates concerning this emergency and also to understand better the limits of how science and data can help government decisions.SAGE provides independent scientific advice to the government. Political advisers have no role in this. From the start the government has tried hard to integrate scientific advice into its decision making in a sensible way. It will continue to do so.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"ultra orthodox jewish wedding shut met emerges father bride","story":"Police shut down an ultra-Orthodox Jewish wedding after officers were called twice to celebrations flouting the lockdown ban.politan Police officers warned the families they were breaking government Covid-19 guidelines after neighbours saw the ceremony being set up in Golders Green, London, at 5.30pm on April 22.But the wedding went ahead and police were called again at 9pm after a large group were seen gathering outside the property.

The first came on March 27, a 62-year-old woman who passed after initially being diagnosed with allergies. The second happened the next day. A man, 70, had been rushed to a hospital 40 miles away with shortness of breath but never recovered. The tragedies have mounted since then, including in the last week - two on Saturday and one each on Sunday, Tuesday and Thursday. Eighteen Covid-19 fatalities in less than a month. “It’s unlike anything I’ve ever seen before,” said Mr Chapman, the coroner of Randolph County. “The phone has been ringing off the hook for days.” The suffering in this corner of rural southwest Georgia could be missed in a pandemic that has already claimed more than 200,000 lives worldwide. But it now tops a morbid list. It is the county with the highest coronavirus death rate in America. The number of fatalities here as a proportion of population exceeds anywhere else in the US, including New York. Limited access to health care, an elderly population and high levels of poverty could all be a factor. And it is not alone - the Covid-19 cases in America’s South are surging. Yet at the same time Republican governors are reopening businesses, including in Georgia, where tattoo parlours and spas were allowed to open on Friday, prompting national headlines. Even Donald Trump, the US president who has urged reopenings, criticised governor Brian Kemp for the move, tweeting that he had not approved the decision. Why has Randolph County, with a population of just 6,800, been hit so hard? To understand, The  talked to local leaders, emergency workers and friends of the deceased.  The picture that emerged, of warnings ignored and a community shattered by disease, can be found across America. As the virus spreads into the countryside, it could be repeated.Mr Chapman, 62, updates the paper list from his dining room table at home in Cuthbert, one of the country’s two “cities”, though really the size of villages. He has been coroner for 12 years and is used to death. But the rate of dying this last month - twice as high as in normal times - has left him shaken. “It’s been at the peak of what I can handle,” Mr Chapman said. “It’s been a challenge to keep up with, that’s for sure.” It is not known how the virus reached the county - with limited resources to track back that is unlikely to change - but the ground zero is clear.  The Joe-Anne Burgin Nursing Home has seen more than a dozen deaths, most believed to be related to Covid-19. Around half of those at the home have tested positive. People who died from Covid-19 there, like all those in the county, were aged over 60. Many had underlying health conditions such as diabetes or past heart problems. The scale of death and size of community means many residents have a personal connection to those who have passed, amplifying the emotional impact.  That is true of Steve Whatley, the mayor of Cuthbert. He has spent all of his life in the city, which has a little over 3,000 people. Last weekend Lucy Hobbs, once a classmate from the local school, was taken by the virus aged just 66. They had been born six months apart.  “The death rate has been unbelievable. These are not just figures to us. These are people we know and are friends with and have a relationship with,” he said. “It has certainly been traumatic, to say the least. With a small community like we’ve got, a close-knit community, it really hits home in a large way.” It is not the first time this area has experienced hardship. Hurricane Michael caused devastation in 2018 when it swept through, ruining houses and leaving people displaced.  “Nobody died, that’s the difference,” Mr Whatley said. He called watching this invisible killer sweep through his hometown “surreal”.“It’s in the Lord’s hands, he added. The virus’s impact has been especially felt on the religious community. The county is in the heart of America’s Bible Belt. Cuthbert alone has more than a dozen churches.  Among the obituaries posted on a local funeral home website is one for Alfred Starling, an African-American reverend. He was another lifelong resident taken by Covid-19 earlier this month, aged 65.  His inviting personality matched his flair for style he was a sharp dresser who always kept a handsome smile on his face,” read one line.   Pastor David Hamm, whose church had the reverend as a member, echoed the warm words. “Great guy, humble guy. He drove school buses for many years.” Pastor Hamm, 43, is no longer giving services in person. The doors to his church are shut, replaced by online broadcasts every Sunday.  But he is still doing funerals. He has overseen four burials for coronavirus victims. No more than 10 mourners can attend, to curb potential spread. Those who do must wear masks.  “They were very troublesome to the families because many of them are distinguished people, well known people. You can’t have a proper burial,” he said. Normally Pastor Hamm would give a whole sermon of remembrance in the church. Now, there are just a few words of comfort by the grave.“They couldn’t say goodbye properly,” he said. But why has Randolph County, with its miles of corn and cotton fields, been so badly hit? Demographics could be one factor.  Around a third of residents live in poverty, according to the latest US Census data. A quarter are aged over 65, so especially vulnerable. Other nearby counties also appear near the top of the death rate list, produced by Prof Gary Wagner from the University of Louisiana at Lafayette. Another factor could be not adhering to social distancing. One resident said locals did not change their behaviour quickly enough as the virus emerged.  The person described a barbecue taking place with more than 100 people earlier this month and said many still visited their families on Easter weekend.  A third is healthcare. The county only has one ambulance to cover 430 square miles. It has only one small hospital, which has had to draft in medical experts to fill staffing gaps. Ambulances from other counties can take calls, but then there is the dilemma of where to take them. Bigger hospitals - in Albany or Columbus or Dothan - are around an hour’s drive. Ken Burns, 51, the county’s emergency manager (and also fire chief), criticised Mr Kemp’s decision to let businesses reopen, fearing it would lead to more deaths. “It’s way too soon,” he said. “We’re still on our growth rate. I see three more spikes coming here and that’s before you even mention opening up.”Back at his dining room table, Mr Chapman too expects more deaths. But his piece of paper, tallying those lost in a county he has called home all his life, is almost out of space. I’m going to have to turn it over or start another one, he said, considering the weeks ahead. “The front page is filled up.”More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"way lockdown strategies evaluated","story":"Countries across the world have been battling coronavirus from behind closed doors, with scientists advising governments on the best ways to ease their populations out of lockdown without setting off a second wave of coronavirus but before risking economic collapse. Various strategies are being implemented by countries at different points on the trajectory of the virus, giving the UK the opportunity to learn from their policies. Following the extension of Britain\u0027s lockdown until May 7, there will be a review to decide whether restrictions remain in place or can be lifted. On Thursday, the Health Secretary, Matt Hancock, announced the beginning of Britain\u0027s strategy to test, track and trace, which he said could enable heavier social distancing measures to be eased.The  has spoken to experts in each field to ask how other countries are working their way out of lockdown and analyse how each strategy could work for the UK. On Monday, Government officials in Chile announced that they would issue the world\u0027s first immunity passports, with comprehensive plans expected to be detailed next week. Physical or digital cards will be given to those who have tested positive for coronavirus but have recovered and are likely to have built up antibodies. Those eligible will be free to return to both work and wider society. Dr Rifat Atun, professor of Global Health Systems at Harvard University, has advised Chile on health policy for more than 25 years and said antibody tests can help governments assess the prevalence of the infections, particularly in asymptomatic people. But he added that the tests still cannot tell us whether a person has developed immunity, how long they are immune for or the extent of the immunity – just that they have had the virus and recovered. The only way of knowing if such herd immunity has built up is by mass testing, while reducing restrictions in one area to see if people continue to get infected. You can check the infection levels to see if mixing leads to higher levels of infections, Dr Atun said. If you have a large number of people that are infected and we\u0027re not getting new infections, that suggests that there should be some kind of immunity because the virus is not being transmitted, so transmission between person to person is interrupted. In Westminster, herd immunity has become a dirty term. The attempt to achieve it involved allowing enough of us who are going to get mild illness to become immune, Sir Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific adviser, explained on March 13.But after data from Imperial College London showed how badly hospitals would be overwhelmed, the UK reversed course – and it seems there is no going back.Professor Neil Ferguson, of Imperial College, who sits on the Government\u0027s Sage advisory committee, said it was likely that only five percent of the UK population had been infected with the virus. There is almost no herd immunity and a very large risk of a second peak if we relax current measures without something to put in their place, he said.Even the most hawkish of backbenchers understands that herd immunity is over as a concept. One Conservative MP said: Even if privately many backbenchers wish we had pursued a policy similar to Sweden, it is understood that it is no longer possible.There are also fears among some advisers that it could blur the rules of the lockdown and encourage others to take the restrictions less seriously.Strict social distancing measures initially proved successful in China, which is at a more advanced stage of the pandemic. During the country\u0027s peak, in early February, there were between 2,000 and 4,000 new confirmed coronavirus cases per day. But leading up to March 23, it had no new confirmed cases caused by local transmission for five consecutive days. One report, by the the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis and the Abdul Latif Jameel Institute for Disease and Emergency Analytics at Imperial College London, concluded that social distancing measures in China have led to control of Covid-19. Professor Christl Donnelly, Associate Director of the MRC Centre, said: At this difficult time, these results suggest that, after containment, a carefully managed and monitored relaxation of effective large-scale lockdowns may be possible even before an effective vaccine is available.There is now debate at the top of the Government over how hard and fast the UK\u0027s lockdown measures should be eased. Cabinet hawks fear the devastation of the economy and are calling for an easing, while doves, including Boris Johnson and Mr Hancock, do not want to risk a second peak.One insider told The : There\u0027s growing concern on the Tory backbenches about a lack of action, but the fear extends to the Cabinet too. Boris and Hancock have put the issue on the back burner. Ultimately a decision has to be taken, and it has to be done in a way that makes it look like the Government is in control rather than being chased by the opposition.While there is an ongoing argument over how to ease measures, it is inevitable that some kind of social distancing will be with us for some time. One Whitehall source said: Until there is a vaccine or an effective drug, people will be asked to maintain a level of social distancing. Britons could have to get used to a very different way of life. Measures aren\u0027t going to be lifted overnight – they will be phased.The chief medical officer, Professor Chris Whitty, this week told the country to brace itself for another year of disruptive measures. He said ministers would have to devise the optimal combination of social distancing to control the virus until a vaccine became available.This could mean workplaces are adapted to ensure colleagues keep a two-metre distance, but one source said: The real hope is that many people will continue to work from home – having that flexibility will be key.”One of the biggest challenges is thought to be maintaining social distancing on public transport, and a Whitehall source said: There is thought going into how to spread the rush hour, and businesses will be required to be more flexible when setting working patterns to try and keep people travelling at different times.Grant Shapps, the Transport Secretary, has said businesses should be asking themselves why everybody has to travel in the rush hour.Sport and cultural activities could also look very different and there is also consideration as to whether theatres could open if every other seat is left empty, it is understood.Schools have long been thought of as one of the first institutions that could reopen as part of any easing. However, Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), suggested June 1 is the earliest date on which they are likely to be able to do so.When schools are re-opened, a leading Government adviser has said they must do better at promoting good hygiene. Susan Michie, a professor of health psychology at University College London, said: School toilets can be pretty dismal places – that is an area that needs improvement.This strategy has been used in countries in the Far East including Singapore and, more successfully, Hong Kong. It involves trained contact tracing teams piecing together a Covid-19 patient\u0027s movements and potential contacts during the time that the person is infectious. Close contacts are then investigated and quarantined where necessary. Professor Li Yang, who heads the infectious diseases programme at the National University of Singapore\u0027s Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, said: When exiting lockdown, once people are able to move around more freely this becomes even more important as a way of quickly containing potential clusters of Covid-19.Prof Li warned that the method takes manpower and is time-intensive, saying: Singapore\u0027s Ministry of Health had to rapidly expand its contact tracing team and tap on support from the police and military as the number of cases surged. Therefore, it is ideal to combine human contact tracing with other technological applications in order to reduce the manpower and time required. In an updated paper seen by The  and initially published in the BMJ, experts estimate that, in order for the UK to replicate the Far East\u0027s success, it would need between 150,000 and 550,000 total volunteers. The co-authors of the paper, Dr Cam Bowie, retired director of public health, Somerset, and professor of community health, Malawi, and Dr Tony Hill, independent public health consultant and health strategist and retired director of public health, Lincolnshire, said: At the end of the day, control will only be achieved by case identification, isolation and contact tracing, and that can only be done at the local level.It is not complicated – it can be re-commenced immediately without disruption to other efforts. It does not need demonstration sites. It is working in the Far East with Covid-19 right now. The report says that, in order for contact tracing to be efficient, it needs to managed by local authorities, with an average of 2.8 full time local staff and trained volunteers to cope with each new case. Each new case will require 58 hours of time to trace 90 contacts and test 6.3 symptomatic contacts, a third of whom will have Covid-19. Between 800 and 3,000 volunteers will be needed two weeks after peak deaths in the averaged sized local authority, according to the report, which says training using local authority resources would take a single day. The system of contact tracing should, they said, be up and running in five working days, and local authorities would be able to relax physical distancing measures to get schools reopened two weeks after peak deaths. Mr Hancock announced on Thursday that he would be hiring 18,000 people to start testing and tracing for the virus in the community, including public health specialists and 3,000 clinicians. He gave no date for when the process would begin, but said the Government would be training up contact tracers over coming weeks.However, Dr Bowie called the numbers paltry and said getting the volunteers is not a problem, adding: The key point is that the numbers required and the methods used means this cannot be done centrally or regionally but only at local authority level.  The number Public Health England think they need suggests they need to remember that we have not one homogenous epidemic but a myriad of small ones, dotting up in different places at different times, requiring different ways of curtailment. You simply cannot do that from London. It is understood that council staff and civil servants are among those who will be drafted in. However, on Thursday the Local Government Authority (LGA) cast doubt on the plans by insisting that central Government should foot the bill as councils are already struggling with staff shortages because of coronavirus.Cllr Ian Hudspeth, the chairman of the LGA\u0027s community wellbeing board, said the extra demand on existing services would need to be met by additional resources and funding.There has been some disquiet among Conservative backbenchers that the Government ever stopped contact tracing. A senior MP said: A lot of people thought abandoning contact tracing was a bad idea. While some regions were difficult to keep on top of, other areas have seen relatively low levels. Testing could have easily been focused in those areas.The Prime Minister\u0027s official spokesman said: We\u0027ll make sure that we have whatever number of staff it is that we need.While 18,000 people are being recruited initially, the spokesman said that capacity will be quickly scaled up if that’s needed. He was unable to give a start date on when the contact tracing scheme will begin, but said work is progressing well.Digital contact tracing is one of the few ways in which the authorities can keep pace with rapid real-time spread of coronavirus. The model the UK is looking to adopt sees people download an app that logs other mobile phones that come into close contact with it via Bluetooth connections. When a user comes down with coronavirus, an alert can be sent to all the people they had contact with, telling them to self-isolate. This system could get people self-isolating before they even show symptoms – a period when they are still infectious and most likely to unwittingly spread the virus.Digital contract tracing needs a large proportion of a population to take part for it to be effective. Even then, it is still just one element of a successful virus containment strategy and needs to be deployed alongside mass testing to be successful. Without millions of people using the app properly, alongside a mass testing regime, digital contract tracing is unlikely to halt the virus.South Korea and Singapore have both used data from the mobile phones of people diagnosed with Covid-19 to trace the people with whom they have come into contact.The authorities in South Korea have successfully used GPS data to help human contact tracing teams, and on Wednesday reported only eight new confirmed coronavirus cases. Singapore has used apps that track other phones that come into close range via Bluetooth connections. The shortcomings of the system can be seen in Singapore which, despite early successes in containing the virus, now has a rising rate of infection, with total cases topping 8,000 this week. This has partly been attributed to the spread in crowded government-built dormitories for migrant workers, where social distancing is difficult to maintain. Professor Li warned that digital tracing is not effective without mass take-up and if social distancing is not adhered to. He said: Generally, the majority of the population will need to have installed such apps before they become truly useful.A study by Oxford University last week found that if 56 percent of the population were to use a contact tracing app, it would effectively stop the spread of the virus before a vaccine or cure is found. To achieve this in practice, the NHS will have to get its app working efficiently and downloaded by around 30 million people by the time the lockdown eases.A coronavirus vaccine has been long-hailed as the weapon that will defeat Covid-19 and unlock society, and this week the UK joined the US – which currently has two studies – and China, in beginning human trials for a vaccine. Yet Mr Johnson and his Cabinet are only too aware that a preventative jab is unlikely to be forthcoming in this calendar year and, acting on evidence provided by its scientific advisers, the Government now appears to have set sail for a lengthy lockdown.There is a real fear at the top about a second peak, one Whitehall insider said. Sage are warning that there will need to be fairly strict lockdown measures until a vaccine is found. Unfortunately, this may take some time.Mr Hancock this week confirmed that two leading vaccine developments – Oxford University and Imperial College London – would receive a total of £42.5 million to support their clinical trials, saying that the UK is at the forefront of the global effort.Professor Robin Shattock, the head of mucosal infection and immunity at Imperial College London, who is leading its team in developing a vaccine, said: The timelines for rolling out a vaccine for the whole of the UK are too long to stay on total lockdown, but early availability of vaccines that have demonstrable efficacy and safety pre-gaining a marketing license could be used to protect key groups – health care workers, care home staff, providing part of the strategy to relaxing the lockdown. He agreed that, considering the time it would take to develop a vaccine and make it widely available, any nationwide campaign is unlikely to take place before the end of the year. Dr Sheuli Porkess, the director of research, medical and innovation at the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry, said: Vaccination has saved more lives and prevented more serious diseases than any advance in recent medical history. Any vaccine for Covid-19 must be thoroughly tested to make sure it\u0027s safe and effective, and that is what companies and organisations around the world are working on now.Professor Adam Finn, professor of paediatrics at the University of Bristol, said: Epidemics are controlled by generating sufficient population immunity that transmission drops away. Vaccines are the only tool we have to do this aside from just letting everyone get the disease or stopping normal life. Earlier this week, ministers refused to confirm whether UK taxpayers would be first in the queue to receive a successful vaccine. However, it is understood that, if the Oxford or Imperial trials prove successful, Britons will have priority.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/global-health/2020/03/10/TELEMMGLPICT000227447964_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqHFpKXeXCxMIMJz8yhX7SwjhqJjatWbAoPNpik4CultM.jpeg?im","title":"west must ensure china pays role spread covid 19","story":"The dominance of Xi Jinping\u0026#39s China cannot go unchallenged by the WestChina, we all know, is run by an autocratic, dictatorial regime which brooks no dissent and is highly secretive about the problems and challenges the country faces. That has been the case for very many years. However, although its behaviour does seem to be getting worse, logic would nevertheless still dictate that when faced with the outbreak of a novel disease the Chinese government would work hard to contain it. That was certainly the case in 2002, when China responded to Sars by working with the World Health Organisation to bring the disease under control. So why, when Covid-19 was discovered, did China instead respond with what many believe to be cynical lies and denials? The Chinese authorities were alerted to the threat the outbreak posed when human-to-human transmission was confirmed in early December, just as they were about to sign a trade deal with the USA ending the damaging standoff between the two countries. Was the reason that the government closed down any mention of the outbreak through December and January to protect this deal? Phase 1 of the deal was set to lift tariffs on about $200 billion of Chinese exports. However, if the deal hadn’t been agreed on December 15 then the US intended to impose wider sanctions on Chinese exports. As it happened, the deal was agreed on December 15 2019 and then signed exactly a month later on January 15. This was a critical period. Any indication in this time that China had a serious health crisis which may have pointed the finger at their biological labs andor their appalling wet markets could have led to wider sanctions being applied.During this vital period, the Chinese authorities systematically suppressed whistle blowers. Dr Li Wenliang, who first publicly raised the outbreak, was silenced and later died, but he was not alone. He had been reporting observations made by Dr Ai Fen earlier in December 2019 and there were others who observed the human-to-human nature of transmission, a vital fact denied by the Chinese authorities at the time. According to The Lancet medical journal there were at least six known human-to-human cases before December 15 and strong indications this had happened in November. Yet it wasn’t until December 31 that it was first reported to the WHO.All the while, China’s President, Xi Jinping, publicly maintained that everything was under control and only on January 28 did he meet Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director-general of the WHO. This meeting led to a public health statement of “an emergency of international concern”. Yet at the same time, inexplicably, Dr Tedros applauded the Chinese authorities, saying, “We appreciate the seriousness with which China is taking this outbreak … and the transparency they have demonstrated.”It looks as though the Chinese state placed achieving a trade deal with the US ahead of ensuring the proper systems were in place to manage the outbreak. Yet this is, it seems, a normal pattern of behaviour from a state growing in economic and military power. Just look at the strategic way that China set out to dominate areas of the world which have important raw materials. At present, China owns nearly 20 per cent of Africa’s debt with a combined loan total of $152 billion to 49 African governments. This is one tactic among many that has secured China’s control of around 85 per cent of the world’s supply of rare earth metals, which go into the production of all electronics. Whether it is ripping off technology from Western countries, driving other businesses out of the marketplace by aggressive and state-backed bidding or even economically colonising countries in Africa, China believes, rightly as it turns out, that the West has become too weak for it to fear. Nothing demonstrates Chinese arrogance or disregard of us better than its handling of coronavirus.The problem is that the West has blithely assumed that access to our free markets would lead China to democracy and increased freedoms. Yet instead of free trade causing the country to open up, as its dominance of the world marketplace has expanded, China has instead tightened up with greater central control and more abuses of human rights. Pathetically, after years of Project Kow Tow, we rarely if ever confront it about its behaviour. It is vital that we change all that and break our dependence on this terrible regime. The Government now needs to set up a commission with experts and senior politicians to examine how we can change and rebalance our relationship with China as we emerge from this crisis. There will be a need for financial reparations for the damage it has inflicted. We also need to ensure that China doesn’t exploit its economic power to avoid taking responsibility for this appalling pandemic. Working with other allies, we have to ensure that we never allow such an autocratic regime, one that abuses human rights and ignores the rules-based international order, to become so dominant again. Sir Iain Duncan Smith is a former leader of the Conservative PartyCoronavirus latest news: Public should continue to seek treatment for serious illness, NHS chief says Contact tracing: how has it worked for other countries, and could it really help ease UK lockdown?Boris Johnson and coronavirus: what we know about his recovery and when he will return to work What needs to happen for UK lockdown to be lifted - and when is it reviewed?Coronavirus Q\u0026ampA: Is there a PPE shortage, and how can NHS workers use it safely?How does a coronavirus antibody home test kit work, and how do I get one?Has the UK passed its coronavirus peak?How long will the UK coronavirus lockdown last?

Reuters was unable to immediately determine what the trip by the Chinese team signalled in terms of Mr Kim\u0027s health.A delegation led by a senior member of the Chinese Communist Party\u0027s International Liaison Department left Beijing for North Korea on Thursday, two of the people said. The department is the main Chinese body dealing with neighbouring North Korea.The sources declined to be identified, given the sensitivity of the matter.The Liaison Department could not be reached by Reuters for comment late on Friday. China\u0027s foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment late on Friday.Daily NK, a Seoul-based website, reported earlier this week that Mr Kim was recovering after undergoing a cardiovascular procedure on April 12. It cited one unnamed source in North Korea.South Korean government officials and a Chinese official with the Liaison Department challenged subsequent reports suggesting that Mr Kim was in grave danger after surgery. South Korean officials said they had detected no signs of unusual activity in North Korea.On Thursday, US President Donald Trump also downplayed earlier reports that Mr Kim was gravely ill. I think the report was incorrect, Mr Trump told reporters, but he declined to say if he had been in touch with North Korean officials.On Friday, a South Korean source told Reuters their intelligence was that Mr Kim was alive and would likely make an appearance soon. The person said he did not have any comment on Mr Kim\u0027s current condition or any Chinese involvement.An official familiar with US intelligence said that Mr Kim was known to have health problems but they had no reason to conclude he was seriously ill or unable eventually to reappear in public.A US State department spokeswoman had no comment. US Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, when asked about Mr Kim\u0027s health on Fox News after Mr Trump spoke said:I don’t have anything I can share with you tonight, but the American people should know we\u0027re watching the situation very keenly.North Korea is one of the world\u0027s most isolated and secretive countries, and the health of its leaders is treated as a matter of state security. Reuters has not been able to independently confirm any details on Mr Kim\u0027s whereabouts or condition.North Korea\u0027s state media last reported on Mr Kim\u0027s whereabouts when he presided over a meeting on April 11. State media did not report that he was in attendance at an event to mark the birthday of his grandfather, Kim Il Sung, on April 15, an important anniversary in North Korea.Mr Kim, believed to be 36, has disappeared from coverage in North Korean state media before. In 2014, he vanished for more than a month and North Korean state TV later showed him walking with a limp. Speculation about his health has been fanned by his heavy smoking, apparent weight gain since taking power and family history of cardiovascular problems.When Kim Jong Un\u0027s father, Kim Jong Il, suffered a stroke in 2008, South Korean media reported at the time that Chinese doctors were involved in his treatment along with French physicians.Last year, Chinese President Xi Jinping made the first state visit in 14 years by a Chinese leader to North Korea, an impoverished state that depends on Beijing for economic and diplomatic support.China is North Korea\u0027s chief ally and the economic lifeline for a country hard-hit by UN sanctions, and has a keen interest in the stability of the country with which it shares a long, porous border.Mr Kim is a third-generation hereditary leader who came to power after his father Kim Jong Il died in 2011 from a heart attack. He has visited China four times since 2018.Mr Trump held unprecedented summits with Mr Kim in 2018 and 2019 as part of a bid to persuade him to give up North Korea’s nuclear arsenal.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"italyprepares tough task return work maintaining social distancing","story":"It was where Europe’s coronavirus trauma began, killing more than 25,500 and forcing the country into a strict lockdown bringing all social and economic activity to a grinding halt.Now nearly two months after its citizens retreated into their homes, allowed out only for essential reasons, Italy is facing the huge challenge of restarting public transport.From May 4 an estimated 2.7 million Italians are expected to head back to work as part of the gradual easing of the lockdown.Many will travel to work by car, motorbike or bicycle. But at least 15 per cent of workers will need to use what in Italy are normally heavily crowded trains, trams, buses and underground trains.The way in which Italy manages this return will be closely watched by other nations hoping to regain some semblance of normality.Fear of a second wave of infections is acute in a country which has suffered the world’s second highest COVID-19 death toll after the US.That has forced Italy’s public transport network to plan for continued social distancing as part of a slow resumption of the daily commute.Paola De Micheli, Italy’s transport minister, warned: “The reopening will be gradual. At the beginning, people will only be allowed to move for work or other justifiable reasons.”As part of the measures passengers will be strongly advised, though probably not obliged, to wear masks on public transport. On flights, it is likely that masks will be compulsory.There will be hand sanitiser dispensers on buses, trains and trams and many seats will remain empty in an attempt to maintain distance between people.In train stations and airports one-way lanes will separate passengers entering from those exiting.People taking taxis will be prohibited from sitting next to the driver. If there are two passengers or more, they must all wear face masks.Ms De Micheli told Corriere della Sera: “There will be social distancing of one metre. Trains and buses will travel with at most 50 per cent of seats occupied. And there will be personnel to make sure people respect the rules. The fundamental rule will be social distancing.”In normal times, Milan’s underground subway carries 1.4 million people a day. Capacity will be drastically reduced by up to 30 per cent in a bid to maintain space between passengers and turnstiles will limit access to the network.But with severely limited capacity, the only way to run the system may be to stagger people’s work times.People will be encouraged to continue working from home if they can and the government wants to build more bike lanes and may offer incentives for people buying bicycles and electric scooters.“In Italy’s eight biggest cities, rush hour is between 7.10am and 7.40am,” said Ms De Micheli. “We need to decongest this busy period.”But the minister warned that normality will only return to the public transport system, and to every other facet of life in Italy, when a vaccine is developed.Italy’s trade unions are concerned about the pressures their members will come under when the country finally starts to get moving again.“We’re expecting 300,000 people to start moving again in Milan, so we’ll need staggered shifts for offices and factories, otherwise we won’t be able to guarantee social distancing on trains,” said Luigi Ciraci from the Federation of Italian Transport Workers.And telling passengers that they cannot board buses when there are empty seats is not going to be easy.“In Rome, there are 8,300 bus stops. We’re worried for our drivers because they will have to decide who can get on and who can’t,” said Massimo Proietti, from the UIL transport union.As part of the move towards restarting Italy’s economy workers at Ferrari are signing up en masse for voluntary coronavirus screening so they can return to work as soon as possible.As part of the car manufacturer’s Back on Track project, staff, families and suppliers will first take blood tests to see if they\u0027re clear, after which an app will alert them if they\u0027ve been in close contact with any scheme members who contract COVID-19.The aim is to ensure only healthy staff resume work but if someone does get the disease, their close contacts will be alerted by the smartphone app to stay away from the plant until they\u0027ve been given the all clear.The ambitious scheme could serve as a blueprint for manufacturers desperate to resume production, in Italy and elsewhere.We\u0027ve all understood we\u0027re not indestructible, said Alberto Zanetti, head of the UILM union in northern Italy\u0027s Modena province, home to Ferrari\u0027s Maranello plant.

My wardrobe is filled with racks of sharp designer suits that I’d normally wear for my television or political work.Yet such pointless peacockery seems an age away now. In five weeks, we’ve turned into a nation of slobs. Joyously, this week the nation’s men found an unlikely style icon in, of all people, comedian Martin Clunes when he appeared on Good Morning Britain in his pyjamas. One Twitter user wrote that appearing before the nation in jimjams was now “the ultimate boss move”.Suitably inspired by Clunes, this week I took part in a six-man international Zoom conference for the charity I co-founded, the Men \u0026amp Boys Coalition. Normally business-minded events, the mood was greatly lightened by the total lack of effort we each put into our appearances. I wore jogging bottoms and a fleece-lined shirt (I’d just finished painting a door), but was trumped by a colleague in Australia, who appeared in shorts and flip-flops – while eating a burger in his Camper van.Getting dressed of a morning no longer means asking yourself of an outfit “Does it look good?” but “Does it smell OK?” And, I must confess, it’s been liberating.With clothing sales reportedly down a record 34 per cent – largely due to mothballed high streets – how many of us will go on to reset our relationship with expensive clothing? Did Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg – who always wears identical grey outfits – have it right all along? All this vanity, who is it for? What is the point of dressing up?And then there’s personal hygiene. I’ve always been a fastidious groomer, but now it seems like a waste of lounging time. I must confess that three days without a shower is becoming commonplace – something I’d only previously do during a severe bout of man flu.Record amounts of us might be googling “how do I cut my own hair?”, but I can’t even bring myself to attempt a self-inflicted crew cut that’s been called the “coronavirus crop”. Instead, I’m just letting it all grow wild, head and beard. If lockdown goes on much longer, I shall resemble Saddam Hussein when he was finally dragged out of his bunker in 2003, a tangle of a madman’s beard, dressing gown and sandals worn with socks.Getting dressed no longer means asking yourself ‘Does it look good?’ but ‘Does it smell OK?’In lockdown Britain, the fripperies of vanity seem pointless and hollow. Perhaps they always were? Last week, when comedian Russell Howard went on Lorraine Kelly’s breakfast show looking unkempt and proceeded to crack open a can of Thatcher’s cider – keen-eyed viewers spotting that he took “40 sips” at 9.15am – he wasn’t called a lush, but “a lockdown legend”. When wearing pyjamas to work or drinking strong cider at breakfast is celebrated, you know revolution is in the air.For professional men in lockdown, fashion, grooming and even personal hygiene (fastidious hand-washing aside) are temporarily obsolete. No doubt when the pandemic is over, most of us will return to our old ways. But we’re not thinking about going back to our suits and double-cuff shirts until the nation’s dry cleaners and barber shops reopen.Helen Kirwan-Taylor: According to Unilever, shoppers have been shunning shampoos and deodorant during lockdown. If only that was it. On my shunned list are: clean clothes actually, clothes in general, apart from my new yellow sweatpants from Hush which I bought to match my Marigold rubber gloves hairbrushes make-up soap (apart from to wash my hands) nail files, irons dental floss sunscreen. The list is long.Like most women of a certain age I used to have a beauty routine. Every few months I visited my wonderful stylist, Fred Gielly for highlights. Manicures and pedicure appointments were dotted into my diary along with leg and bikini waxes. I maintained some semblance of youth thanks to regular sunspot zapping, chez Dr. Jean Louis Sebagh. Sun was once the enemy: now it’s an essential part of corona combat.I might look ten years older, but who knows - I don’t look in the mirror much. If you don’t wear make-up, you don’t need to use cleanser or cream, even. I simply splash and go. I wash my hair only when it leaves an oil trail on my pillowcase (I wash one or the other but not both).I might look 10 years older, but who knows – I don’t look in the mirror muchSometimes I look like a bag lady. I hate doing laundry so I keep my apron on most of the day, along with my washing up gloves (to cover the state of my hands). I figure, why take them off as I spend most of my time in the kitchen as it is? Besides, it’s good Covid19 practice. Ironing requires coordination and patience so forget that.It’s not just me who’s turned Neanderthal. Wilson, our cairn terrier, normally goes to the groomers to be hand stripped. Now he looks like a woolly mammoth (he also smells of manure but I’m used to it.)Some of my girlfriends are trying to dye their own hair (it’s a shocker if you are dark). I know Josh Woods is sending emergency kits all over the country but you can still tell who has cheated and snuck in their colourist. One woman in my village calls herself the “root Stasi”.  She knows a professional job when she sees one (and reports it). I figure if you don’t look in the mirror too often, the grey bothers you less.Occasionally I pass someone on a village lane (the odour hits you half a mile away) and think, ‘Oh, there’s a bum,’ - then I recognise him. I spoke to a friend last night that admitted she stays in her nightie until dinnertime. Anderson \u0026amp Sheppard, the Haberdashery store in Mayfair, tells me they’re selling more bathrobes than ever—proof that everyone has stopped bothering to dress.It’s not just grooming standards that are slipping. For the first few weeks of lockdown, I cleaned manically. Now I accept that spiders and woodlice have rights too, so we leave each other alone. For Covid protection, however, I treat the kitchen like an operating theatre: I even use fairy liquid to clean vegetables.In some ways, self-isolation is a good thing. My husband and I put garlic in *everything*. In the old days, I might have worried about my breath, but now I figure anyone who smells it, deserves it, for breaching protocol. I’ve put away all the deodorants and perfume bottles in my bathroom and replaced them with home made hand sanitisers.I still shower, but quickly, so I don’t have too close a look at what is growing where. I’m not that worried, as I reckon we won’t be wearing bathing suits any time soon.  More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/04/24/15/gettyimages-1197744072.jpg","title":"alex rodriguez jennifer lopez wedding arod jlo coronavirus postponed","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.‘We have to go with the flow now’Alex Rodriguez says he and Jennifer Lopez have had to put their wedding plans “on pause” due to the coronavirus crisis.J-Lo’s fiancé spoke to Jimmy Fallon on Thursday in a remote episode of the host’s\u0026nbspTonight Show.A-Rod and Lopez were reportedly supposed to walk down the aisle this summer.

His song, with Michael Ball and The NHS Voices Of Care Choir, is part of his continued fundraising during the coronavirus crisis.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe chart victory comes after his closest competitor, The Weeknd, asked his fans to support Cpt Moore, rather than back his track “Blinding Lights”.“What wonderful news to receive today, a number one single and record-breaker too – my grandchildren can’t believe I am a chart topper,” said Cpt Moore, of Bedfordshire.Captain Tom Moore gets Pride of Britain Award for raising £28m for NHSHow to send Captain Tom Moore a card for his 100th birthdayCaptain Tom Moore sent more than 40,000 cards ahead of 100th birthday“I have to thank Michael Ball, the NHS Voices Of Care Choir and everyone behind the scenes, who shared their talents and expertise in order to raise money for the NHS, to whom we owe so much.“And, of course, the public for buying the single and donating – we’re in this together, and I am forever grateful for your support.\u0026nbspAnd this just proves you’ll never walk alone.”“You’ll Never Walk Alone”\u0026nbspis now the fastest-selling single of 2020\u0026nbspaccording to the Official Charts Company, clinching the top spot with combined chart sales of 82,000 units.The Weeknd’s “Blinding Lights” is\u0026nbspin second place with a tally of 69,000.“This is the most extraordinary thing, one of the most proudest moments of my career, but it’s not about me, it’s about Captain Tom,”\u0026nbspBall told OfficialCharts.“Thank you for giving him a number one on his 100th birthday. You are the best, God bless ya.”Martin Talbot, chief executive Official Charts Company, added: “The sight of Captain Tom Moore and Michael Ball at the top of the official singles chart this week should lift everybody’s spirits in these extraordinary times.“We are absolutely delighted to see them at the pinnacle and setting new landmarks as they go – including a record as the oldest number one singles artist of all time.“It has been a roller coaster week, starting with a big initial lead for Captain Tom, before The Weeknd closed the gap yesterday to almost nothing – before a massive surge in the final day by Captain Tom.“Huge thanks to The Weeknd for lending his support at the eleventh hour. But this is Captain Tom’s week – congratulations sir and happy birthday for next week. You are a hero to us all.”The Weeknd asked his fans on Twitter on Thursday to support Captain Tom’s single to get him to the number one slot.At 99 years and 11 months, Captain Tom is the oldest artist to reach the top spot on the Official Singles Chart in its near 70-year history.He will also become the first centenarian to top the charts as he will turn 100 on Thursday, while he still holds the number one spot.The BBC’s Live Lounge Allstars charity cover of the Foo Fighters’ “Times Like These” entered the chart at number five within hours of release, while St Jhn’s “Roses” slipped from number two to three and Drake’s “Tootsie Slide” went from third spot to fourth.Captain Tom has also broken two Guinness World Records, including for the most money raised by an inidual charity walk, and as the oldest person to reach number one in the UK charts.The inidual charity walk record was previously held by Canadian athlete Terry Fox, who raised £27,201,900 (adjusted from £5.4m\u0026nbspaccording to inflation) in 1980.“I feel very honoured to receive recognition from Guinness World Records,” Cpt Moore said.“My charity walk has raised more money than I could have possibly imagined and I am so thankful to those who have donated money and bought the single so we could achieve these records together and raise money for our incredible NHS during these difficult times.“These really are Guinness World Records titles for all of us.”Guinness World Records editor-in-chief Craig Glenday said: “Tom’s remarkable efforts prove that age should never be a barrier to making a difference, to inspiring the nation or to breaking world records.“The fact that this indomitable 99-year-old has achieved all three of these things makes him truly a national hero that rightly deserves his place in the history books.“We’re proud to be able to welcome him into the Guinness World Records family.”Additional reporting by Press AssociationThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It’s out of context \u0026amp it’s too serious a subject to talk about on a platform like this... people who have been abused or assaulted should seek guidance from a therapist... this is not a healthy place for topics this serious.”Pompeo later added:\u0026nbsp”For those who feel offended or are taking this personally this panel was 2+ years ago and it was way before the whole stories of the women came out I Certainly didn’t know he was a rapist at that point ... that took s*** to a whole different level.”She later clarified that timeline,\u0026nbspwriting:\u0026nbsp”Okay so I was just told The Times story was out before this but I didn’t read it ...

But the company has now paused the availability of that and some other categories as it deals with false stories around the pandemic.Other topics including conspiracy theory appear to have disappeared from the list, and a Facebook spokesperson confirmed to Reuters that other categories were being hidden as it evaluates the different audience categories.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe removal came after a report that demonstrated it was possible to pick people interested in pseudoscience for targeting with particular posts, presumably allowing them to be targeted with false or misleading information.Such people would not necessarily know they were thought to be interested in such a topic, and would not have given any explicit indication that they were. Instead, the tag was probably added by automated systems based on the kinds of content they engage with.The Markup demonstrated that Facebook was allowing such ads after saying it would police COVID-19 misinformation on its platform. More than 78 million Facebook users were interested in pseudoscience, it said, citing Facebook\u0027s ad portal.Misinformation about the pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus, from bogus cures to wide-ranging conspiracy theories, has also spread on rival social media platforms such Twitter Inc and YouTube, the video service of Alphabet Inc\u0027s Google.Advocacy group Avaaz reported last week that a sample of 104 coronavirus-related pieces of misinformation content on Facebook analyzed by the group had reached over 117 million estimated views.Data gathered by ProPublica in 2016 shows that Facebook assigned pseudoscience to users at that time, suggesting the category has been available for several years.The Facebook spokeswoman said in her email that the pseudoscience category should have been removed in a previous review.Created with Sketch.Gadget and tech news: In pictures Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.125 Gun-toting humanoid robot sent into spaceRussia has launched a humanoid robot into space on a rocket bound for the International Space Station (ISS).

After the government was heavily criticised for its failure to provide equipment to medical staff, Sarah says she\u0027s never had to enter a Covid-19 ward without PPE, but has “probably worn about five to six different types of gowns and visors and masks, depending on the stock and the flow and the amount of different stuff available at different sites.”You can read about the interview here.You can subscribe to the series on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Acast or wherever you listen.

One participant was given a dose of the vaccine, while the other was given a meningitis vaccine for comparison.Speaking to BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Prof Gilbert said the team was looking to recruit hospital workers “who will be at greater risk of infection” in order to increase the chances of gauging the vaccine’s efficacy.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesShe said they were “not convinced” that Covid-19 is still prevalent enough in the UK for the trial to produce results as quickly as they would like.“We’ve been accelerating the trial as much as we possibly can and we’re looking to, for the next phase of the trial, specifically recruit people who work in hospitals who will be at greater risk of infection, because while there are still cases in hospital, that’s where the virus is,” she said.Tracking the coronavirus outbreak around the world in maps and chartsWhen can we really expect coronavirus to end?Everything you need to know on supermarket delivery slotsThe dirty truth about washing your handsListen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus Podcast“We’re going to try and increase our chances of getting the vaccine efficacy result by doing that. But we accept that we may not be able to do that in this country, so we’re also making plans to set up trials in other countries where the transmission of the virus has been a bit slower to get going because we may need to go and test the vaccine somewhere else.”Researchers need to test the actual vaccine against a placebo in large enough groups of people in order to determine its effectiveness. They are testing for three things: the vaccine’s safety, its ability to induce immune responses, and its efficacy in stopping people from contracting the coronavirus.According to Prof Gilbert, the team are aiming to have at least 5,000 people take part in the trials.However, the fall in the rate of infections could delay the production of the vaccine. The Oxford team had hopes of at least a million doses of its candidate being ready in September.“It could still happen over the summer and maybe we will get a signal of efficacy, a trend towards efficacy, a hint that it’s working here, and then be able to add to that by doing trials in other countries.” No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

At this moment we don’t have a treatment for coronavirus so we would have to do this extremely carefully.”On Thursday, Prof Gilbert said she was “very optimistic” that the vaccine developed by her team will be successful, but she added that there was “absolutely no suggestion” the vaccine would become available to the general population before its efficacy was determined.The Oxford Vaccine Group hopes to repeat the testing process with six more volunteers on Saturday, and will move to larger numbers on Monday.University of Oxford\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The firm should work with the customer to resolve these difficulties in advance of payments being missed, the FCA said.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Indeed, they have become four times as frequent\u0026nbspin the past half-century.Since the 1970s, it is\u0026nbspestimated at least three dozen infectious diseases have emerged from human interference with animals, including Sars, Mers, Ebola, \u0026nbspbird flu, swine flu and the Zika virus. As far back as 2007 the World Health Organisation warned that infectious diseases were emerging at a rate that had not been seen before.The spread of the viruses is put down to a deadly combination of wildlife trafficking and consumption, increasing human encroachment into wildlife habitats as more people live in densely populated areas – and air travel, which enables pathogens to take hold globally.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThree years ago, an article\u0026nbsppublished by the US National Centre for Biotechnology Information stated, presciently: “The Aids and influenza pandemics have claimed and will continue to claim millions of lives. The recent Sars and Ebola epidemics have threatened populations across borders. The emergence of Mers may well be warning signals of a nascent pandemic threat.”Zoonotic diseases are complex, and it’s sometimes impossible to say a virus has disappeared, because it might have many different strains, and might mutate and lie dormant. This is a timeline of the main zoonotic diseases to have hit us since the start of the 20th century:How to help the elderly and vulnerable during the coronavirusHow to feel less anxious about the coronavirusHow to be productive when working from home during coronavirusWhich countries around the world has coronavirus spread to?The dirty truth about washing your handsThe 1918 flu pandemic: This was the most severe pandemic in modern times, killing at least 50 million people in two years. It is widely believed that the virus originated in birds because it shared genetic mutations with the bird flu virus later found in Asia, and could have transferred to horses in the trenches of the first world war before spreading to humans. This is disputed, with one study suggesting it came from mammals.Asian flu, 1957:\u0026nbspIn February 1957, a new influenza virus, known as H2N2 emerged in east Asia, which spread into a pandemic. It originated from an avian influenza virus, causing an estimated 1.1 million deaths worldwide.HIV: First identified in 1981, the disease is thought to have been acquired by people in central Africa hunting chimpanzees and coming into contact with their infected blood. However, studies show that HIV may have jumped from apes to humans as far back as the late 1800s, and it has existed in the West since at least the mid to late 1970s. HIV has killed about 35 million people to date, according to the World Health Organisation.Wildlife trade continues in Asia amid calls for restrictions China tries to shut down wildlife trade but markets remain openBlack-market trade ‘may undermine Vietnam ban on disease-rife markets’Stray dogs eating bat meat ‘could have sparked coronavirus pandemic’Sars:\u0026nbspSevere acute respiratory syndrome is another type of coronavirus, which killed at least 770 people globally in an epidemic in 2002-3. Most victims were in southern China, Vietnam and Singapore. Scientists are not certain of its origins but like Covid-19 it’s thought it could have come from bats and spread to other animals such as civet cats, which are commonly sold in squalid conditions in street markets. The epidemic resulted in more than 8,000 cases, in 26 countries. Of those, 774 died.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The H1N1 virus killed nearly tens of thousands of people in a global pandemic that spread to 214 countries in less than a year. However, overall the outbreak was not as serious as originally predicted, largely because many older people were already immune to it. And the NHS says it now circulates each year and is considered a normal seasonal flu strain, which is covered by the annual seasonal flu vaccine. A study in 2013 suggested between 123,000 and 200,000 people globally may have died as a result of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic.Mers:\u0026nbspFirst identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012, Middle East respiratory syndrome is also a coronavirus whose symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath. With an estimated death rate of 35 per cent, the disease has killed 858 people, according to the WHO. Again, scientists think it spread to humans from bats, this time via camels.Exterminating bats blamed for Covid-19 ‘would increase disease risk’Ebola: A 2014–2016 outbreak in West Africa was the largest and most complex Ebola outbreak since the virus was first discovered in 1976, killing 11,300 people. Scientists say it began with a child in Guinea who came into contact with infected bats, but it has since been widely linked to the killing and butchering of bush meat, including monkeys, chimps, antelopes, fruit bats, porcupines and rats.Zika: First identified in Uganda in 1947 in monkeys, the mosquito-borne virus caused alarm in 2015, when it was thought to be the cause of thousands of cases of microcephaly – a shorter-than-normal head – in babies in Brazil. Outbreaks soon appeared throughout the Americas, Africa and other regions. It was thought to have killed 29 babies.Bird flu: Avian influenza, also called avian flu or bird flu, has many different strains but one of those, H7N9, has caused 1,568 cases in humans and 616 deaths worldwide since 2013, according to the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations.Another strain of the virus, H5N1, first identified in 1997, spread across east and southeast Asia, killing six people in Hong Kong and leading to vast swathes of chickens and turkeys – from Hong Kong to Britain – having to be culled early after contracting the disease. To date 861 cases of human H5N1 infection and 455 deaths have been reported.\u0026nbspThe highest number of infections and deaths were in Indonesia, Vietnam and Thailand. The H5N1 virus, which has a 60 per cent mortality rate among infected humans, according to WHO, has not gone away, but is thought to have mutated.Bird flu has been linked to rapid intensification of the poultry industry, with thousands of birds crowded together indoors and with compromised immune systems.The Independent is campaigning against the wildlife trade at the core of the Covid-19 pandemic.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It is a charity that has adapted with incredible speed to the crisis to help the most vulnerable in our community. In just five weeks, they have responded to the increased demand for food by quadrupling their output. We hope that our donation, coupled with the campaigning power of The Independent, will help the project grow and reach as many as possible of the one in five Londoners at risk of food poverty.”Another substantial contribution came in yesterday from the Julia and Hans Rausing Trust, which has assigned £16.5m\u0026nbspto charities at the forefront of the coronavirus pandemic and has donated £50,000 to our appeal.How to support our campaignJulia and Hans Rausing,\u0026nbspheirs of food packing giant Tetra Pak, said: “We have been impressed not only by the speed of The Felix Project’s response to the crisis, but the way in which they have managed to get a number of organisations working together to help people across the capital. Efforts like this support communities across London at this time of need, and we are glad to support their inspiring work.”We launched our appeal, in association with the Evening Standard, on Friday 27 March\u0026nbspand have reached £3m\u0026nbspthanks to the generous backing of dozens of London foundations, philanthropists and corporations, including Garfield Weston Foundation, Lansdowne Partners, the Westminster Foundation, Sir Peter Blake, Burberry, Eranda Rothschild Foundation, Citibank and investment holding company Temasek.More than 1,170 members of the public have contributed, donating £103,837 on our Virgin Money Giving page.But there is a sense that we are still in the foothills of the economic crisis, with experts warning the government that food poverty is about to get far worse. The Food Foundation has reported that eight million people in Britain face food insecurity and that three million have been missing meals since lockdown. The Institute for Social and Economic Research at University of Essex estimates that 6.5 million jobs could be lost in the coming months, causing a huge rise in demand for free food.As the biggest supplier of free food in London, The Felix Project has been operating 12 hours a day, six days a week, distributing surplus food to giant community hubs, including Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in Haringey, as well as to 80 charities and schools across the capital.The Independent\u0026nbspis encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry across the country – find out how you can help\u0026nbsphere.

He picked up a van at a depot in northwest London, drove more than 100 miles to pick up two tons of surplus food, returned to the depot to unload, and then headed back out across the capital to deliver fresh produce to hungry children and adults. He works a 65-hour week –\u0026nbspand has done so since the start of the coronavirus outbreak –\u0026nbspfor no pay.MacNichol is a volunteer for The Felix Project, our Help The Hungry appeal partner. Since lockdown, Felix has quadrupled food deliveries to vulnerable Londoners to a staggering 100,000 meals a day. But they have had to manage this with a small staff of 22 and a 30-fold reduction in volunteers – from 3,500 to just 115 – as many of their volunteers are over 70 and can no longer work due to Covid-19 restrictions.These super volunteers are the backbone for London’s fourth emergency service –\u0026nbspfood provision to the capital’s hungry –\u0026nbspand Felix could not function without them. Today we meet six of them and ask why they joined and what volunteering means to them.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHow to support our campaign“Going back 10 years, we were instructed by our bosses at Sainsbury’s to destroy all surplus food, but then the likes of Felix came along and suddenly there was no excuse for waste. I was so impressed by Felix’s operation that I promised to volunteer when I retired. Since coronavirus, I do a 65-hour week. I start at their Park Royal depot, drive to Hello Fresh in Banbury and to Mindful Chef near Birmingham, returning with a two-ton\u0026nbsppayload. Later I deliver to community hubs, charities and schools that have set up food drop centres.“Recently I supplied a school in Ealing and as I arrived one boy said to his friend, “now we’ve got something to eat tonight”, and I thought, bloody hell. To think some parents have to choose between paying rent and feeding their children and that Felix is the only reason they can do both — it brings a lump to your throat.”Retired facilities manager for City officesRuns a fundraising\u0026nbspconsultancy for charities“I came across Felix when it launched in 2016 and was hired to help them raise funds. I promised myself that one day I would go back and volunteer –\u0026nbspand that’s what I did last November. It was amazing to see how Felix had grown into a major lifeline for thousands of Londoners. I thought, incredible growth, incredible impact –\u0026nbspit really does walk the talk. In my job, I see the distress inequality causes, but when I go out in a Felix van, I feel I am doing something good for the community. It might sound schmaltzy but, for me, it’s my war effort.”Economics graduate, works for Cisco Systems“I started volunteering for Felix in January and the thing that struck me when I first walked into their Park Royal warehouse was the unbelievable quantity of food that would otherwise go to waste. It is such a bustling place and since coronavirus, it’s even busier because major suppliers like Hello Fresh and Sainsbury’s have even more surplus food. It’s a boost for my morale to help during lockdown and satisfying to see the smiles on people’s faces as you arrive in the green Felix van.”Tracking the coronavirus outbreak around the world in maps and chartsWhen can we really expect coronavirus to end?Everything you need to know on supermarket delivery slotsThe dirty truth about washing your handsListen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus PodcastLawyer and non-executive director of Investec Wealth“I joined Felix last year because my friend Gary had been there 18 months and loves it, so I went out in the van and got hooked.

A number of our churches across the capital, particularly those that host and run food banks and homeless shelters, have successfully partnered with Felix in the past. Never has there been a greater need for us all to come together to support the vulnerable in our local communities.”Imam Mahmoud, who ran a half marathon to support Felix in 2017, said: “I applaud the good work that The Independent and The Felix Project are doing to feed and support the elderly and most vulnerable members of our community during this time of crisis. In difficult times, it is important that we all come together regardless of background and support each other as a community and as a nation, the best we can.”With the start of Ramadan today, Imam Mahmoud added that he was particularly “moved by the good spirit” that people have shown towards others of late. “This project is close to my heart because I’ve seen first-hand the benefit that it has bought to the community. I urge everyone to continue to support Food for London Now and other projects like it.”Rabbi Mirvis called for a sense of community at a time when many feel isolated. He said: “The great Jewish sages taught that ‘anyone who saves a single life is considered to have saved the whole world’. In these extraordinary times, it is not only the heroes of the NHS who are called upon to fulfil this noblest aspiration. The efforts of The Independent and The Felix Project, together with their partners, make it possible for us all to play our part in saving the lives of the most vulnerable among us.“Today, as many thousands of people face the agonising uncertainty of not knowing where their next meal is coming from, we must reach out to them with compassion and reassurance. I urge everyone who is able to support the appeal.”How to support our campaignThe Independent\u0027s appeal, in association with our sister newspaper The Evening Standard, was set up to fund The Felix Project, London’s biggest surplus food distributor, to provide for the delivery of food to the poor and elderly who are unable to afford supplies, or are stuck at home at risk of losing their lives. Felix currently delivers the equivalent of 100,000 meals a day to giant community hubs run by local authorities as well as charities and schools across the capital.The Independent\u0026nbspis encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry across the country – find out how you can help\u0026nbsphere.

Northern Powerhouse Rail have asked government for £25m to get on with working up the outline scheme that they want to do,” Sir John told the Commons Transport Select Committee.“Those are the sort of things that the government can do to get things moving because in the first place it’s not about digging holes, it’s actually about doing lots of environmental work assessments, design, consultation, land acquisition. There’s several years of work that will take place on Northern Powerhouse Rail before you can start digging holes.”The scheme is backed by northern cities and will share some infrastructure with the north-south high-speed railway HS2, the construction of which was green-lit by the government last week.Sir John said the best way for the government to ensure there was capacity to build multiple schemes all at once was to “give more certainty to its long-term plans and long-term strategy” so that contractors would feel able to invest long-term in their capabilities.The chair of the Commission – which is conducting a review into phase two of HS2, connecting Birmingham to Manchester and Leeds – said the construction of new lines was a good idea.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It’s called High Speed Two, but frankly it’s more capacity to the north. Rail will continue to grow the demand is there.”He warned critics of the project that it was difficult to accurately draw up an economic business case for it because that would involve making predictions.“We’re talking about a project that is going to be beneficial to the country for the next 75 years at least, and forecasting how those long-term socioeconomic benefits will play out is difficult enough for anyone. I think occasionally you need to say, ‘This looks a sensible thing to do, so let’s go ahead,’” he said.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The cruise ship Ruby Princess departs from Port Kembla, some 80 kilometres south of SydneyAn activist performs on the roof during Earth Day in Wroclaw, PolandMalaysian army personnel set up barbed wire in the locked down area of Selayang wholesale market in Kuala LumpurA trader walks inside a pen as he arrives to purchase vegetables and fruits at the Agricultural Produce Market Committee market in Navi Mumbai during the nationwide lockdownA bride, poses for a wedding photographer next to East Lake in WuhanPeople shout at police officers during a demonstration of conspiracy theorists as other demonstrators protest against the lockdown imposed to slow the spread of the coronavirus in BerlinA pair of rare morepork owl chicks have become the first in more than a decade to survive on Norfolk Island, in the South PacificA squirrel runs across a fence as the sun shines in Berlin\u0027s Kreuzberg districtElection officials count after general election voting in Seoul, South KoreaNotre-Dame Cathedral in Paris, which was damaged in a devastating fire one year ago todayWild bluebells, which bloom around mid-April turning the forest blue as they form a carpet, pictured in the Hallerbos in BelgiumPope Francis delivers his Urbi et Orbi message following Easter Sunday Mass behind closed doors at St Peter\u0027s Basilica in The Vatican, during the country\u0027s lockdownA man watches Krakatau spewing ash during an eruption, in Serang, Indonesia\u0027s Banten provinceWomen queue for distribution of food for those suffering under Kenya\u0027s coronavirus-related movement restrictionsFirefighter Sittiporn Singthong, dressed up as Spider-Man, sprays disinfectant at the Wat Tha Mai Buddhist temple in Samut Sakhon province, ThailandTulip fields in Plomeur, western FranceA employee and a resident of the house for the elderly De Ravenstein react as nurses dance and sing in the garden, following the coronavirus disease outbreak, in Boortmeerbeek, BelgiumA man stands in the balcony of his home with the moon in the background in Cali, ColombiaA man holds a traditional lamp from the balcony of his house as torches and candles illuminate houses and high rise residential buildings as Indians mark the country\u0027s fight against the coronavirus pandemic a suburb of New Delhi, IndiaMedical staff load an infected patient into an ambulance at the Nimes air base, south of France, during an evacuation operation from the hard-hit east of the country where hospitals are overwhelmedA man prays inside the closed Moussawi Grand Mosque in BasraA City Hall health official wearing a protective suit sprays disinfectant at the entrance of City One condominium as the residential building was placed under lockdown after 17 cases of COVID-19 were detected, in Kuala Lumpur, MalaysiaMigrant workers wait on marked areas on the ground to maintain social distancing as they queue to receive food packets at an industrial area during a government-imposed nationwide lockdown as a preventive measure against the Covid-19 coronavirus, in ChennaiWedding dress and evening wear designer Friederike Jorzig adjusts a mannequin wearing a wedding dress with matching protective mask in her store Chiton in BerlinA stray dog walks in front of an empty historic India Gate, as nationwide lockdown continues over the coronavirus in New Delhi, IndiaA man watches a TV screen showing a file image of North Korea\u0027s missile launch during a news program at the Seoul Railway Station in SeoulHong Kong\u0027s skyline is seen with some of its lights turned off to mark the Earth Hour, an environmental campaignUkrainian citizens queue at the Polish-Ukrainian border during the coronavirus pandemic in Korczowa, Poland.

He had vowed to continue preaching unless I\u0027m in jail or the hospital before his death from coronavirus earlier this month.The bishop told his congregation that he believes God is larger than this dreaded virus just days before Virginia Governor\u0026nbspRalph Northam\u0026nbspurged people to avoid nonessential group gatherings.During a 15 March service, which nearly 200 people attended, the bishop said: I\u0027m glad to be in the Lord\u0027s house. It didn\u0027t have to be this way. The government could have said we couldn\u0027t gather at all. Just imagine if the government had the authority to say, you and me, we can\u0027t go to church. Aren\u0027t you glad you were free to get up and come?Most congregations are following stay-at-home guidelines,\u0026nbspaccording to recent polling\u0026nbspthat found that nearly 90 per cent of congregations have closed their churches and been encouraged to worship at home.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The survey found that evangelicals were more likely to report worshipping in person. In states with restrictions on attending church as well as those without, nearly a third of church-attending evangelicals said they continued to attend in person.Though many Christians have continued to practise their faith at home or by watching live-streamed services held in empty churches, places of worship across the US have been linked to several outbreaks.A report\u0026nbspfrom the\u0026nbspCenters\u0026nbspfor Disease Control and Prevention showed how religious services in particular can be deadly vectors for the disease.The\u0026nbspCDC\u0026nbspillustrated how a Chicago funeral became a super-spreader event that played a significant role in transmission of the virus.Among several people who became ill following the service, one patient who developed\u0026nbspCovid-19\u0026nbspsymptoms two days after attending the funeral was hospitalised a week later and put on a ventilator. The patient\u0026nbsplater died.Wife of arrested pastor Spell flashes wad of cash as she bails him outChurches sue US governor for right to hold religious servicesChurches mark Palm Sunday with virtual services amid Covid-19 lockdownChurches remain packed as pastors ignore coronavirus lockdown ordersPastor arrested for repeatedly violating social distancing rulesFlorida Pentecostal pastor\u0026nbspRodney Howard-Browne\u0026nbspheld several services in packed churches despite warnings from health officials and doctors to avoid large gatherings to prevent spreading the disease, which he called a phantom plague before his arrest for violating social distancing rules.Hillsborough\u0026nbspCounty Sheriff Chad\u0026nbspChronister\u0026nbspsaid that the pastor\u0027s reckless disregard for human life put hundreds of people in his congregation at risk along with thousands of Florida residents.Republican Senate Majority Leader\u0026nbspMitch McConnell\u0026nbspeven intervened in Louisville\u0027s social distancing guidelines as the mayor warned residents about packing churches on Easter.He said: Religious people should not be singled out for\u0026nbspdisfavoured\u0026nbsptreatment.Some Christian pastors plan showdown with coronavirus at EasterThe right to worship has emerged as one of the chief battles within the looming culture war brought on by the coronavirus, dramatically emphasising the outsized role of fringe American conservatism across the US and in the White House.The pandemic has also renewed defence of the Second Amendment, with the National Rifle Association claiming lockdowns during the pandemic a chance for them to want your guns, while gun stores are closed along with other nonessential businesses. The claims have been echoed by Donald Trump in his string of tweets to liberate states with Democratic governors, including Virginia, where he said gun rights are under siege. Republican officials have also used the crisis to close abortion clinics and deny abortion care under government orders to halt nonelective procedures.Roy Moore, who was endorsed by the president during his failed bid for a senate seat in Alabama, defended Louisiana pastor Tony Spell after he was charged for continually shunning a statewide ban on large gatherings.His Life Tabernacle Church has been linked to at least one death from coronavirus.The East Baton Rouge Parish coroner determined that the death of a 78-year-old man who had visited the church was due to Covid-19. The pastor has said the results are a lie.Mr Spell has been embroiled in a legal battle over his opposition to the state\u0027s stay-at-home order, stressing to his followers that it\u0027s their duty to continue attending church services despite the pandemic.He was recently arrested and charged with aggravated assault for allegedly attempting to back over a protester with his church bus. He said he\u0027s not guilty.His attorney Jeff Wittenbrick was admitted to Baton Rouge General hospital last week with a high fever and persistent cough after attending two events at the church earlier this month.Mr Spell, meanwhile, had planned to host a 2,000-member service on Easter Sunday.Central Police Department Chief Roger Corcoran said he had counted about 330 people who entered the church.Reverend Spell has also directed parishioners to donate their federal stimulus checks —\u0026nbspsent out earlier this month to support unemployed and under-employed Americans during the crisis —\u0026nbspto his website.Several other prominent evangelical leaders and televangelists on the Christian right, who rely on miraculous healing in their ministries, have also attempted to capitalise on the crisis.Kenneth Copeland urged viewers to pay tithes despite losing their jobs amid unprecedented unemployment claims. Jim Bakker pleaded to viewers to donate to his ministry to avoid filing for bankruptcy after he was cut off from credit card processing companies for selling a fake coronavirus cure for $80.But the pandemic has created unprecedented legal friction between state and local governments and churches that conservatives suggest will continue through the quarantine.This week, a federal court judge in California denied a request from three churches in the state to continue holding in-person services, which one pastor claims are commanded by scripture in order for them to lay hands on people and pray for them.The judge rejected arguments from Shield of Faith Family Church, Word of Life Ministries International and Church Unlimited that claimed Governor Gavin Newsom\u0027s stay-at-home order violates their First Amendment rights.Following the ruling, Harmeet Dhillon, who serves on the Republican National Committee for California and as the CEO of Center for American Liberty, said Americans should count on more restrictions on all your civil rights with no end in sight.Centres for Disease Control and Prevention\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

As I say, this baffling statement will make zero dference to their already fractured relationship with the UK.In an ideal world, every media outlet worldwide would form a pact that they will never again write about or use a photograph of the Sussexes.The effect would be swt and damning.For without the oxygen of publicity, what are they Married to a home-body, I have always rather envied those whose other halves travel frequently for their job.It gives you the house to yourself sporadicallyand makes you appreciate them when they .But in lockdown we are faring well because we are already used to being together most of the time.A friend whose husband usually travels for work called me the other day to say that his sudden, constant presence in the home was causing friction.And yesterday, Boyzone star Shane Lynch announced the sad news that lockdown has put his -year marriage to Sheena White under intolerable strain.He says: “I’m not even in my family home right now because me and her were at each other’s throats.“It wasn’t a good time or a good space.“I’m usually on the road and for the first time I’ve spent three months in my house . . . it can be a struggle.”Indeed it can. Let’s hope they sort it out for the sake of their two children.Now the dust has settled around Professor Neil Ferguson’s original estimate of , Covid deaths, it’s perhaps time to stand back and take a logical overview of the situation.While the death toll is still worrying, the mantra that we are critically harming the economy to protect the NHS from being overwhelmed is undermined by the news that many of the private hospitals repurposed for Covid patients are lying virtually empty and the ,-bed facility set up in London’s ExCel centre is only treating  people.It’s adding credence to the burgeoning mindset that, perhaps, those who are considered vulnerable should remain in lockdown while the rest of the country makes a gradualto school or work while maintaining strict social distancing measures.On GMB yesterday, a gruff, Swedish professor, whose name escaped me, was asked to explain the thinking behind his country’s policy to keep everything open.He replied: “People are not stupid.”In other words, the Swedes are taking personal responsibility for how they behave and, as of earlier this week, the death rate was starting to decline.It remains to be seen whether Sweden’s outlier stance proves to be the correct one, but one thing is for certain: Its economy may be weakened at the end of it, but it won’t be on the critical list like ours.Model and businessman David Gandy talked about the importance of fostering at the weekend, under the headline, “OMG. He’s so cute!”Indeed he is, was my immediate thought. My second was that I would happily foster him anytime.However, it turns out the headline and suggestion of benevolence was aimed at Dora, his rescue pup from Battersea Dogs Home, for which David is an ambassador.He says: “What I love about the evenings now is the calmness of a tired, sleeping dog at your side. I watch Dora dreaming.”Lucky Dora.One wondersshe knows that, when it comes to good fortune, she has won the canine equivalent of the Lottery.Last year, I read to kids in a primary school and, with rare exception, every time I asked what they wanted to be when they grew up, they replied: “A YouTuber.”Yet last week, while queuing behind a mother and her daughter outside the supermarket, the young girldeclared her desire to become a nurse when she left school.Now that is something positive to come out of the Covid- crisis.Jigsaws are getting me through the long days of lockdown.Despite The Bloke’s lame attempts to hide the last pieceI completed my fth at the weekend and, as an exercise in mindfulness, it’s right up there with any yoga retreat.So imagine my joy when Kodak announced last week that it has produced the world’s largest jigsaw with, gulp, , pieces.It is  separate images of world landmarks and, when finished, covers  square metres – about the size of a standard living room.

You have to do it.They keep us fit — or at least, far fitter than we would ever bethey weren’t compulsory walkies waiting for us at the startof every new day.I would never dream of jumping out of bed at dawnit was not for Stan, our ruby-coloured, eight-year-old Cavalier King Charles spaniel, who is always keen to get out into the world and snf a few lampposts, greet four-legged friends and wander, blissed-out, through nature.Whatever the weather, Stan wakes up ready for his dawn yomp on London’s Hampstead Heath and, whatever my mood, Stan is sure to lt it.Because dogs are the most positive creatures on God’s earth.But while they are helping save lives, who is there to help them The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today herewww.thesun whocareswinsappealNo animal on the planet comes in so many dferent shapes and sizes and temperaments, but every dog knows how to get the maximum joy out of any given moment.Dogs have a genius for living le to the full.In these dark days, their relentlessly positive outlook is nothing less than inspirational.And you can’t help noticing that dogs rather like lockdown.With her A-levels coming up, the closure of the schools was a devastating blow for my -year-old daughter.But Stan is absolutely delighted to have her hanging around the house.Even after all these weeks, he trots after her with his tail wagging happily and a pleasantly surprised expression that says: “What are you doing here in the middle of the day ”Many of our ten million pooches must get desperately lonely home alone during the long working days of normal le.They are not lonely now, and are delighted to be our constant companions.The reason that the ,-year-old partnership between humans and dogs has worked so well is because dogs have been happy to perform whateverwe have asked of them.Guard dogs, guide dogs, snfer dogs, herding dogs, lapdogs, therapy dogs — you name it and some dog out there will do it brilliantly.And now there is research to seethey can be trained to spot coronavirus.Medical detection dogs already help screen for cancer, malaria and Parkinson’s disease.Now the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine is running tests to seedogs can be trained to snf out Covid-.“We do not knowCovid- has a specic odour yet,” says Professor James Logan, head of LSHTM’s department for disease control.“But we know that other respiratory diseases change our body odour so there is a chance that it does.“Andit does, dogs will be able to detect it.”We ask a lot of our dogs.In the lockdown, we look to our four-legged friends to be the cure for loneliness.We are backing a proposal by Lord Ashcroft to honour our health heroes with the gallantry gong given for acts of bravery that did not take place in battle.A No spokesman said: “The NHS is doing a fantastic job and the nation will want to find a way to say thank you when we have defeated this virus.”SAS hero Andy McNab added: “The award of a George Cross would show an emotional appreciation.”We are asking our readers to please sign the petition below.The Dogs Trust, the UK’s largest canine charity, reports that is has been “overwhelmed” with applications for dogs to keep the nation company during lockdown, not least for all those millions of children who are shut out of school and no longer able to see their friends.“On Sunday March  we recorded our busiest day at the contact centre since it opened in , with a  per cent increase in calls,” says a Dogs Trust spokesman. “However, like many other animal welfare charities, we have now closed all our rehoming centres.”This dog-crazy nation got even crazier about dogs during lockdown.But it is probably just as well that organisations such as the Dogs Trust and Battersea Dogs Home are currently closed.Because getting a dog should never be an impulse buy.I came downstairs this morning and discovered Stan had sprayed liquid diarrhoea all over his cage.He was mortied, not least because he knew that I was going to have to clean it up. Stan can’t do it.Nobody will ever love you like a dog.Nobody will ever be as happy to see you as a dog.Nobody will ever make you laugh as much as a dog.In their heartbreakingly brief lives they make you realise how lucky you are to be alive.I would recommend getting a dog to anyone.Watching your child grow up with a dog is a privilege and a joy.But our dogs rely on us as much as we rely on them.And a dog is for ever, not just for lockdown.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

First, the EU scheme has spectacularly failed to deliver anything.Indeed — as I suggest below — the EU is coming apart at the seams over this virus.And second, the invitation to join the scheme was sent, by those EU genii, to the wrong address. Duh.It is becoming more apparent with every day that passes that the civil service is the biggest impediment to the UK reforming itself.It is hostile to the Government, to the people — and deeply hostile to change of any kind.It is a vast congregation of time-serving bureaucrats dedicated only to saving their own jobs.The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today herewww.thesun whocareswinsappealEven now, red tape may be stling our efforts to deal with the coronavirus.It will be interesting to discover, once this pandemic has receded, what part the civil service played in the UK’s failure to carry out adequate testing for the virus, right from the start.And the failure to bring in vital equipment.Government ministers carry the can for these sorts of failures, of course.But it is the civil service charged with enacting the decisions.I wonder how many ventilators have failed to arrive here because of some bureaucratic hitch I wonder what would have happenedthe civil service, rather than the military, were charged with building those Nightingale hospitals.They might just about be ready by the end of the century.It was clear, when this Government came to office, that the real opposition wasn’t the ragged hounds and trots on the Labour benches, but from the very people paid to enable the government — the civil service.There needs to be a clear-out, from the top down.Because this battle — between civil servants and Government ministers — will continue long after this virus has been defeated.Their opposition to Government policy hampers almost everything we do.That’s no way to run a country.I see The Vicar Of Dibley is back. Dawn French will reprise her role as the Rev Geraldine Granger for the BBC’s Big Night In this evening.That should cheer us up for a few moments.Here are a few more sitcoms they could update to keep us laughing through the lockdown:Some Mothers Do ’Ave ’Em – Frank Spencer is appointed Health Secretary and has to give briefings every day to the Press. Ooh, Betty, the hilarity.Till Death Us Do Part – Alf Garnett, in self isolation, kindly explains to us what he thinks of some Chinese culinary practices and the Chinese government.Both Feet In The Grave – sadly, there was no ventilator for Victor.Not Going Out – huge laughs as a large number of people don’t, er, go out.Are You Being Served  – um . . .  no, actually.Dad’s Army – Captain Mainwaring orders his men to build a new hospital in two days flat, with hilarious consequences.On The Buses – Stan and Jack vow to wreak revenge on the idiots who won’t give them PPE.How’s the home- schooling coming along then Got the kids up at eight every morning to do a bit of calculus I’ve been enjoying it, although I maybe haven’t given enough attention to mathematics.But it’s been a good chance to redress some of the crap my daughter has been subjected to in ten years of state education.She now has a slightly dferent take on the British Empire, the poverty of Africa and how fun it might be to transition into being a bloke.A mad woman in America has warned that home-schooling is “dangerous”. Why Professor of Law Elizabeth Bartholet said: “It’s always dangerous to put powerful people in charge of the powerless.”.She added that it gave parents “authoritarian control” over the kids.You mean like the authoritarian control they’ve had from the teachers all these years, love It’s comforting to know that even in this crisis, the liberals are still as deranged as ever.You’ve got to feel sorry for Victoria Beckham, haven’t you Poor woman says that last week was the worst of her le.She’s bitterly disappointed with you, the British people.She thinks we were all terribly arsey about her when she decided to use our money to furlough her fashion company workers.How could we be so mean as to expect a woman who has an estimated wealth of £million – acquired largely through singing badly – should dig into her own pockets.Rather than scrounging off the taxpayer.The stinking rich really don’t get it, do they No self awareness whatsoever – and even less shame.But then never mind the witless Posh, whose useless company loses millions every year.Look at old beardo Branson – Sir Richard, entrepreneur and “philanthropist”.He wants YOU to pay HIM £million to bail out his airline, Virgin.This is a man who has paid not a single penny of income tax in the UK for fourteen years.But when his company is in trouble he expects you to bail him out.And this from a bloke who has already been coining it from the taxpayer for his awful rail franchises.This kind of bare-faced cheek almost beggars belief.Or there’s Apple boss Tim Cook boasting about sending a few safety masks to the UK.SO kind of you, Tim.Now how about your company pays its proper share of tax in the UK  Then we might not need your charity.Pope Francis has pleaded with the EU for countries to “come together” to fight the virus.Ha. Fat chance, your Popeship.The European Union is falling apart as a consequence of this crisis.All the member states have been doing the sensible thing – and ignoring everything the EU bureaucrats have to say.Germany introduced very tough anti-immigration measures, for example.But the EU has been criticised for abandon- ing Spain and Italy.There are big rows over a joint debt fund to help the worst-hit countries.There are arguments over what phone app should be used to track virus carriers.One leading European economist said that the EU was in danger of “imploding”.Ah well – every cloud, huh I CAN’T get to my usual snippers in Saltburn. So my we and daughter kindly agreed to cut my hair for me. They gave me a kind of Mohican.I think it’s great. The new me. Liddle, back in the game. Watch out, chicks.KIM JONG-UN is apparently very ill. Nothing to do with the coronavirus.The morbidly obese weirdo who runs North Korea is thought to be under-going serious heart surgery.He’s getting his reward then, for eating like a king while the rest of his country starves. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

At its best, the monarchy shines light on dark places, telling stories that would otherwise go untold and standing up for what’s right.It has been said that the Royal Family’s first obligation is to give back to the British people who fund them. I agree wholeheartedly. It is gravely concerning that these former royals, over many years, have sought to insulate themselves from taking accountability for what they say or do — even when they know it to be distorted,  and completely tone-deaf.When power is enjoyed without responsibility, the trust we all place in these very privileged people is degraded.It is a really hypocritical way of doing business and, quite frankly, it bores every corner of society.I have watched the Duke and Duchess of Sussex ditch crown and country at a time of need, by private jet, to make millions in Hollywood — for no good reason other than the fact they simply cannot bear the fair and honest reporting a free Press brings.With that said, please note I will not be engaging with Harry and Meghan’s PR spin. There will be no corroboration and zero engagement.This policy is also being instated for their long-suffering communications team. My heart truly goes out to their lone UK staffer James Holt, although I have far less sympathy for the dodgy practices offered by Hollywood PR company Sunshine Sachs— a side of the industry relating to celebrities readers never see.This policy is not about avoiding criticising Harry and Meghan.I’ll always be honest. It’s not about shutting down public conversation or censoring accurate reporting.The media have every right to report on — and indeed, have an opinion on — the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, good or bad. But it can’t be based on their lies.I also want to be very clear: This is not in any way a blanket policy for all royals .I’m looking forward to working with other dukes and duchesses all over the country, engaging with members of the Royal Family senior and junior and young up-and-coming royalsto spotlight issues and causes that desperately need acknowledging.And I look forward to doing whatever I can to help further opportunities for more under-represented royals, who are needed now more than ever .What I won’t do is offer myself up to the constant spin, fact-twisting and putdowns of their family members I’ve had to put up with from Harry and Meghan’s long-suffering staff for the past two years.I’m that encouraged this new approach will be heard and respected.Sun readers deserve to know what’s REALLY going on.NETFLIX managed to achieve the impossible this week with sex-obsessed new reality show Too Hot To Handle.They found a cast of millennials more backstabbing, vain, stupid and horny than ITV have ever managed with Love Island, which looks totally tame in comparison.It’s the biggest mind-numbing abomination I’ve seen on television in a very long time.But can I be totally honest with you – I absolutely loved every minute. px,px, px\" data-img\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-BBC--.jpg stripallw\" data-srcSet\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-BBC--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-BBC--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-BBC--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-BBC--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-BBC--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-BBC--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-BBC--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-BBC--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-BBC--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-BBC--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-BBC--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-BBC--.jpg w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox  . %E%C svg%E\"  px,px, px\" data-img\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-R-KELLY-.jpg stripallw\" data-srcSet\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-R-KELLY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-R-KELLY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-R-KELLY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-R-KELLY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-R-KELLY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-R-KELLY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-R-KELLY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-R-KELLY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-R-KELLY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-R-KELLY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-R-KELLY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-R-KELLY-.jpg w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox  . %E%C svg%E\" Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Hairdressers will be instantly elevated to key worker status.We’ll bang pots and pans for them in the street every Thursday at pm.Before that we’re all going to have to learn to use scissors and clippers fast.If it goes wrong at least we’ll have masks to hide behind.IT’S not often we congratulate employment tribunals for their common sense.But one saw right through tech exec Rachel Power’s claim that she was sexually discriminated against by a boss who told her: “You got balls.”Everyone  knows it’s harmless slang for having guts.As for bringing a case over it . . . that really is a load of balls.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Will. Never. Happen.I adore the show and am glad it is on track toas usual later this year.But I know I would be very, very bad – and not in a funny Ed Ballsy way.I’d just be embarrassingly woeful. At the age of , I don’t want to be dragged around the dancefloor by the long-suffering Anton du Beck, showing off my knickers like Ann Widdecombe.I reckon the idea I might be involved in Strictly all started because of the ­glorious pro dancer Luba Mushtuk, who was paired with Olympic rower James Cracknell, last year and exited far too soon.We met each other at the Jason Vale health retreat, below, in February, where people go to recharge their batteries.It feels like a letime ago that we were all enjoying long walks, yoga and exercise classes, making new friends along the way.Luba very kindly gave us all a Strictly masterclass. I’ll never forget the hilarious lessons out in the sunshine – with a view of the lakes and hearing everyone’s laughter.Although I really enjoyed myself, it made me realise I could never, ever be a contestant on Strictly.My role is to watch the show from the comfort of my sofa with a large glass of wine and a jumbo bag of Revels.It is easy to criticise the ministers and health experts fighting Covid-.They must make le-or-death decisions with the information available and haven’t always got it right.But they are also human beings.This week England’s Deputy Chief Medical Officer, Dr Jenny Harries, told me she had been struck down by the virus, probably the day after Prime Minister Boris Johnson tested positive, and it left her feeling frail.With classic understatement, she called it an “unpleasant” experience.She was looked after by her children, one of whom is a junior doctor, and had to stay off work for ten days.This will have given her even greater insight into the disease and empathy with patients and their families.But it also makes us realise that behind the daily pm briefings are real people just trying to do their best.I’M still baffled by what to do when it comes to wearing a face mask.EvenI could get one, I don’t want to deprive a worker in the NHS, a care home or public transport, as these grafters are the priorities.We are told by some thatwe stay at home, and social-distance when we go out to the shops or for a bit of exercise, we don’t need to wear a mask.But that can feel problematicyou’re out shopping or on a bus or train.I will be making my own mask from the simple DIY instructions printed in The Sun earlier this week – it will be much better than nothing.But right now, there’s confusion and doubt, and it must be cleared up fast.NO ONE wants to put extra pressure on the NHS, and figures show we haven’t been going to AE or phoning ambulances unless we’re severely ill, which is laudable.But you can go too far.I would urge anyone who happens upon a lump or something suspicious to get help right away.Cancer specialists report a drastic fall in the number of people seeking help and fear a huge increase in cancer cases.So don’t think you are being a nuisance.A drastic, unexplained weight loss, a lump or change in a breast, or anything amiss with the testicles, must NEVER be ignored.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Others say it won’t.And meanwhile, everyone is sitting at home thinking, “Can you lot make up your bloody minds.”But that’s the point of science. There should never be a ­consensus.Everything should constantly move as new discoveries are made. Emc until someone proves that it doesn’t.My colleague Rod Liddle explained last weekend that when the first atom bomb was about to be tested, none of the utterly brilliant men who’d designed it could agree on what would happen.Some said the explosion would be small. Some said it would be massive.One thought it might set the ­atmosphere on fire. One said it wouldn’t work at all.Today, we are told that all of science is agreed on global warming.We hear it IS happening and it IS our fault. No argument is allowed.History has taught us that this is ­dangerous.A hundred years ago, someone came up with a new idea called eugenics.The idea was that the human race was doomed because too many black and ­stupid people were having babies.We can see now that this is lazy, racist nonsense but back then it was a ­dferent story.Boffins at all the most prestigious ­institutions in America were captivated by it.They worked on it at Yale and ­Hard. Millions was spent on research.The greatest minds were taken in, Nobel Prize winners among them.HG Wells supported it and so did George Bernard Shaw and Alexander ­Graham Bell.Legislation was passed to promote it.Winston Churchill believed in it, as did US presidents Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow ­Wilson.So just like global warming, we had an idea backed by leading politicians and many top celebrities.And anyone who said it was stupid was told to shut up.“We have science on our side” they screamed.Yeah, but they also had Hitler on their side.He believed so ­passionately in eugenics, he came up with the Aryan Nation, built concentration camps and murdered six ­million Jews.Be glad then that scientists can’t agree on what to do about Covid-.It shows they are ­thinking. When they say they all agree, it shows they’re not.EVERY European country has dferent ideas about which businesses can re-open next week and which ones cannot.But they’d all really like to give the green light to one thing: Hairdressers.I realise, of course, that everyone has now reverted to their original hair colour and that in Scotland it’s easy to spot the ginger roots of recession.But I just can’t see why this matters so much.

So what do they want  Well, I’m fairly sure thatyou asked them, they’d say they’d like a new sofa, a nice car, a holiday or two and a fridge full of ice-cool beer.That means we must build power stations and roads for them.We must dam their rivers and pull down their jungles to make way for sewerage and water pipes and factories and hospitals and shopping centres.I’m fairly confident then thatwe put people first, the planet is going to feel like we’ve trodden on its toe.I WAS out on my tractor this week, doing a safe and steady mph on a narrow country lane, when I noticed in one of the seven rear view mirrors that behind me, there was a small army of cyclists who couldn’t get past.Ooh, I was happy.I was so happy in fact, that when I got home, I drove right past the drive so that I could keep them all behind me a little bit longer.Payback.It’s so, so sweet.COUNCIL chiefs in Manchester say that the city has been so lovely and quiet these past few weeks that they are thinking of banning cars for ever.Really  You want to stop all those Cheshire boys coming into the city centre on a Friday night with their Ferraris and Bentleys Good luck with that.THIS week, we read about a builder who’d kept his we happy by turning his dumper truck into a luxury bath.He’d even used a drill attachment to create bubbles.Very clever but I knew a man in Doncaster back in the day who made his kids a swimming pool out of a skip.He tilted it so there was a deep end and even put a brazier underneath, so it was fully heated.WHETHER you’re doing a house-party or video conferencing with colleagues, it’s critically important you get the background correct.Tory MPs using Skype to do interviews on the evening news usually put themselves in front of a book case.This tells us they are wise and well read.Celebrities usually make sure there’s a bit of zebra skin in the shot and a pickled shark or two on the wall.This week, my friend Trinny Woodall hosted a live online make-up tutorial from her bathroom.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.Doubtless she made sure the background was spick and span.

The big ones will take longer.Or raise the seedlings indoors so the children can watch their progress. To do that, place seeds on a damp kitchen paper towel in a clean container.As soon as you see tiny roots emerge, plant them into small pots or trays of moist ­potting compost.Now they need full light and can go on to a window sill or patio table.Check regularly to see the compost does not dry out.Once they are six or more inches high they can be planted either in final containers or out in the garden.ASK children to draw a flower and they usually sketch out a sunflower – a single stem with yellow petals ­surrounding a dark central disc.Soyou’re aged under , show us your drawing skills and you could win a £ National Garden gt token.Send your colourful drawings or ­paintings to sunflowers@ the-sun by May , , and I will pick my top ten artists, who will each receive a £ token.We will also be giving away another ten vouchers for the best ­photos of your sunflowers when they start flowering this summer.Send those photographs to sunflowers@the-sun by September , .For full TCs here.BY paying attention to your garden, balcony, window sill – or even that unloved patch of ground down the road – you can unlock a host of benefits for yourself, your kids and your community.You can encourage wildle to thrive. Hedges, trees, flowers and even grass are havens for important critters, from birds and hedgehogs to frogs and beetles.You don’t need a sprawling estate to make a dference.One of the best things about sunflowers is their ability to absorb toxins.

A few leaves steeped in hot water makes a fragrant tea that can help calm anxiety.Plant herbs as near to the kitchen as you can so you can grab a handful when you’re cooking.Plants and flowers provide food for nature but you can also build a home for frogs, ladybirds, beetles and other insects – it’s a great way for kids to see them up close.You don’t need anything fancy. Old bricks, bits of wood, logs, layers of cardboard, twigs, roof tiles or broken terracotta pots piled up in a semi-organised heap will do. The idea is to create lots of tiny, dferent-sized spaces for creatures to crawl into.Just be sure to put something waterproof on top to keep out the rain.You can even create a “hedgehog highway” by cutting a small hole – about the size of a CD – at the base of your fence on both sides of the garden. Encourage your neighbours to do the same, too, as hedgehogs like to roam large distances and this stops them getting penned in.If you haven’t got a garden, growing plants on your balcony or window sill can be just as beneficial for you and for nature.Andyou’re struggling for space there too, when you’re out on your daily exercise take note of unused bits of ground – around the base of street trees, on roadside verges, abandoned empty planters – that might benefit from a bit of colour.Plant your sunflower seeds there and watch them grow as you walk, run or cycle past each day.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It comes as Priti Patel is expected to hint restrictions could be tightenedBrits continue to breach lockdown. The Home Secretary is set to hold a press conference later today where she will produce data showing there is a rising number of people flouting the rules. For coronavirus updates, follow our live blog.  A source told the Sun: “We are seeing a worrying increase in people moving around. “We know it has been hard but everyone needs to stick with it. “The more people comply with the rules, and we slow the spread of this virus, the sooner we can think about easing rules.”The warning comes amid an increased appetite for the government to explain how the UK might eventually make its way out of lockdown. It is understood that the UK government is considering letting people socialise with nominated bubbles of people outside of their households as it plans an exit strategy. During Fridayaposs Downing Street press conference, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps urged people to stay at home despite apparent improvements in the crisis. Mr Shapps said: The country has done incredibly well in adhering to social distancing and there is a danger as we go into yet another warm sunny weekend that people think that perhaps these graphs are showing that the peak is over. It isnapost over, weaposre riding perhaps, we hope, a downward trend but it is by no means, no means established yet. According to the Met Office, most of the UK will have a sunny weekend, with some cloud and a risk of showers on Sunday. Temperatures are expected to remain signicantly higher than average over both days, before moving closer to average figures next week.  Meteorologist Marco Petagna said that while eastern parts of the UK may see low cloud in the morning, Saturday will be bright and sunny for most people. He told the PA news agency: Thereaposs a lot of sunshine around, a bit of a chilly start to the day with a potential touch of frost in one or two spots but then plenty of sunshine. It wonapost be as warm as it has been recently, temperatures have been in the ,  range in recent days but weaposre still looking at highs of  and  towards the South East on Saturday, and highs of  on Sunday. Fridayaposs highest recorded temperature was .C, in Porthmadog, Wales, compared to an average of between  and  degrees. Mr Petagna said Saturday may bring one or two light showers in Wales and the South West, before an increased risk of showers for the whole country on Sunday. He added: We start then to see a change towards more unsettled weather as we go through Sunday and into next week, becoming a little bit cooler. On Sunday thereaposs a greater risk of showers breaking out almost anywhere really. It might be welcome rain for some, after itaposs been so dry. Thereaposll still be some sunshine, even when things are unsettled.

Mr Cummings was one of  attendees at a key meeting of the Scientic Advisory Group for Emergencieson March , the day Boris Johnson announced the nationwide lockdown, according to a list leaked to the . Ben Warner, a data scientist who worked on the Vote Leave campaign during the Brexit referendum, is also understood to have been present.The revelation yesterday evening has raised signicant questions about the independence of the scientic advice given by Sage. For the latest on the coronavirus pandemic, read our liveblog here A former government chief scientic adviser, Sir David King, said he was shocked to find that there were political advisers involved. If you are giving science advice, your advice should be free of any political bias. That is just so critically important, he told the . A No spokesman confirmed Mr Cummings had attended Sage meetings but denied he was a member of the group. Sage provides independent scientic advice to the Government. Political advisers have no role in this, they said. The scientists on Sage are among the most eminent in their fields. It is factually wrong and damaging to sensible public debate to imply their advice is affected by government advisers listening to discussions. Downing Street say that Mr Cummings had attended some Sage meetings and listened to some meetings now they are all virtual. He and another adviser do this in order to understand better the scientic debates concerning this emergency and also to understand better the limits of how science and data can help government decisions, the spokesman added. Occasionally they ask questions or offer help when scientists mention problems in Whitehall.  The Government is under increasing pressure to reveal who sits on Sage given its critical role giving advice on how to tackle the coronavirus crisis. It has never released a list of the aposs members of attendees, although iniduals are free to disclose they are part of the group. In a letter to Parliament earlier this month, Sir Patrick Vallance, the UKaposs chief scientic adviser and chair of Sage, said the group does not disclose its membership on the advice of the Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure . He said this is for security reasons, and to protect members from lobbying and other forms of unwanted influence. Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said the disclosure that Mr Cummings had been attending Sage raised signicant questions about the credibility of Government decision-making. Dominic Cummings has no place on the Governmentaposs scientic advisory group on the coronavirus, he said. He is a political adviser, not a medical or scientic expert. If the public are to have confidence in the Sage, the Government must make clear Dominic Cummings can no longer participate or attend.

The change will mean people who go on maternity leave now receive their full usual maternity pay, eventhey are put on the governmentaposs aposfurloughapos scheme. It applies to anyone starting Maternity, Paternity, Shared Parental, Parental Bereavement or Adoption Pay from tomorrow. Tonightaposs move - which campaigners said was welcome, but not enough - comes after fears that thousands of mums were losing out on cash. The aposfurloughapos scheme for more than million people leaves workers on % or less of their usual pay, funded by the state. Because maternity pay is already less than a full wage, new mums were taking a double hit by having their salary docked, and then ided again when they went on leave. Under the new law, anyone who starts maternity leave from tomorrow will now have it based on their usual earnings - not the reduced wage they got on furlough. That means it will be worth at least % of usual earnings for the first  weeks, followed by  weeks at the statutory rate which is currently £.. Business Minister Paul Scully said: These measures will ensure those on the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme continue to receive the parental leave and pay they are entitled to. However, the change stops short of demands by the campaign group Maternity Action, which wrote to the Chancellor earlier this month. Todayaposs announcement does not address the plight of pregnant women who feel forced to leave their work by government guidance on vulnerable groups. Pregnant women, along with the over-s and people with an underlying health condition, are being told to signicantly limit face-to-face contact. The government has said the move is a precaution while scientists work outpregnant women are more at risk. But Maternity Action says many pregnant women are still being directed to work, in unsafe conditions, during the pandemic. The group is demanding formal advice for employers to offer home working or other safe working conditions for those women, or  allow them to be suspended on full pay. Director Rosalind Bragg said the move was welcome but did not go far enough. She said: We are still waiting for the Government to provide employers with clear guidance on health and safety for pregnant women.

It is understood that the UK government is considering letting people socialise outside of their households in small bubbles as it plans an exit strategy. The move would widen the current stay at home advice to include meals and other social activities with close relatives and friends. It would also mean couples who do not live together can spend time together. However, people would only be able to nominate one or two households to be part of their cluster, and would not be able to mingle with anyone . For the latest on the coronavirus pandemic, read our liveblog here It comes after Nicola Sturgeon today said the Scottish government is looking at the proposal as one possible way to relax restrictions. But the First Minister warnedthe idea does happen, itaposs got to be the same people day-to-day, week-to-week to prevent Covid- being passed on more widely. The idea is also being considered by the UK Government, Mail Online reports. A Whitehall source told the paper: If we can find a way to allow a bit more flexibility without risking transmission of the disease running higher then we will do it. Similar plans are also being considered in Belgium. Scotlandaposs government has gone further than UK officials in laying out how lockdown might eventually be eased. Yesterday Ms Sturgeon published a -page document saying outdoor activities might resume, and businesses may reopenthey can keep customers and staff  metres apart. The First Minister also suggested schools could reopen with modications needed in some classrooms. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has refused to comment in detail on the plan for the whole of the UK. But today he said Ms Sturgeonaposs plan was essentially a reiteration of his own five tests of when lockdown can be relaxed. Those five tests are: the NHS able to cope a sustained fall in deaths infections dropping to aposmanageableapos rates adequate testing and PPE and no risk of a second peak.  Ms Sturgeon told BBC Radio Scotland no decisions have been made on such a bubble arrangement. But she said she wants to have an open conversation with the public about the way forward. Ms Sturgeon said: I know from my own parents who are not seeing their grandkids just know, I understand the anguish of that. Weaposre all missing seeing our loved ones so we all want to get beyond that as quickly as possible. Every country is going through these decisions, none of us are through this pandemic yet, but some countries are starting to look at slightly expanding what people would define as their household - encouraging people who live alone to maybe match up with somebody  who is on their own or a couple of other people to have almost kind of bubbles of people. She added: And the key thing there is,youaposre seeing maybe one or two more people outside your household, itaposs got to be the same people on a day-to-day, week-to-week basis so youaposre still limiting the ability for the virus to transmit. Now, none of these are fixed decisions yet, but these are all the kind of things weaposre trying to work through. What weaposre trying to do is to do is, how do we get a semblance of normality back into our lives because the lockdown - it is essential that people stick with it just now - but itaposs having consequences of its own.  The First Minister said any easing of the lockdown will be gradual and le will not be normal for some time to come. Lockdown has the potential tomultiple timesthe virus spikes again. Health Secretary Matt Hancock today said the key factor in easing lockdown will be speed with which number of new cases reduces. Once lockdown is eased, the key factor in keeping it that way will be a test and trace programme.

And the question of when and how they can open is one that will not go away.When will schools reopen There has not yet been a decision - but most agree that it canapost be before the end of May.Most in the sector agree that what is best is for pupils to be in school - but only when it’s safe for them to do so.Some in the sector are concerned that even speculating about their reopening could be a bad thing.The National Education Union have warned that “loose talks costs lives”.General Secretary Dr Mary Bousted said that the speculation “deeply concerns our members, who would be at immediate riskGovernment was too hasty in relaxing lockdown measures.”The earliest realistic point at which schools in England could start re-opening would be  June, head teachersapos leader Geoff Barton has said.We cannot see any realistic way that schools could be re-opened to more pupils before the second half of the summer term, said the ASCL leader.But even the  June date is viewed as optimistic because, in order to meet that target,Mr Barton says planning would need to begin very soon.Will they be safe This is the overriding concern of everyone involved in the decision from government to unions to school leaders and parents.  Before schools were shut last month, many were running with a skeleton staff with teachers and others off sick.While many parents kept children at home believing it was the safety place for them to be. More than , people have now signed a petition set up by the National Education Union which asks the government not to reopen them before itaposs safe and to commit to testing and tracing to help that.The new general secretary of the National Association of Schoolmasters Union of Women TeachersDr Patrick Roach, warned that staff concerns must be fully addressed before teachers would be willing to come back.In a letter to Education Secretary Gavin Williamson earlier this week, Dr Roach demanded personal protective equipmentfor all staff, anti-viral cleaning measures and guidelines on how social distancing would be enforced in schools. Will they look dferent when they     On Thursday Nicola Sturgeon talked about “rearranging classrooms” so that the m distancing could be observed.The First Minister said alternating weeks for pupils was the type of option her government is considering whenever lockdown is eased. She also raised the prospect of redesigning classrooms as a way of enforcing social distancing. She has consistently been more open with the public about measures to deal with coronavirus suggesting the Westminster government will be having similar discussions.Sturgeon said of schools: “I think some countries have perhaps had some children in school go back.“There has been some talk, and it is certainly an option that has to be considered, although we might not do it, some kids go one week, other kids go the next week, so that there’s the ability to have smaller classes. “These are the kind of options we are dealing with.” The Welsh First Minister has also stipulated that the m rule must be observed in schools currently and in the future.For many schools that may inevitably mean a new layout for classroom and for teachers to handle fewer pupils at a time.The details have not yet been decided but they are part of the discussion which will have to happen before schools .    They want to - or certainly their unions want them to have that option.The unions representing support staff have banded together to demand their members have the right equipment before theyto work.The GMB, Unison and Unite have issued a joint statement asking the government to engage with them ahead of anyto school. They say their members need proper equipment and that staff are currently very worried. At the moment PPE provision is patchy.One school told the Mirror they have equipment to be worn when dealing with an ill child but not for other situations.But with many children potentially posing as carriers rather than suffering from the virus there are concerns that staff could be more at risk than the children they care for.Andy Prendergast, Senior Organiser for the GMB, told the Mirror: “There’s a huge number of hurdles we need to get over before schools can be open across the board. There’s the problems with PPE which are problems everywhere and at the moment we can’t get enough into hospitals and care homes so the idea that there’s tonnes of it waiting for schools is quite simply not the case.  “The relatively small number of schools that are open are struggling to get PPE, but the idea that we can open all the schools in the country and have them work safely just doesn’t work.“One of the big issues that they’ve got is lack of hand sanitiser and some of the advice being given is that people can go and wash their hands. The obvious problem with that isyou’re in a class with a load of kids and you have to go and wash your hands. That involves you having to go somewhere, having to touch numerous doors, wash your hands, go all the way back and what do the kids do in the meantime “What we’re saying very clearly is we need to have adequate risk assessments and there needs to be adequate stocks of PPE to protect the members as we move forward on that.“While there are national shortages of PPE we can’t see that happening any time soon but obviously we want to get people back to usual but to do that we need to be satisfied that members - and also the kids and their families - are going to be protected.”“We’ve had at least one member who works in a school who has died of covid- and, while we can’t say for absolute certain how they got the virus, we are extremely concerned that that may have been spread through the school. At the moment the they’re not being forced back to work and the government lockdown continues for the next few weeks but the concern is what happens after that.Will teachers be tested  If they show symptoms anyone who works in a school will be eligible for a test as a key worker as part of the announcement by Health Secretary Matt Hancock of the extension of the governmentaposs testing programme. They need to sign up or be referred by their manager on gov.ukThe newly-unveiled system has suffered teething problems as the government struggled to cope with demand.

But as we head into another warm, sunny weekend, calls are growing for the government to spell out how it will eventually be relaxed. Tory MPs have piled on pressure to save the economy - while Scotland and Wales have tightened the screws by pushing ahead and saying what will happen next. For all the argument and debate, we still donapost have a date when lockdown will be relaxed. And we know it wonapost actually end - it will just be eased bit by bit. But details have dripped out in recent days about how that might happen. Weaposll relax lockdown once the infection rate is low enough, and then use a test, trace, track strategy with an NHS app to keep it low. Hereaposs everything we know about how lockdown will be relaxed, but why we must also get used to a aposnew normalapos that looks dferent to the UK we knew before.How long is the UKaposs coronavirus lockdown  The lockdown expires on May  - six weeks after it began. But thataposs just the legal date it has to be reviewed by. Emergency lockdown powers in the Health Protection Regulations  must be formally reviewed every three weeks. In reality the government will renew the lockdown for longer, at least partly. The question is how much of it will be extended, and for how long.  When will the UK lockdown end - and how  The UK lockdown will start to be relaxed once five tests are met:The NHS is able to cope A sustained fall in deaths New infections dropping enough Adequate testing and PPE No risk of a second peakBut once it is eased it wonapost all happen in one go. Instead the lockdown is set to be relaxed in phases while some social distancing measures stay in place. So while the strictest restrictions should start to ease this summer, some measures look set to be in place until next year. Stand-in PM Dominic Raab adds we might see restrictions tighten in some ways and loosen in others. How will the government decide itaposs time to relax the lockdown  The UK government will have to fulfil all five testson ending the lockdown. Downing Street adds the key test will be how far and fast the infection rate drops. aposRapos - the number of people each carrier infects - is already below , which stops Covid- spreading exponentially. But Health Secretary Matt Hancock has warned it wouldn’t take much to loose that grip. Any change to the restrictions must not risk the aposRapos number going above .So how will we know when thataposs happened  The key piece of evidence will be a study by the Office for National Statistics on the infection rate - expected to be published in early May. That could be crucial in deciding what the government does next. Despite pleas from Tory MPs, Downing Street insists the decision will be based on science before the economy. Boris Johnsonaposs spokesman said: We will have to take decisions based on the best available scientic and health advice. it’s not going to be a case of choosing between the economy and public health.”Once lockdown is relaxed, what happens then  If the virus spikes again, lockdown could have tomultiple times with little notice. So the plan is to stop that happening with a three pronged strategy - test, trace and track. The government is hiring , human contact tracers and will encourage people to download an NHS app. Put together, the system should noty people when theyaposve been in contact with a Covid- carrier - so they can immediately isolate and stop it spreading further. But there are concerns about how well it will work. The NHS says the app will be launched in the coming weeks. It will use Bluetooth to log each time your phone moves near another personaposs phone with the app. If one of those people is later diagnosed with Covid-, you would get an alert warning you to get tested and self-isolated.  What will reopen first and what will stay shut  The UK government has refused to say officially - and thereaposs not yet a firm decision. But plenty of speculation has been leaked. And we can also pick up clues from Scotland and Wales, which have been more open about their plans. Schools and some non-essential shops seem very likely to reopen first, with modied layouts to ensure people can stay two metres apart. But hairdressers and nail bars could remain shut for six months, sources told The Sun. Working from home could become the new normal until thereaposs a vaccine, government advisors have said. And UK and Scottish ministers have warned pubs and mass gatherings could be among the last to reopen. PM Boris Johnsonaposs spokesman said: There will be judgments based on scientic and health advice of what is possible without increasing the risk of a second peak.” That could have to mean extending the aposfurloughapos scheme for staff to get up to % of their pay while out of work. The scheme currently expires in June but No will continue to keep it under review. It’s our intention to stand by both workers and businesses, a spokesman said.  Will some people be let out earlier than others  Itaposs possible. The government has looked at an idea of loosening restrictions on younger, healthier people first in order to get the economy moving again. And people could meet small bubbles of wider friends and family under one idea being looked at in Scotland. If that idea does happen, youaposd have to pick the same small aposbubbleapos of people to meet day-to-day, week-to-week - and carry on staying away from everyone . None of you would be able to go outside your aposbubbleapos.  Why have Scotland and Wales got dferent plans - and what does it mean  Deep splits have opened up in the strategy across the UK. Wales and Scotland are both pushing ahead with telling the public what post-lockdown might look like, but the UK government refuses to say. So far, the actual plans remain pretty similar in each country - in fact, Matt Hancock has said Scotlandaposs plan is pretty similar to what heaposs been looking at. Itaposs just the communication with the public that has been split. But that risks changing as Wales and Scotlandaposs chiefs - who sit on crucial COBRA meetings about the lockdown - pile pressure on Boris Johnson and have powers over places like schools and care homes. The split forced the Health Secretary to plead for unity, saying: So far we have moved as one United Kingdom and I think that has been a very good thing. My preference is that we work together as one country. A Downing Street spokesman warned the nations: I’m sure they like us will be guided by the science - and won’t want to do anything that could risk a second peak”. Whataposs happening in Scotland  Scotlandaposs First Minister set out a -page blueprint for easing the lockdown. Nicola Sturgeon said businesses might be able to reopenthey can keep customers and staff  metres apart. The same would have to be in place in schools with modications needed in some classrooms. But pubs and mass gatherings would likely have to remain closed for longer. Despite spelling out an exit strategy, Ms Sturgeon warned normal as we knew it is not on the cards in the near future. Nicola Sturgeon said lting the lockdown is not a flick of the switch moment but more of a gradual change to the current conditions. No insisted Scotlandaposs plan was actually pretty similar to its own in terms of what needs to happen before lockdown ends.  Whataposs happening in Wales  Walesapos First Minister Mark Drakeford said lockdown could be left in three phases, like a traffic light in reverse. The red phase would see only the most careful and controlled lting of restrictions, amber would see more restrictions lted andthe virus does not re-emerge, Wales could move to the green zone. But he believed that UK ministers were nervous about entering into a similar conversation with the public for fear it would undermine the message to stay at home. The Welsh Government will also need seven questions to be answered before easing the lockdown. They are:Would easing a restriction have a negative effect on containing the virus  Does a particular measure pose a low risk of further infection  How can it be monitored and enforced  Can it be reversed quicklyit creates unintended consequences  Does it have a positive economic benefit  Does it have a positive impact on people’s wellbeing  Does it have a positive impact on equality "},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus nurse left shocked anxious","story":"NewsCoronavirus nurse left shocked and anxious after heartless vandals trash her carThe newly-qualied nurse, who works on the coronavirus ward at the Royal Derby Hospital, has been left so shocked by the incident that she is struggling to sleepShareCommentsByNoah Martin:,  APR Updated:,  APR NewsTwo of tyres on the car had been slashed by vandals \" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - The Coronavirus BriefingSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

The newly-qualied nurse was left shocked when she noticed white paint had been thrown all over her car while parked outside her home in Derby on April . The front windscreen had also been smashed while two tyres had been slashed, Derbyshire Live reports. I was very emotional, I didnapost know what to do, whether I should stay at home or go to work. I just stood there, said the woman, who works as an outpatient nurse on the coronavirus ward at the Royal Derby Hospital. In the end I made the rational decision and put the patients first, the patients are more important, I had to get public transport. I wasnapost thinking about myself, I was pretty shocked and worried. I donapost knowI was ing properly. The nurse said her le has been made very stressful over the past two weeks after her car was wrecked by the heartless vandals. The woman, who asked to remain anonymous, noticed the damage at around am when she went out to her car in order to drive to work. It really got to me, obviously we have to stay professional but I canapost switch off my emotions at work, she said. It does distract you, I donapost need it right now, especially in a Covid- ward, it has a huge impact. The nurse spoke with her manager and was told to go home and deal with the overwhelming situation.  The -year-old washed the paint off the car, and also noticed a stone which had been painted white had been placed outside her front door. Obviously I did contact the police and they have said itaposs a case of mistaken identity, she said. The nurse added: Itaposs just tiring and overwhelming, Iaposm already stressed in work so for that to happen, I just wish people could have respect. Although her insurance company gave her a temporary courtesy car, the nurse said is has been a big blow financially. The vehicle could be a write-off, she claims.  The nurse added: Iaposve been a student for so many years, Iaposm just starting out and Iaposve still got debts to pay. When I bought the car I told myself I needed to make an investment and keep it for a few years, my whole plan has to change.

Well, spare a thought for one unlucky librarian who couldnapost believe her eyes when she arrived at work this week. She discovered cleaners had carried out a deep clean of the book shelves and then reorganised books by size instead of genre alphabetical order. Kate Ashton, manager of Newmarket Library, in Suffolk, has told of her shock after walking in to discover the mishap.Her colleague Krystal Vittles went viral on Twitter after sharing the hilarious mistake, with over , likes. She tweeted: You think youaposre having a bad week  My poor colleague has just been in to do her weekly check of the library building. The cleaner has stared deep cleaning the spaceand has cleaned the shelves but has put . bays of books back on IN SIZE ORDER. Libraries and other public places were closed down in March as a result of coronavirus. But cleaners and librarians are still visiting regularly as part of weekly building checks. Now Ms Ashton has said she can see the funny side of the mistake - but admitted it will take a bit of time to reorganise the books.She told Mirror: “Our cleaner was taking the opportunity to give the shelves a thorough clean – nothing to do with coronavirus, it’s just good to give the shelves a thorough clean whilst the library is closed.Unfortunately the books were put back in size order rather than by genre alphabetical order! “I was a bit shocked at the time as it’ll take us a bit of time to reorganise them but I can see the funny side now.  We’re all still really busy at the moment running library activities online for our regular customers but sadly it looks like libraries will be closed for a while so we’ll have time to sort the books out. “Our cleaner is lovely and does a great job in the library. It was an honest mistake and just one of those things so I would never want her to feel bad about it.  “I’ve been bewildered at how much interest there has been in the story – I think the story has been retweeted about , times and lots of fellow librarians have got in touch. I think people are just pleased to be able to share any light-hearted stories at the moment as it helps to cheer everyone up.  In the grand scheme of things it’s not really that important. “Don’t worry all the books will be back in the right order ready for our customers when we’re open again!” In a follow-up tweet, Ms Vittles said she would be buying the cleaner a bottle of wine. She wrote: A quick update: our cleaner at this library is a great lady. Bless her for being neat and tidy. She doesnapost work in libraries as such so she was just doing her best, and to be fair, the books were neat as heck.  I might have to buy her a bottle of wine after this. The hilarious blunder struck a chord with many on Twitter as people suggested new ways of storing the books. One person joked: Just go with it. Or do the colour thing. It’s a new world. Another joked: You might attract a whole new clientele who were previously triggered by books being in random sizes, who will now be totally happy with the neat new layout!

Tonka and Little P were hiking and exploring in Colorado, in the US, with their devoted dad Kris Busching when they all got lost and spent three days without food or drink. Kris spotted a creek with water in a canyon below, but during the descent lost his footing and plummeted to the bottom as he tried to pull his precious pit bulls to safety. Tragically the -year-old died upon impact, while Tonka suffered a broken leg and Little P sustained a broken jaw. The pooches refused to leave Krisapos body and were found a day later by search and rescue helicopters.  They were taken to Kris’ devastated family in Long Island, New York, where nonprofit animal shelter organisation Mr. Bones  Co. stepped in and rushed the pups to an emergency vet.It was here where the doggy brothers “who lost their world suddenly” were photographed comforting each other and sweetly touching noses as they deal with the pain of their injuries and their grief.  The animal charity shared the photo with the caption: The level of loyalty and love that radiated from these two as big brother Tonka was admitted to our emergency animal hospital so that his leg could be saved needs no further caption. His bond with Little P is forever. The dogs have undergone numerous treatments, been given lots of TLC and are now on the path to recovery. But the pair have a gaping hole in their lives as they come to terms with never seeing their adored owner again.  Kris, a talented tattoo artist, took them on amazing adventures and gave them an incredible le. His brother Dave paid tribute and said: “We are all devastated, and really can’t describe the void and pain that we all feel. “He was a talented human, with huge hopes and dreams. He lived an extreme lestyle, and like most in my family, loved the outdoors. He was where he loved to be when he passed.  Dave added: Nothing, no one prepares you for something like this.” The animal charity has vowed to find the pair a new home together so they are not separated as Krisapos family heartbreakingly cannot look after them. They are currently at two dferent foster homes as they recover. Tonka has undergone several surgeries to his legs with the care team going out of their way to make sure he feels the love during this very confusing time for him.  The animal shelter organisation added: He’s been able to hang out with the doctors and nurses behind the scenes and soak up a ton of TLC. He’s eating well and coping with his splints politely. His temperament is beautul and soulful, a testimony to level of love his dad gave him for almost ten years before he passed. To honor Tonka’s dad and his remarkable artistic talent, the in-house team of bandage artists made sure Tonka had some apostattoosapos of his own and it made our day, so we wanted to share these photos with all of you.  Tonka has since been discharged from the hospital. In an update on Little P, they said: His surgery to wire and splint his broken jaw was successful and he’s looking forward to leaving the hospital today with his foster mama! After an almost immediate attempt to play and get rowdy, our decision to not foster them together was further reinforced. Now that Little P also has a strict recovery period he needs to get through, it is imperative that both dogs continue to temporarily foster separately. This brief separation will be a blip on the radar when they are recovered and have found their new home together!  They continued: For Little P to have suffered such a severe break, whatever his head hit on the fall down the canyon hit with such force that he had little chance of surviving, and yet, he did. As long as this fighter keeps everything except kibble out of his mouth for six weeks he will heal and undergo one more outpatient surgery to remove the splint and wiring and our silly little ping pong ball will be back at play!A fundraising page has also been set up to help Krisapos family financially and has raised more than ,."},{"url":null,"title":"toddler filmed flying mum during","story":"NewsToddler filmed flying with mum during pole dancing lockdown workoutBradley loves to \"fly\" with his mother Miranda who has worked as a pole dancer \"on and off\" for three years.

Ministers will argue that it is impossible to plan for every unexpected event. But a leaked document reveals the Cabinet Office was warned last year that it needed to step up its preparations for a pandemic. In particular, the risk assessment set out the importance of ensuring there was sufficient personal protective equipment, the capacity to carry out testing and tracing and an action plan to help Brits overseas get home. These are three of the areas where the Government has fallen short. At some point ministers need to explain who saw this advice and who was responsible for implementing its recommendations. This document adds even more weight to the case for a public inquiry, when the crisis is over, into the Government’s handling of it. Dismal Donald Donald Trump may be regarded as a joke by most of the world but in America he still has a base of loyal supporters. This loyalty is why his uninformed suggestion that disinfectant could treat coronavirus is so dangerous.  There are already enough bogus remedies on the internet without the President adding his own potentially deadly advice. Trump dismissed the outbreak as a hoax before claiming it would be over by Easter. He has put the lives of Americans at risk by encouraging quack remedies and urging his followers to defy the lockdown.

Reuters says it is not immediately clear what the mission signals in terms of Kimaposs health. However Daily NK, a South Korea-based website, reported earlier this week that the -year-old leader is recovering after a cardiovascular procedure on April . The leader has not appeared in public since he presided over a meeting on April , and his absence from Day of the Sun celebrations on April  has fuelled speculation about his health. The annual event celebrates the birthday of North Koreaaposs founding father Kim Il-sung, Kimaposs grandfather. However, both South Korean and Chinese officials have challenged suggestions that the ruler is in grave danger medically. A South Korean source has told Reuters that its intelligence is that Kim is alive and will likely appear in public soon.  US President Donald Trump has also downplayed the speculation, and said on Thursday: I think the report was incorrect.Trump declined to sayhe has been in touch with North Korean officials. However, an official familiar with US intelligence said that although Kim is known to have health problems, they had no reason to conclude he was seriously ill. North Korea is one of the world’s most secretive countries, and the health of its leaders is treated as a matter of state security. The impoverished state, which is hard-hit by UN sanctions, depends on Beijing for economic and diplomatic support. Kim came to power after his father Kim Jong Il died in  from a heart attack.  Asked about his health on Fox News, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said: I don’t have anything I can share with you tonight, but the American people should know we’re watching the situation very keenly. It is not the first time Kim has vanished from the public eye. In , he disappeared for more than a month, and North Korean state TV later showed him walking with a limp. Speculation about his health has been fanned by his heavy smoking, apparent weight gain since taking power and family history of cardiovascular problems.

The global health emergency has led to shops around the world being stripped bare of essential items such as pasta, toilet roll and flour.But sales of gum and mints have dropped, suggesting that social distancing measures mean shoppers are worrying less about keeping their breath smelling fresh, news.au reports.The Australian supermarket chain Coles says demand for both of these items has fallen since the Government introduced lockdown measures to slow the spread of Covid-. However, a spokeswoman says its shops have been doing a healthy trade in items which can ease the boredom of le at home, such as coffee capsules, baking items and hair dye. “Last month as people prepared for an extended period of isolation, we saw great demand for pantry staples, such as flour, pasta and tinned vegetables,” she said. “We are now seeing customers move towards products that they can use at home including hair colourants, baking mixes, gt cards for online entertainment, stationery and coffee capsules. “As customers increasingly work from home we are seeing less demand for packaged salads, while social distancing has led to a downturn in sales of gums and mints, as well as for cinema and restaurant gt cards.” The grocery chain has now lted restrictions on items such as fresh milk and meat, which were brought in after mass panic-buying last month as Covid- swept across the globe. But although stock levels of many previously in-demand products are beginning toto normal, shortages of flour are still being reported. A rise in home baking has led to a surge in sales, despite Coles limiting customers to two packets of flour per purchase. In the UK, supermarket prices on aposessentialapos items have risen by an eye-watering % in the past month, with pet food, rice and vegetables seeing the biggest jump.The data, published by the Office for National Statistics , shows the early signs of rising living costs that households face as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.It shows how supply and demand has already resulted in a sharp increase in daily prices - in as little as four weeks.

Just this week we had the wonderful pictures of a rainbow-painted Prince Louis to celebrate his second birthday. The photos were the latest example of how mummy can capture her children in a way no other ­photographer can. Six-year-old Prince George, Princess Charlotte, four, and Louis all look happily relaxed in their portraits because their mother, The Duchess of Cambridge, is behind the lens. Kate, a former art history student and patron of the Royal Photographic Society, is no stranger to a photo ­opportunity and knows even images that look casual can take lots of setting up. As a mum, she also knows naturally kids don’t play ball when asked to do so. The Duchess has captured her ­children’s precious kisses for newborn siblings, tentative toddler’s steps, first day of school nerves, cheeky laughter and countryside runs with wild flowers. Ingrid Seward, editor in chief of Majesty magazine, says: “The Duchess studied photography and worked for a while as a photographer’s assistant. “She’s become a really good photographer, capturing her children beautully. “In the recent pictures of Prince Louis, we can see that the pictures are still a bit posed because even though there’s paint on his face there’s none in his hair. At two, Louis is at the delightful age when he’s happy to pose. Whereas in the pictures of Princess Charlotte on the steps on her first day at school, she looks slightly more self conscious. “Kate can probably persuade them to do things they might not do ­otherwise – that’s one reason her pictures are so charming.” Ian Vogler, the Mirror’s royal photographer, sees a clear ­progression in Kate’s images since she released her pictures of Prince George’s second birthday in .  He says: “Kate’s pictures are really coming on. She knows it’s always best to take pictures in natural daylight because a flash can put a child off. “And it’s best to distract children, as it’s always easierthey’re doing something they enjoy.

Under plans being considered by the government, restaurants could be opened again for take-aways on May  to ease strain on the hospitality sector.

John-Paul Drike, the director of Drakes Supermarkets in Adelaide, Australia, says he responded simply by giving the alleged hoarder the middle finger. In a stunning YouTube video, the supermarket boss has vented his anger at those who have taken advantage of the desperate rush for basic household supplies amid the coronavirus pandemic. He claimed that one unidentied customer had been audacious enough to purchase  -roll packets of loo roll and  units of one-litre sanitiser from his shop - and then later ask for a refund. Follow the latest coronavirus updates here “I had my first customer yesterday who said he wanted to get a refund on  packets of -pack toilet paper and  units of one-litre sanitiser, Mr Drake says in his video on April . Flipping his middle finger at the screen, he added: “I told him that.  Branding those who have been panic-buying supplies such as toilet paper absolutely ridiculous, he continued: That is the sort of person that is causing the problem in the whole country. Speaking to News, he said the man wanted to get rid of the items because he was no longer able to sell them on eBay after his site was shut down. He claimed that he had as many as  people working with him to buy up the highly-sought after commodities. Australiaaposs Home Affairs Minister, Peter Dutton, has said that the government will come down like a ton of bricks on supermarket hoarders who have been clearing shelves of basic supplies. Speaking last month, he said that that anyone caught profiteering from buying up essential groceries such as food and toilet paper will be prosecuted. In the UK, police officers have taken to standing guard at supermarkets to halt coronavirus panic-buying and enforce the Governmentaposs social distancing orders.

We felt very hard done by.“The boys who were kept on were feeling really fortunate because they were still getting paid.“I don’t knowit was the plan from the bosses to pick a team that could compete but we ended up with a really good team with some good youngsters left behind.“There was real quality and we said ‘let’s have a go’.”Despite being left with a threadbare squad, former club skipper Smith had some real talent to choose from that season with a good mix of youth and experience.The older heads included former Scotland internationals Rab Douglas and Neil McCann as well as experienced campaigners like Rhys Weston and Matt Lockwood while the younger ones included future Scotland star Leigh Grfiths, Dens hero Gary Harkins and defender Craig Forsyth among others.Called up from the youth team was also striker McIntosh, who hit a purple patch of goals at a critical point in the season – an equaliser against Stirling Albion followed by a double at Morton # before the Dark Blues went north to Dingwall.The match that clinched their unlikely survival turned out to be his final one of the season, however.McIntosh said: “When the match started I actually felt my hamstring go because of the demand of all the games before Ross County.“I think I actually tore the muscle and it was only about  minutes in. I knew the gaffer could tell something was wrong but, being young and naïve, I played through it.“It got worse and worse but it got to the point where I forgot all about it and then got the goal after half-time.“I was always motivated to chase down long balls and this time the goalkeeper took his time.“I nicked it from him and I don’t think I even considered anything about what to do next, it was natural. It was a great feeling despite the pain in my hamstring.“It was a really nice day up there I remember and the supporters were there in their numbers, it was an electric atmosphere.“I scored right in front of them and it was like an explosion.“There won’t be any other games with that kind of circumstance I don’t think, it was unique.“I remember the celebrations on the pitch – it was like we’d won the league. Everyone was ecstatic and it was just pure relief.“I don’t think I realised at the time how signicant it was. My focus was only on playing well and trying to make it as a first-team player.“It was a massive game looking back.“I still get Dundee fans coming up to me in the street to say they were there.”On the game itself, McIntosh’s then team-mate Irvine admits it was all a bit of a blur looking back.He added: “I remember Leighton’s goal, he was one of the really good young boys who did just as much as the older experienced lads.“It was the only goal of the game and, at the end, it felt like we had won the league. The feeling and the celebrations afterwards for what we achieved were amazing.“I’ve always said nothing comes close to that season. I’ve won three league titles and won Challenge Cups where you get a medal at the end for your hard work – there was no medal at the end of that one but I still class saving Dundee and keeping them in the league as my best achievement.”Irvine went on to spend six years at Dens Park as a player before ing as a coach where he took the U  side before the coronavirus shutdown.McIntosh, meanwhile, has had spells at Montrose, Peterhead, Icelandic side UMF Selfoss, Arbroath and Airdrie before signing for National League side Wrexham.Following the departure of manager Bryan Hughes, the now--year-old joined Lee Clark’s Blyth Spartans on loan until the pandemic hit.Despite his contract in Wales running down this summer, McIntosh is sanguine about his future.He added: “I took the opportunity to go down south and I’ve enjoyed it. It’s very competitive and the full-time setup was a big plus for me, too.“Everything is up in the air right now and I’ll have to wait and see what pre-season brings, whenever it starts.“I am out of contract this summer but I understand the furlough scheme will cover out-of-contract players for a time so I’m not overly concerned.“It is what it is, everyone is in the same boat.”🔵 In these troubled times, when many people are struggling to get out for their paper, we are pledging to help readers by providing a FREE digital edition of the Eveningfor three months.

I wasn’t there at the time but nobody really remembers the Roma European Cup semi-final too fondly but they’ll always recall Barcelona and Monchengladbach.“Getting into the final was a massive thing for the city and the club but at the time, as players, nothing was really a surprise for us.“We were expecting to get there so when we did it was great to do, don’t get me wrong, but it wasn’t as much of a surprise to us as it was outsiders.“At that time there was the European Cup, Cup Winners’ Cup and the other teams went into the Uefa Cup.“When you think about that in recent terms, Liverpool didn’t win the league last season but they won the Champions League.“That was the sort of level we were up against. It was a huge achievement.”Bowman recalls United going into the second leg riled up after witnessing some premature celebrations from the Monchengladbach players after a stalemate in Dundee.The -year-old also remembers a rare occasion where legendary boss Jim McLean inidually congratulated his players after the final whistle.Bowman, who made  appearances in tangerine, added: “Under wee Jim we were always taught, unless it was the second leg and you had to win at home, as long as you didn’t lose a goal it was OK.“That was the biggest thing, from our point of view, we didn’t get beat and we weren’t up against it.“I remember they were celebrating after the first leg and that probably gave us a bit of impetus to go on and beat them.“They were high-fiving each other because they got a - and thought the tie was over so that annoyed us a bit.“It made such a dference for us going there at - and Iain getting the goal just before half time.“They had to really come at us because they needed to score two.“Going into half time it was a massive advantage but I can’t really remember us being under that much pressure.“We knew they had to score two which was a tough ask against our defence. It was quite comfortable.“They didn’t have a lot of chances. Big Thommohad some great games and made some big saves that season but I can’t really remember him having to be brilliant.“Heggiesaid to me after it, ‘You should take this all in,’ and I was probably very naïve and just thought this happens every year, we’ll do it again next year.“I probably didn’t appreciate it as much as what I probably should have. It’s only when you look back.“It’s probably one of the only times I can recall Jim coming round and shaking everybody’s hand in the dressing-room after the game.“He really pushed us to our limits and got the best out of everybody. If he could see you had something he would get it out of you, how he did it was irrelevant.“He was very guarded towards us but he went round and congratulated everyone inidually.”United went on to lose the final - over two legs against IFK Gothenburg, with a - Scottish Cup Final defeat to St Mirren sandwiched in between.Bowman believes had they beaten the Buddies they might’ve gone on to secure the Uefa Cup, too.He continued: “It shows how much the SFA helped us at the time! We played the Scottish Cup Final on the Saturday and the second leg of the Uefa Cup Final on the Wednesday.“It was for the good of Scottish football we were trying to win it as well. I thinkwe’d beaten St Mirren, we would’ve had a lot better chance.“There’s no way of saying we’d have definitely beat Gothenburg because they were a decent team but the St Mirren loss was the first down we’d had that season.“Everything was on the up all the time, even with the amount of games we’d played that year.“It was the first time the press had questioned our fitness because we’d played that many games.“You’re never tired when you’re winning but as soon as you get beat that can quickly change.“Personally, all the finals don’t mean anythingyou don’t win. You want to have success by winning and savouring that.”🔵 In these troubled times, when many people are struggling to get out for their paper, we are pledging to help readers by providing a FREE digital edition of the Eveningfor three months.

In an ideal world I’d like to see an even bigger league with Dundee given the chance to join United in the Premiership.Whether that can happen, we’ll have to wait and see.We’re right at the start of the process so I’m sure almost anything is still on the table.I hope all the clubs in this area get something out of reconstruction. What we get should be better for Scottish football.I just hope we can avoid the same sort of voting farce we had  days ago with the SPFL.Dundee and managing director John Nelms were left in an impossible position, evensome of the behaviour has been questionable.As far as I’m concerned we should move on now and look to a better future. Ideally one with United and the Dark Blues in the top flight together.I know the existing Premiership clubs would certainly want the Dee up, too.What we know for sure, having seen the goings-on for the past couple of weeks, is clubs will only vote for something that is in their own interest. That’s just the way the world is.The good news, I think, for Dundee in all that is having them catapulted into the top flight would be seen to have plenty of plus points for it.Just ask Aberdeen – having both our city clubs back in the top flight gives them more decent away crowds coming to Pittodrie and their fans good away days.They wouldn’t be the only ones that benefit from having the Dundee derby back in the Premiership.We need the biggest teams at the top table – make it happen!It’s a few days ago now but I want to offer my congratulations to Robbie Neilson and his team after Dundee United were crowned Championship winners.The Tangerines have been in pole position right from the first whistle and it’s more than deserved for all at Tannadice.We don’t know what the top flight might look like come next season but the main objective has been achieved by Robbie – get United back in the big time.That’s been the target for four years now.It’s taken far longer than anyone associated with the club would have liked but they’ve finally done it.With all the noise going on over the past couple of weeks over the season, just having their top spot confirmed must be a huge weight off their shoulders.With the way the world is, relief will be the main feeling I’d bet for Robbie, Tony Asghar and Mark Ogren.They’ve done their bit – now it’s about improving the team for a shot at what is likely to be a bigger Premiership next campaign.Well done United!Having only seen the info that’s come out in the press, I’ve found Dundee United’s fall-out with a supporters’ group strange.It sounds like the money the Dundee United Supporters’ Foundation were looking to put into the club would be a benefit for everyone at Tannadice.There’s obviously been a disagreement behind the scenes but it doesn’t sit right with me having a go at your own fans – and on the day before the club were crowned champions, too.Jackie McNamara being up and about again was great to see last week. We were together in Scotland squads and he helped me a lot at that time. It’s fantastic to hear he’s on the mend again after a real health shock.🔵 In these troubled times, when many people are struggling to get out for their paper, we are pledging to help readers by providing a FREE digital edition of the Eveningfor three months.

Included in this is the Isle of Jura.This is as shockingly reckless as it is offensive.The Isle of Jura is not a #bolthole# as the Daily Mail has chosen to state but a very beautul island steeped in culture and rich history.On both Jura and Islay we, like so many rural areas, are struggling to deal with all of the challenges related to the Corona virus out break. Our local health services have very limited resources as it is, along side a population that has many elderly residents who are more at risk to the virus.We have seen a local uptick in people traveling to Islay in camper vans and this is happening at a time when the UK government is advising against non essential travel.Those who are choosing to travel to our islands of Islay, Jura and the many other islands in Argyll and Bute in order to avoid the coronavirus may end up inadvertently spreading it to islands who arenot as much affected in the same way as so many built up urban areas are. Such actions are as reckless as they are selfish and I would implore people who do not need to travel to our rural constituency to avoid doing so until this global pandemic has passed.Jura, Islay and the rest of Argyll are some of the most beautul places you will ever visit and you won#t find an area where the people are more hospitable and friendly but while this crisis is ongoing I would ask everyone who is not currently living here to avoid traveling here for the time being.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands ward.To the Scottish public,During this time of unprecedented uncertainty, we are all concerned about the safety and wellbeing of our families, friends and colleagues.Our hearts go out to those who have been affected personally by the outbreak of coronavirus , as well as the many communities around the world that are facing extreme measures in an attempt to slow its spread.We appreciate and are mindful of the challenges iniduals are currently facing as well as the impact this pandemic has had on our vital emergency services as well as the grocery retail sector, supply chain and producers.Like our retail partners, we want to take this opportunity to assure you that Scottish farmers, auctioneers, hauliers, processors and butchers are doing everything they can to maintain the ongoing availability of fresh, locally sourced Scotch Beef PGI, Scotch Lamb PGI and Specially Selected Pork.We would like to thank all those who work in the Scottish red meat industry and their families for their ongoing and unwavering efforts to keep our supermarket shelves and butcher shops stocked, fuelling Scotland with top-quality red meat during this challenging time.As bodies supporting the Scottish agricultural and red meat industry, we are constantly reviewing the developing situation and are doing all we can to support everyone involved in putting nutritious food on your plates.Alan Clarke, chief executive, Quality Meat ScotlandMartin Morgan, executive manager, Scottish Association of Meat Wholesalers Duncan Todd, secretary, Scottish Beef Association Jen Craig, president, National Sheep Association Scotland Penny Montgomerie, chief executive, Scottish Association of Young Farmers Clubs and Gordon King, executive manager, Scottish Craft Butchers.What on earth is going on  It was banal enough when Ben Goldsmith # English financier and environmentalist # tweeted that #overgrazing# by upland sheep farmers, was responsible for the devastating floods in South Wales, rather than record-breaking torrential rainfall.Unbelievably we now have a government official, Dr Tim Leunig, suggesting the whole of the UK does not need farming, and his comparison of the UK to Singapore in this context is absolutely ludicrous. You truly have to wonderthere is something in the water that he is drinking – could it be flood contamination Surely, every person having a full and ing set of neurons and synapses, the complete opposite is the truth, as we dearly need our hard working farming community.The UK Government should be fully supporting the farming industry and indeed, good land management. The Welsh Assembly has totally lost its way with its mindless policy of devastating Welsh forests with thousands and thousands # an understatement # of trees being felled for wind farms, and compounding the felony by covering acres of land with very limited electricity generating solar parks # Wales is not the Sahara and the sun disappears at night! Solar  will generate about  per cent of their maximum capacity in the UK.Returning to farming perhaps some kind person should tell Dr Tim Leunig that the answer lies in the soil and then lead him to a darkened and quiet room so he can lie down and contemplate the truth # wise men recognise that truth is the daughter of time, not of authority.Dave Haskell, Cardigan."},{"url":null,"title":"the voyages of the fulmar part 10","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhat a night! All of us were agreed that never had we experienced anywhere a worse one and we were glad we had been in Loch Aline on Sunday night not in Tobermory as intended as, from what we heard, that night had been similar but twice as bad.It was a wild night lashing with rain and a big swell was rolling in from the north-east causing us to pitch and roll horribly. Everything banged and rattled and the ropes, despite their lashings, slapped on the mast, the chain rugged continuously on the bobstay, and there was one most annoying thump that kept everyone awake .We could not trace its origin until in desperation the Pilot donned oilskins, sou’wester and seaboots, and went on deck and found it was the tiller end bumping on the bulwarks. The Pilot had a very justiable grouse about this as he had suggested lashing the tiller, but the Skipper had said that he did not think it necessary and that we would lie easierit was allowed to go free.About six we heard Murdoch in Venture hailing us and the Skipper and Pilot hurried on deck. The yachts in the harbour were all lying higgledy-piggledy owing to the swell, to there being little or not wind, to the strong surface current from the swollen river, and to it being about the turn of the tide.Venture and Fulmar were lying stern to stern and what had aroused Murdoch was that the Venture had got her mizzen boom over our main boom and as we pitched we had lted it up crutch and all – how nothing was broken was a miracle. She had then swung round and her now free boom had knocked the cap off our jackstay. As the Skipper came on deck Venture again surged towards us and started pitching and her counter came down with a terric slam not six inches from our bulwarks. We put our helm over and swung clear.Murdoch and Barclay were both in their dog-house and the Pilot and Skipper stayed in ours until the new tide took charge and the boats began to swing in normal fashion and all were able to retire once more to their bunks. Luckily the rain had cleared off shortly before this episode took place.At a quarter to eight we heard the usual poor forecast but for the first time since the cruise began there was not a gale warning for any area. The glass had risen well during the night. What wind there was was from the north-west.The Skipper went ashore for the milk and rolls. The dinghy had a lot of water in it and owing to the rolling it was impossible to get into it and balance on the thwarts till it was baled so the Skipper got his feet thoroughly soaked – the simple remedy of wearing seaboots had never occurred to him. Again the rolls were sold out and again he had to take porter biscuits.On board the Pilot lit the fire then started in to get our breakfast of bacon and egg. After our meal the sky cleared and it became a beautul sunny day, and everything we had was up on deck drying off or airing. The owner of Rose came alongside and for a good time tried to get us to persuade him to go north against his better judgement, but when we heard he had the lady member of his crew of three sick in her bunk our advice was that he go south and that immediately and reluctantly he was forced to agree and half an hour later he sailed. Hervor also went out about the same time and she turned north and we were to meet her later in Iona."},{"url":null,"title":"worldwide ceilidh community sign up for tunes in the hoose","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsCapercaillie founder Martin MacLeod, originally from Oban, and his son, also Martin, have came up with an innovative way to connect musicians from all over the world and allow them to play together for the enjoyment of others.#Tunes in the Hoose# was inspired by Scottish musician, and family friend of the MacLeods, Peter Wood, who was posting videos of himself playing tunes in his home during self-isolation.Having saw the footage Martin senior, called his filmmaker son to askhe had the technology and know-how to put a video together of him playing along to Peter’s video.#I run my own production company based out of Glasgow, so it’s relatively straight forward work for me ,# said Martin Junior.#From that first successful attempt, our new idea was to create an online community for all Scottish musicians to help them connect and continue to play together during these uncertain times.#Housed in Facebook, Tunes in the Hoose amassed over  followers last week with ,+ views worldwide.

From his throne he dispensed news, advice and anecdotes – albeit not always historically accurate. His inimitable irony, perfectly-timed humour and the occasional reprimand to a wayward customer were all fuelled by a generous glass.As former president of the Scottish Licensed Trade Association and Keeper of the Quaich, Donald knew the intricacies of the business intimately from personal experience. His taste was eclectic and his appetite substantial, extending from Dom Perignon and Saint-Émilion Grand Cru to Tennent’s lager and Glen Dronach single malt. On a hot day he’d have an icy Martini or a gin and tonic, proportionately scaled up in a pint glass. Being askedhe had time for a quick ‘small one’, he would reply: #I’ll decide the size for myself,you don’t mind.#The records suggest that his frequent claim to be Scottish Slimmer of the Year, after getting his weight down from  stone to  stone, was fancul.Big D, as he was often called, was fastidious about standards in the little public bar, training his regulars to clear tables of empty glasses and plates promptly, and to keep the log fire stoked on winter evenings.If one of his regulars turned up untypically well-dressed, Donald would raise an eyebrow in mild surprise:  #What’s the occasion for the suit   A funeral   Your latest marriage   Or has your court case come up #In summer, an erratic stream of foreign tourists would have their first encounter with a Scottish pub, standing in the doorway bewildered as to what happens next – sit or stand  Fight their way to the mobbed bar or go to a table and wait for the non-existent waitress  Donald would call them over to his corner and was soon plying them with drinks, food and conversation, not infrequently paying the entire bill for his astonished guests.When a tourist asked him about the quaint red GPO telephone box in Church Square, he told them: #We have the fastest modern communications here – telephone, teletext and tell Donald.#Donald was a Francophile and loved his summers in Collioure, where #Le Grand Ecossais# was almost as well-known as in Argyll. A fixture of the local bars and restaurants, and frequently crossing the border to patronise Spanish hostelries, he revelled in the region’s seafood, wine and culture.His hobbies included cooking, opera, reading and lively conversation on a sweeping range of topics from local history to civil engineering. His knowledge was genuinely wide, but when occasionally encountering someone with a superior command of the topic in question, he would quickly change the subject and admonish: “Och, you’re showing off now.”Donald Clark was born on  July , in Rotten Row hospital, Glasgow. He was the youngest child of Donald Clark and Elizabeth Inglis, following by nine years his only sibling, Fiona.His early years were spent in Inveraray where family le revolved around his parents’ hotel in the little white-washed town.He was schooled at Inveraray Primary and Larchfield in Helensburgh, then Strathallan from  to  where he acquired his love of sports. Contrary to what his dimensions in later le would suggest, he was athletic when young, excelling at rugby and playing for his school and West of Scotland First XV and the old boys’ As.Donald also enjoyed curling, motor boating, snow skiing and water-skiing, where his party piece was to mono-ski down Loch Fyne while drinking a pint of beer.Although not a shinty player, he used his sports experience to coach the Inveraray team in the s and like his father chaired the club.

The documentrsquos most famous excerpt is a statement of Scottish independence.Mr Clark, who works at Hawick High School, has previously completed Scots translations of a number of popular books.The focus of his latest effort, however, was rather dferent in style to previous inspirations, which include Diary of a Wimpy Kid.It took Mr Clark and Ms Douglas around three months to convert the Declaration into our native language.Asked where his interest in Scots came from, Mr Clark said it was his move to the Borders  years ago which kick-started his love affair.ldquoI spoke Scots in Hamilton and so did my friends but I was under the impression it was just bad English ndash it was knocked out of you, said Mr Clark.ldquoBut then I came to the Borders and found that a lot of people not only spoke Scots, but spoke it without a social stigma.Reflecting on the Declaration, Mr Clark believes Scots have a strange relationship with the document.ldquoItrsquos funny that we have this text thatrsquos basically the birth certicate of the whole country, but therersquos not a lot of knowledge about it, said Mr Clark, going on to outline his views on its signicance.ldquoAt root, itrsquos a revolutionary document. Itrsquos a country asserting its right to be a country and its right to choose its own ruler.ldquoWe should be a lot more proud about Scotland being one of the first countries to assert itself in this way.Mr Clark says he supports Scottish independence, but he is keen for the Declaration to appeal to nationalists and unionists alike.He said: ldquoI think itrsquos really important the Declaration of Arbroath is not part of a political wrangle.

In order to help sustain all aspects of our community, wersquove tried to take a broad approach.One solution was the creation of the first Newstead Village Newsletter ndash a simple, four-page leaflet which included useful information and several helpline numbers. ldquoMelrose shops offering home deliveries were also included in the newsletter, says Lisa. ldquoWe put the information online but that excluded those without internet access.

The burst of le and colour with the longevenings resurrects my mood, enlivens my nature-loving soul. It makes our days feel longer while also giving us the extra energy to enjoy them.How can we not be uplted by the sight of a tree in full blossom bathed in sparkling sunshine, or a carpet of wild flowers especially after months of winter when the land sleeps, and the sun seems to have forgotten us But these are not normal times of course and the ability to roam in nature and soak in its wonder has been temporarily restricted. In fact for many of us our normal le routine has been totally suspended.While we are in lockdown, nature is enjoying the opposite itrsquos flourishing with new le and beauty. And while itrsquos frustrating that we cannot venture out in ways we might be used to, I have been able to listen more closely to the stories that nature is telling on my doorstep.Over the last few years I have deliberately lsquore-wildedrsquo my small garden which I am so lucky to have. By that I mean I have allowed nature to do its thing, and nature has accepted the invitation. Elder, rowan, silver birch and cherry trees now enclose my wee patch of the world. Wild flowers such as dandelion and forget-me-nots have sprung up and last year I had foxglove, so Irsquom waiting to see what this summer will bring.A strange effect of all this has been the enlarging of my garden. Not literally, but in the power of its presence. Irsquove noticed how a space full of nature feels bigger than one thatrsquos bare, lsquoneatrsquo and manicured.I like to call it the forest horizon effect. Compare standing in the middle of a wide open treeless park with standing in the middle of a wood surrounded by trees and humming le. The area of the wood may be much smaller than the park, but its impact on our senses is much greater. We are embraced by nature, not just physically but also,we feel the connection, emotionally and spiritually. The space actually feels larger than it is because there is more in it.I am missing this embrace so much right now because of the inability to visit my favourite woods. But the lockdown has compelled me to spend more time in the natural world on my back doorstep.And within the embrace of my gardenrsquos re-wilded forest horizon, although only a space of around  metres by , I have discovered the truth contained in the wonderful book by Scott Sampson How to Raise a Wild Child.In his book, Scott states: ldquoWhen I began on this book, I had a certain sense of self-satisfaction, convinced that a letime of outdoor play, hiking and campinghellip had forged within me a deep bond with naturehellip Instead, I found that, like most of us, I was oblivious to most of the natural goings-on around me.He explains how he then spent time with his daughter absorbing the sounds and sights of nature on his doorstep, which fostered their lsquointernal wildnessrsquo more than any trip to a remote wilderness. They listened to birdsong and sat quietly as small creatures played out their lersquos dramas under the shadow of their house. ldquoWildness just outside the front door, Scott writes, ldquowas helping us deepen our bond with nature. Such interactions, I have come to realise, are essential to nature connection.Reading this has given new meaning to the confinement imposed by the lockdown. Never before have I had such time to simply sit and absorb the tiny goings on in the garden, embraced by my own mini forest horizon.A garden is a privilege, of course, and I understand many donrsquot have one. But wildness can also be found on our walk to the shops, on verges and public green spaces, with trees, bushes and wild flowers that grow in our urban spaces. The trick is to pause and absorb the wonder of it, listen and look for the wee miracles that we usually donrsquot notice and walk by. Itrsquos easier now, even on a normally busy street, with so much reduced traffic noise and absence of bustle.On my exercise walk yesterday I did just this and was overwhelmed by the beauty of renewed le. It occurred to me that this precious one-walk-a-day has intensied the connection it gives me to local nature.And never have I enjoyed the privilege of having a re-wilded garden so much. On Easter Monday I sat in it with my five-year-old son. His attention span can be short but I explained what we were doing and he stayed with me for  minutes. The first thing I noticed was the absence of normal background noise, which heightened the volume of naturersquos spring melody.Our garden attracts many birds which sit on the branches and sing their hearts out. I know they donrsquot sing for us, but my young son thought they were doing just that. In just  minutes we heard or saw coal tits, wrens, wood pigeons, willow warblers, magpies and a robin. Irsquod never have previously known what some of these birds were, but now we are in a mindset to get to know who is inhabiting our lsquodoorstep wildnessrsquo.We also watched a peacock butterfly explore our garden as it fluttered and paused in equal measure. The sound of bumblebees arrived and we saw them hover over the dandelions. Then a small honey bee made an entrance, likewise visiting the dandelions. As we sat quietly, the sound of honking above us raised our heads and we saw two V formations of geese heading north.When my boy got restless, I suggested we crawl like explorers in the grass to see what we could find. We spotted an incredible sight: young garden spiders emerging from their egg sack which was half hidden under a curve in a plant pot. My sonrsquos fascination at this was matched by my own! It was early for this to happen, and we found many other egg sacks where still unhatched.Within these  minutes there was so much le and wonder so many stories to discover. Where did the small birds come from, where were the geese going, why do bees suddenly appear and what did they do during the winter  Why are dandelions so popular with the bees, what is so special about them  Why do the birds sing dferently, are they speaking to each otherso, what are they saying How did the peacock butterfly get its name and where did it hibernate, was it in our garden shed  What was it looking for  Were the hatching spiders emerging early because their mother deliberately chose a warm corner in the garden to lay her eggs  Why do some spiders live in the garden, while others like hiding under your bed  Do you know how to spot the dference, and do they spin their webs dferently These were just some of the stories my son and I wondered about after our  minutes together in our garden wilderness. But such drama happens all around us. Little patches of mini wilderness are everywhere,we hone our senses to notice and appreciate them.I realise now the lockdown, although stressful, has created the conditions for the discovery of so many new things, with so many new nature stories to learn tales of survival and adventure, of lersquos drama happening on our doorstep and in our street.And the biggest story of all is that everything around us is ultimately related. We are part of naturersquos story because we are part of nature. We share a common ancestor with every creature and plant yes, even with the trees.So while I, like us all, yearn for the end of the lockdown for many reasons, I am also going to try to make the best of it by being more aware of naturersquos wonders that are literally outside my window, while I stay at home to help keep others safe."},{"url":null,"title":"uk-economy-braces-biggest-recession-300-years-due-lockdown---likely-recover","story":"While adjusting to le in isolation has been dficult, businesses have been hit particularly hard by the restrictions, with the budget watchdog now warning the country could suffer its biggest recession in  yearslockdown continues into the summer.The Office for Budget Responsibility has said the economy could shrink by  per cent this spring, with unemployment levels reaching . million over the coming months - its highest level since the s.The struggling economy has sparked comparisons to the financial crash in , and the Great Depression of the s, but experts are now predicting the outcome will be much worse.Experts now believe the UK is headed for its biggest economic slump since , when the country was hit by a deep freeze that spread across Europe.Temperatures plummeted on January , bringing with it the worst winter in  years and freezing over several countries, including France, England and Russia.The lsquoGreat Frostrsquo, as it came to be known, lasted for three months and sparked food shortages, thousands of deaths in France, and a huge deficit to the economy.The coronavirus pandemic could see the economy shrink by a record  per cent by June, the Office for Budget Responsibilityhas warned.A drop this big would mark the largest decline ldquoin living memory, Robert Chote, chairman of the OBR has said.However, Chancellor Rishi Sunak stressed that this forecast is just one possible scenario, and it merely suggests the scale of what the country is currently facing will have ldquoserious implications for our economy.He said: ldquoWe came into this crisis with a fundamentally sound economy, powered by the hard work and ingenuity of the British people and British businesses.ldquoOur planned economic response is protecting millions of jobs, businesses, self-employed people, charities and households.ldquoOur plan is the right plan.Mr Sunak assured that the government would not stand by and will act to support the economy, adding that the OBR expects the economic impact of the pandemic to be temporary.Despite being forecast for a signicant decline, the UK is expected toto its pre-coronavirus economic growth by the end of this year, with the OBR stating this amount will depend on how long the lockdown lasts.The OBR predicts that any drop in growth will be reversed in the three months to September, as the economy starts to recover.However, it warned that the pandemic may have a more lasting impact on unemployment, which is estimated to rise to . million by the end of June.Unemployment levels are currently . million, marking a rise from . per cent to  per cent.Unemployment rates are expected to remain high until , before dropping back to four per cent, according to the OBRrsquos forecast."},{"url":null,"title":"11-year-olds-thank-letter-delights-ambulance-staff","story":"Sarah Brady, , a primary seven pupil at Wallyford Primary School, was taking part in the first lsquoClap for our Carersrsquo event on March  with mum Samantha.She noticed the ambulance sitting at the end of her street so quickly drafted a letter and ran over with a rose and gave it to them.The letter read: ldquoThanks for everything yoursquore doing for the world, love Sarah Brady.Samantha said: ldquoThe clap was amazing.ldquoA few days later the ambulance had to come back to my house for my partner.ldquoThe ambulance lady said that two men were in Wallyford recently and someone gave them a letter and that they were really overwhelmed.

Taking the best from history and finding a way to interpret it thatrsquos interesting or unexpected.All their spirits are made by hand in small batches of less than  bottles, with a direct-fired copper pot still, and aged on-site.Since launching in , they have released three distinctive gins starting with their London Dry. Believing that classics shouldnrsquot be messed with, they have stayed true to style by creating a punchy juniper-led spirit, easing into warming spices on the palate and a bone-dry finish.This was followed by their New Tom - a modern take on the ldquoOld Tom style favoured by Illicit distillers prior to London Dry. New Tom is sweeter in character: distilled with pink peppercorns, rosehips, and tonka beans, and sweetened post-distillation with bee pollen and honey.Finally, in late , Blacklist gin was released. Setting out to create a gin with the rich smouldering character of some of their favourite whiskies - bringing together Scotlands two great spirits - they smoked juniper berries over Scottish peat to impart a deep smoky flavour to the spirit.Complimented by the addition of black cardamom, lapsang souchong tea, black peppercorns, and finally infused with activated charcoal to anchor and enhance the flavour, the result is an unconventional gin - jet black in colour - and with a heady undercurrent of smouldering peat and warming spices.All three products are currently available to via their websitewith free UK delivery during the lockdown period.See illicitspirits shop------------------------------------------------------NUDIE SNACKSNudie Snacks are a local based healthy Snacking Company headquartered in Ayrshire.

The Scottish Government has already committed to enrolling at least  senior officials to the Climate Solutions course.The news comes just days before Tuesdayrsquos one-year anniversary of Scotlandrsquos First Minister Nicola Sturgeon declaring a climate emergency.The course was devised by experts at the Perth-based Royal Scottish Geographical Society in partnership with the Institute of Directors, Stirling Universityrsquos Business School and the University of Edinburghrsquos Centre for Carbon Innovation.Among the main areas the course looks at are issues around transport, energy use, supply chains, social behaviours, mitigation and planning for the future.Former UN executive secretary on climate change Christiana Figueres who brokered the Paris Agreement, former Bank of England Governor Mark Carney who is now UN special envoy on climate action and finance and ex Irish President Mary Robinson who set up a climate justice foundation, are among heavyweight names lending their support.The man behind the idea, RSGS chief executive Mike Robinson, said a number of business leaders have already committed to undertake the course along with the Scottish Government, with further discussions to ensure new university students and MSPs can take part well-underway.The studies are aimed at filling the gaps in knowledge, on a scientic and factual basis, with a focus on developing a structured plan. Online modules are live now, with the first planned workshop to be held in June.He insists business leaders ndash and the farming community in particular ndash will play a key role in deciding future outcomes.Mr Robinson, said: ldquoWhat wersquore really hoping is we can make it universal.ldquoThe conversations Irsquove had are with six universities is about making it mandatory for students as a matriculation course. Stirling and Edinburgh universities are already further down the line on that than others.ldquoIrsquom also talking to others about making it as mandatory as we can in all other sectors - including business - because we need everybody to wake up a bit to their responsibilities.ldquoThe Scottish Government are already committed through their programme of government to put through  senior staff on it.Scotland has some of the most ambitious climate targets in the world, setting a legally binding pledge to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by  at the latest ndash five years ahead of the date set for the UK as a whole.The nationrsquos emissions cuts in March stood at around  per cent since  baseline levels, but achieving  per cent is expected to take a lot more work across every sector of the community.Speaking during Climate Solutions Week, Mr Robinson added: Targets, particularly on climate change, relate to the whole of our society and not just government, and you need businesses, you need local authorities, you need inidual actors to pick up the baton and play their role.ldquoUntil you all have the same thing you are working too, then the danger is you are actually pulling apart instead of pulling in the same direction and thatrsquos actually the single biggest risk.ldquoThere is a willingness, but not necessarily clarity.ldquoSo, herersquos a way thatrsquos credible, reliable, makes sense to business and helps them implement stuff - becauseyou donrsquot know this stuff how are you going to run a business in ten years time.Anticipating hundreds of people to enrol in the first year, he hopes the course can help reduce the impact of the pause.He said: ldquoItrsquos very solutions focussed, its imbued with optimism which I think is essential from a mental health point of view.

for the Scottish Government to take a dferent approach to that of England, Wales and Northern Ireland unless the outbreak pattern dfers greatly than where.His comments to the Westminster science and technology committee yesterday come after Nicola Sturgeon published a -page framework document which sets out how Scotland could lt lockdown measures.Stressing it was a high-level plan, the First Minister acknowledged that lting the lockdown was not ldquolike the flick of a switch and said ldquoato normal as we knew it is not on the cards in the near future.:Coronavirus: Nicola Sturgeon: Lockdown exit will be more challenging for police enforcementHowever it prompted calls for UK health secretary Matt Hancock to publish a similar document showing what measures may be taken to lt the lockdown where, while he insisted the Scottish Government plan was the same as his own five measures set out two weeks ago.Speaking to the committee by video yesterday afternoon Mr Smith and the CMOs from Wales and Northern Ireland were asked by SNP MP Pete Wishart whether they should follow an independent route out of lockdown.The MP said: ldquoAs we start to think about coming out of lockdown, surely it would be practical for the four nations to determine their own approach to that given that each nation is in a dferent place on the curve and there is a disparity in the severity across all the nations of the United Kingdom.Mr Smith replied that ldquothe science is the science no matter which part of the United Kingdom yoursquore in. ldquoHe said that it was important to maintain a consistent message across the country, so people did not become confused.:Former Watchdog presenter Lynn Faulds Wood dies at The CMO added: ldquoThere will be dferent stages to the epidemic in the UK but there is a value in making sure the messaging to the public [is consistent], so the measures are applied with consistency, and we see the right level of compliance form the public.ldquoOnce you start to develop a mixed message there is always a risk that people will misunderstand the message, and wont know in one part of the country what they are supposed to do compared to another.Mr Smith explained that it is possible to take a dferent approach, but said ldquoWe should just be very confident that it is the right thing to do at that point in time.He said there had been a few times where Scotland had taken ldquoa nuanced approach, such as cancelling large gatherings before the rest of the UK, and said: ldquoIf that applies on the way in to the measures, it equally applies to the way out of the measures, however I would emphasise again there would need to be very good reason to make sure that was absolutely necessary.ldquoThe dferences might be that the stage of the epidemic was so wildly dferent in Scotland than in the rest of the country that there was a need to take a dferent approach, or the alternative is the approach taken in other parts of the UK was so dferent that it wouldnrsquot be right for Scotland. then we would apply the scientic evidence through the Scottish context, so we can give the right advice to our ministers.It also emerged at the committee that the devolved administrationsrsquo CMOs were not consulted before Westminster announced the roll out of an online portal to expand testing for key workers on Thursday night.The UK Governmentrsquos website for tests was overwhelmed during its first two minutes of operation yesterday when all  home testing kits were ordered by eager members of the public.The authorities later apologised after the site stopped taking bookings due to the unprecedented demand.When Welsh CMO Dr Frank Atherton was asked by an MP whether the decision to launch the online portal was something which was ldquorun past him, he responded that while the four CMOs had been working well together and sharing information, some issues remained with administrations working together.He explained: ldquoI think we should distinguish between the sharing of science and understanding, and the sharing of policy.:New Holyrood laws to make stirring up racist and homophobic hate a crimeldquoSome of the areas like that portal were really not discussed in detail across the four nations.There have been occasions where we would have liked it a little earlier notication of some of the practical details.Meanwhile, committee members quizzed English CMO Chris Whitty on why minutes from the governmentrsquos scientic advisory group for emergencieshad not been published for more than a month, and why membership of the group was being kept secret.Committee chairman Greg Clark MP said it would boost confidence to know who was in Sage and what evidence they were using, ldquoin keeping with the tradition of science of robust scrutiny and openness.Mr Clark suggested a similar model to the Scottish Governmentrsquos scientic advisory group, which publishes its minutes and membership details, would be welcome.Professor Whitty said he agreed ldquo in principle that the details should be made public, but added: ldquoWe were given quite clear advice from the Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure basically based on the fact that Sage e is a sub-committee of Cobra and meets under a range of circumstances, some of which are very security-related, this is not...The idea that itrsquos secret I think is rather strong. I suspect most members are actually known one way or another and all of the sub-committees are extremely open."},{"url":null,"title":"uk-govt-virus-decision-making-called-question-emerges-dominic-cummings-attended-sage-meetings","story":"Mr Cummings was said to have been among  attendees at a key meeting of the Scientic Advisory Group for Emergencies[SAGE] on March  the day the Prime Minister announced the nationwide lockdown.Ben Warner, a data scientist who worked with Mr Cummings on the Vote Leave campaign during the Brexit referendum, was also said to have been present.:Governments Covid- testing website crashed as it went liveIt was further claimed several attendees of SAGE had said both Mr Cummings and Mr Warner had been taking part in meetings of the group as far back as February.No insisted claims Mr Cummings was on or a member of SAGEwere \"not true\" and dismissed them as \"ludicrous\".In a strongly worded statement, a Downing St spokesman confirmed that Mr Cummings and Dr Warner had attended or listened in to SAGEmeetingsbut denied they had in any way affected the groups advice.\"SAGEprovides independent scientic advice to the Government.

While the vast majority of the public has taken a mature approach to the restrictions placed upon them, there are some early signs of fatigue, and a natural desire to have some indication from the authorities about the eventual relaxation of these measures.The First Ministerrsquos important contribution ndash and one that this newspaper has called for ndash was to outline some of the criteria to be applied when such a decision is made. She also stressed that there is no prospect of a swtto ldquonormal conditions before this crisis.Though there are indications the spread of the disease has been contained, and that public compliance with these extraordinary limits on our freedom has bought valuable time for NHS frontline staff, it is important to remember there is as yet no cure for Covid-.To abandon social distancing altogether would be to risk a second, potentially much worse, spike in infections , as well as making it much harder to reintroduce preventive measures. But since most people have demonstrated that they can be trusted to observe physical restraints in public, and become accustomed to them in, for example, supermarkets, there must now be a case for gradually reopening other outlets.Ms Sturgeon was wise to avoid laying out a firm timetable for such changes until we have guidance from medical advisors and more reliable data. A sine qua non for making sure we have the best scientic evidence is going to be more widespread testing than has been available since the very beginning of the outbreak.There are assurances that the UK is on course to meet the target of testing , per day by the end of the month, but that looks dauntingly ambitious. Current testing capacity is half that, at ,, and uptake ndash those actually being tested ndash half that again. In Scotland the numbers are also pitully and worringly low. That urgently needs to be improved.Until it is, it is premature to speculateabout dates for and inidual areas of relaxation. Exactly how and when schools ndash where there are enormous logistical challenges ndash might start to reopen is still unclear what is evident, however, is thatthey do, it will not be anything like business as usual. And such questions should not be exploited to ert attention from whether the authorities have done enough to obtain the data necessary to make those decisions.There is also no reason why Scotland should not erge from other parts of the UK in its measures or its timetablethere are compelling indicators that it is safe to do so. It was reassuring to see the First Minister declare straightforwardly that political and constitutional issues play no part in her thinking, and to insist that only the science will guide policy. Such factors as population density, transmission rates, and the capacity of the health services may well justy slightly dferent timetables across the UK as a whole.That, however, is a judgment that can be made only when we have robust scientic evidence, which can come only with accurate population-wide testing data. It will not mean abandoning all the precautions now in place for some time to come but there is certainly scope for greater public trust and continuing to treat us like adults."},{"url":null,"title":"opinion-kevin-mckenna-coronavirus-aftermath-makes-independence-vital-ever","story":"Certainly, it would be foolish not to follow a plan simply because you donrsquot fancy the look of its authors. But when the UK Governmentrsquos response and strategy for containing coronavirus have been found to be deficient then surely a devolved administration has a duty to seek a dferent way within its jurisdictional competence.:UK Govt virus decision-making called into question after it emerges Dominic Cummings attended SAGE meetingsThe Scottish Government, having adhered to Westminsterrsquos plan for the first five weeks of this crisis, is now facing valid questions about the wisdom of sticking to the Johnson roadmap so uncritically. The UK is on course for one of the biggest death tolls in Europe following a haphazard and complacent approach by Westminster. This resulted in three lost weeks prior to the March  lockdown during which the Prime Minister genuinely didnrsquot seem to grasp the gravity of the situation. Scotland has thus fared less well than other similar-sized jurisdictions, most notably Ireland.Mr Johnsonrsquos ministers, standing in for him during his rural confinement, have probably done more damage to the reputation of English public schools than Messrs Philby, Burgess and MacLean. None of them look as though they know whatrsquos going on either as they lurch from one hapless plan to the next. They are also a daily advert for Scottish independence and Ms Sturgeon must now begin the process of decoupling from this train-wreck.How much of this informed Ms Sturgeonrsquos decision yesterday to depart slightly from the UKrsquos direction of travel is open to conjecture. It was the right thing to do though. She seems to be acutely aware that some of our communities and some sections of the population have less of what is needed to deal with the pressures of confinement than others.For every household which will come to view this period as a curious interlude in their comfortable existences there are several who have nothing with which to ease the sense of isolation and helplessness. They donrsquot have gardens sufficiently large and handsome to fix a barbecue or a batch gin-tasting before posting it on social media with a witty apercu.Having emerged from a decade of economic lockout consisting of austerity healthcare cuts and long-term unemployment they are now being told to deal with a lockdown by playing parlour games on Zoom and touching their toes with Joe.We are plainly not all in this together and to suggest otherwise is naiumlve and ignorant. In no country does a one-size-fits-all approach to government work, and certainly not in Scotland. Here there are several regional statelets, distinct from each other in history, culture, faith and geography, which rub along edgily with each other.:Marches in support of Scottish independence postponed to next year amid pandemicItrsquos inconceivable that those who were already struggling before this pandemic will adhere to this universal curfew for longer than another few weeks. Something will have to give lest the country is soon to face outbreaks of serious civil disorder. Ms Sturgeon seems to have sensed this and has moved to offer hope and a little compassion.Lest anyone in the Scottish Government be tempted to promote the advantages of being independent during a global health crisis a few familiar trumpets from the sprawling right-wing commentariat in Scotland have been quick to advise them of the folly of such a position. Why, independence would be unthinkable in these circumstances how could Scotland put together an economic aid package similar to that announced by the UK government to help businesses Presumably, the UK Government simply borrowed like everyone  faced with this situation. What will define the quality of the UK Government isnrsquot how quickly they requisitioned the cash for their bailout package but how they choose to spread the burden of its impact afterwards.Nothing, we are told, will ever be normal again after this. The effects of coronavirus will persist for a generation. Change isnrsquot merely advisable itrsquos necessary. Having walked in the shoes of the poor for a little while we will be compelled to do without in other ways. Andwersquore talking about change then we need also to talk about changing the way we do politics how we make legislation and where we spend money. This is exactly the right time for the wider Scottish independence movement to discuss ways of pressing home the advantage of compassion.The attitude of every Westminster administration since the global banking crisis of  does not engender any confidence that one headed by Boris Johnson and Dominic Cummings will act in the interests of the many rather than the few. A decade or so of marginalising communities, intimidating minorities and assuaging the malfeasance of the finance sector ensured that those least able to bear the burden of  footed a disproportionate share of the bill.Boris Johnson, Dominic Cummings and Michael Gove have already signalled their intent to endanger the UKrsquos coronavirus recovery by insisting that Brexit remains on track. We are fond of mocking President Trump for his increasingly unhinged pronouncements but nothing he has said is as reckless as this. It reinforces the idea that the Johnson government, whose weaknesses have been ruthlessly exposed by coronavirus, is still refusing to take the threat seriously enough.This week, Pope Francis said: ldquoWe were not shaken awake by wars or injustice across the world, nor did we listen to the cry of the poor or of our ailing planet.

A two-day conference to be held at Glasgow University has been cancelled but some of the other planned projects are going ahead, such as Hold Hands Among The Atoms, a video channel to be hosted online, and The Second Le, an artistsrsquo grant scheme and a nod to the title of one of his most celebrated collections. Hold Hands Among The Atoms goes live on Monday with a video titled Open The Doors!, the title taken from the poem Morgan wrote to celebrate the opening of the Scottish Parliament in . A new film exploring aspects of Morganrsquos work and legacy will be posted on the th of each month.In the more traditional world of paper and print, Edinburgh-based publisher Birlinn has produced The Edwin Morgan Twenties, a five-book boxset collection ided into five categories ndash Love, Scotland, Take Heart, Space And Spaces and Menagerie ndash with each book containing  poems. Meanwhile Glasgow-based indie publisher Speculative Books is putting out a collection of poetry drawn from an open submission and inspired by Morganrsquos celebrated scrapbooks, described by them as ldquovisually arresting, playful, dynamic hellip a queer visual diary, a catalogue of images, and a surreal bricolage. Theyrsquore currently held in Glasgow University Library.Come Monday itself the hashtag #edwinmorgan will be trending in Scotland as readers post their favourite poems on social media, and the event organisers have commissioned a series of digital birthday cards which can be downloaded and posted online. And, of course, many will also find the time to raise a glass or two in celebration.Among them will be Morganrsquos close friend Jackie Kay, a poet and author and the woman who currently holds the position of Makar, having assumed it from Liz Lochhead in .ldquoI think Irsquoll mark it quietly myself with a wee malt in my own wee quaich, and Irsquoll toast him with a Talisker, she tells me. ldquoHe wasnrsquot a great drinker but hersquoll appreciate the toast. You always thought that he would live until  but in a way he has because wersquoll all be thinking of him and celebrating him.Like many Scots, Kay first encountered the work of Edwin Morgan as a teenager, in her case at high school in Bishopbriggs in Glasgow.Kay was  when she first heard Morgan read, at the Highland Institute in Sauchiehall Street. ldquoHe was an amazing reader of his work. He was quite dfident and shy in person but then hersquod get on stage and he was absolutely hilarious. Hersquod have people crying with laughter, so that was really amazing. A bit after that I got to read with him myself, which was even better. I remember doing a reading with him in Cardf when I was about , before I was published. There was me, Edwin Morgan, Sorley MacLean and Norman MacCaig. It felt like an extraordinary experience. She still has a photograph of the event.Kay subsequently became friendly with Morgan. She visited him in the care home he moved to until his death aged  in , and exchanged letters with him. Friendly as they were, however, it was dficult to become close to him. Kay remembers a man who could be guarded and secretive.ldquoI think he got into the way of being secretive after years and years of being in the closet, she says. ldquoI remember making a radio programme with him once called Word On the Street and I asked him about whether he missed the secrecy that being gay involved and to my surprise he said he did, because there was a great power to a secret. There was just the two of you that shared it.Born in Glasgow in  and raised in Rutherglen, Morgan grew up an only child in a wealthy family. His father, Stanley, was the director of a company of iron and steel merchants. Morgan attended Rutherglen Academyand in  enrolled at Glasgow University. Called up in , he registered as a conscientious objectorbut spent the war with the Royal Army Medical Corps in the Middle East.After ing to his studies in  and graduating from Glasgow University in English Language and Literature he took a lecturing job in the English department. And there he stayed until retirement in .Morgan published his first poetry collection in  but it was the arrival of The Second Le in  that announced him as a major voice in Scottish poetry. By then he had encountered and been influenced by the American Beat poets, particularly Allen Ginsberg and William Carlos Williams, and written some of the poems which remain among his most popular. That list includes The Death Of Marilyn Monroe and King Billy, about the demise and funeral of Billy Fullerton, leader of notorious Glasgow razor gang the Billy Boys.Like Jackie Kay, the actress Elaine C Smith first encountered Morganrsquos work at school, and those two poems in particular have stayed with her.Con man, charlatan, rebel, visionary. Who was the real Malcolm McLaren ldquoI remember being struck by how much it resonated culturally with me, she says. ldquoWersquod been reading Burns before and that didnrsquot so much reflect where I lived and where I came from. King Billy certainly did that. Later, when she was trying for drama school, Smith used Morganrsquos The Death Of Marilyn Monroe as her audition piece and their paths crossed in person many times over the following years. ldquoI donrsquot mean that we were great friends or anything like that, but I shared many a political  with him. He was there at the inaugural meeting of artists for an independent Scotland, and as ever had great things to say ndash incisive, funny, and a man full of humility as well.For fellow actress Kate Dickie and for author and broadcaster Damien Barr, presenter of BBC Scotlandrsquos The Big Scottish Book Club, it was a similar story.Barr, growing up gay in a small village in Lanarkshire, had no idea that the poems he was reading celebrated the love between two men or even that their author was still alive. ldquoI thought all poets had to be dead, but Edwin Morgan was very much still alive and very much still writing about the country that he helped shape with his words. And what an incredible thing for a poet to shape a nation ndash Edwin Morgan shaped our nation with his words just as surely as politicians shape it with their laws.As well as finding his poetic voice by the early-s Morgan had also found love: with John Scott, a storeman in a factory. They remained partners until Scottrsquos death in . Meeting Scott, Morgan said in , ldquowas probably the thing that unleashed most of the poems in the s hellip Most of them, not every one exactly, but most of them did come out of things that actually happened. One example is Strawberries, still one of Morganrsquos most popular poems. It wasnrsquot until , however, that Morgan came out publicly as gay. Until then, his view of his own sexuality was that it was personal. What eventually changed his mind was politics.ldquoI think he would have felt, like a lot of people, that it wasnrsquot really anybodyrsquos business, says Kay. ldquoBut it was also a generational thing. It wasnrsquot that long ago from his point of view that it was illegal and as a gay man you developed a whole way of being to try to avoid being arrested. I think these habits run deep and are hard to shake off even when yoursquore able to. So it was partly societyrsquos fault and partly his own reticence, being quite a private person and thinking that he didnrsquot need to share it until Clause  made him think he absolutely had to.A particularly spiteful and pernicious element of the  Local Government Act brought in by the Conservative government of Margaret Thatcher, Clause  stipulated that local authorities ldquoshall not intentionally promote homosexuality or publish material with the intention of promoting homosexuality or ldquopromote the teaching in any maintained school of the acceptability of homosexuality as a pretended family relationship.Local hero: how Gerry Cinnamon took on the music industry and wonMorgan was  when he came out in . By then he had published widely and in a dazzling array of formats, from sonnets to concrete poetry, and throughout the s and in the years that followed the opening of the Scottish Parliament he found younger collaborators in other fields of artistic endeavour, particularly music. The jazz musician Tommy Smith set a series of Morgan poems about the history of the earth to music in , calling the project Planet Wave. A mixture of music, poetry, electronica, samples and performance it has become a signicant part of the repertoire of Smithrsquos National Jazz Orchestras of Scotland and was performed by it as recently as February. Meanwhile Morgan collaborated with the rock band Idlewild on their  album The Remote Part and five years later two of his poems were used on The Ballad Of The Book, an collaborative album between Scottish musicians and Scottish poets curated by Idlewild frontman Roddy Woomble.As well as poetry Morgan also translated the work of others, beginning with a  translation of Beowulf which is still in use today, and when he won the prestigious Soros Translation Award in  he blew the prize money on a trip to Lapland on Concorde. That was the closest he ever came to space, though things stellar, cosmic and interplanetary were an abiding interest and influence. He was one of the first private citizens to put his name down for a putative space flight and his  collection From Glasgow To Saturn contains such cock-eyed gems as The First Men On Mercury.ldquoThere were certain themes he ed to again and again, says Jackie Kay. ldquoHe wrote a lot about love, about Scotland, about changes in our society, changes in technology. He wrote a lot about le on other planets and about owning and claiming landscape hellip but I think the thing about him is that he canrsquot really be boxed into categories and thatrsquos whatrsquos refreshing about him.So as well as looking backwards and celebrating a le and the work it produced, the Edwin Morgan centenary programme is about asking Scots to look forward, as Morgan himself did, tirelessly and relentlessly.ldquoI think his lasting legacy is that he broke doors open, says Jackie Kay. For her, Morgan was in the very vanguard of th century Scottish writers, a true pioneer, and itrsquos that which we should remember on Monday and for the months ahead.ldquoHe was interested in absolutely everything. He had an encyclopaedic knowledge and his mind was amazing. There was nothing that couldnrsquot be included in a poem ndash anything that interested him, he could find a way to write about it. Thatrsquos interesting as a writer because a lot of poets arenrsquot necessarily like that. They might find things interesting but not be able to write about them or find a poem in them. But Eddy could find poems in the most surprising places. In that way he burst down the stable doors and let out all these horses. He has allowed people a great deal of freedom.And as the man himself might have said, freedom rules OK.News from trusted and credible sources is essential at all times, but especially now as the coronavirus pandemic impacts on all aspects of our lives.

Her proximity to him during those summits led many outsiders to believe she is essentially North Korearsquos No. official.ldquoI think the basic assumption would be that maybe it would be someone in the family to replace Kim Jong Un, US national security adviser Robert OrsquoBrien told reporters on Tuesday.ldquoBut again, itrsquos too early to talk about that because we just donrsquot know, you know, what condition Chairman Kim is in and wersquoll have to see how it plays out.ldquoNorth Korean politics and the three hereditary power transfers have been male-centred.

However, he urged the Justice Secretary to reflect on what was happening in England and Wales, where court services were making use of telephone, video and other technology to allow remote hearings and procedural business to take place.Kirkwall Sherf Court has been closed due to the coronavirus crisis, with emergency business transferred to a ‘hub’ in Inverness. However, concerns have been raised about the impact of this transfer, as well as obstacles in the way of securing new ship orders and Powers of Attorney.The Justice Secretary acknowledged these concerns, and offered to pursue the issue with the Scottish Courts and Tribunals Service.Mr McArthur said: “Nothing is ‘business as usual’ at the moment, and the well-being of court staff and the wider public has to be the number one priority.  However, there are many aspects of civil court business that we cannot afford to put on pause.“Over recent weeks, I have been contacted by local solicitors in Orkney, extremely concerned at the dficulties they have faced in getting urgent business completed.  Delays in getting a new ship Orders or Powers of Attorney in place, for example, can have serious consequences. Vulnerable people rely on effective and timely court processes that make sure their rights are properly safeguarded.“In England and Wales we are seeing technology being used to enable more court business to be undertaken.

Many farmers and crofters have already responded to our call not to leave it to the last minute # but we need more of you to do so.“Now, more than ever, it’s crucial we keep money flowing into our rural communities and keep funding our crofters and farmers.“We know that crofters often seek the support of our area office staff to complete and submit their SAF applications and, usually, that has involved a last minute rush in the first two weeks of May. In normal times, this is manageable – but these are unprecedented times.“Our staff are working incredibly hard and are still directly helping customers by phone, but the changes to our usual way of working mean that we cannot currently offer face-to-face support, or for people to simply drop by their local office. Phone support will inevitably take longer and I would therefore encourage you to consider submitting your application online.  Area Office staff can support you to access our online system and ensure you have access to up to date information to help you in completing your SAF. The online system will also provide checks to ensure basic errors are avoided.”“So I am asking crofters in particular to schedule an appointment now to progress their applications by phone. We still have the option of extending the SAF window beyond  May but the current rate of applications suggests that should not be needed # providing people respond to this request.“Whatever  you were planning to do today and this week, please make time to submit your SAF or make an appointment to get support to do so.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This might included certain businesses being allowed to reopen where customers can safely stay at a two metre distance, and the reformatting of classrooms before pupils canto schools.The First Minister has advised that restrictions are likely to continue in some form for at least the rest of this year, and possibly beyond that.She added that the Scottish Government would be relying on the latest data to inform it of what the best approach for Scotland will be and explained that work to expand the nations testing capacity was ongoing. When asked about whether certain regions of Scotland might undergo a more localised approach, the First Minister said she wasn#t ruling out anything that might help us deal with the virus.#Today I am seeking to start a grown up conversation with the public about the complex decisions that lie ahead of us as we look beyond lockdown,# she said.“As we have done all along, we will seek to inform the public with the best scientic advice possible, but the science will never be exact and we are in uncharted territory so we also need to make careful judgements and be prepared to adapt and change course as we go.“We want to ease restrictions, but we cannot rule out having to reapply them should the virus run out of control.#Nicola Sturgeon said she and her colleagues would be relying on the latest data to inform them of what the best approach for Scotland will be and explained that work to expand the nations testing capacity was ongoing.“Every day we see evidence that this virus causes real harm, but so too do the lockdown measures we are taking to contain it,# she continued.#This is causing harm to the economy and living standards, to children’s education and to mental health and wellbeing.“That is why we need to try to find a better balance than the one we have now, but as we do so we cannot take our eye off the need to suppress the virus and minimise the damage it does.“It is only when we are sure the virus is under control that we can even start to ease any of the restrictions because the virus will not have gone away.#Nicola Sturgeon has advised everyone to take part in the conversation about how we might leave lockdown.

Until late last year, a suitable vessel proved dficult to source, said the council.It then became known that the Nordic Sea, which operated on a number of passenger routes in the far north of Norway, had become available.Following visits and sea trials involving Orkney Marine Services and Orkney Ferries staff, the vessel was considered as a suitable replacement for the Golden Mariana.As the Nordic Sea was operating under a Norwegian Passenger Certicate, it was known that a number of requirements would have to be met before she was considered ready for a UK passenger certicate.With surveys now completed and a works list developed, the decision to complete the purchase was made and the vessel departed Bergen for Orkney yesterday morning, Thursday.On arrival, the vessel was handed over to Orkney Islands Council, but due to Covid- restrictions and the need for some works to be carried out to bring her up to the full UK Classication and Certication, it will be a while yet before the residents of Papa Westray are able to benefit from their new passenger ferry.The purchase of the new vessel was part funded by the Scottish Government and Transport Scotland.More details in The Orcadian Marine Scene section next week.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

For urban wildle, which includes mammals and birds living alongside people in towns, this will affect levels of disturbance from humans and food availability.In recent weeks there have already been reports of animals adapting to the reduced human activity including Kashmiri goats roaming around Llandudno, North Wales, troops of monkeys in Singapore, wild boars in cities across Europe and Coyotes wandering streets during daylight hours in the US.Lead researcher Professor Dawn Scott, an expert in Mammal Ecology and Conservation, will use this unprecedented time to try to collect information and answer the study’s overarching question # How have urban animals responded to changes in human activity during the COVID- lockdown The research will collect records on any observations of unusual animal behaviour during the lockdown, determine the effects of reduction in human activity in city and town centres on urban wildle, and the effects increased human activity in gardens and outdoors space is having. The data from the survey will then be combined with other data from media searches to produce a report on the response of urban animals to lockdown across the globe.Professor Scott, head of the School of Le Sciences at Keele University, said: “Urban animals have been able to adapt to our landscape and live alongside towns, cities and suburbs so we know they are already highly adaptable. This flexibility in behaviour means they can usually quickly respond to changing conditions, including the absence of humans, which is happening during the lockdown.“Across the world we have seen reports of animals roaming cities and in locations that they wouldn’t normally be seen during the day. Social isolation is an opportunity for many to learn more about nature and how we can support it. We’re asking people to take part in our study and help us discover how urban animals are responding due to our change in behaviour.”To find out more and take part in the study visit: www.keele.ac.uk wildlestudycopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Considering his past record as a caring inidual, including his efforts to help the homeless, that was not really surprising.But apart from manager Daniel Stendl, who waived his salary, others at the Edinburgh club appeared reluctant to follow Naismith’s example. Reports later suggested that no other Hearts player would be asked to take more than a  per cent reduction.Also last week it was claimed that Scotland manager Steve Clarke had accepted a  per cent cut, simply meaning his salary would go down from £, to £,.In England the men’s and women’s international bosses Gareth Southgate and Phil Neville apparently agreed to take  per cent less. In the former’s case he would still be pocketing £. million while Neville would get £,.At club level south of the border the situation is very inconsistent. Some managers, such as David Moyes, Eddie Howe and Graham Potter have volunteered to take a cut while Pep Guardiola donated a million euros to help fight the outbreak in Spain. There was a terrible poignancy to Guardiola’s generosity a few days later when it was reported that his -year-old mother had died as a result of the virus in Barcelona.But while most Premiership clubs have placed most non-playing staff on some kind of temporary leave, some receiving  per cent of their salary through the government’s job retention scheme, the situation with the majority of players is still unclear.This is a dficult situation and UK health minister Matt Hancock ruffled some feathers when he suggested that well-off footballers should consider doing more to help.Some journalists have even criticised Hancock, saying he was completely out of touch with what was actually happening. That was unfair. The minister was not speaking about the game in general, where players at lower-level clubs are paid a pittance compared with those at the top. He was merely highlighting the fact that many could easily survive with no pay at all for the foreseeable future.To put this in perspective, most players at Premiership level are earning several million a year, an increase of roughly two and a half times what they took home six years ago. A high proportion are on more than £, a week.At the top of the tree are Manchester United goalkeeper David De Gea and Man City midfielder Kevin De Bruyne, who are on over £ million and £ million respectively.Even a player I confess to never having heard of, Tanguy Ndombele of Tottenham Hotspur, is reportedly bagging £. million a year.In the Championship the average annual pay is considerably less, around £, a year or £, a week. And in the lower League Two it drops to £ or £ weekly, not all that much above the national average.During the current situation all these figures need to be taken into consideration. We should have no issue with lower-paid players still getting  per cent of their wages for doing nothing. They, like everyone , still have bills to pay.But for the multi-millionaires to grumble about being hit is about as hard to take as the coronavirus pandemic itself.: : : : : : : :No decision has yet been made about whether the football leagues in the UK will be completed, whenever the action begins again.In Scotland it has been proposed in some quarters that the title should just be handed to Celtic, as the Glasgow side had an almost unassailable lead when play stopped.Now a director of the other half of the Old Firm has suggested thatthat happened, their rivals would only be able to claim “eight and a half” in a rowthey were crowned champions.Personally I feel that this season’s scheduled fixtures should be played out, however long it takes. Only then should the - action start, evenit means a shortened campaign.: : : : : : : :There are currently eight premier ision football clubs in Shetland, all of which have been in existence for dferent s of time.Scalloway are the oldest, dating back to , with Lerwick sides Celtic and Thistle being able to trace their beginnings back to the early part of the th century.Spurs and Ness United both emerged during the s, with Whitedale, Whalsay and Delting joining the senior league more recently.Someone suggested to me that a best XI from each could be selected, to give players and supporters something to ponder over during the current period of uncertainty.There will no doubt be controversy over this, but that’s what opinion is all about. If anyone would like to submit their thoughts, or their own ideas of what their respective best sides would be, feel free to send them in.Next time I will give you the line-ups, in alphabetical order, from the past  years. Dferent formations may be used, depending on how many defenders, midfielders, or forwards are worthy of inclusion.Email me at j.tait@shetlandtimesyou have any suggestions..."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus testing equipment is in the isles ","story":"New kit which will pave the way for on-island coronavirus testing has arrived in Shetland, paving the way to allow for a quicker turn-around of results.The new equipment means samples taken will no longer have to be flown south to be processed, potentially shaving days off the turn-around time for results.NHS staff have already started training to help them use the equipment. It is expected to be pressed into service as soon as possible.Health board chairman said demand for testing on the Scottish mainland had seen tests take up to five days for processing.But having the kit on-island, he said, would see results turned round in a matter of hours.Mr Robinson said he recognised there had been a #hiatus# after initial testing coronavirus had stopped.#We recognised in NHS Shetland that capacity for testing was going to be an issue. Testing in Glasgow was going from  hours to five days.#I think we recognised there was a need to get something locally.# raquoNHS Shetland, like many other essential service providers, employs people whose parents and grandparents did now grow up in Shetland, or even in the UK. Let#s allow them, women and man alike, to be fully welcomed as valued members of our communities, with equal status.Let#s make the changes needed to fully include them and their families and so appreciate the strength in ersity that is their much appreciated contribution to modern Shetland, modern Scotland and modern Britain.Peter#s choice of poetry is particularly relevant during a week when British farmers chartered planes to collect  farm workers from Romania.The manager of the airline says he has already put in a bid for the next six flights.These Romanians form the first link in a long chain that magically re-stocks our supermarket shelves while we lie sleeping in our beds every night.For those with an apatite for further contemplation, I would recommend the following article:Thanks for the helpful and interesting link Malcolm. It almost makes a case for education in the humanities to be compulsory into adulthood!Reading it helped me to reflect on how dangerous it is for us to accept a narrow and rigid definition of what makes for a permissible #Shetlander#,and how important it is to reject the idea that some are entitled to more of a voice in that discussion than others.Those wishing to contest the need for such points to be made should first read Malcolm#s recommended article and then reflect on how recently a SMUHA squad featured a black-faced member of the NHS.As the article points out there is a prospect that this visus will not lead to more harmonious societies.The price of the peaceful cooperation we should wish for with all our neighboursis vigilance against those who would needlessly turn us against each other.Ilove how Peter and Malcolm appear to be so in veneration of each other, just a tad too preachy for me. As for #an education in the humanities to be compulsory into adulthood!# I would respectfully suggest a basis eduction in the STEM subjects would be of far more value to humankind. That way most would understand what a virus is, how a vaccine works. The sort of simple science stuff that lives depend on.Humanities educated, Like Boris Johson and Rees Mogg. Go for it, Peter!One hesitates to perturb so a warm a socialist embrace. However, re the linked article, any author who discusses Nazism and bigotry in one breath and then Trump, Bolsonaro and Modi in the next while omitting to mention China’s Xi Jinping or the North Korean monster, Kim Jong-un, is clearly peddling a dishonest agenda.It#s a wonder people #educated in the humanities# didn#t see that. Interesting.Having installed himself as president for le, Xi is reportedly responsible for the most appalling, vicious repression and imprisonment of a million Uighur people and the relentless destruction of their culture in China’s Xinjiang province. The “ View” is clear: “Speak out or be complicit.”“Without sustained pressure, the grotesque human rights abuses seen in Xinjiang will not just continue but intensy. The time to speak up arrived long ago. Countries should be shouting about this from the rooftops.”If you want a chilling reminder of Nazism, guys, look no further.Does anyone want to remind John the NHS is socialist in intent and inception Did he learnall this from the wonderful British Empire ,I wonder, so ,he is a poor apprentice.John Tulloch#s unwillingness to engage with the main points previously made is unsurprising.Have I missed something here  An article about testing equipment arriving in Shetland allowing results to be available in hours rather than days has very quickly turned into a debate about immigrants, racism, humanities -v- STEM Education and extreme left right wing politics. It’s not always necessary to find something to disagree about.@Stephen Johnston, I agree. That#s precisely why I hadn’t commented on any coronavirus item, here or where, until my above post. The coronavirus pandemic is a rapidly unfolding tragedy, a national and global emergency. Using it as a political football is completely inappropriate.However, there comes a point when people pompously touting their supposedly superior educations to bolster bogus arguments, endlessly stirring the pot of social ision and bitterness, must be challenged. Ideally, we would support those faced with tackling the crisis # at all levels # and keep our criticisms constructive. Or keep quiet and let them get on with it. Lessons can be learned later, with the benefit of hindsight, once all the facts are knownAs they say, # you won#t help, at least, get out of the way.#JT, straight from the right wing playbook# Tell them to be quiet. It#s an effective way to silence people # who could disagree that the coronavirus is a terrible tragedy after all  But#JT, How is the racism suffered every day for thousands of NHS staff not up for discussion  Why do you wish to silence that discussion Why don#t you deal with issue, rather than making a series of accusations and personal attacks What facts about racism faced by NHS staff are not known  Maybe not known to you, but lived by the people in the poem. Maybe for you racism and anti-immigrant sentiment is a political football to be put away until you see fit. But for the people who have lived with it through their lives, suffered because of it, it is a matter of day to day struggle. And yes, a political issue.When John declared that “People pompously touting their supposedly superior educations to bolster bogus arguments, must be challenged” I assumed that he was going to say something about Dr Mr Lt.Cdr Tinkler.For what it’s worth John, my own qualications are an HGV and PSV licence sothat’s what you regard as a superior education, you must have the mother of all inferiority complexes.Whenever anyone tries to bring up subjects like racism or social exclusion on this forum, the same few iniduals fly into an apoplectic rage and you, John, are always one of them.As someone once said:“If you won’t help, at least, get out of the way.”Malcolm Henry Johnson, O dear me, that chip on the shoulder. It was actually Surgeon Lieutenant Commander with  years training in Nuclear, Biological and ChemicalWarfare including triage and casualty care. I rejoice I never had time to waste on the humanities, more important work to do, like keeping people breathing.I know, tell me about it Ian. I for one would be fine without HGV drivers. In fact, I have been training our blessed grandson on how to handle a mule and cart . On a side note, I was exposed to radiation as a child in the s. The triage nurse was excellent and the radiation never did me any harm. So what I am saying is you are both valued by old John Thomas.I’ve often pondered the nature of predictability and wondered: What came first, the Surgeon Lieutenant Commander or the wind-up, clockwork toy To Peter Hamilton and John Thomas I say, thank you, for exemplying my point about using the coronavirus tragedy as a political football.

Prof Pennington said the Western Isles, which at the start of the week had only six confirmed cases of Covid-, could exit the restrictions as a “test-bed” before wider lockdowns were lted.Politicians said the idea was worth considering, but still carried risk.Prof Pennington said: #There could soon be a case for a geographical lting of restrictions # such as in some of the Scottish islands and the Highlands and Grampian.#The Western Isles and Orkney are the obvious candidates to be the test beds for an exit strategy for the country. Travel is restricted because they are islands and have extremely low levels of confirmed cases. You can control access to them and re-open things like shops and churches etc and get back gradually to normal le again.#As for people travelling to the islands it is to be remembered that the vast majority of people have not been affected.”He added that effective testing facilities, which would give a quick result, must first be in place to allow any restrictions to be eased.Western Isles MSP Alasdair Allan said that while the idea had merit, islanders would be alarmedthey felt their health was being compromised as part of an experiment.He said: #It is unfortunate that the language of ‘testbeds’ has been used by some to describe the Western Isles, which has disturbed a number of people who have contacted me about this subject.“We have a population that is more elderly and more vulnerable to this virus than most, and so slowing down the spread of the virus has to be our overriding priority.“Despite the fact we have a low number of confirmed cases, the true number of infected islanders is likely to be signicantly higher. There is certainly now a need for more testing locally.#We need to keep observing the social distancing guidelines and cannot allow any room for complacency.“Given that we may well be behind the infection curve for the rest of Scotland, there is a good case to be made for a regional approach to lting lockdown restrictions, when that happens. However, this also has to ensure that the islands are not subject to any influx of travellers from other areas where the virus has already peaked.”Highlands and Islands Conservative MSP Donald Cameron added: “Any proposal to trial a relaxation of the lockdown rules must have the full support of local residents with the protection of the most vulnerable remaining paramount, as well as ensuring the NHS is not put under any unnecessary strain.“However, the geography of the islands means they are suitable for a possible trial and Professor Pennington’s suggestions certainly deserve serious consideration.“Given the fragile nature of the islands# local economy at this time, we need to give our communities every chance of not only getting through this pandemic but also kick-starting a recovery as quickly as possible.

When the tide was out, it was a grey-sanded, multi-rockpooled, playground.The entire village could be found there on a summer’s weekendwhen it appeared that everything celestial had aligned just perfectly.Hang on, rose-tinted glasses being fetched.We changed into our trunks behind towels held up by impatient fathers, determined themselves to let the sun shine, however briefly, on pale skin that hid, perennially, under jumpers and boiler-suits, the unorm of the tweed-mill and croft.Our young horizons were beginning to broaden and, like every islander before us, the sea needed to be properly introduced.These were the halcyon, formative, summer days of my youth and I was a veritable Jacques Cousteau in black, knee-, wellies.We overturned large pebbles and boulders in the pools, discovering quickly the habits of their occupants and that the miniature world, whilst of huge interest and education, was but a microcosm of what lay beyond the surf crashing not too far away with its warning roar.It was a gentle build up to boldness.We were relatively safe and required little, or no, supervision: the worst that could happen to us was a graze from a slip on the rocks, or a nip from a, larger than was wise to attempt to corner, portainn .We learned which fish were ‘horned’ or awkward to handle and delighted ourselves when we managed to capture one in our hands.Everything was done with your pals.Some of us were more adept than others at this new ‘sport’ a lack of fear, and possibly consequences, proving hugely advantageous when it came to the ‘hunt’.We broke open winkles and limpets on the rocks and threw them, defenceless, into the bigger pools and waited and watched.We experimented and we learned.We filled jars and tin cans, wandered home with our capture, and learned the dference between salt and seawater when it came to aquatic le.Usually several days later from the smell in the shed.At the time it seemed like simply harmless fun, but it was just what generations previous had done before us, and it was preparing us for the serious business ahead.The menfolk of the village all had a bamboo pole which they used to fish ‘properly’ with. The trick was to keep it wet so it wouldn’t get brittle and crack, hence the best place for hiding, and protecting, it was usually in the waterone.You might have had some guttering, we had several waterones.The post office at Knock was the place from which to procure such an item and, yes, they did them in miniature sizes too.I watched in awe as my father rigged my first ‘bamboo’.Half-way up the pole he tightly bound one end of theof tarred sisal twine that he had precisely cut just below a protruding culm .The twine was then wound around the narrowing bamboo to the fragile tip.The tip needed to be light and flexible, for casting and for ‘feel’, but strong enough not to break under the weight of anything with scales or fins.He then expertly tied off a secure fastening at this apex, leaving a working portion of twine which was brought back down the pole and loosely bound.We were, I was told in Gaelic, ‘good to go’.‘Look after it !’, I was warned.Of course we weren’t allowed, immediately, to go to ‘the rocks’ on our own: there had to be some kind of schooling before we were let loose where the big fish swam andyou fell in you’d almost certainly drown.These were the early seventies in Lewis, and the only things that knew how to swim were the creatures that you so desperately wanted to catch.We were taken, yet again, to Shinigeadh where, when the tide was full, we had our very own ‘training pond’, full of cuddies, desperate to hit the frying pan.The bodach had attached a hook to the end of the twine with about a yard of monofilament and had spent low tide filling a bag with some bàirnich , which I’m pretty sure we referred to as maoraich .The walk down to the geo, proudly behind my father and uncle , rod over my shoulder, made me proud as punch.In hindsight, yes it was a graduation.Naturally it was a beautul summer’s evening , the sun was behind us and, despite the bay being filled with grey sand, the sea seemed blue-transparent and I swear I can remember seeing the fish shoaling and darting about, ready to tease us with nibbles and tugs, each one magnied to the size of something huge.Possibly a mackerel Plucking a limpet from the bag, my father swtly extracted it from the shell with a squeeze of the thumb.He tore off the working anatomy, the gastronomic bits of the gastropoda, and popped the rest into his mouth and chewed.Not for long just enough to soften the muscular foot of the newly despatched mollusc so that it could easily be stuck onto the end of my waiting hook.It was the one ‘trick’ that I was never to repeat.I was told about the dangers of fishing too close together , the dangers of standing too close together , the dangers of waving a rod around , the dangers of getting too close to the sea .There were dangers from wet rocks , danger from extracting a fish, no matter the size, from a hook when it was thrashing around, determined toto terra-fliuch , and danger, generally, from not paying full attention, at all times, to what was going on around me.Maybe not all at the same time, but, as the night progressed, and my schoolboy enthusiasm spectacularly combined with my schoolboy errors to make repetition often and necessary, I quickly realised that to mistake ‘playing’ with ‘fishing’ could have serious consequences indeed.I was, however, undoubtedly ’hooked’.From the moment that first vibration was transmitted from fish to fingers.I’ve often wondered about heredity and whether or not certain traits get handed down from previous generations.I’m certain that in many cases they do.But we all, certainly most boys of my generation, grew up with the hand-me-down skills of our fathers and grandfathers.I never met my father’s father, the original ‘Tomsh’.He died before I was born.As a long-line fisherman working out of Portnaguran, his was very definitely not the easiest of lives.The photographer James McGeogh, a former Glasgow policeman, married the daughter of his next-door-neighbour.He is well known for his stunning photographs of the guga hunters of Ness.He found time as well to capture many other images of ‘s Lewis, including one of my grandfather in his working gear.‘Tomsh’ here was the same age in it as I am now.Check out the missing digits on his left hand.Not that I would have ever dared to answer my father back, or not pay attention to his instructions at the rocks: but looking at that picture of his father, I’m pretty sure I know why the message stuck.We all had to start somewhere.I think I managed around a half-dozen cuddies that night.Though I had to get someone more experiencedto get these huge fish off my hook.The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until st May .Sorry for any inconvenience this may

The battle against the coronavirus is far from won, as we are reminded day and daily, so I pray God#s counsel for all our political and civic leaders as they make dficult decisions in an effort to protect lives and preserve health.A spokesman for Bishop McKeown also welcomed the reopening decision, and reminded people planning to visit cemeteries to respect the social distancing guidelines.Moderator of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland Rt Rev Dr William Henry said the Executive#s decision would bring comfort to many.For many reasons this is a sensible and compassionate response to an important pastoral and human need, especially when not everyone who mourns a loved one has been able to attend their funeral as a result of current Government restrictions.Visiting afterwards, therefore, may be the first occasion they are able to make a personal response at a time of bereavement. Opening graveyards makes this possible.Today#s decision will bring much comfort to many, not just those who are grieving the loss of a loved one who passed away recently, but also those who find comfort in being close to those they miss.We recognise that appropriate access to burial grounds must be done in a way that ensures appropriate social distancing, and which safeguards those who work there, along with those who have come to visit. As we continue to pray for those in authority who have to make these important decisions, we also pray for those who mourn that they will know the Lord#s comfort.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Bronagh O#Connell was speaking after the death of her parents Ignatiusand Mary .Mr O#Connell passed away on April , before his we died at their Strathmore Park home in north Belfast on April .They were laid to rest together on Monday in the village of Carrigart in Co Donegal, where they enjoyed many summers together.Mrs O#Connell was head of art at Dominican College, Fortwilliam, while her husband was principal of St Augustine#s secondary school on the Ravenhill Road before moving to St Joseph#s teacher training college.The couple would have been married  years this August, having met in the s while teaching in Ballycastle. They have two daughters, Bronagh and Aine.Speaking to the Belfast , Bronagh said that losing her parents in such a short period of time has left an indescribable void.We have a very small family and to lose an entire generation in one fell swoop is just overwhelming, she said.Bronagh explained that when the coronavirus outbreak began she brought both her parents to stay at her Randalstown home so they had less chance of catching it.However her father, who suffered from Alzheimer#s, began to develop symptoms of a chest infection and was prescribed an antibiotic by a GP.They were warned thatit had no effect within  hours then they must contact their GP again.Praising the GPs in Salisbury Medical Centre and the Covid- team from Grove Wellbeing Centre, Bronagh said they had gone above and beyond the call of duty.The GP said to get them back to their home in Belfast and they would take things from there after the antibiotic didn#t work, Bronagh added. They askedwe wanted to nurse them at home. My daddy had Alzheimer#s andthey both went to hospital we wouldn#t have been able to nurse them or visit them, and they would have died on their own.After arriving at their home in Belfast Mrs O#Connell developed the same symptoms her husband had just three days later, but she was in a much worse condition.Following the death of her father Bronagh was advised to be tested for Covid- and the result came back positive.Thankfully the community midwe is making a full recovery at home. Due to the current restrictions at funerals, only a few family members were able to take the long drive to Donegal, but with the roads being deserted Bronagh felt it was like the path was open for her parents to go to Heaven.I don#t think we have grieved at all yet, she added.You just do the al things, but mummy and daddy are constantly in our minds.There was a Mass but nobody was allowed to attend and the coffins weren#t allowed in the chapel at all.The priest told me that it was the first time in his professional le that he buried a husband and we together.Urging Stormont not to lt the lockdown too soon, Bronagh used her own family#s loss as an example of what can happen.We have no mummy and daddy and granny and grandad anymore, she said.I know people are restricted being in lockdown, but when I look at my mummy and daddy, they got sick and they went nowhere.I think when the lockdown is lted we will see a rise in deaths as people will go crazy.People aren#t abiding to the regulations as well as they should. If the lockdown is lted too soon we will have a pandemic.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

That in Northern Ireland terms is around £.bn,” she said.Noting that good health and economic wellbeing were interlinked, she said that the Executive were working closely with the hardest hit industries like tourism and retail.“From us on this stage today the public health message is still very critical in terms of flattening that curve, making sure we don’t see a resurgence of the curve going into this weekend.” On managing the economic fallout, she said: “I’m on record as saying the virus is not going to disappear, we’re going to have to live with the virus for quite some time. Because of that, social distancing will be with us for quite some time. I know we’ve had some commentary this week about public health versus economic growth. To me the two are interlinked because we need to have an economy to go back to but it is important that public health is at the forefront of everything that we decide.”Much of the focus during the update was on lting the restrictions on visiting cemeteries.Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill said Sinn Fein accepted the need to change their earlier opposition, but also warned it was not yet the time to be speaking about an exit strategy from lockdown. “People talk about the new normal but le as we know it has changed and I think the public are very alert to everything that’s happening,” she said.“The issue of social distancing is going to be a feature of our lives ... for perhaps up to a couple of yearsnot beyond.“That’s an adjustment in itself in how we conduct ourselves in our everyday lives. As we have information we will give it to the public. As we have information there’s nothing that we will hold back on.”The Executive has also agreed to amend the regulations to clary the circumstances in which a person can leave the house to exercise including reasonable travel to exercise.For example, a drive to a safe space or facility would be permitted.However, taking a long drive to get to a beach, or resort where numbers of people may gather is unlikely to be regarded as reasonable, even for exercise.However Ms O’Neill also rejected an earlier suggestion from Secretary of State Brandon Lewis that restrictions across Northern Ireland could be eventually lted on a county-by-county basis.“We’re not in that space yet,” she told the Belfast .“We’ve said we’ll review the regulations and we’ll do that before May  but we really, really must take this opportunity to ask people to stay at home and keep doing what you have been doing.“This is the space we’re now in. We will not ask people to abide by these measures for a minute longer than necessary but our whole approach to this is all about bringing down the curve to stop people from dying.“If people don’t adhere to that now, we are in danger of jeopardising the progress that we have made and reversing the trend.“When we get to the point when we can relax these measures, then that’s what we’ll do at the appropriate time.”Ms O’Neill added that it made sense to work in tandem with the Irish Government to relax restrictions across the island.“There’s no doubt that this pandemic is proceeding in a similar course right across this island,” she said.“The numbers speak for themselves, in that our death rate here is probably -% less than what has badly been experienced in Britain.”She continued: “We have a memorandum of understanding now [with the Irish Government] and it’s important that we work together on the issues of modelling, on the issue of restrictions and what they look like across the island, and we work together where we can to the advantage of the people that we look after.”Mrs Foster agreed that co-operation was vital, but said the comparison between Northern Ireland and the Republic was more nuanced due to dferent data systems.Last night the PSNI welcomed the latest guidance from the Executive on restrictions.Assistant Chief Constable Alan Todd said: “We welcome today’s announcement and the clarity that the change to the regulations and any associated guidance will bring to the public and police officers alike.”Between March  and April  the PSNI has issued  Community Resolution Notices and  penalty notices in relation to policing restrictions.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

But Kit Adams said he feels more isolated on ing to a Northern Ireland that bears no resemblance to the one he left just a few months ago.When the Co Down man departed his native Newcastle for a stint as a postmaster at Port Lockroy in Antarctica, the main concern back home was the effect Brexit would have on the border between north and south.Now, however, the entire island is in lockdown due to the coronavirus epidemic and -year-old Kit, who came home at the end of March, told the Belfastthat it has been a challenge trying to adapt to the culture shock of post-Covid Northern Ireland.It#s strange, but in many respects I have stronger feelings of isolation back home in Co Down than I had when I was living in one of the least populated places on the planet, he said.Even in Antarctica, we actually had quite a few people coming and going. We had cruise ships regularly visiting, with  people at a time passing through [Goudier Island].It#s hard to believe but I see fewer people now I#m home!Here, however, it#s all about making the best of a bad situation and seeing the good where it is.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseThe Port Lockroy team of Kit, Vicky, Lauren and Lucywith Goudier Island in the background FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappThe Port Lockroy team of Kit, Vicky, Lauren and Lucywith Goudier Island in the backgroundSince histo Northern Ireland, Kit has been enjoying spending time with dad Colin, an estate agent, conservation volunteer mum Janette and brother Nick , who is also back home having left his former job in the Swiss Alps.You become fantastically close to people you#re away with and then everybody goes their separate ways so it#s nice to be back with family, he said.The young adventurer, who already had three Arctic expeditions under his belt before he left for the other pole, said the experience more than lived up to his expectations.It was fantastic - I could have stayed a bit longerit had been an option but we had to come back before winter set in, he said.Perhaps surprisingly, the geography graduate said he was not on his own that often when he was there.We had some trouble getting in initially because of sea ice and at the start of the season we were iced in so we didn#t see anybody  for a week, he said.We had to gather bits of icebergs and melt it down for water.We#d only been on the island for a few days when the wind direction changed and it blew a load of ice close to the island and none of the ships could get in, but we managed.At that point, there were only six of them there, but later there were ious people coming and going from conservators to electricians and other workers.Being postmaster in such a remote part of the world was quite interesting, according to Kit, whose job entailed sending missives all over the world.It was always a surprise where things went to from here, he said.Tourists coming to the island sent mostly postcards or letters, staff sent stuff to family and friends and people also wrote to us from all over the world asking us for information about ious things.He added: We all received stuff as well from family and friends which was nice.Kit admitted that he pined for nothing while he was gone.It sounds bad but there really wasn#t an awful lot I missed, he added. It was warm, dry and there was lots of chocolate.The lack of normality he now faces at home is a bit strange, Kit explained.You go away and you come back with all these grand plans to go travelling or something... he said.And then I found myself in a not too dissimilar situation than I was in Antarctica.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseKit Adams FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappKit AdamsBut he certainly sounds happy enough.It#s really not that bad, Kit said. You can still get outside, you can go for a run, you can do ious forms of exercise that I just couldn#t do in Antarctica so in many ways it#s easier.When we were in Antarctica it was  days before two of us left the island for the first time.He added: There are more opportunities here at home - you can go for a run or a cycle. I suppose it#s what you make of it, really.Although Kit, who has a Master#s degree in polar and alpine change, initially said it would be tough to single out the best bit of his Antarctic adventure, he subsequently revealed one special memory which will be hard to surpass.We got to kayak around the island on Christmas Day which was pretty special, he said.It meant that we could see the island from a dferent perspective.Recalling a December  like no other during his stint at the UK Antarctic Heritage Trust#s post office, Kit said he did not even miss not getting the usual turkey dinner.There was a little bit of snow on Christmas morning, then it cleared and it was a real blue sky day, he said. We started cooking the Christmas dinner and we had an offer to borrow kayaks from a ship that was in the area so we borrowed those, put the Christmas cooking on hold, left it on the hob and went kayaking around the island.Not many people ever get up close and personal to the penguin population, but Kit can now be counted among their number.The chicks are inquisitive and would go into buildingsyou left doors open too long, he said.Some of the adults are a bit less friendly, and more protective. But they#re fantastically funny to watch I don#t think you could ever get bored watching them and we were literally surrounded by them the whole time.Four months in one of the world#s most remote locations must be hard to follow. Asked what#s next on the agenda, Kit replied: I really don#t know.You can have all these grand plans and ideas and then a virus throws a spanner in the works.I wanted to see some places that I#d never been before. Now I#m sorting through photographs from being away.Kit said he would love to go back to what must be one of the coolest destinations he has ever visited.We#ll see how thing span out for next November, he mused.The trust has said they#ll be choosing people who#ve been before to go back ... so I#ll possibly throw my hat into the ring.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It is of course vital that everyone continues to implement social distancing and stay safe.SDLP leader Colum Eastwood also endorsed the decision: The trauma of losing a loved one has been made more dficult by the lockdown restrictions that seek to prevent the transmission of Covid-. The suspension of our traditional way of marking a passing and processing grief has been very hard for many people to bear. I#m glad that the latest medical and scientic advice offers some relief for those seeking to visit loved ones and that we can permit the opening of cemeteries and graveyards with controls on social distancing. It#s a matter of regret that parties publicly moved to dferent positions this week before hearing the advice necessary to make a determination on this issue. This has caused signicant upset for many people. The Foyle MP said that it was important that people continued to follow the lockdown guidance. This is not a broad lting of the restrictions. We need to keep our guard up or more people will lose their lives unnecessarily.The Executive made the change after Sinn Fein ended its opposition to the reopening of graveyards and burial grounds.Mrs Foster said: This is about balancing public health concerns with the basic human need for people to visit their loved ones# graves.But she warned: In lting this restriction, it is vital that members of the public heed the advice around going out in public when they are in a cemetery, respecting the two-metre social distancing rule, limiting their interaction with others, and of course washing their hands thoroughly after they have been in public. Mrs Foster said that following advice on social distancing and public hygiene had made a signicant contribution to reducing the peak of the pandemic.We#ve flattened the curve, but now is not the time to be careless, we are not out of the woods, she added.Glancing across to the Deputy First Minister, Mrs Foster continued: We both know that a lot is being asked of the bereaved at this time. But we would not be asking you to respect these restrictions were it not quite literally a matter of le and death.Sinn Fein had been opposed to reopening cemeteries, but faced intensying pressure this week from unionists, from grieving families who wanted to visit loved ones# graves, and from Church leaders.Deputy First Minister Michelle O#Neill defended her party#s change of position, saying ministers had listened carefully to the distress of families.I understand there#s a fine balance and making sure that people do not face additional burdens in terms of their mental health and wellbeing and our role in making sure that people are not put at further risk from the transmission of coronavirus, she said. We recognised the comfort of visiting the grave of a loved one, and what that means to so many people. That#s why we had committed to keeping this issue of graveyards under review.We#ve listened very carefully to the genuine distress of families who have not been able to visit the grave of a loved one.The opening up of graveyards will be permitted where there are those in charge of burial grounds who can ensure we have compliance with the regulations on appropriate social distancing.

Steven is loving getting to spend so much time with the kids as he#s not on the road to Omagh every day.It has been mentally dficult knowing that I don#t need to do  things at once because he is here to help.Having this time has made me reassess and I know I shouldn#t complain because I have my health.Suzie says Steven can also take credit for coming up with the idea of the Friday afternoon cook-alongs at pm.It was his brainchild, and because I was already doing them with the kids anyway, he thought it would be fun to get some other people and their families involved, too.Since we are all stuck at home we are cooking more than normal so it#s the ideal time to get families into the kitchen to learn about food and gain confidence.I try to make things simple as we have to create the dish within an hour.The feedback has been really lovely as more and more people are watching and telling me how they got on trying the recipes.And they love to see that I#m in the same position as them in terms of still managing to cook with kids crawling all over me.I have also been trying to push local food suppliers to keep them going, and thankfully it seems to work as they say their business is booming.Belfast Most ReadNewborn twins ensure names of tragic Spence men will live onTwo men arrested after #mass brawl# in Markets area of Belfast‘Signicant milestone’ as PSNI officer takes senior role in Irish police forceAlleged IRA bomb trio are granted amnesty by ColombiaEoin Brannigan appointed Editor-in-Chief of Belfastand Sunday Le,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Many of us can rely on family members, friends, or local support for help. However, there are people having to self-isolate who are experiencing dficulties and it is for those people that this service has been introduced.I am aware that community pharmacies have been working extremely hard to meet the increased demand for home deliveries of medicines within their communities. I am greatly encouraged to report that over  pharmacies have signed up to the new scheme and  of them have been matched with a community or voluntary sector organisation. The Health and Social Care Board is continuing to work closely with the CDHN to co-ordinate volunteer organisations who will provide vital support to community pharmacies. Communities Minister Deirdre Hargey said: It is thanks to the work coordinated by CDHN and carried out by the volunteer network, including sporting organisations, that patients will continue to get their medicines. During this outbreak we have seen many excellent examples of volunteering in the battle against Covid-. I believe this delivery scheme to be a great example of voluntary action which is designed to help the most vulnerable members of our community.And I applaud the CDHN, the Health and Social Care Board and the many volunteers in their efforts to achieve this.Belfast Most ReadNewborn twins ensure names of tragic Spence men will live onTwo men arrested after #mass brawl# in Markets area of Belfast‘Signicant milestone’ as PSNI officer takes senior role in Irish police forceAlleged IRA bomb trio are granted amnesty by ColombiaEoin Brannigan appointed Editor-in-Chief of Belfastand Sunday Le,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

I regret that and it worries me,” he added.“We need to find solutions on the most dficult topics. The UK cannot refuse to extend transition and at the same time slow down discussions on important areas.”Under the Withdrawal Agreement struck with Brussels, the transition period in which the UK continues to follow Brussels’ rules runs until the end of the year.It can be extendedmore time is needed to secure a comprehensive trade deala request is agreed by both sides, but that must be lodged by the end of June.Mr Barnier criticised the UK team, led by his counterpart David Frost, for having “failed to engage substantially” on the subject of the level playing field. with Michel Barnier \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming fab .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_baa-fa-a-aaf-aadbbd_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming fab .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_baa-fa-a-aaf-aadbbd_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming fab .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_baa-fa-a-aaf-aadbbd_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming fab .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_baa-fa-a-aaf-aadbbd_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming fab .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_baa-fa-a-aaf-aadbbd_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   with Michel Barnier \"Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClose with Michel Barnier \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming fab .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_baa-fa-a-aaf-aadbbd_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming fab .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_baa-fa-a-aaf-aadbbd_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming fab .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_baa-fa-a-aaf-aadbbd_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming fab .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_baa-fa-a-aaf-aadbbd_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming fab .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_baa-fa-a-aaf-aadbbd_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   with Michel Barnier \"David Frostwith Michel Barnier PA FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappDavid Frostwith Michel Barnier  Overall governance of a future partnership is another area where both sides are “very far apart”, he said.The EU wants a single framework to jointly manage the future relationship but the UK “continues to insist on a number of separate agreements”, he said.Britain also refused to “provide firm guarantees rather than vague principles on fundamental rights and inidual freedoms” creating “serious, serious” limitations for a security partnership, while the UK must recognise a role for the European Court of Justice.And “no progress” has been made on fisheries as the UK has “not put forward a legal text”, Mr Barnier said.Senior figures in Brussels and opposition parties in the UK have warned the coronavirus pandemic means it will be impossible to reach an agreement in time and will lead to a chaotic exit at the end of the year.Mr Johnson has repeatedly insisted this will not happen. His official spokesman has even said the UK needs to be free of EU rules to allow it “flexibility” to respond to the coronavirus crisis.Two more week-long rounds of negotiations between the sides are scheduled, starting on May  and June .A UK Government spokeswoman said that despite “some promising convergence in the core areas” of a free trade agreement the detail of the EU’s offer on goods “falls well short” of recent precedents set by the bloc with other countries.Other “signicant dferences of principle” include the level-playing field, which aims to set common rules and standards to prevent businesses on one side undercutting the other.She said progress on that area cannot be made until “the EU drops its insistence on imposing conditions on the UK which are not found in the EU’s other trade agreements and which do not take account of the fact that we have left the EU as an independent state”.On fisheries, she said there would be no progress until Brussels accepts “the UK will have the right to control access to its waters at the end of this year”.PAMost ReadBill Gates says ‘worst nightmare has come true’ with pandemicMeghan’s claim that articles caused row with father ‘objectionable’ – newspaperProgress in post-Brexit talks ‘disappointing’ – BarnierMeghan awaits ruling on first stage of case against Mail on Sunday publisherEx-RAF pilot recalls intercepting  Russian bombers  years on,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The community in Magherafelt responded to a plea from nurses for accommodation in the area and within  hours, a house had been located and refurnished ready for them to move in. Mid Ulster councillor Darren Totten had been alerted to the nurses’ plight and set in place a train of events that would reveal a heart-warming tale of community spirit. He told the County Derry Post: “One of the nurses had been askingthere was any accommodation available – Air BnB or something along those lines in the Magherafelt area. googletag.cmd.push “Somebody had tagged me into it and that’s how I got involved. I sent her a message to give me a ring and she rang me more or less straight away. “That was on the Friday evening and I met them over at the house at a quarter to  on the Saturday morning. It was a bit rough round the edges, it had been lying empty for a while.  “The fella that has recently bought it had said to me a few weeks ago thatit was of any use to anybody, to use away at it. He brought the keys down and left them with me.” googletag.cmd.push Darren posted online appealing for help to make the house a bit more inhabitable for the healthcare staff and found himself inundated with offers from both friends and strangers. “I threw it up on Facebook asking for a favour from anyone who could help kit a house out from start to finish,” he said. “There were people who came here with tins of paint. Four fellas landed and they were painting the living room and bedrooms. “One fella, who I had never met in my le, rang me and said ‘I’m here whenever you need’ so I told him to come on ahead. He landed with dust sheets, rollers, paint brushes and all the rest.  “Bradley’s furniture landed out with a lorry-load of furniture and kitted the whole thing out with brand new mattresses, beds, bedside lockers and all. “The smaller stuff was all made up from donations that people had given. Cloverhill Oil landed with  litres of heating oil and a local fella wired up the TV aerial free of charge.” Cllr Totten hailed the effort as a fine example of community cohesion and said the positivity had helped create a space for the healthcare staff to rest from the harrowing reality of Covid-. He said: “They were over the moon. They would have taken it as it was on Saturday morning, but I asked them to give me a day or two to make it a bit more homely for them. “The whole thing took legs, there’s a real good will out there at the minute and not a penny changed hands. “It was all hands to the pump and it was amazing to be part of it. You would have thought anyone working in that house had been friends for le, they were chatting away to each other. With the house ready to move into on Saturday evening, the mammoth effort left out just one important utensil. “The only thing we forgot about was a tin opener,” said Darren, “but that’s sorted now.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

People will be able to see and hear from their favourite bands and artists, as well as taking part in some jazz dance classes. googletag.cmd.push Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council Michaela Boyle said the online festival will help lt spirits. There is always such a buzz around Derry and the whole district when the Jazz Festival rolls around every year and while we will unfortunately have to miss out on that this time, I think this is a brilliant way of recreating a bit of that excitement and atmosphere in our own homes. Theres nothing quite like a bit of toe-tapping and catchy music to lt your spirits and ease les anxieties, and this revised online programme gives us all something to look forward to – which is exactly what we all need right now – and with over  artists and bands taking part there will be something for everyone to enjoy. googletag.cmd.push I want to thank Councils Culture Department for their hard work in putting this programme together. Im certainly looking forward to a bit of jiving and singing! Jacqueline Whoriskey, Councils Festival  Events Manager, said they felt it was hugely important to keep the festival going, albeit in a dferent capacity. The Virtual Jazz Festival… Sofa Sessions is an opportunity to celebrate artists from our own district and from all over the world, and we felt that now, more than ever, it was imperative that we find a way to do that. In putting together the programme we have made sure that local artists are well represented in line with the ethos of the festival. Its a really tough time for them, and for all of the artists and bands involved, given the financial hit that they have had to endure in the past few months. This is the th year of the festival, and although it will certainly be much dferent to any that we have had before, we were determined that it would go ahead in some form, and we hope tobigger and better than ever on our th anniversary next year.

Council members and senior management have been meeting regularly to review impacts on Council services, with daily updates on the changing response to the COVID- situation. It was decided that given the ongoing situation and all the guidance from health authorities regarding public safety and the restrictions regarding public gatherings it would be prudent to cancel at this stage.Announcing the decision, Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council, Councillor Michaela Boyle, said it was necessary to look ahead and be realistic about what events can safely be delivered over the coming months. I know this will be disappointing as these are both popular events and ones which positively promote health, wellbeing and fitness, she declared.But these are exceptional times and dficult decisions must be made for the greater good.Local people have been responding well to the social distancing advice and I know people will understand that under the current government guidelines regarding public gatherings, it would not be possible to host these events without making major changes to their format that would have a detrimental impact.By making these decisions at an early stage, we can avoid accumulating unnecessary costs and resourcing in terms of planning, and we will continue to review other major Council-led events over the coming weeks.We do however want to send out a strong message regarding exercise and its importance to both mental and physical health at this time. Council is promoting smaller exercise challenges – such as the Family Home k Run Walk on May  – and the online Friday Fitness Challenge, which people can do at home, in their garden or near their home. We will continue to explore other activities and programmes in the coming weeks which will enhance health and wellbeing and offer people the chance to exercise in a safe and fun way.Please take the opportunity to get together as a family and enjoy games and activities, and the extra time we are getting to spend with loved ones.The decision was taken by members during a virtual meeting this week where they were reminded that regulations set out by the Department of Health in their Coronavirus Legislation which came into operation on March  were still in place.The announcement follows on from the decision to cancel the City of Derry Jazz Festival and St Patricks Day programme in recent weeks. Council will continue to adhere to the requirements to keep premises and businesses closed, including burial grounds and cemeteries, and to adhere to the restrictions on movement and gatherings. However, it continues to explore alternative options for the public including the launch this week of an online Jazz Festival. The Virtual Jazz Festival… Sofa Sessions will be broadcast as a live event on the City of Derry Jazz Festival Facebook each day from Thursday May thto Sunday May th- called the Virtual Jazz Festival…Sofa Sessions.For more information on all the impacts on Council services in relation to COVID- please go to www derrystrabane  coronavirus googletag.cmd.push  googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

We are now entering the th day of lockdown with strict regulations in place to curb the spread of Covid-. The current situation is set to last until at least May  and as many seek comfort from the virus’ threat, they are turning their attention towards happier days. Re-runs of old TV programmes are filling the airwaves. The GAA has made  All-Ireland finals available to watch online. News archives are being pored over for hidden gems. Nostalgia is king at the moment, but Maghera psychologist Sarah Connell is not surprised by the phenomenon. googletag.cmd.push “It’s a really comforting emotion,” says the owner of Minding Me Psychologists. “It brings back times when we’ve been accepted and loved, and it provides some badly needed relief in these times of uncertainty. “People are generally frightened by change, because we don’t always feel like we’re in control of things. Having that sense of being in control is really important for our well-being. “We can retreat to the past and think of when times were good, and we felt like we were in more control of things. I think that really helps us to be more stabilised and feel better about things. googletag.cmd.push “I think sometimes we can use it as a wee bit of an escape as well. It can take us out of the situation we are in that, for some people, is really challenging.” Although nostalgia is widely regarded as a positive emotion, this was not always the case and early research into the area deemed it to be a psychological problem. The term was coined by Swiss doctor Johannes Hoffer in , who deemed it a ‘neurological disease of essentially demonic cause’ after studying Swiss mercenaries stationed abroad. It arose from the Greek terms nostos – meaning a yearning tohome – and algos – its associated pain. Hoffer also concluded that the condition may have been caused by incessant cowbells in the Alps causing damage to the soldiers’ ears and brain cells. Even throughout the th and th centuries, it carried the stigma of ‘immigrant psychosis’, a form of ‘melancholia’ and a ‘mentally regressive compulsive disorder’. Sarah describes the concept as ‘bittersweet’ and refers to it as a ‘double-edged sword’. “Because it triggered dissatisfaction and lots of negative emotions like stress, fear and loss, it was interpreted as something you don’t want to have,” she says. “It really is bittersweet. It’s sweet because we’re remembering the good times, all the things that were good in the past, but it’s bitter because we know we can never regain that experience. “It’s gone forever. Time is irreversible and there’s something really sad about that. “The song ‘Days of Our Lives’ by Queen has the lines: ‘Can’t turn back the clock, can’t turn back time, ain’t that a shame’ and I think that really summarises it well. “Although it’s a lovely thing to think back, we can’t turn back the time. It’s really positive in one way but there’s a downside to it as well.” Nostalgia is often triggered by activities that people enjoy, such as music or sport, and Sarah says this is especially the case during a time of psychological distancing. “It can really help counteract feelings of loneliness,” she said. “It’s a huge link because those [music and sport] are things we love. If we think back to times when you played a good match, or went to an enjoyable concert, those are happy memories. “Nostalgic thoughts unite us with people again in our minds. It increases the perception of social support and reminds us of a time when we were with people, doing things and enjoying them.” A rise in nostalgia can often be a result of coming face-to-face with your own mortality and as the death toll in Northern Ireland reaches , people are increasingly worried. “It’s giving them that sense that you actually can die,” says Sarah. “Some people are quite concerned about it, but others probably still feel an element of ‘that’s not going to happen to me’. “One thing many are most concerned about is the economic effect that it’s having. They’re concerned about job loss – a lot of people have been furloughed. “They’ll be wonderingtheir job will continue after this period and what will happen in terms of paying bills and mortgages. The fear that we are going to go into recession is causing worries. Through talking to clients, Sarah has heard many people talk about the unexpected positive aspects that have arisen from the effects of the lockdown. She says: “I am hearing a lot of people really focusing on the positives, which is great. They are loving having more precious time to spend with their families and their children. “Little things like the slower pace of le – you can hear the birds singing more in the mornings. It’s giving time for people to reflect and re-evaluate their lives. Although the psychological distancing that we are currently having to enforce increases feelings of isolation and loneliness, people are adapting. Sarah says: “People are finding ways of coping with it by trying to find a bit of regularity in their lives - doing things like exercise every day and keeping some kind of structure to their day. “We’ve gone from being able to do whatever we want to having massive restrictions on us. “None of us like being told what to do or being held back from living our lives how we want to live them. “We’re having to draw on our willpower to focus and do the things that are right for ourselves and for everyone.” If nostalgia can act as a buffer against the fear and frustration caused by Covid-, then open that GAA archive, put on the old TV re-runs and wallow in reminiscent therapy.

Fireside selectors picking teams is one of Ireland’s national past times. This selection is based on players who took part in county senior, intermediate and junior finals -. It is based on the grade they were playing at that time. Five from each is selected. Just like putting five litres into a one litre jar. Here goes...  - Antoacutein McMullan For years it was the ‘big boot’ in defence who would do the kicking out. Distance was important. Now it has developed into an art form with the qualities being, a cool head, the ability to kick the ball through basketball hoop at a distance of  metres, safe hands and cat like reflexesrequired. Antoacutein has all the credentials. googletag.cmd.push  - Oisin Duffy A good defender is one that the forward hates playing against and the energetic Duffy was one of those prize assets. Firm in the tackle, virtually impossible to stop on the run and full of scores from his defensive position. His display in the Ulster Intermediate championship against Magheracloone, where he scored - from play, was exceptional.  - Brendan Rogers No player can change gear as quickly as the tall Brendan when he motors out of defence. He would excel in any sport and could play anywhere on the football field. A brilliant hurler as well. Seeing a forward chasing him with tongue hanging out is something were are used to. A real pleasure to watch. googletag.cmd.push  - Karl McKaigueThere is a famous film called the Quiet Man. Karl could be titled the quiet marker in defence. He has snuffed out some of the best forwards in the game and still manages to slip forward and get a point or two. Tackles the ball and not the man, so he rarely gives away frees. His anticipation of where the ball is going to drop is exceptional.  - Niall KeenanA neat and tidy footballer. His build would suggest corner forward material but he is actually a quality defender. Came through the minor and U ranks showing class all the way. His display at Croke Park in the  minor semi-final for Derry marked him as a player with a great future and he has lived up to that billing.  - Joe Gray Play anywhere Joewas the heart beat of Faughanvale teams for the most of two decades. He led a young team from the junior ranks to a solid intermediate outfit. Played and managed at dferent times and had a few games with Derry in the s. Has all the skills and a read dead eye free taker.  - Jimmy O’Connor Jimmy was ‘spotted’ by an Derry U scout when he was closer to  than . Now, nearer  than , he keeps up an amazing standard of fitness. Normally listed as a corner forward he is let loose to conduce the orchestra. Not the biggest but he makes light of that with his wide range of skills.  - Enda Muldoon Could have played on any team, in any era. Great hands and a master of the ever accurate foot pass. Always made the game look easy since he broke into a Derry minor team in . Now a qualied coach, passing on his skills to the next generation the youngsters could not have had a better tutor. A gentleman on and off the field.  - Mark Lynch From enthralling Croke Park in the  All-Ireland minor final, at the age of , Mark has continued to show quality. Stepped down two years ago after a long inter county career. Still the heart and soul of Banagher teams. He was exceptional in their senior championship run last year and the intermediate title a year previous. In his all round skills is the mastery of free taking.  - Michael McNaughtGrandson of the great Mickey McNaught who was on the Derry  National League winning team. His accurate left foot is one of the reasons why the Waterside men have become a solid force in Derry football. Can play midfield or half forward and seldom is below par. A very accurate free taker.  - Richard KingRichard broke into the Wolfhound’s senior team at the age of  as a corner forward. Now a commanding figure in the half forward line and an excellent free taker. Was a key figure in the treble winning junior team of . His rather harsh sending off against Red Hugh’s almost certainly cost Limavady the Ulster title. At  there is a lot more to come from this excellent footballer  - Enda Lynn Good enough to captain his county for two seasons. This man is a virtual scoring machine. Such is his dedication that he has been known to train on Christmas Day. His pace and tireless running makes him nearly impossible to mark. Missed a lot of action last season with an injury. Greenlough and Derry will be glad to see him back againthe action ever resumes.  - Paudie O’Neill Probably the best club footballer in Derry never to get a county call. Time after time, he would win games on his own for the Henry Joys. His scoring tallies were mind boggling but like a lot of good footballer had ongoing injury problems. A loyal club player he often played through the pain barrier.  - Kevin O’ConnorEvery year he postpones his retirement is another good year for Foreglen. From being an excellent half forward he now brings his deadly accuracy to the role of target man. A quite superb free taker who is always calm and measured. Played a leading role in their intermediate championship win last season.  - Conleith Gilligan Has to be one of the highest ever scorers in Derry club football. From his teenage years to his mid-s his quality never dimmed. Be it from frees or open play, he seldom missed the target. His pace and ability to be in the right place at the right time marked him as one of the best. His retirement left a huge void in the Shamrock’s attack. He is now passing on his skills to others.

He was impressionable. In September, he was listening intently to the wireless, as Derry launched their first bid for Sam Maguire. He wasnt just reliant on the radio waves to savour the magic. Twice a week, the Derry team would train in nearby Newbridge and he got to meet his heroes. Where the towns Credit Union now resides, John Joe Diamonds cafe was located on Bellaghys Castle Street. Tommy, now  years of age, vividly remembers the scene as his mother Cathy made plates of sandwiches for the players before they ed home, to the four corners of the county. googletag.cmd.push “When you get the county stars in your kitchen twice a week, I got to know them all well and I was friendly with them through the years,” Diamond begins. Sean OConnell would later train the Derry teams that Diamond would captain to All-Ireland glory. “I played with him too, hiscareer lasted a brave while...he mustve been  when he was still playing with Derry,” Diamond adds. When Bellaghy All-Ireland winning manager Harry Cassidy took charge at county level, he called Diamond into the senior  in the early s. He was part of the team that toured New York and Connecticut. googletag.cmd.push “We went out to play exhibition matches out there. It was an experience to get out there. We also won the Wembley Tournament two years in a row.” The semi-finals were played in the iconic stadium, with the final played out in New Eltham. “I was taking a look the other day and I think I have played in every county in Ireland,” Diamond added, of a county career that ended in . But it was the s, when he left his greatest imprint. *** In , Tommy was on Bellaghys first county U championship winning team and was a minor champion three years later. At county level, Derry minors had yet to reach an Ulster final. The first of Diamonds three years in the county minor team began in the closing stages of a game in Dungiven, with Antrim in the lead. “I remember being threw on as a late sub and two balls were kicked right over the full-back,” he recalls. “They landed in my hands and all I had to do was to kick them into the net and I think we won by a point.” After another season of consolidation, a place in the final again eluded them, but there was a crux of a team still eligible for . “We knew from , we had a good  and we didnt lose many,” said Diamond, who was made captain. When Derry defeated Tyrone, Donegal and Fermanagh on their way to the  minor league final, they did so without the St Columbs Derry players who focussed on winning the MacRory and Hogan Cups, under the management of former Fermanagh player Fr Ignatius McQuillan, just four years after tiptoeing onto the Ulster Colleges scene. “Then seven or eight of them came onto the Derryteam – which was some help,” Diamond added. “FrShields was the man who put the backbone into us and Sean , he put all the final touches to us, he was a great trainer.  Sean OConnell, Tommy Diamond and Fr Seamus Shields with the Tom Markham Cup “We trained twice a week up in Ballinascreen and after training we went into Timoneys for sandwiches and milk every night.” Aside from the medals and success, Diamond is grateful for the memories and friendships built up, that stood the test of time. “If any of us ever meet each other, it is a half day session. Thats the great thing about it.” They hammered Donegal in the  first round, in Dungiven, but the win came at a cost with a knee injury to Chris Brown. In the semi-final it was a dferent story and it was a narrow - to - win over Down, a game that saw Phil Friel sustain three fractured ribs. “We beat Cavan in the final in Clones,” Diamond remembers. “It was a hard, dour match and a typical Cavan match with hard hitting and not a lot of finesse about it.” Derry were Ulster champions and with the Hogan Cup now in the county, there was an air of quiet confidence as the squad headed to Croke Park. Diamonds first memory of their epic semi-final with Roscommon was giving the referee his name. “I was marking Dermot Early that day and we got booked after  seconds,” he laughs. “It was some start to a semi-final. I caught the ball and as soon as I caught the ball, he hit me. He was about two seconds late, I hit him with an upper cut and put him on the broad of his back and both of us were booked.” Derry were - to - winners and with the game in the melting pot in the second half, Early pulled a penalty wide of the posts when the Rossies were four points in arrears. “The great Miacutecheaacutel Oacute Muircheartaigh was commenting and he called it the game of the golden goals. Every one of them was hit in from  yards, absolute screamers.” It was time for one last push. Derry had one hand on the Tom Markham Cup. So too had Kerry. *** The Kingdom had the breeze and thanks to some wastefulness in Derrys attack, Kerry were a point ahead at the break. Sean OConnells pep talk worked wonders and the cogs began to turn. Tommy Diamond and Seamus Lagans performance at midfield helped them to a - to - win. “I dont remember an awful about it.” Diamond says. Earlier in the day, GAA President Alf Murray asked himhad his speech prepared with the customary lines of Irish, should Derry win. “I had no Irish, so he penned out the speech with the phonetics and I tucked it into the pocket of my shorts”. The speech mustve slipped out during the game and as he stood on the presentation podium, Diamonds pocket was empty. “I am the first man to just speak in English, I dont think it went down to well but I just had to go ahead with it,” he continued. The team stayed out in Portmarnock on the Saturday and Sunday night. Just recently Donal Mullan, son of county official at the time Paddy, handed Diamond a ticket from the post-final banquet. “The entrance admission was just  shillings,” he added. The homecoming on the Monday took nearly six hours, with crowds coming out along the route to salute the new champions. There were bonfires as the team crossed the county border. On the final leg of the journey, the victory cavalcade of cars coming to Maghera streamed all the way back to Tobermore. The Brackaghreilly Pipe band led John Mulhollands decorated lorry up Maghera street. “I remember being up on the top of the cab. They had a seat and I was tied into it and held the cup,” Diamond proudly beams. “It was some occasion for the firstchampionship to come into Derry.” Two years later, with Diamond still as captain, Derry won the Ulster U title before getting trounced by Mayo in the All-Ireland semi-final in Charlestown. “We were favourites for Ulster but we just werent ready for it ,” Diamond admits. “We were a year young and the next year we were all U and Sean OConnell was still in charge of us.” In , Derry swept all before them in Ulster, with only Down putting up any sort of resistance and Seamus McCloskeys - tally was enough to see off Monaghan in the final. Kerry came to Ballinascreen for the semi-final and trailed - to - at half-time, but had pegged the team back to a point midway through the second half. Diamond was switched to mark Brendan Lynch and a Kevin Teague goal helped swing the game in the home sides favour. Holders Mayo were shocked by Offaly in the other semi-final, setting up a Croke Park meeting with Derry. The Oaks led by nine points at the interval with the Faithful County down to -men after the dismissal of Eugene Mulligan, before easing to victory. He was the first player to captain his county to minor and U All-Ireland titles. But for Diamond,  was far from over. Despite playing three years for Derry minors, it took Diamond time to break into the Bellaghy senior team who would win seven titles during the s. He was dismissed, along with his brother Laurence, in the  semi-final win over Kilrea and missed the final. “Bellaghy had a strong  of players,” Diamond points out. “I only got my place on the senior team when Anthony Madden went to Australia and I got his place at right corner back.” There was nothing  only football and it is still the case. Karls son James is the first of his grandsons to play senior championship for the blues. The recent underage production line represents the hope in the new batch in the club. “They have the greatest facilities and have everything you would want and we have no team,” Diamond adds, referring to the -year gap since the John McLaughlin Cup rested in Bellaghy. “At that timewe had no facilities but we had teams....its a change of circumstances.” He picked up the third of eight senior medals in , but the Bellaghy adventure was only beginning. Once again, Diamond was involved in a first as the club were crowned Ulster champions in the first year of the competition. Frankie OLoane scored - in a  point win over Pearses of Belfast in the first round and it was followed up by a victory over a Newry Mitchells side that hammered Bryansford in the Down decider, thanks to goals from Sean Lee and Tom Scullion. Bellaghy beat St Josephs in the final, a combination of Ballyshannon and Bundoran, played on December  in the falling snow. “They had Brian McEnf and about  county men in total. They had a strong side and they actually, by right, shouldve beat us, but we were that dogged that day,” Diamond states. “It was a really cold day and we got a bit of a lead up against them. It was a rearguard action against the breeze in the second half but we held out.” There was no All-Ireland series until  when East Kerry won the title. Bellaghy retained their Derry title with a win over Slaughtneil in  before losing the final the following year to Newbridge. When they bounced back, it took them to their finest hour. A - to - win over Lavey saw them win Derry title number . In Ulster, they defeated Ballybofey, Ardboe and Teemore before taking on Armaghs Clann na nGael in the Ulster final. A - to - interval lead put them on their way to a facile win. In the All-Ireland series, it was a dferent story and Frankie OLoane was twice their savour. Tommy Diamond, Hugh McGoldrick and Chris Brown led from the half-back line against Portlaoise, but it was OLoane who tied the game late on, before Hugh Donnelly scored the winner in a - to - win. In the final, they took on the might of UCC and once again it took OLoane, with his seventh point of the game, to level matters late on. When Hugh McGoldrick broke up a Cork attack, Brendan Cassidy went on to score and the Tones were crowned All-Ireland champions. “Theyhad  county players, they were from all around. Moss Keane was full-back, he was a big tower of a man but Tom Quinn was too much for him.”   All-Ireland club - Tommy is on the extreme left of the front row Later that night, Cassidys lorry ferried the team up and down Bellaghy street to a heros welcome. Absent was the cup, as East Kerry didntit. “It is the sort of thing they cant take away from you,” Diamond said, of achieving the pinnacle of club football. He would later turn to management and managed Derry for  months at the end of the s, but stepped down after he felt the County Board were not allowing him full control of the team. Before that, at the start of the  season, Bellaghy were unable to get a senior manager, so Diamond put his name forward. The Tones went seven seasons without a title and werent tipped for glory. “Nobody wanted to take it. A lot of these managers, unless theyare good they are not interested at all,” he said. After winning the Derry title, Diamond took his side to Crossmaglen for the opening game of Ulster. After a battle, Bellaghy came out on top, but lost in the next round by a point at home to Castleblayney. “We shot in and shot inand Blayney went on to beat Burren in the Ulster final. I went to it in Dungannon, it was a dour match, - to -,” Diamond recalls, as Burrens quest for four-in-a-row failed. ”I said I would take themas far as I can, there wasnt much hope for them. We got them going rightly and I was disappointed we didnt win an All-Ireland with that team. I felt they were good enough.” *** Another passion is golf. He has been member of Ballymena Golf Club for  years, where he still plays with lelong friend Gerry McCann. He has been a member of Moyola, where he is now the Ranger.  Tommy andSeve Ballesteros Another friend of Diamond, Willie Cassidy, pulled off a coup in  by bringing Seve Ballesteros to play a round at the course, just months after he won the Masters. “I think it cost pound, to bring him to Moyola, he was number one in the world and Willie got him,” Diamond adds. “It is the only course in the north of Ireland I think he played on and I had the honour of caddying for him, I was the lowest handicapper at the club. “I marked his card, he countersigned it and it is up in the clubhouse for ever more amen.” A letime of memories. Aside from the current lock-down, the chat continues every Thursday night over the winter. Tommy plays cards with friends and his sons. It is a ritual. The social hub and the legacy of parents John Joe and Cathys cafe continues. RELATED - Derrys path to their first taste of September. Click here...

He was impressionable. In September, he was listening intently to the wireless, as Derry launched their first bid for Sam Maguire. He wasnt just reliant on the radio waves to savour the magic. Twice a week, the Derry team would train in nearby Newbridge and he got to meet his heroes. Where the towns Credit Union now resides, John Joe Diamonds cafe was located on Bellaghys Castle Street. Tommy, now  years of age, vividly remembers the scene as his mother Cathy made plates of sandwiches for the players before they ed home, to the four corners of the county. googletag.cmd.push “When you get the county stars in your kitchen twice a week, I got to know them all well and I was friendly with them through the years,” Diamond begins. Sean OConnell would later train the Derry teams that Diamond would captain to All-Ireland glory. “I played with him too, hiscareer lasted a brave while...he mustve been  when he was still playing with Derry,” Diamond adds. When Bellaghy All-Ireland winning manager Harry Cassidy took charge at county level, he called Diamond into the senior  in the early s. He was part of the team that toured New York and Connecticut. googletag.cmd.push “We went out to play exhibition matches out there. It was an experience to get out there. We also won the Wembley Tournament two years in a row.” The semi-finals were played in the iconic stadium, with the final played out in New Eltham. “I was taking a look the other day and I think I have played in every county in Ireland,” Diamond added, of a county career that ended in . But it was the s, when he left his greatest imprint. *** In , Tommy was on Bellaghys first county U championship winning team and was a minor champion three years later. At county level, Derry minors had yet to reach an Ulster final. The first of Diamonds three years in the county minor team began in the closing stages of a game in Dungiven, with Antrim in the lead. “I remember being threw on as a late sub and two balls were kicked right over the full-back,” he recalls. “They landed in my hands and all I had to do was to kick them into the net and I think we won by a point.” After another season of consolidation, a place in the final again eluded them, but there was a crux of a team still eligible for . “We knew from , we had a good  and we didnt lose many,” said Diamond, who was made captain. When Derry defeated Tyrone, Donegal and Fermanagh on their way to the  minor league final, they did so without the St Columbs Derry players who focussed on winning the MacRory and Hogan Cups, under the management of former Fermanagh player Fr Ignatius McQuillan, just four years after tiptoeing onto the Ulster Colleges scene. “Then seven or eight of them came onto the Derryteam – which was some help,” Diamond added. “FrShields was the man who put the backbone into us and Sean , he put all the final touches to us, he was a great trainer.  Sean OConnell, Tommy Diamond and Fr Seamus Shields with the Tom Markham Cup “We trained twice a week up in Ballinascreen and after training we went into Timoneys for sandwiches and milk every night.” Aside from the medals and success, Diamond is grateful for the memories and friendships built up, that stood the test of time. “If any of us ever meet each other, it is a half day session. Thats the great thing about it.” They hammered Donegal in the  first round, in Dungiven, but the win came at a cost with a knee injury to Chris Brown. In the semi-final it was a dferent story and it was a narrow - to - win over Down, a game that saw Phil Friel sustain three fractured ribs. “We beat Cavan in the final in Clones,” Diamond remembers. “It was a hard, dour match and a typical Cavan match with hard hitting and not a lot of finesse about it.” Derry were Ulster champions and with the Hogan Cup now in the county, there was an air of quiet confidence as the squad headed to Croke Park. Diamonds first memory of their epic semi-final with Roscommon was giving the referee his name. “I was marking Dermot Early that day and we got booked after  seconds,” he laughs. “It was some start to a semi-final. I caught the ball and as soon as I caught the ball, he hit me. He was about two seconds late, I hit him with an upper cut and put him on the broad of his back and both of us were booked.” Derry were - to - winners and with the game in the melting pot in the second half, Early pulled a penalty wide of the posts when the Rossies were four points in arrears. “The great Miacutecheaacutel Oacute Muircheartaigh was commenting and he called it the game of the golden goals. Every one of them was hit in from  yards, absolute screamers.” It was time for one last push. Derry had one hand on the Tom Markham Cup. So too had Kerry. *** The Kingdom had the breeze and thanks to some wastefulness in Derrys attack, Kerry were a point ahead at the break. Sean OConnells pep talk worked wonders and the cogs began to turn. Tommy Diamond and Seamus Lagans performance at midfield helped them to a - to - win. “I dont remember an awful about it.” Diamond says. Earlier in the day, GAA President Alf Murray asked himhad his speech prepared with the customary lines of Irish, should Derry win. “I had no Irish, so he penned out the speech with the phonetics and I tucked it into the pocket of my shorts”. The speech mustve slipped out during the game and as he stood on the presentation podium, Diamonds pocket was empty. “I am the first man to just speak in English, I dont think it went down to well but I just had to go ahead with it,” he continued. The team stayed out in Portmarnock on the Saturday and Sunday night. Just recently Donal Mullan, son of county official at the time Paddy, handed Diamond a ticket from the post-final banquet. “The entrance admission was just  shillings,” he added. The homecoming on the Monday took nearly six hours, with crowds coming out along the route to salute the new champions. There were bonfires as the team crossed the county border. On the final leg of the journey, the victory cavalcade of cars coming to Maghera streamed all the way back to Tobermore. The Brackaghreilly Pipe band led John Mulhollands decorated lorry up Maghera street. “I remember being up on the top of the cab. They had a seat and I was tied into it and held the cup,” Diamond proudly beams. “It was some occasion for the firstchampionship to come into Derry.” Two years later, with Diamond still as captain, Derry won the Ulster U title before getting trounced by Mayo in the All-Ireland semi-final in Charlestown. “We were favourites for Ulster but we just werent ready for it ,” Diamond admits. “We were a year young and the next year we were all U and Sean OConnell was still in charge of us.” In , Derry swept all before them in Ulster, with only Down putting up any sort of resistance and Seamus McCloskeys - tally was enough to see off Monaghan in the final. Kerry came to Ballinascreen for the semi-final and trailed - to - at half-time, but had pegged the team back to a point midway through the second half. Diamond was switched to mark Brendan Lynch and a Kevin Teague goal helped swing the game in the home sides favour. Holders Mayo were shocked by Offaly in the other semi-final, setting up a Croke Park meeting with Derry. The Oaks led by nine points at the interval with the Faithful County down to -men after the dismissal of Eugene Mulligan, before easing to victory. He was the first player to captain his county to minor and U All-Ireland titles. But for Diamond,  was far from over. Despite playing three years for Derry minors, it took Diamond time to break into the Bellaghy senior team who would win seven titles during the s. He was dismissed, along with his brother Laurence, in the  semi-final win over Kilrea and missed the final. “Bellaghy had a strong  of players,” Diamond points out. “I only got my place on the senior team when Anthony Madden went to Australia and I got his place at right corner back.” There was nothing  only football and it is still the case. Karls son James is the first of his grandsons to play senior championship for the blues. The recent underage production line represents the hope in the new batch in the club. “They have the greatest facilities and have everything you would want and we have no team,” Diamond adds, referring to the -year gap since the John McLaughlin Cup rested in Bellaghy. “At that timewe had no facilities but we had teams....its a change of circumstances.” He picked up the third of eight senior medals in , but the Bellaghy adventure was only beginning. Once again, Diamond was involved in a first as the club were crowned Ulster champions in the first year of the competition. Frankie OLoane scored - in a  point win over Pearses of Belfast in the first round and it was followed up by a victory over a Newry Mitchells side that hammered Bryansford in the Down decider, thanks to goals from Sean Lee and Tom Scullion. Bellaghy beat St Josephs in the final, a combination of Ballyshannon and Bundoran, played on December  in the falling snow. “They had Brian McEnf and about  county men in total. They had a strong side and they actually, by right, shouldve beat us, but we were that dogged that day,” Diamond states. “It was a really cold day and we got a bit of a lead up against them. It was a rearguard action against the breeze in the second half but we held out.” There was no All-Ireland series until  when East Kerry won the title. Bellaghy retained their Derry title with a win over Slaughtneil in  before losing the final the following year to Newbridge. When they bounced back, it took them to their finest hour. A - to - win over Lavey saw them win Derry title number . In Ulster, they defeated Ballybofey, Ardboe and Teemore before taking on Armaghs Clann na nGael in the Ulster final. A - to - interval lead put them on their way to a facile win. In the All-Ireland series, it was a dferent story and Frankie OLoane was twice their savour. Tommy Diamond, Hugh McGoldrick and Chris Brown led from the half-back line against Portlaoise, but it was OLoane who tied the game late on, before Hugh Donnelly scored the winner in a - to - win. In the final, they took on the might of UCC and once again it took OLoane, with his seventh point of the game, to level matters late on. When Hugh McGoldrick broke up a Cork attack, Brendan Cassidy went on to score and the Tones were crowned All-Ireland champions. “Theyhad  county players, they were from all around. Moss Keane was full-back, he was a big tower of a man but Tom Quinn was too much for him.”   All-Ireland club - Tommy is on the extreme left of the front row Later that night, Cassidys lorry ferried the team up and down Bellaghy street to a heros welcome. Absent was the cup, as East Kerry didntit. “It is the sort of thing they cant take away from you,” Diamond said, of achieving the pinnacle of club football. He would later turn to management and managed Derry for  months at the end of the s, but stepped down after he felt the County Board were not allowing him full control of the team. Before that, at the start of the  season, Bellaghy were unable to get a senior manager, so Diamond put his name forward. The Tones went seven seasons without a title and werent tipped for glory. “Nobody wanted to take it. A lot of these managers, unless theyare good they are not interested at all,” he said. After winning the Derry title, Diamond took his side to Crossmaglen for the opening game of Ulster. After a battle, Bellaghy came out on top, but lost in the next round by a point at home to Castleblayney. “We shot in and shot inand Blayney went on to beat Burren in the Ulster final. I went to it in Dungannon, it was a dour match, - to -,” Diamond recalls, as Burrens quest for four-in-a-row failed. ”I said I would take themas far as I can, there wasnt much hope for them. We got them going rightly and I was disappointed we didnt win an All-Ireland with that team. I felt they were good enough.” *** Another passion is golf. He has been member of Ballymena Golf Club for  years, where he still plays with lelong friend Gerry McCann. He has been a member of Moyola, where he is now the Ranger.  Tommy andSeve Ballesteros Another friend of Diamond, Willie Cassidy, pulled off a coup in  by bringing Seve Ballesteros to play a round at the course, just months after he won the Masters. “I think it cost pound, to bring him to Moyola, he was number one in the world and Willie got him,” Diamond adds. “It is the only course in the north of Ireland I think he played on and I had the honour of caddying for him, I was the lowest handicapper at the club. “I marked his card, he countersigned it and it is up in the clubhouse for ever more amen.” A letime of memories. Aside from the current lock-down, the chat continues every Thursday night over the winter. Tommy plays cards with friends and his sons. It is a ritual. The social hub and the legacy of parents John Joe and Cathys cafe continues. RELATED - Derrys path to their first taste of September. Click here...

They cant get enough credit. The leadership didnt faff about once Leo Varadkar signalled the need for a lock-down earlier this month. On a local level, clubs have rallied around their communities and provided direction on so many fronts. Last week they delivered the archive of All-Ireland finals to the world. What a brilliant gesture, following on from the terric coverage given by broadcaster TG. Struggling with the withdrawal from sport, for those who are fanatical about it, cannot be underestimated. Last week, it was great to take a look back at Derrys only All-Ireland title. Highlights aside, I havent watched the final - in full - since I was at school. googletag.cmd.push WATCH - All-Ireland final  Hammering Down in the first round was a statement of intent. A mauling that led Pete McGrath to admit, in the post-game interview, that Mourne fans deserved an apology. The gesture didnt sit well with the Down players. Monaghans Gerry Mone gave Derry a torrid time in the Ulster semi-final at Casement before Joe Brolly came from the bench to give the spark needed for victory. The Ulster final saw Damian Cassidy gracefully skating over the puddles in Clones, in a game the Derry players were going to win, come hell or high water. It took a late block by Tony Scullion on Manus Boyle and Brian McGilligans intervention to deny Donegal another goal chance, when they had crafted a two on one situation. googletag.cmd.push In the All-Ireland semi-final, it wasnt until Johnny McGurks wonder pressure point that Derry would eventually rest easy against the Dubs in the season-defining clash. Anthony Tohills outstretched arms of celebration before Joxers kick went over the bar will always stick in my mind. The branch of the Derry Supporters Shop at the top of Hall Street in Maghera was thronged with people in the lead-up to the final. There was so much expectation that Sam wouldon the Monday evening. In a powerful video interview with Shane Stapleton on #OurGame, Tony Scullion touched on how he felt the wave of emotion was almost congratulating them as they departed for the final. It was a Cork team that hammered a poor Mayo outfit in the semi-final, I thought. With hindsight and on watching the final, from someone outside the camp, the mental strength was Derrys greatest asset that day. Cork had nine players who had played in an All-Ireland senior final. They had played in five, winning two and losing twice, once after a replay. Derry, while being the upcoming team and having dispatched the  and  champions on their way, they were untested on the biggest day of the season. HAMMER BLOW From my position on the Hill that day, I can still see Joe Kavanaghs number  jersey cutting through the Derry defence before hammering past the advancing Damien McCusker. It was the first goal Derry had conceded since June , that sunny day in Castleblayney when Derry fans applauded Monaghan scoring their only point of the first half. In the second half, three Farney goals had Oakleafers shaking, before getting out with a draw. Kavanaghs goal brought me back to that day. Derry never do anything the easy way. Colin Corkery won the first two balls off Gary Coleman, John ODriscoll beat Tony Scullion to an early possession. Corks running game had Derry in all sorts of trouble. Fergal P McCusker and Henry Downey couldnt get to grips with Don Davis and Joe Kavanagh respectively. When Derry eventually went on an attack, Mark OConnor won the first battle with Seamus Downey. Derry were - to - in arrears. Was Derry going to fail the final hurdle again  Brian McGilligan then won a vital possession at midfield. It was small, yet massive. Later in the attack Damian Bartons trademark disguised hand pass - where he looked one way and gave the ball the other - found Johnny McGurk who fired over Derrys first point of the game. It took a series of Cork mistakes to swing the momentum. Teddy McCarthy dropped a routine pass from Niall Cahalane and McGilligan curled between the posts. The now dominant Tohill hoovered up a loose Teddy McCarthy pass before going on a storming run to win a free and Gormley slotted over. The Oaks were now only two points in arrears and growing in confidence. McGilligan turned the screw even tighter. John Kerins had been targetting Barry Coffeys height advantage over Johnny McGurk on his kick-outs. Across came McGilligan to win a ball he had no right to. It was inspirational. The big man launched a pass forward that eventually found Damian Cassidy. Cass swung a ball into the square. Seamus Downey made up the guts of  metres to take advantage of a mix-up between Kerins and OConnor, before punching to the net. Boom. Derry were on top. Heaney nearly beat Kerins to the ball for a further goal chance and, earlier, the Cork stopper made a brilliant save to deny Cassidy. Then referee Tommy Howard made two wrong calls. Cahalane buried Enda Gormley off the ball and got off with just a lecture. Seconds later, Tony Davis was harshly sent off for a lazy lunge at Dermot Heaney, with Howard gesturing the use of an elbow. It was the wrong call. The narrative was always that the punch woke Enda up. Thats harsh I feel. There was very little ball directed into his corner before that. Everything went thought Brolly. However, it lit a fire and Gormley went on to score six points. Derry twice led by three points and when Dermot McNicholl curled over, after the interval, it shouldve been the catalyst to push on. Brolly was toasting Brian Corcoran and shouldve been used more. John ODriscoll started the second half at wing forward, with Colin Corkery in on Tony Scullion. But when Don Davis inch-perfect pass took out the entire Derry defence, ODriscoll drilled to the net and Cork were ahead. Thats where the Derry resolve was again tested. And they passed. There was no sign of panic. McGurk was allocated the extra-man role. Fergal P McCusker, Henry Downey - and later McKeever – ran the show in defence. With the extra man, Damien McCuskers outfield experience saw him use short kick-outs before they were even invented. For all their control, they failed to ask any questions of Derrys defence, but when Gormley levelled the game, the Ulster champions superior fitness carried them into the three point lead. Even then, Derry did it the hard way. With Steven OBrien now at full-forward, Cork began to throw the dice for the last time. If every the term getting over the line was used, then this was all so relevant. Derry had performed better on other days during the Eamonn Coleman era, but winning was the only thing. Failure wasnt an option and they refused to be denied their moment of glory. It was richly deserved. Its just a pity there was no back door and that Eamonn was controversially sacked. This group had so much more to offer. RELATED - Sideline View wants Derry to fast forward.Click here...

They cant get enough credit. The leadership didnt faff about once Leo Varadkar signalled the need for a lock-down earlier this month. On a local level, clubs have rallied around their communities and provided direction on so many fronts. Last week they delivered the archive of All-Ireland finals to the world. What a brilliant gesture, following on from the terric coverage given by broadcaster TG. Struggling with the withdrawal from sport, for those who are fanatical about it, cannot be underestimated. Last week, it was great to take a look back at Derrys only All-Ireland title. Highlights aside, I havent watched the final - in full - since I was at school. googletag.cmd.push WATCH - All-Ireland final  Hammering Down in the first round was a statement of intent. A mauling that led Pete McGrath to admit, in the post-game interview, that Mourne fans deserved an apology. The gesture didnt sit well with the Down players. Monaghans Gerry Mone gave Derry a torrid time in the Ulster semi-final at Casement before Joe Brolly came from the bench to give the spark needed for victory. The Ulster final saw Damian Cassidy gracefully skating over the puddles in Clones, in a game the Derry players were going to win, come hell or high water. It took a late block by Tony Scullion on Manus Boyle and Brian McGilligans intervention to deny Donegal another goal chance, when they had crafted a two on one situation. googletag.cmd.push In the All-Ireland semi-final, it wasnt until Johnny McGurks wonder pressure point that Derry would eventually rest easy against the Dubs in the season-defining clash. Anthony Tohills outstretched arms of celebration before Joxers kick went over the bar will always stick in my mind. The branch of the Derry Supporters Shop at the top of Hall Street in Maghera was thronged with people in the lead-up to the final. There was so much expectation that Sam wouldon the Monday evening. In a powerful video interview with Shane Stapleton on #OurGame, Tony Scullion touched on how he felt the wave of emotion was almost congratulating them as they departed for the final. It was a Cork team that hammered a poor Mayo outfit in the semi-final, I thought. With hindsight and on watching the final, from someone outside the camp, the mental strength was Derrys greatest asset that day. Cork had nine players who had played in an All-Ireland senior final. They had played in five, winning two and losing twice, once after a replay. Derry, while being the upcoming team and having dispatched the  and  champions on their way, they were untested on the biggest day of the season. HAMMER BLOW From my position on the Hill that day, I can still see Joe Kavanaghs number  jersey cutting through the Derry defence before hammering past the advancing Damien McCusker. It was the first goal Derry had conceded since June , that sunny day in Castleblayney when Derry fans applauded Monaghan scoring their only point of the first half. In the second half, three Farney goals had Oakleafers shaking, before getting out with a draw. Kavanaghs goal brought me back to that day. Derry never do anything the easy way. Colin Corkery won the first two balls off Gary Coleman, John ODriscoll beat Tony Scullion to an early possession. Corks running game had Derry in all sorts of trouble. Fergal P McCusker and Henry Downey couldnt get to grips with Don Davis and Joe Kavanagh respectively. When Derry eventually went on an attack, Mark OConnor won the first battle with Seamus Downey. Derry were - to - in arrears. Was Derry going to fail the final hurdle again  Brian McGilligan then won a vital possession at midfield. It was small, yet massive. Later in the attack Damian Bartons trademark disguised hand pass - where he looked one way and gave the ball the other - found Johnny McGurk who fired over Derrys first point of the game. It took a series of Cork mistakes to swing the momentum. Teddy McCarthy dropped a routine pass from Niall Cahalane and McGilligan curled between the posts. The now dominant Tohill hoovered up a loose Teddy McCarthy pass before going on a storming run to win a free and Gormley slotted over. The Oaks were now only two points in arrears and growing in confidence. McGilligan turned the screw even tighter.

In addition, another  food parcels were delivered by last Friday.Local council officials have been working in partnership with their colleagues across local government, health trusts and the Department for Communities to set up the hubs.Down Leisure Centre has been transformed into a processing centre to organise deliveries, with other sites currently being identied should they be required, with staff working in split shts, while observing social distancing and other safety protocols.The new service covers the councilrsquos seven even district electoral areas with deliveries focusing on food supplies with the packages including items such as tinned and dried food, cereals and some essential toiletries.Requests for help from the council and its community and voluntary partners are arriving via Access NI which is processing calls from across Northern Ireland on a freephone helpline.Council chairman Charlie Casey says he is pleased to see just how many of the districtrsquos most vulnerable residents have been able to receive food parcel deliveries recently.ldquoOur sincere thanks go to all our partners who worked with us over the Easter break to achieve this and all the volunteers who have already kindly offered their help, he continued.ldquoIt is important that we provide a leline to those following medical advice to shield to protect their health, or who are self-isolating, and have no other means of assistance.The council chairman said that during the local authorityrsquos COVID- response, it will continue to work hard to deliver essential supplies to those who need them and ensure no-one feels alone or isolated at this dficult time.A COVID- community helpline is operational, with those in vulnerable groups seeking support asked to make contact between am and pm, seven days a week, with the helpline managed by Advice NI who are processing calls from across Northern Ireland.The Freephone number is   , while the email is covid@adviceni.net. Contact can also be made by texting ACTION to .All calls that are relevant to the councilrsquos community co-ordination hub will be passed on to the local authority for action, including referrals from the South Eastern and Southern health trusts.The Downpatrick-based County Down Rural Community Network, the Confederation of Community Groups in Newry and Community Advice Newry Mourne and Down are acting as lead organisations for the community groups involved in this response.Members of the public are reminded that the Down Leisure Centre remains closed and that anyone who requests a food parcel will have it delivered to them directly.The County Down Rural Community Network in Downpatrick is acting as one of the lead organisations for the community groups involved in the response to the new food parcel distribution service.Any other volunteers who wish to assist in the delivery of food and supplies or ensure residents on their own at this time receive phone calls to help ease their isolation, are encouraged to register with Volunteer Now via their website.Further information about volunteering is available at www.volunteernow while organisations can identy COVID- volunteering requirements at www.volunteernow organidations.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd April 2020 Castlewellan.jpg","title":"Castlewellan dressmaker makes scrubs for frontline workers in lockdown  ","story":"FROM wedding dresses to scrubs ndash thatrsquos the new order of work for Castlewellan bridal dressmaker Shirley Moorhead.Sewing a range of scrubs for nurses and nursing home workers has replaced Shirleyrsquos normal orders of stunning gowns, veils, bridesmaidsrsquo dresses and outfits for the mother of the bride and groom since the coronavirus lockdown.The  year-old was facing a full order book for spring and summer weddings until the lockdown resulted in many weddings being pushed back to the autumn and beyond.The woman behind Fairytale Designs, the mother of five was determined not to let her inactivity and seamstress skills go to waste during the lockdown over the last four weeks.She is now sewing scrubs for over  hours each day in her garden workshop, after  years of experience as a dressmaker.ldquoIrsquom sure that in any home where there is a sewing machine, local people are also doing their bit and working to sew to support the local effort with PPE, said Mrs Moorhead.ldquoAt the moment, while Irsquom being very productive, I canrsquot earn a living with what I do, like so many others. Therersquos plenty like me and we are all in the same boat.ldquoIt started when I received requests from nurses who I made their wedding or bridesmaid dresses in the past for. I ended up making scrubs for some entire hospital wards, male and female and in a iety of sizes.ldquoThat widened out to sewing for staff at local nursing homes. I just want to do something to help, particularly for nursing homes as my daughter, Abigail, works in one in Castlewellan.There is plenty of work to be done to complete her bridal orders, but Mrs Moorhead feels that her priority is for scrubs.ldquoMy weddings have been pushed back until October or November or even next year. There are things that would hamper me. I canrsquot see brides to fit them and I wouldnrsquot want to go too far ahead with orders in case some people gain weight or lose weight, she said.ldquoAlso,the wedding changes seasons, that can change the outfit ordered in style and colour. For instance, a mother of the bride might want a jacket as well or might want to lose or shorten sleeves so I feel I canrsquot go to far ahead with my orders. Brides have needed me to reassure them that everything will be alright for their big day, whenever it happens, and I can absolutely promise that.ldquoAbigail is getting married in November and her sister, Johanna, is getting married next May, so they will be the most special wedding dresses I will make in my letime. I feel that I have to keep going with the scrubs as itrsquos so important. However, I will make sure that I will provide all outfits that have been ordered from me. It has become a family affair as Mrs Moorheadrsquos husband, Joe, who also is unable to work as an engineer in the lockdown, helps with the pressing of the garments while Johanna helps with the sewing.Mrs Moorhead has been creating the scrubs from donated material, much of it brand new, and is very grateful for the donations..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd April 2020 Crossgar.jpg","title":"Crossgar man takes Chance with move to Hong Kong 26 years later opens superstore  ","story":"AT the age of  and without a word of Cantonese, Richard Bowsie left his family and friends behind in his home village of Crossgar for a le of adventure in Hong Kong.Twenty-six years later and now a married father of two, Richard has found love, happiness as well as a successful career as the owner of two second-hand furniture stores in the huge cosmopolitan city with over seven million inhabitants.He and his locally-born we, Mavis, run nd Chance Furniture that provides shoppers in the city and online across the world a virtual Aladdinrsquos Cave with thousands of unique and affordable items - ranging from lacquered tables to pool tables, Chinese vases to Balinese drums.While other young ambitious men were told to lsquogo westrsquo, Richard went east, finding Hong Kong to be every bit as much the land of opportunity as the United States.The father of eight year-old daughter Kailey and son George, whorsquos coming five, literally changed his le in three days when he made the decision to fly to Hong Kong.From working as a leguard at the Tropicana centre in Newcastle and at the former Down Leisure Centre, the former student of the High School, Ballynahinch, had been close to completing his BTec qualication in Leisure Management at the former Newcastle College of Further Education.He ped out of his course a few months shy of graduation due to bullying. While his parents, Margaret and Ken, a well-known architect, were shocked at their middle sonrsquos decision, they were not surprised.He recalled: ldquoI had a friend who had travelled to Hong Kong three months previously. During a phone call he told me that the new international airport was under construction and work was easy to find. Three days later I arrived.ldquoI decided to go by myself as I had been trying to find an exciting job at home for a while but kept being told I was too young for the roles or lacked experience. My parents knew I was ambitious and how frustrated I was becoming with my career ambitions being knocked back all the time.Richard admitted he hadnrsquot a clue what to do once he arrived and took a bar managerrsquos job as an interim position as many of the airport workers drank there.His first job at the airport turned out to be with the Northern Ireland company, Lagan Construction Group, before going to another Belfast-based company, Rotary International, with which he worked for two years.ldquoI felt excited and nervous all at the same time when I first moved to Hong Kong, said Richard.ldquoThe first thing that struck me was the heat, after leaving cold and damp of home. Arriving in  degrees and high humidity was certainly a shock to the system, despite having been on family holidays to France most years with my family and once to America with a cross community group. The heat in Asia was a massive shock.Having grown up in a rented manse on the Rademon estate, Richard swapped a quiet rural existence for the hustle and bustle of the global port and major commerce centre. It was still under British rule and would remain so for another three years before it was handed back to China.Richard said: ldquoLanguage was the biggest shock but I made it my mission to learn the language and enrolled in YMCA lessons but also managed to pick it up from also working alongside locals.It wasnrsquot long before Richard felt confident enough to start out his own business, an electrical supply company which employed  staff.He said: ldquoI knew after the first few months that Hong Kong was going to work for me,you worked hard, nothing could hold you back, age was not an issue here. Opening a business here was very straight forward, just need a bank account and register an address.He met his we Mavis during his first month in the city and the two have been together ever since.They opened their first store in  in the after seeing a large amount of good furniture being thrown away each week and were determined to do something that would reduce the waste and help the environment. Within months, they had outgrown this store and relocated to their current , sq ft premises in Tuen Mun.The couple has recently opened a second, , sq ft premises in Chai Wan which is closer to the busy capital.Fluent in Cantonese for many years, Richard has seen Hong Kong go through many challenges, not in the least with the recent coronavirus pandemic.ldquoHong Kong has handled the virus very well, having been through SARS and bird flu before, said Richard. ldquoAs soon as we heard there was an issue over the border in China, Hong Kong went straight into prevention measures before even being advised to. Now everyone wears masks and observes hygiene measures.The preventative measures must have been successful as the city recorded zero deaths on Monday for the first time since the outbreak before Christmas.While the move to Hong Kong was the right one for Richard, he still misses home and his brothers and sisters, Simon, Gillian, Laura and William.He said: ldquoI miss the food, the greenery and, of course, my family who are all still in Northern Ireland. I miss being close to home as I have lost family members and grandparents.ldquoBut we come home as often as we can. Mavis and the kids love Crossgar, especially AJs Diner. They love the Rademon estate where we lived beside, walks down the Church Road to Kilmore and the open green fields. We have very few here in Hong Kong and any we do have are full of mosquitos.Home is always on Richardrsquos mind, as is his business.He adds: ldquoNext for our business is hopefully more expansion as I would like to start exporting furniture to other countries such as Northern Ireland. I have discussed this with some Co Down firms in the past, so watch this space..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd April 2020 Downpatrick Jockey.jpg","title":"Downpatrick jockey Declan lands seven winners  ","story":"DESPITE the fact that the - season has been curtailed, it is good to record that Downpatrick amateur jockey Declan Lavery rode an excellent tally of seven winners, one ahead of Banbridge farrier Mark OrsquoHare during the season.It is notable that while Lavery is based with Paddy Turley at Downpatrick, he rode his winners for Southern-based trainers like John Ryan and Luke Conner.

Although I donrsquot remember him riding, I know he did so for many years, and was also a trainer and owned horses right up to .His son, Pat, also rode as an amateur and professional, spending a good bit of his riding days with Jeremy Maxwell at Ballee. I can recall him winning on Raise An Argument at Downpatrick. Like his father, he also trained and one of his locally based owners was Joe McGrath, from Annacloy.Dr Gillespie was a regular steward at local meetings and also at many Southern racecourses. He was also a good supporter of the former Downpatrick Racecourse Supporters Club.

Mr James said bluntly yesterday:ldquoThere are people who had an opportunity to say things at an early stage but did not. Now they have really pulled the carpet out from under our feet at an advanced stage. Irsquom bitterly disappointed at this kind of timing.The problem arose when the Housing Executive was in the final stages of preparing a scheme, which has been on the drawing board for several years, when it was told of the Government objections to a number of potential sites, including the Burren River catchment area and another, the most important, at the Dundrum Road end of the town.The Executive had finally got an agreement to purchase from the landowner of the Dundrum Road site and had made a final routine check with the Government departments before clinching a deal.

It is also my understanding that Newry, Mourne and Down Council and Northern Irelandrsquos other  councils are working closely alongside the government department at this time.Cllr Walker said he would like to see the recycling centres open again, suggesting that strict controls could be introduced to only allow two vehicles access them at any one time.ldquoI would also appeal to people at this time to keep their waste until the recycling centres are open again. I appreciate that many people who are not at work at the moment are making the most of the time they have to clean out their homes, sheds and garages and I commend them for being active.ldquoHowever, it simply isnrsquot on to load up you car with waste, drive to a secluded area and dump it. I just donrsquot understand the mentality of people who engage in this kind of behaviour.Cllr Walker also said the cost of clearing up illegal waste is borne by the districtrsquos ratepayers.ldquoWe have the ironic situation that those who dump their waste illegally end up paying for its removal viatheir rates. This beggars belief, he declared. ldquoThe stupidity of those who dump waste in secluded areas is beyond me.Cllr Walker added: ldquoThe time has come for common sense and people really need to catch a grip of themselves. One of the most worrying aspectsof illegal dumping is that waste which ends up in fields is sometimes eatenby livestock which often results in deadly consequences. To those who dump their waste illegal my appeal is stop now.The local council has confirmed that it is receiving increasing reports about fly-tipping across the district since the start of the COVID- crisis. But the organisation insists that it is currently able to manage the issue within existing resources.A council spokesman said that the organisation continues to work closely with the Environment Agency which also performs a key role in addressing incidents of larger illicit dumping.On the issue of reopening the districtrsquos household recycling centres, the spokesman explained that the decision is continually being reviewed in line with government social distancing measures.He continued: ldquoFly-tipping is illegal and the council will strictly enforce this where evidence can be gathered. Responding to fly-tipping incidents also erts important council resources away from providing other essential services.The spokesman confirmed that the council is unable to remove illicitly-dumped waste from privately-owned land, explaining that where this occurs, both it and the Environment Agency has the legal powers to request its removal.He said the council will enforce this where required.The spokesman added: ldquoThe council would urge the public to avoid producing any unnecessary waste, including undertaking DIY and house and garden clearances at this time due to the considerable pressure being placed on public services.ldquoAny additional waste that is produced should be stored for future disposal at the household recycling centres once they re-open.

In a glittering playing career, the Ballykinlar man went on to win two more All-Ireland medals and established himself as one of the legends of the Gaelic football. Here, he selects his greatest Down team of all timeHIS name alone is enough to rekindle treasured memories of a time when Down football reigned supreme.Paddy lsquoMorsquo Doherty had the deadliest left foot in Ireland and he used it to maximum effect as Down swept all before them.Incredibly, itrsquos  years ago that Down took the sporting world by storm when they defeated Kerry to win the All-Ireland senior football title for the first time. It was also the first time that a team north of the border had won the Sam Maguire Cup.To reinforce their emergence as a new power in Gaelic football, Down retained their title the following year with Paddy as captain of the side which defeated Offaly and he was also a member of the Down team which won a third All-Ireland for the county in , Kerry again falling victim to the Red and Black machine in the final.As well as his three All-Ireland medals, Paddy won seven Ulster Championship, seven Railway Cup and three National League medals. He was the leading scorer in Ulster for eight seasons and in Ireland for three years.Now in his s, hersquos followed Downrsquos fluctuating fortunes ever since, relishing in theof the glory days in the early s, sharing in the disappointment of the barren times and casting a critical eye from the sidelines, though always with the optimistic outlook of the true fan.So what does he believe is the greatest Down team of all time Not surprisingly, given their accomplishments, hersquos largely selected his choice from his team-mates from the Sixties mdash though with typical modesty, he has not picked himself for the starting .ldquoYou have to remember that the Down team of s was the first to bring the Sam Maguire over the border, he says.ldquoThat was a really big achievement and we had beaten Kerry in the final. We had shown we were the best team in Ireland and we proved that again the following year in the final against Offaly after beating Kerry in the semi-final. We also beat Kerry in the  final, which meant that we had beaten them three times.ldquoKerry have always been the benchmark. If we had not beaten them, they would have won another three All-Irelands.Asked how his Down team would fare against present day sides ldquoItrsquos a dferent game now, what with the blanket defence and other things, but the Down teams of the s would have won in any era. Well, thatrsquos what I think, though Irsquom sure there are many people who would disagree. Eddie McKay Eddie won two All-Ireland medals with me in  and . He was a very good goalkeeper believe me, always safe, dependable and brave. He was an excellent shot stopper and made many excellent saves. I also played against him many times when Ballykinlar took on Dundrum. These were local parish derbies and everyone was trying to kill each other, but somehow Dundrum never managed to beat us. George Lavery George also won two All-Irelands in  and . He was the quiet man on the team, but there were few better man markers in the game and he would have been a star in any era. He had played a match of two for Antrim, but Maurice Hayes, who was secretary of the Down county board, persuaded him to sign for Down. He played as sweeper and was a good, tight marker. Leo Murphy Leo was a terric full back, tough and reliable. Not too many players could get past him and he could kick the ball a long distance. He also won two All-Irelands in  and . Pat Rice There was no one better than Pat Rice at catching a ball. His high fielding was magnicent and he was quick at clearing the ball. He gave away few chances and often kicked the ball out for Eddie McKay. He missed little and he wasnrsquot a dirty player at all. Dan McCartan One of only three Down players to win three All-Ireland senior medals along with Sean OrsquoNeill, Joe Lennon and myself, Dan is one of the all-time greats of Down football. He had outstanding ability, tackled hard and always looked for the quick clearance up to the front men. He could play anywhere as he showed when he moved to full back in the  final. Joe Lennon He was our captain in , though he did not play in the second after getting injured. He was a great captain and a terric leader. Joe placed a great emphasis on fitness and pioneered new coaching practices. He thought greatly about the game and was possibly ahead of his time. He was a very talented player. Tom OrsquoHare Tom played in the  team, but was good enough to get his place on any team. He was probably one of our best players that year. He was always steady and was great at delivering a ground ball. Jarlath Carey Jarlath won two All-Irelands in  and . He was a tireless worker, who was at home either in midfield or in attack. He was always forcing his way into the forward line and would wag his finger at me to go back into midfield to cover for him. I didnrsquot mind one bit, because he was good enough and I was fit enough to do what he asked. Colm McAlarney They called Colm lsquoThe Mighty Arklersquo after the famous racehorse because of his long strides up the field. Colm and Tom OrsquoHare were our two outstanding players in  and Colm was definitely one of the best midfielders in Ireland at that time, or any other time. Tony Hadden Tony won two All-Irelands in  and . He could fist the ball further than many players could kick it and he could also move into midfieldthings were going bad. He was tall and well built and could score a point as well as anyone. James McCartan A very strong player. Down would not have won anything without him because he took a lot of the abuse which would otherwise have been directed at me or Sean OrsquoNeill. He played a critical role in the  final against Offaly. We were two goals down in the first half and getting beaten. I crossed the ball to James who turned in mid air and put into the back of the net. Two more goals from Sean OrsquoNeill and Breen Morgan had us a goal up at half time, but it was his goal that turned things around. Sean OrsquoNeill You would have to say that Sean was the greatest Down footballer of them all. He was named in the GAA Team of the Century which says it all. We played well together, wherever I kicked the ball, Sean was there to get it. He had a wonderful sidestep and took a lot of abuse, but he never retaliated. He went on to become a successful manager and won the Sigerson Cup with Queenrsquos University. Mickey Linden Mickey was a flying machine and one of Downrsquos best ever forwards. He could blow defences away with his pace and score with either foot. He was also very versatile. You could play him anywhere and he would still be a threat. Perhaps his only failing was that he was too nice a player. He rarely made a foul. Won two All-Irelands in  and . Patsy OrsquoHagan Full forward and winner of two All-Irelands in  and . He could have played full forward, full back, or just about anywhere . He was that good. One of his best performances was Wembley Stadium during one of the Wembley Cup tournaments when he scored four goals against Galway.

This would be known as Serious Condition Criteria.While widely welcomed, what was not made clear was Departmental staff have discretion around who meets criteria and can overrule a claimantrsquos medical evidence.A number of enquiries were submitted to the Department under a Freedom of Information request.The responses are concerning.The Department stated legislation does not refer to serious conditions but rather whether there is a relevant change of circumstances. The decision not to reassess those with severe, lelong disabilities or health conditions who are unlikely to ever move into work: ldquoTook effect from  September , but did not result in legislative change.The Department was asked about the right of appealing a decision rejecting a claimant for Serious Conditions Criteria, who responded: ldquoThere is no automatic right of appeal against a determination which is embodied in or necessary to a decision. , a claimant has a right of appeal against an outcome decision rather than a determination, which is merely a component of the outcome decision.This was complicated for non-legally trained or represented claimants, so questions were put around full compliance with the Disability Discrimination and Human Rights.The Department responded stating it: ldquoDoes not hold any information relating to this hellip.may have been undertaken by DWP.A copy of the risk-assessment template used by the Department in instances of considering Serious Condition Criteria, was requested, but: ldquoNo template existsInstead, the response referred to assessment procedures where Departmental Healthcare Professionals advise on the re-referral period, and consider whether a claimantrsquos condition meets: ldquoThe new severe conditions criteria andno further assessments are required.However, the claimantrsquos own medical professionalrsquos opinion around Serious Condition Criteria could be over-ruled, with this decided by: ldquoAn Administrative Officer appointed by the Department.In respect of providing the legislation or guidance which permits the Department to overrule clinical opinion provided by a claimant seeking consideration under the Serious Condition Criteria, the response referred to ESA Regulations , which: ldquoProvides for the redetermination of whether someone has limited capability for work. The time period in relation to this is not set down in the legislation but is largely at the Department Decision Makers discretion ndash usually based on available medical evidence including medical reports from ATOS hellip The decision not to reassess those with severe, lelong disabilities or health conditions who would be unlikely to ever move into work, took effect from  September  but did not result in legislative change.As the Freedom of Information request was answerd prior to the restoration of devolution, the Department was asked with a Minister now in post, to comment on current processes around Serious Condition Criteria decision-making and in particular, how it can by discretion supersede a medical diagnosis by a claimantrsquos clinician. It was also askedprocedures are under review andthere is intention to bring forward legislation to allow for scrutiny or challenge.A spokesperson said: ldquo Anyone claiming ESA will be automatically assessed for the Severe Conditions criteria at their Work Capability Assessment by a Healthcare Professional. If the personrsquos condition or its al effects meet the criteria, the Department will be advised that no further assessments are required.In response to the overruling of clinical decisions, the spokesperson said: ldquoThe Work Capability Assessment looks at the al effects of a personrsquos condition, rather than the diagnosis itself. It is not a supersession of the opinion of their clinician.This dfered to the response provided prior to the Minister taking office, which appeared to show the Department was permitted to over-rule the evidence of claimantrsquos clinician.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Itrsquos a place, not a thing.ldquoWe were making decisions the scientists and medical experts were making decisions at that time and planning was going on. This is the point to judge it now when we have two months more evidence is dangerous and a misleading thing to do.Turning to PPE which has been an issue in Fermanagh, Mr. Lewis used his own constituency of Great Yarmouth as an example of where there has been ldquono problems with accessing equipment.He added: ldquoWersquove had gowns sent over to the UK, OrsquoNeills [sportswear] converted to gowns, there is gin distillery in your part of the world producing sanitisers.ldquoWersquore shting five and a half million pieces of PPE across to Northern Ireland.

I am cautious about predicting what will be in a few weeksrsquo time.He believes the government could ldquoflatten the curve of Covid-people continue to stay at home, adding: ldquoWe want to see past the peak, you donrsquot want to see a downward trend and ease up as all you do is let it shoot back up again.ldquoIf you think back to the beginning there were some quite scary numbers being put about by some experts about what the deaths might be. Now any death is too many and we have sadly lost people, friends and family who have gone through tragic experiences recently, and the figures are nowhere near those numbers we saw at the beginning.ldquoThatrsquos because the public across Northern Ireland and the UK have done a good job generally of following the guidelines which means we can flatten that curve, he said.Mr. Lewis explained that he had personal experience of people close to him who had been diagnosed with Covid-, including his parliamentary private secretary.ldquoSomeone I know lost a member of their family this week, I have a few people in family who had the disease.

No less a person than gardening expert Alan Titchmarsh believes the Government has been unfair to garden centres by deeming them non-essential, forcing them to close during this emergency whilst supermarkets can carry on selling plants and flowers.He said this week that ‘ garden centres were to put in place the same protocols as supermarkets then they who earn their entire living from horticulture should be allowed to’. I rang my regular garden centre for advice and, yes, they were closed but I could place an order by phone or online with them. I couldn’t visit and stroll around to pick what I wanted, but they could deliver a phoned order or I could pick it up so long as I stayed in the car on their driveway and paid by swiping my card. I was happy with that though it deprived me of seeing what promising new plants and garden decorations were available. The colourful ladybirds on my garden shed door are not real, but metal, bought in the garden centre last year. It is this kind of trade that our garden centres will be deprived of and that is hardly fair to them.Without any worries about rain the digging began, the ground being a lot harder than I expected, obviously due to the dry weather. The bags of compost, delivered to my door by the garden centre, were all used up in no time and two days later planting began, watched by my menagerie of pets.Nightly watering was necessary but a great sense of satisfaction set in that despite the tough stance on garden centres people like me were able to progress our gardens.So le was rosy then  Not quite. After a couple of days I noticed my dog wasn’t in great form. In fact he was throwing up over the lawn, though he wasn’t running a temperature. He still wanted to go out for his evening walk so I assumed that he would recover. On the second day of throwing up I was about to ring the vet for an appointment but decided to investigate more closely what he had brought up and it was plain to see that one or other cat had found a new toilet spot amongst the plants and one nosey dog decided it seemed good enough to eat.I suppose there are more important things for the older generation to worry about than protecting their plants from inquisitive cats and dogs. For example, there are calls to remove the triple lock on the state pension – it rises by .pc yearly – which could see the value of the pension fall back while prices rise.The suggestion comes from the think tank Social Market Foundation, which believes the Government ‘should abandon the system to ensure the economy recovery from the coronavirus crisis is fair to working-age households’. It must think, wrongly, that my generation has had it too good.--A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Please try again later.Submitting...Make sure your dog has a comfy bed or den, where they can relax in peace.Give them something fun to occupy them, such as a long-lasting treat or puzzle toy.While your dog is enjoying their treat, take a couple of steps to the other side of the room. If your dog stays where they are, wait a moment, then go back and reward them with an extra treat.Increase the distance you move away and the time you wait before ing with the extra treat. You should soon be able to leave the room and close the door or gate. Progress to spending more time in a dferent room. Build this into the daily routine.It’s important that your dog remains relaxed. If they show signs of distress, leave them for a shorter period, or don’t move as far away, next time.Rachel Casey, Director of Canine Behaviour and Research at Dogs Trust, said: “For many of us it has been great to spend so much time with our dogs during lockdown andmostly our dogs love us being around too. But all this extra attention could potentially create a ticking time bomb of separation anxiety for our dogs. If they expect us to be about all the time, it will be more dficult for them to cope once we go back to our normal lives and aren’t in the house  .“Now is the time to act to avoid future problems – and it’s easy to do. Just make sure that you factor in time apart from your dog each day to help them be able to cope when alone – this could be separated from you by a door or child gate for an hour or two whilst you’re working or home schooling the kids. By organizing your dog’s day, with time apart, play times, exercise, other activity sessionsand quiet times, you can make sure that your dog maintains their ability to cope with the dferent aspects of ‘normal’ le when we get back to it.”For more ideas on how to keep your dog occupied visit www.dogstrust.org.uk--A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Every so often a splinter or chunk falls off. The colour on the planks is faded, cracked and peeling.It was some time ago that my we first suggested I should paint the fence. Two years back, I think. I have been considering the task ever since then, coming to terms with it.When my we occasionally inquires about when the job will be commenced, I patiently state that there are a myriad of factors which need to be in my favour before I can even think about starting such an enterprise. If she persists, I plead that it is too complicated to explain. I don’t like to rush into things.The garden fence stretches into the misty horizon \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...But the current lockdown has concentrated minds and removed distraction. On a crisp morning my we informs me that she and my son are going to start on the fence. My jaw tightens and I feel the burn in my cheeks.‘No, it’s alright, I’ll do it....I was thinking about painting it today anyway.’Half an hour later I’m standing at my back gate with my boy, who is staring at me with curiosity.I have slipped into working man mode, a rare and distinct condition which he has not witnessed often. There are certain tells. I walk about a lot shaking my head and muttering under my breath. I stare dolefully at inanimate objects. I curse a whole generation of earlier tradesmen whose inferior labour I am going to have to correct. I wipe my hands on my trousers while emitting a low growl. I look about for a nail to put in my mouth but cannot locate one.An alarming amount of time is wasted trying to open the tin of paint. My son watches me struggle, and laughs when I boot it in frustration.And then, finally, we are ready. My thought is that my boy can assist me, father and son working together, passing my wisdom and experience down to the next generation, bonding over sweat. We select a plank and begin to paint.Fourteen seconds later he says: ‘Daddy, I’m bored of this, can I go and play now ’I had expected as much. Luckily I have a cultural reference which can assist. I loved reading Tom Sawyer at school, particularly the scene where he tricks his friends into painting his garden fence.I step back, peering admiringly at the newly applied colour.‘That’s ok buddy, it’s just such a shame that you are going to miss all of the fun.’‘What fun daddy ’‘Well, the fun of painting. This is not work, it’s play. After all it’s not everyday that a man gets the chance to paint a fence. Boy oh boy, am I going to have some fun today.’The trap has been set and I can see there is a momentary confusion in his features. I give him a fatherly smile. He looks back.‘Duh daddy!’ he says, before running off.Deflated, I slap some more paint on wood, cursing Mark Twain’s novel for the fancul nonsense that it clearly is. I work on alone, my solitary state causing my thoughts to meander until I fix upon another cultural reference. There is a scene in The Karate Kid film where Mr Miyagi teaches Daniel the hidden secrets of martial arts by getting him to use a certain technique to paint his fence.I try to recreate it now. Long flowing vertical strokes with the brush, mobilising the flexibility of my wrist. Wrist up, wrist down. I can feel a newfound power flowing through my left arm. Wrist up, wrist down.Two minutes later I have to stop because I have developed cramp in my wrist. I switch to my right hand but the cramp appears here even sooner, complemented by the added hindrance of losing the feeling in my fingers. This causes me to drop the brush on my foot. I don’t remember this scene from the movie.Abandoning any hopes of a new career as a full-combat karate champion, I reduce my ambition to just getting some paint onto the fence. The truth, which both Tom Sawyer and Mr Miyagi ignored, is that there is no comfortable way of doing this. I try brushing up and down, side to side, diagonally, in circles. I try painting the outline of squares, and then colouring them in. It makes no dference my arm aches and I can feel my back beginning to seize up.I’m forced to consider alternatives. Just throwing the can of paint at the fence is attractive, but likely to be messy and inefficient. I seriously ponder the prospect of removing my boot, lying on the ground and gripping the brush between my toes, but the woman from across the road is watching out her window and I suspect she already thinks me a little strange. Best not to lower her opinion still further.I plough on stubbornly, becoming more reckless. There is, to be sure, some paint on the wood, but probably more on my clothes, skin and hair. I think,such a thing is possible, that I may have stained the insides of my eyelids. My son rides past on his scooter.‘Are you still having fun daddy ’I scowl and put down the brush and survey what I have achieved. I have painted part of the gate. My property is not large but the totality of the fence seems to stretch off into the misty horizon like the Great Wall of China. I wonderour garden fence can be seen from space.I go back inside.‘Have you finished ’ my we asks hopefully.I chuckle inwardly at the naivety of the query.‘No, no,’ I respond. ‘A job like this has to be done in stages.’‘But you’ve only been at it for less than an hour.’‘I know, but, but...you have to let the paint soak into the wood. Whoever painted it before did a bad job, that’s slowing me down.’She looks at me doubtfully.‘Don’t worry,’ I continue. ‘I’ll do a bit more tomorrow....or maybe the day after.’—— ——A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

In a comment which slipped by without provoking any reaction, she said “social distancing is going to be a feature of our lives it’s going to be a feature of our lives for perhaps up to a couple of yearsnot beyond”.As the two leaders spoke yesterday, the Department of Health confirmed “a further  people have sadly lost their lives to Covid-”.

Please try again later.Submitting...The total fatalities for the UK now stands at , . Globally the figure last night was , . There has been tension recently within the Executive, with Sinn Fein generally favouring a hardline approach to easing restrictions, and the DUP more inclined to allow some limited leeway – with the cemeteries a stark example of the ision.The Moderator of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland, Dr William Henry, last night described the reopening of cemeteries as “a sensible and compassionate response to an important pastoral and human need”.UUP leader Steve Aiken called it “a humanitarian act”.Jim Allister, TUV leader, declared: “The dys of the Executive delayed this for at least a week, causing needless hurt to many grieving families. Those behind the delay owe such families not just an explanation but an apology.”The public desire for reopening graveyards was gruesomely illustrated during the week when DUP MP Jeffrey Donaldson announced a pensioner had impaled himself on railings while trying to climb over them to visit his we’s grave.Arlene Foster said: “We’ve agreed to support the health minister in lting the restrictions on access to graveyards. This is about balancing public health concerns with the basic human need for people to visit their loved ones’ grave.”But she added: “Please do remain at home as much as possible. We’re not out of the woods.”On Tuesday Declan Kearneyhad told MLAs on the floor of the Assembly: “I and Executive colleagues understand how extremely dficult it is that members of our families, inidual friends, and our community are being denied the solace that moments of reflection at gravesides and places of worship can provide, but that is the price that we must pay because the coronavirus pandemic is an emergency.”At yesterday’s news conference, Michelle O’Neill was quizzed on how Sinn Fein “got this so badly wrong”.She responded: “I always said we’d keep these things under review, and we listened very carefully to what people had to say. And you have to get that fine balance between protecting people’s lives and also then listening to people whenever they’ve expressed concern.“So I’m glad the Executive has found a way forward... That’s us listening to people at this moment in time, that’s us understanding the angst that was there, that’s us not wanting to exasperate [sic] anyone’s mental health or families that are grieving right now.“But our number one priority right now is about dealing with the fact we’re still in the mist [sic] of the pandemic.”Asked about north-south co-operation on combating coronavirus, Ms O’Neill indicated that on this side of the Irish Sea “the numbers speak for themselves, insofar as our death rate here has been  to % less than what’s sadly been experienced in Britain”.She added that “we are an island and we have to use that to our advantage”.In the Republic, as of yesterday there had been  deaths.However, Mrs Foster said that comparing death figures in the Republic with Northern Ireland “is a little bit more nuanced than perhaps some people have presented”, because of “dferent data systems” and dferent reporting times for deaths.We need to share information [with the Republic]” she said. “But it’s also true to say we’ve greatly benefitted from being part of the UK as well.”When it comes to why Northern Ireland’s death rate is relatively low compared with Great Britain, she said “population density has a big impact on this”.For example, she said London has population density of nearly , people per square kilometre, against just  per sq km for Northern Ireland.A number of councils got in touch last night to say when they will re-open cemeteries some said Saturday, others Sunday.

Irsquove grown up on the beach.ldquoI normally take landscape pictures because I love the water and some of the sunsets here are incredible, especially in the winter.Rochelle wrote her Instagram handle on the parcels, so that people who found them could send her a message.ldquoIt was just to make someone smile, and Irsquove had some lovely comments from people who got back to me on Instagram, she said.ldquoThey said they were going to put it up in their room and frame it.ldquoSome people were feeling a bit down and didnrsquot expect to find anything, so it cheered them up.ldquoMy job was done ndash the main purpose was to make people smile and it did - it made me smile too.ldquoI think itrsquos very important to say hello, especiallypeople are living by themselves orthey havenrsquot got their family around.ldquoWhen Irsquom normally walking the dog I say hello and have a chat, but itrsquos quite hard to do that now because everyone is quite wary.ldquoI donrsquot have to have that physical contact with someone to brighten up their day.ldquoArt is just a dferent  to communicate with. You knowsomeonersquos a bit shy and they donrsquot want to speak using words, they may want to draw a picture and open up that way instead.ldquoI think art can show feelings that words canrsquot quite express, so itrsquos a great idea to share that with the community.At a time of uncertainty and doubt, Rochelle ended with a message of hope and solidarity:ldquoI think as a community we could do so much more at this time, she saidldquoEveryone is concerned about how long it is going to last, but I am hopeful we can get past it, andwe all work together and remain positive we may come out of this in an even better situation than we was before.Rochelle would like to make clear that all parcels were fully sanitised.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

If your dog stays where they are, wait a moment, then go back and reward them with an extra treat.Increase the distance you move away and the time you wait before ing with the extra treat. You should soon be able to leave the room and close the door or gate. Progress to spending more time in a dferent room. Build this into the daily routine.It’s important that your dog remains relaxed. If they show signs of distress, leave them for a shorter period, or don’t move as far away, next time.Rachel Casey, Director of Canine Behaviour and Research at Dogs Trust, said: “For many of us it has been great to spend so much time with our dogs during lockdown andmostly our dogs love us being around too. But all this extra attention could potentially create a ticking time bomb of separation anxiety for our dogs. If they expect us to be about all the time, it will be more dficult for them to cope once we go back to our normal lives and aren’t in the house  .“Now is the time to act to avoid future problems – and it’s easy to do. Just make sure that you factor in time apart from your dog each day to help them be able to cope when alone – this could be separated from you by a door or child gate for an hour or two whilst you’re working or home schooling the kids. By organizing your dog’s day, with time apart, play times, exercise, other activity sessionsand quiet times, you can make sure that your dog maintains their ability to cope with the dferent aspects of ‘normal’ le when we get back to it.”For more ideas on how to keep your dog occupied visit www.dogstrust.org.uk--A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

INPT-. : -TONY HENDRONNNLocal MLA Jonny Buckley said: “I’m relieved that the Northern Ireland Executive have now come to the collective decision of reopening our cemeteries in a controlled manner.“This has been an extremely sensitive issue for grieving families and I am glad that Executive Ministers have reconsidered their stance.“Please keep safe whilst visiting the cemetery and adhere to social distancing rules.”Local MP Carla Lockhart said: “I know this has been heartbreaking for many families who have lost a loved one. Please await Council guidance on opening times and guidance on regulations.”Councillor Paul Berry said: “Let’s think of all those people who had loved ones die due to COVID and other health related illnesses but who couldn’t visit their loved ones grave . A very tough time for many many people.”SDLP Upper Bann said they were awaiting further details of opening hours and how it can be managed with social distancing but added: “For many people this visit is very important to them as part of their grieving process and something which they did on a daily basis prior to the pandemic.“The lockdown has robbed them of that special moment in the day where they go to visit the resting place of their loved ones.”Cemeteries were closed when social distancing measures were introduced towards the end of March .The NI Executive met on Friday afternoon and agreed that cemeteries throughout Northern Ireland could reopen.“This is about balancing public health concerns with the basic human need for people to visit their loved ones,” said First Minister Foster.Mrs Foster stressed it remains vitally important that the public remember they must continue to adhere to social distancing guidelines and wash their hands.Sinn Fein and the Alliance Party had previously supported the decision to close cemeteries across Northern Ireland.However, deputy First Minister and Sinn Fein vice-president, Michelle O’Neill, said the decision to re-open cemeteries came about because they had “listened carefully to the genuine distress of families who have not been able to visit the grave of a loved one”.“I understand that there’s a fine balance and making sure that people do not face additional burden in terms of their mental health and well-being and also our role in making sure that people are not put at further risk from the transmission of coronavirus,” she said.“So the opening of graveyards would only be permitted where there are those in charge of burial grounds that can ensure that we have compliance with the regulations and appropriate social distancing.“We continue to keep these issues under review,” she said.\"\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleMore from Portadown TimesAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bYSBpT sc-elJkPf kHpvMx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisCoronavirusSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us    "},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1587656147249.jpg--marts_to_reopen_gradually.jpg?158765614700","title":"marts to reopen gradually ","story":"THE Department for Agriculture, Environment and Ruralaffairs has welcomed the decision by the Northern Ireland Livestock and Auctioneers’ Associationto open Livestock Marts on a gradual basis from Monday,  April.Livestock Marts closed voluntarily on  March - including Rathfriland Co-Op and Hilltown Saleyard - in response to Covid- health and safety concerns. Recently mart operators trialled a number of successful online sales to enable livestock trading to continue and are now gradually moving towards re-opening on a phased basis from next Monday, with some restrictions in place.In welcoming the decision, a spokesman said: “Farmers are key workers and are continuing to provide food for us all in very challenging circumstances. Part of that food supply chain is the ability to trade and sell animals.“Staff within the Department have maintained regular contact with Livestock Mart operators over recent weeks and have been reassured that robust operational protocols, developed by the Marts in conjunction with other stakeholders, will enable them to conduct business in a manner that is safe for staff, farmers and buyers and adheres to social distancing requirements.“DAERA therefore welcomes the decision to recommence sales of primestock, cull animals and store stock on a gradual basis from week commencing  April.  addthis, Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_bfdbbbcbbe   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_ccbfbbbeaadabccb   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]  []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
