[{"url":null,"title":"Jennifer Lawrences fiance Cooke Maroney quiet popular girls high school","story":"    Jennifer Lawrence\u0027s fiancé Cooke Maroney was a \u0027quiet yet popular guy\u0027 who dreamed about owning a Bentley, former classmates have revealed          Gail Burkholder, a fellow 2002 graduate and now upholstery store owner, told DailyMailTV: \u0027I\u0027m not really surprised Cooke ended up with a celebrity. At school, he was a quiet yet popular guy who was friends with lots of girls.\u0027 The art gallery director was voted best dressed in high school  But long before he began dating the Hollywood star, Maroney was a \u0027sensitive jock\u0027 who shunned the limelight - but was popular with the girls at Middlebury Union High School in Vermont          The 34-year-old art gallery director, who began dating the Oscar-winning actress last June, was revealed to have popped the question after the pair were spotted celebrating in New York City earlier this month\u0027He is someone you can be yourself with. He\u0027ll spend a lot of time with you but won\u0027t talk s**t about you behind your back to other people.\u0027He was never a big fan of being the center of attention. He\u0027ll definitely do well with a big time actress and support her from the background.\u0027And for a big-deal New York City art dealer and gallery director, Maroney actually has an unusual background.He grew up on a 700-acre farm in Leicester, Vermont, a one-store town outside Middlebury known for its 25ft concrete roadside gorilla named Queen Connie holding a VW Beetle high above its head.While he was born in Manhattan, Cooke\u0027s art dealer dad James and mom Suki wanted to taste some of America\u0027s off-the-grid living and moved north in 1986.They bought a giant windy hilltop property dubbed Oliver Hill Farm. The city slickers, said a neighbor, had no experience raising and maintaining animals but made a go at organic dairy farming with more than 250 heads of cattle.When they received the keys to their new kingdom, the neighbor added, they went through a three-year process to obtain organic farming certification, only the third in Vermont at the time.\u0027When they got here, everybody was rolling their eyes,\u0027 said neighbor Rodney Jerome, 72, who rents his 73-acre farm from the Maroneys.           According to the yearbooks leading to his graduation in June 2002, he wasn\u0027t a member of the Honors Society or a part of school plays, band, the Scholar Bowl or any non-sports activities          Cooke Maroney, far left, is seen in his 2001 High School yearbook from his junior year at Middlebury Union High School in Middlebury, Vermont. He was serving as a \u0027Junior Escort\u0027\u0027People thought \u0027who are these guys who are doing new things?\u0027 In no time, however, they won us guys over. They\u0027ve been very good to me. They\u0027re a great family.\u0027But the size of the undertaking eventually  caught up with the family.On one frigid night in February 1994, when Cooke was nine years old and his sister Annabelle just three, tragedy struck the budding farming operation. A fire,  likely started up by sparks in a utility closet, took out the farm\u0027s main barn.\u0027It lit up the area like it was daylight,\u0027 Jerome recalls. \u0027The barn was probably 200ft long and all in wood. There were more than 100 cows in there. It was some kind of a spark that started the fire, and before you know it, the whole thing was engulfed.\u0027Neighbors who saw the fire before the Maroneys, who were sleeping, rushed to the scene and managed to get most of the cows out, except for a few calves.Still, the milking business was finished. The Maroneys sold the surviving heifers and switched to renting their land out to area farmers either for grazing or making feed and hays.Over the past five years, they also started a $150-a-night down-home country bed-and-breakfast at their white wooden home while James maintained his art dealing gig.          He grew up on a 700-acre farm (pictured) in Leicester, Vermont, a one-store town outside Middlebury known for its 25ft concrete roadside gorilla named Queen Connie that\u0027s holding a VW Beetle high above its head          Long before he began dating the Hollywood star, Maroney was a \u0027sensitive jock\u0027 who shunned the limelight - but was popular with the girls at Middlebury Union High School in Vermont          The  town outside Middlebury known for its 25ft concrete roadside gorilla named Queen Connie holding a VW Beetle high above its head\u0027The good thing is after they got here, everybody started doing organic,\u0027 Jerome said. \u0027But in this area, neighbors are far from one another so we stay out of everybody\u0027s business. I think the daughter comes home more often than Cooke. I haven\u0027t seen him in three or four years.\u0027When asked if he knew of Cooke\u0027s celebrity fiancee, Jerome replied:  \u0027Sorta. Is that who Cooke\u0027s with?\u0027 In Middlebury, where Cooke was bussed daily to attend school and play Tigers hockey, he didn\u0027t appear to be overly active.According to the yearbooks leading to his graduation in June 2002, he wasn\u0027t a member of the Honors Society or a part of school plays, the band, the Scholar Bowl or any non-sports activities.\u0027He did play hockey and maybe even lacrosse,\u0027 said business owner Burkholder. \u0027He was sorta a sensitive jock.\u0027And he did okay academically, even in French.          Burkholder added: \u0027He was never a big fan of being the center of attention. He\u0027ll definitely do well with a big time actress and support her from the background\u0027\u0027That\u0027s because he scrambled to copy my French notebook at the last minute before class,\u0027 said Burkholder. \u0027I let him, though.

The musical remake of her 1980s film that she leaves behind is proficient, but soulless. The set blinks like a pinball machine, it churns out good smutty puns, but it’s oh so thin on plot, monotone on performance and even the newly penned songs by Dolly are blandly forgettable.Two Parton classics appear though, one warning us ‘too much make-up, too much hair, don’t be fooled by thinkin’ that the goods are not all there’.Reader, the goods are not all there.Its attempt at a message is ‘#MeToo the musical’ but with bottom slapping. The central trio of secretaries (originally Parton, Lily Tomlin and Jane Fonda on screen) start the fight within their firm for equal rights and recognition.Worthy causes, but they’re quickly forgotten as cleavages are ogled, unattractive women are balked at, secretary Bonnie Langford kicks her height in suspenders and boss Brian Conley is dangled from the ceiling in a gimp suit.          Dolly Parton joins cast members Natalie McQueen as Doralee Rhodes, Caroline Sheen as Violet Newstead, Amber Davies as Judy Bernly, Bonnie Langford as Roz Keith and Brian Conley as Franklin Hart Junior on stage during the curtain callIt unconvincingly tries to have it both ways, like Bernard Manning giving a serious lecture on the virtues of feminism.But the crowd lapped it up, except the elderly gentleman sitting in a box who tutted like a woodpecker when drugs made an appearance.Our secretary trio is Caroline Sheen, Natalie McQueen and Amber Davies. Davies is far better than her Love Island career start would have you expect, Sheen is solid West End standard, but McQueen as Doralee (unmistakably the rootin’-tootin’ Dolly Parton role) is the closest thing to stardust with fine Tennessee-twang vocal cords and a Barbara Windsor slapstick quality.

Mrs Overall meets Moulin Rouge.But on the whole, it’s as limp as February panto. Energetic but lightweight.

A hard Brexit would be a particular blow to us, but not life threatening. While it may put pressure on future decisions, we are fully committed to the UK.\u0027Our Brexit planning is in place.

But we have a safety valve just in case.\u0027           Mr Hallmark was speaking to the MailOnline in Marbella, SpainThis includes: :: quadrupling the amount of stock it holds (soon to rise to five-fold) to prevent being hit by shortages of key parts :: shipping cars and parts via Immingham instead of Dover :: remaining flexible over potential shut-down periods. There are no plans yet to extend the planned Easter holiday shut-down, but Friday working could be curtailed if necessary to give some flex. Mr Hallmark said Brexit was only one of a number of factors currently affecting the wider motor industry and forcing uncomfortable change. Others include the demise of diesel, the drive towards electrification, and sales slowdowns in China and the USA. He said that as a luxury manufacturer Bentley was better placed than most volume car producers where tariffs bite harder because trade is more price sensitive. If a \u0027hard Brexit\u0027 meant tariffs of around 10 per cent were imposed, Bentley would take a decision whether to add them onto the price or to absorb them, hitting profits. Mr Hallmark said: \u0027A hard Brexit could lead to a lift in prices in Europe, or we could live with them ourselves by taking the hit and reducing our base price accordingly to compensate for the extra tariff. That\u0027s harder for volume manufacturers.\u0027 He stressed: \u0027When times get tough, those who are weakest struggle most \u0027Brexit hasn\u0027t happened yet. I don\u0027t think anyone can blame current performance on Brexit. There\u0027s the diesel issue, for example. That\u0027s nothing to do with Brexit.\u0027          Mr Hallmark, who this week celebrates his first full year at the helm said: \u0027All our Brexit planning is in place. We have been here for 100 years and we will be here for the next 100 years.\u0027Mr Hallmark said only 20 per cent of Bentley\u0027s sales are to Continental Europe so it has a more balanced spread of sales. Some 21 per cent is to the USA, 19 per cent to China, 14 per cent remains in the UK and the remaining 16 per cent is exported to the result of the world. \u0027The outlook for luxury cars is still positive,\u0027 he added.Volkswagen Group has given Bentley two years to drive back to profitability. Members of the powerful Porsche family dynasty which dominate VW shareholdings have given the firm the deadline after it made losses of £122million in the first nine months of 2018 compared to £27.5m profit in 2017.                                                       Honda\u0027s decision to shut down its Swindon plant shows the whole car industry has stalled, writes RUTH SUTHERLAND - and No Deal fears aren\u0027t helpingBy RUTH SUTHERLAND FOR THE DAILY MAIL Honda\u0027s decision to shut down its plant in Swindon after 30 years as a major local employer may not be directly motivated by Brexit but by wider problems in global car manufacturing.However, yesterday\u0027s move by the Japanese carmaker could hardly have come at a worse time.No one in the industry doubts that uncertainty over Brexit is having a chilling effect on production. Fears surrounding our departure helped to halve fresh investment in the sector last year, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders.            Nissan has also scaled back UK production by cancelling construction of its new X-Trail SUV at its Sunderland factoryOverseas investors such as Honda have, in the past three decades, rebuilt the British car industry after it was driven to the brink of annihilation in the 1970s by rabid trade union activity. Now they are in flight.Nissan is cancelling plans to build its new X-Trail SUV at its Sunderland factory. US giant Ford, which employs 13,000 workers in Britain, describes the potential consequences of No Deal as \u0027catastrophic\u0027, while the boss of Jaguar Land Rover, which is cutting UK jobs, has issued a string of dire warnings.Brexiteers will, of course, accuse these firms of crying wolf. Maybe – but that doesn\u0027t mean there are no wolves out there. And it is a tragedy that the very companies which helped to bring about a remarkable renaissance in the British car industry have become the collateral damage in the chaos of our impending departure from the EU.            Jaguar Land Rover, which is cutting UK jobs, has also issued warnings about a no deal BrexitIt is yet one more problem to contend with in a troubled industry that faces plummeting demand for diesel cars, a slump in the vast Chinese market, and fears that Donald Trump may impose punishing tariffs on vehicles imported into the US.In Germany, a country synonymous with the production of sleek, super-reliable driving machines sold worldwide, the decline in the auto industry is actually stalling the economy.The industry is also dealing with the lifestyle choices of the Uber generation: city-dwelling, environmentally-conscious young people who are less fixated on car ownership than their parents were.So a state of emergency would prevail even without Brexit, and the threat of No Deal makes us an even less attractive place to invest in troubled times.Workers blame Brexit for demise of Honda\u0027s Swindon plant | Business | The Guardian"},{"url":null,"title":"Vatican reveals secret rules priests father children","story":"      A Vatican spokesperson confirmed this week that there are rules in place for priests who father children\u0027I can confirm that these guidelines exist,\u0027 Vatican spokesman Alessandro Gisotti told the New York Times. \u0027It is an internal document.\u0027  Gisotti added that the fundamental principle of the internal guidelines was the \u0027protection of the child.\u0027  He claims that under the secret rules, a priest who fathered children was requested to leave the priesthood and \u0027assume his responsibilities as a parent by devoting himself exclusively to the child.\u0027 Survivors of abuse by Catholic priests descend on the...From $4 visas to 40,000 tourists and a population of 23 who...Share this articleBut Monsignor Andrea Ripa, under-secretary in the Congregation for the Clergy at the Vatican, told the paper the guidelines were more of a formality than an order.   As part of their vows Catholic priests are required to maintain a life of celibacy, refraining from any form of sexual activity.A growing tide of sexual abuse scandals involving priests around the world has shown these vows are often broken, although there are many examples of consensual sex by ministers.           It comes as the Church is surrounded by sexual abuse scandals involving its priests around the worldA litany of child sexual abuse scandals has rocked the Catholic church, which has 1.3 billion followers around the world.In December the pontiff had vowed the church would never again treat abuse allegations without \u0027seriousness and promptness\u0027, calling on abusers to hand themselves in to police.The Argentine has struggled to resolve the problem as the steady drip of scandal corrodes the church\u0027s authority amid sharp isions in Rome over how to handle the fallout, and an apparently endless stream of bad news.Over the past four months, Roman Catholic dioceses across the U.S. have released the names of more than 1,000 priests and others accused of sexually abusing children in an unprecedented public reckoning spurred at least in part by a shocking grand jury investigation in Pennsylvania.Vatican’s Secret Rules for Catholic Priests Who Have Children - The New York Times"},{"url":null,"title":"Last posts English backpacker 20 disappeared friend parking rental car","story":"    The  final posts of an English backpacker who disappeared with his friend while exploring Australia\u0027s east coast showed the two embarking on the trip of a lifetime          Well-wishers have been leaving messages of support for the pair in the comments section of their pictures, despite police fears they may have drownedProperty belonging to the men was found at the beach by morning walkers at about 6.30am on Monday, but the two tourists have not been found.By the time the search ended for the night on Tuesday, authorities had grown increasingly worried the duo, who are believed to have been swimming, may have drowned. Lifesavers and police have both spoken of how rough the surf had been at the beach. Mr Palmer\u0027s Instagram profile shows the two friends enjoying their adventure through Sydney last month, having set off on their journey across the world in November.  Since news of the disappearance spread, well-wishers have begun flooding the comments section on the pictures with messages of support. Man, 67, pulled from the water of a popular Sydney beach in...Pictured: Surfer, 42, bitten by a shark after he \u0027landed on...Share this article\u0027I hope you guys are OK,\u0027 the post read.\u0027I hope God is with you in your hearts protecting you and loving you.

Forces loyal to Italy\u0027s hardline Interior Minister Matteo Salvini and far-right French politician Marine Le Pen (pictured) will make gains, according to an analysis of national opinion polls put together by the parliamentAnd, with the Socialists and Democrats as the second force, the traditional parties of the centre will remain the largest in the new parliament.The survey forecast that the EPP will lose 34 seats and the Socialists 51 seats but retain 183 seats and 135 seats respectively.The new parliament will have 705 seats, down from the current 751 because of Britain\u0027s scheduled exit from the 28-nation bloc.The liberal group ALDE will move from fourth to third place with a projected 75 seats, compared to 68 today.ALDE will displace the European Conservatives and Reformist (ECR) Group, which will see its share decline from 75 to 51 seats, with the departure of Britain\u0027s pro-Brexit Conservatives. Poland\u0027s eurosceptic Law and Justice (PiS) Party also belongs to the ECR. The liberal group could even - according to the survey - increase its representation to 93 seats if it is joined, whether formally or in an alliance, by French President Emmanuel Macron\u0027s Republic on the Move (LREM) party.LREM\u0027s expected gains will however come at the expense of established centrist parties, not Pen\u0027s National Rally (NR), which the poll average shows will strengthen its position and win 21 seats.The NR belongs to the Europe of Nations and Freedom (ENF) group, which could rise from 37 to 59 seats with help from Salvini\u0027s League, which is sceptical of Brussels but not outright opposed to Italy\u0027s EU membership.The League, which counts only six seats in the current parliament, are projected to win 27.Overall, eurosceptic and populist forces will represent more than a fifth of the new parliament if the ENF and ECR results are added to those of the EFD, which includes the League\u0027s coalition partner, the Five Star Movement.But these gains are comparable to their current representation.\u0027Contrary to what some have said, the extremes, the nationalists and the populists are far from attaining a majority,\u0027 analyst Christine Verger told AFP.\u0027Even if they increase a little in numbers, this will not fundamentally shake up the internal balance,\u0027 said the analyst from the Jacques Delors Institute.Gains by such groups in smaller EU countries have had little impact at the European level, she added.Corinna Horst of the German Marshall Fund think tank said she would not put \u0027too much weight\u0027 on polling results, especially this early.The issue, Horst said, is less about populist gains than about the fragmentation of the European Parliament and EU Council summits gathering leaders of the member countries.\u0027The bigger question is how the EU will govern amidst this fragmentation,\u0027 Horst said in an email to AFP.In one example, the EU is split over how to share responsibility for asylum seekers, which has fuelled the rise of populist parties in Italy and other countries.The EU remains deadlocked even though migrant arrivals have fallen sharply since a 2015 peak.   "},{"url":null,"title":"Cheeky girl yanks hairdresser aunts pants Nottinghamshire salon","story":"A side-splitting video shows the moment a little girl pulls down her hairdresser aunt\u0027s pants, in Retford, NottinghamshireApparently clueless of the embarrassment that is to follow, her aunt encourages her niece by saying, \u0027yeah, pull my back.\u0027 But Amie then tries to turn away as her mischievous niece grabs the waistband of her pyjamas and yanks them down, along with her underwear.The little girl then falls to the floor and giggles uncontrollably as Amie tries to regain her modesty.   As Lucy Cutts films her sister Amie working in her home, her daughter rubs her Aunt\u0027s back before grabbing the waistband of her pyjamas and pulling them down.

Abramović’s much vaunted show is tedious and tritePeople are standing around with hi-tech devices strapped to their heads. I am one of them. Through the lenses that protrude from my face, I can see how daft my fellow audience members look. We’re like a bunch of drunks playing that game where you have a word stuck to your forehead. This is Mixed Reality, which lets you see a virtual image within a real physical space. In the middle of the gallery stands the world-famous performance artist Marina Abramović, wearing a bright red dress with her dark hair tied back. She paces a bit. She holds out an arm and stares at it as if mystified. Then she dissolves in a cloud of blue dots.Abramović, you see, is present only in digital form. She has been filmed by 36 cameras to create a mobile simulation of herself. This virtual animated sculpture seems to walk on the actual floor of the gallery. At times she vanishes, leaving just her shadow to move around the room, creeping towards audience members.And that’s about it. At the press view, Abramović (the real one) explained how difficult Mixed Reality had been to make, how this 19-minute artwork had been forged at the whitehot edge of new technology. The most generous thing to say is that her passion for experiment has led her to use tech that isn’t yet capable of serious art – that this is a modest essay in what may work for artists one day.Yet nothing here suggests modesty. The Life is presented as a wonder, a redemptive encounter. Before entering and being fitted with a headset by a white-coated attendant, you have to surrender “all your belongings”. Why all? It can’t be for security or safety. On the contrary, it is a step in a ritual: like a pilgrim who wishes to enter the inner sanctum, you must be prepared, cleansed, purged. Only then may you enter the Electric Presence.Abramović had a great-uncle who was patriarch of the Serbian Orthodox church and her performance art has always been quasi-religious. Throwing herself into a flaming star, losing consciousness, being potentially assaulted by her audience – the extreme performances that made her name in the 1970s were Joan of Arc-like martyrdoms.The Life, too, is a sacral rite. As we stand about in our headsets, we seem to experience a spiritual vision. This is not the fleshly Abramović. It is her angelic, resurrected self. That’s why she is able to vanish and reappear, step in and out of our reality. She’s like the risen Christ, or Gandalf the White, or Tupac when he came back as a hologram.The Tupac analogy is best, because this is celebrity art at its most empty, a piece of nonsense that takes the gallery into bathetic realms of pop-culture kitsch. The only reason to be thrilled by this digital Abramović is that you adore the real Abramović as a star. The work itself is too slight to hold the attention. I naively deduced from the title that Abramović‘s immaterial presence would tell her life story, that we’d get a confessional encounter of some kind. Yet she does not speak or engage in any way with the audience.Everything Abramović is loved for is lacking. She is renowned for relating to her audience directly and uneasily, looking them in the eye. With her digital version, looking at her own hands is about as intense as it gets. Nor is there any sense of danger. Nothing is going to happen to the simulacrum Abramović, nor is anyone in the audience going to be challenged.I’ve only experienced events this vacuous at really bad concerts, when you’re miles from a band watching them on screen as they perform mechanical versions of their hits. I kept watching it over again, waiting for some emotional or intellectual depth to materialise. Instead, the optical illusion got less and less convincing and the headset heavier. My eyes began to ache as Abramović’s dress melted in red blotches. There is no intimacy or human presence. This is a robotic perversion of performance art."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8711b5dfba9bf5728562179ed0d0de0d9448c1fc/513_579_4518_2711/master/4518.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2599c4df8bddd395f25f014e5be0093c","title":"honda decision britain swindon brexit","story":"There is a sense that while the Swindon plant’s days were numbered, Brexit tipped the balanceHonda claims Brexit had nothing to do with the decision to shutter its Swindon plant, but almost nobody seems to be buying it.The consensus among industry pundits is that it suits Honda to avoid dipping its toe into the toxic pool of Brexit.Even the business minister, Greg Clark, appeared to detect a whiff of Brexit in the decision, saying during the fallout that manufacturers’ no-deal warnings were not “project fear” but “project reality”.Honda and the wider automotive sector have been vocal in their dismay at the government’s endless shilly-shallying, making it harder to believe the company when it plays Brexit down. Failure to rule out a no-deal exit leaves carmakers facing nightmarish levels of disruption to the crucial just-in-time manufacturing processes that make them tick.But there are myriad other reasons for Honda to scale back its UK operations and – even more concerningly – for rivals to follow suit.The backdrop is a global carmaking capacity glut that means some production lines will have to grind to a halt if the supply-and-demand equation is to be balanced.Another factor is the slump in diesel sales after the dieselgate scandal, a factor which has rendered Jaguar Land Rover’s Castle Bromwich plant vulnerable.As well as 147,000 Civics a year, Honda makes diesel engines at Swindon for export to a market in precipitous decline. At the same time, even as sales fall, automotive companies must invest their dwindling incomes in electric vehicles to ensure they are ready for the technological leap forward.Honda in particular has some catching up to do on that front. In its Brexit-free statement, it said its money would be better spent closer to major markets such as China, the US and its home in Japan.In the case of both Honda and Toyota, which is due to decide on the future of its plant in Burnaston, Derbyshire, next year, the recent free trade deal between Japan and the EU also plays its part. The agreement will reduce tariffs on cars shipped from Japan to the EU to zero by 2027, ending a key benefit for Japanese manufacturers to maintain a European outpost.There is still a sense, though, that while the writing was already on the wall for Swindon, Brexit underlined it, either hastening Honda’s decision or tipping the balance.Japanese carmakers came to the UK in the 1980s at the invitation of Margaret Thatcher, who sold the UK as the perfect place to invest billions in return for a launchpad into the single market.Those familiar with Japanese business say investors would be loth to break such a compact. But their patience is not infinite and warnings from Japan have been growing louder, to no apparent avail.The UK’s failure to get its house in order means it has simply not held up its end of the bargain, absolving investors – from Japan and potentially elsewhere – of theirs.Honda may be polite enough not to say it but the ebbing away of confidence in Britain as a place to invest should be of grave concern, not just in the automotive sector but far beyond."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2ead1d6402c2c9a2f09172b58fdcb7e44dce780a/0_291_4368_2621/master/4368.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2310d79c97a4ee229f98f394324b22bd","title":"did you work for a uk high street chain that has closed","story":"For an upcoming project, we would like to hear from former workers of chain shops that shut about how it affected their livesWith thousands of high street shops closing over the last decade, communities have been rightly concerned about the decline and what the future holds.If you worked for a high street chain that shut down, we’d like to hear from you.

He is unable to walk, although at regular intervals he is able to throw up some of the bottle of rum he has just drunk.The St John Ambulance team here in Newcastle see dozens of these men and women every night: a head laceration on a rough sleeper, a student who thinks she broke a tooth when a friend accidentally closed a door on her, a German couple concerned about a man tottering precariously close to the edge of the High Level Bridge.The common denominator? Alcohol, and in due course the patients are walked 20 yards to a second van nearby that has been converted to take eight seats, and has sick bowls and wet wipes. Under the supervision of two police officers the patients are given time to sober up, charge their phones, contact friends or family, and get taxis home.One of the officers has worked the city centre beat for 16 years. “Babysitting drunk kids didn’t used to be our job,” he says. “But the focus these days is on people’s safety.”Some surveys suggest a recent trend towards more moderate drinking among younger people, but on tonight’s evidence, there are still plenty who enjoy a drink. The crew will assess and treat more than 50 people by sunrise.“There are drinkers who know they’ve had enough, those who don’t, and those who do but carry on,” says Daryen Lemmon, clinical operations manager of the North East Ambulance Service, which runs the Safe Haven in partnership with St John and the Northumbria police and crime commissioner.“They’re the dangerous ones, and the challenge is to make them understand that they are vulnerable.”The Safe Haven is designed to help tackle that challenge, relieving pressure on Newcastle’s stretched police and hospital resources. Five years ago, before it was introduced, A\u0026ampE waiting rooms and police station receptions were stuffed on weekend nights. Similar safe havens are in operation in Bristol and Cardiff. In December, NHS England made £300,000 available for other cities to set up similar facilities over the festive period.But along the so-called Diamond Strip of Newcastle nightclubs, there is still plenty to keep police patrol cars, ambulances and street pastors busy as they rub shoulders with pushy promoters promising three trebles – three triple-shots of spirits, such as vodka or rum, with a mixer like Red Bull or orange – for little more than a fiver.Post-industrial cities such as Newcastle, Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester and Nottingham dominate the latest Which? University rankings of best cities for nightlife. They have some of the highest densities of pubs and bars per sq km, and the most recent Public Health England figures suggest those densities are increasing every year – and much faster than the national average.Serving a regional population of around 2 million, Newcastle’s compact city centre offers a rowdy but representative sample on a Saturday night: all ages, men and women, but skewed heavily in favour of the 50,000 students who study here. These younger revellers seek entry between the red velvet ropes erected by pre-bars and clubs with exotic names like Tup Tup Palace, Florita’s and Bijoux. A more affluent set of locals head for the gin bars and microbreweries of Grey Street and High Bridge. Older drinkers settle in for the night in the traditional pubs of the Bigg Market.These pubs, bars and nightclubs are the engine of the night-time economy, on which Britain’s struggling post-industrial cities and towns are becoming ever more dependent. In many ways it is itself a hangover from the past: the great industrial cities of 19th-century Britain were saturated with beer houses, gin palaces and pubs, and in Newcastle drinking patterns formed around the working lives of shipbuilders and coal miners who finished their last shifts at 1pm on a Saturday, then went to the pub and drank away their wages until closing time.Now, with heavy industry gone, these cities are left with their reputation as party towns. Newcastle city council estimates its night-time economy accounts for 7,000 jobs, £500m of revenue and 17 million visitors a year – more than a few of them on stag or hen parties. “As proud Geordies, we sure know how to party in style,” boasts the local bar crawl organiser Last Night of Freedom. “If you’re visiting the city and you’re looking for a canny night out – slap on your false tan, prepare to tash on and get propa mortal.”Protecting this reputation comes at a high price. You hardly need a Lancet subscription to know the links between alcohol and a slew of health and social problems: heart disease, liver disease, brain damage, cancer, mental health problems, accidents, injuries, assaults, domestic violence and sexual offences, to name a few.The alcohol-related mortality rate in Newcastle has risen in the last five years from 48 to 61 per 100,000 people. The English average is 46. Rachael Hope, the city’s community safety specialist for drugs and alcohol, says she knows of 4,066 dependent drinkers in Newcastle, including 180 she describes as having multiple issues of substance abuse or mental health. “They’re the ‘frequent flyers’ who come in and out of various different services,” she says, “but you don’t necessarily see alcohol problems present themselves in the same way as you would see a drug issue – until possibly it’s too late.”Newcastle has done more than most to constrain what economists would call these “externalities”: side effects of a product that have a negative impact on society as a whole but aren’t reflected in its price.Now keen to shed the image it gained as a stag and hen party destination of alcoholic excess – amplified to the world through the MTV reality show Geordie Shore – the city introduced a new licensing strategy last year that seeks to prove its night-time economy is about more than just alcohol. In neighbourhoods with the most licensed premises, the council is encouraging operators to move towards a more mixed offer: more restaurants, more bars with seating, more family-oriented attractions.Bars along the city’s Georgian Grey Street have accepted a voluntary minimum unit pricing of 50p. Newcastle is one of just eight cities and local authorities to introduce a late-night levy: 243 licensed premises pay into a fund that pays for the extra policing, taxi marshals and after-hours cleaning incurred by the night-time economy.On the top floor of the Newcastle Civic Centre, a half-hour walk from the Diamond Strip, Ed Foster heads up the city’s public safety and regulation team. “We want to support business and growth in the city, but we want to shape what goes where,” he says. “By having the right planning and licensing policies, we can help business fit in with what our vision is of the future of the city.”Police, meanwhile, have been working with bar and club staff, training them to take better care of drunk and vulnerable people following a series of tragic incidents: in 2012, a drunk 17-year-old schoolgirl was raped by at least two men after being thrown out of Digital nightclub in 2016, the death of an 18-year-old student at Hoults Yard revealed a shortage of qualified first-aiders on the premises.That same year, a 20-year-old Newcastle University student died from excessive alcohol during an Agric Society initiation ceremony. The school and other universities in the city have since intervened, encouraging freshers’ week organisers to plan as many “grub crawls” as pub crawls. Meanwhile, a drugs bust and forced closure of three adjoining late-night bars on the Diamond Strip in 2017 has led to clampdowns on club-night promoters, who could soon become licensed and regulated in the same way as bouncers and door staff.“Police budgets have shrunk, so I’ve got to work differently,” says Ch Insp Dave Pickett, who is responsible for Newcastle city centre. “One of my sons is 13 now, so in the not-too-distant future he’ll be wanting to go out with his friends and I want to know he’ll be looked after, not left abandoned on a night out.”The city of Liverpool reckons its economic cost from misuse of alcohol at around £750m a year. In January this year it opened a Centre for Alcohol Research, but it faces the same dilemma as Newcastle and others seeking to reduce harm from alcohol: how to regenerate city centres without it? Central government funding to Newcastle will have fallen by £282m in the 10 years to 2020. Licensed premises are some of the city’s most successful remaining businesses.The rules are skewed towards the interests of Big Alcohol, says Colin Shevills, director of the north-east campaign group Balance.Indeed, more than nine out of 10 applications for licences – many of them for high-volume “vertical-drinking” bars – are being approved, even in “cumulative impact zones”, areas that cities have already identified as saturated. In Newcastle the number of licensed premises continues to rise, not fall, from 1,165 in 2013 to 1,197 now. Each pays as much as £1,000 for a licence. To a cash-strapped city, alcohol is a much-needed source of revenue.The extended drinking hours introduced by the Licensing Act were aimed at bringing  “continental”-style café culture to England: according to a slogan of the time, “Bologna in Birmingham, Madrid in Manchester, why not?”A decade later, the government devolved responsibility for drugs and alcohol treatment services to local authorities, leaving cities to pick up the bill. Subsequent austerity cuts meant places like Newcastle could no longer afford to pay for dedicated alcohol services, which are now merged with drugs treatment services. At least 41 English hospitals do not currently have an alcohol care team.The government’s toothless approach to alcohol contrasts with its aggressive targeting of Big Tobacco, which has seen it restrict the sales of cigarettes and all but banish advertising. That would be tricky to do with booze. Much of the night-time economy is run by the alcohol industry. Night-time mayors typically have backgrounds in nightclubs or licensed premises: in London, for example, the current chair of the Night Time Commission, Kate Nicholls, is also the CEO of UK Hospitality her vice chair is a director of the Drinkaware Trust, which is funded largely by donations from UK alcohol producers, retailers and supermarkets.Restricting advertising is another option. In the US, several cities already ban alcohol ads on public transport, including New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco. “History has shown us is that when restrictions and bans were placed on tobacco sponsorship, other companies come in and fill the advertising void,” says Shevills.But the alcohol industry, like Big Tobacco before it, is resilient and resourceful, and unlikely to give up control of cities without a fight. Lobbying in Chicago, Charlotte and Washington DC, for example, has recently overturned bans on alcohol advertising on public transit.Likewise, in another Newcastle – the one in New South Wales, Australia – “lockout” laws that have halved alcohol-related assaults are under constant attack. Local activist Tony Brown says the city centre used to be a no-go zone at night, held hostage by the “three Vs: violence, vandalism and vomit”.And yet New South Wales’s Independent Liquor and Gaming Authority is under sustained lobbying to roll back the changes, in spite of evidence of what can happen when licensing hours are relaxed.“We had this whole narrative going on, which is common internationally, that the blame was all about the young people themselves. It really pissed me off from a social equity view,” says Brown. “No one was ever talking about political responsibility or the industry’s responsibility. This is a dominant mono-narrative about blaming young people.“Our cities must disentangle themselves from the industry and escape from the notion that the unfettered availability and supply of alcohol is a prerequisite for the development and sustainability of the night-time economy. Our city has proven otherwise.”For the rest, as any addict knows, the first step to recovery is admitting they have a problem.Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1cb3777bdbaf6068c084577222fc6962e15a7059/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bb28f1a684f59a046771ec189603c8e0","title":"corbyn labour party broad church","story":"There is a phrase that has a lot of currency among Labour MPs who hate the direction their party has taken under Jeremy Corbyn. They say they will “stay and fight”. The vow is sometimes taken in private, sometimes declared on social media alongside a plea for others to do the same. It has become so familiar that its meaning is rarely interrogated.But what is this fight? Who is it against? What does victory look like? The answers are not comfortable for the stayers. The enemy is the elected leader of their party and he enjoys the overwhelming support of its members. Corbyn’s position is so unassailable that his would-be assailants hardly dare to criticise him. They grumble about Labour’s position on Brexit and agitate for the endorsement of a second referendum. They express horror at the way antisemitism has eaten into the party like gangrene and demand surgical intervention. But in public, the dissenters avoid pointing blame squarely at the leader or even at iniduals in his entourage.In other words, the fight is against the way Labour is going, but not explicitly against the people who are taking it there. It is for a change of leadership – in theory – but only once the incumbent steps down, whenever that may be. Until this week, the best defence of that position was the absence of alternatives. Then seven Labour MPs quit to set up an “independent group” in parliament. The schismatic group might not look electorally viable, their plan might be ramshackle, their agenda obscure – but the fact they have taken action exposes the passivity of the remaining anti-Corbyn rump. It also flushes out tricky questions about what Labour is really for.Those who find such questions uncomfortable hide behind the image of a “broad church”. This is another boilerplate phrase whose meaning wilts under scrutiny. When does a church become so broad that its congregants no longer profess the same faith? For Labour, that challenge goes beyond the present rows over Brexit and antisemitism. It drills into deep ideological faultlines.Corbyn’s party has no leftmost boundary. There is no form of radical socialism that it deems taboo. It welcomes people who wave hammer and sickle flags, whether they are unaware of atrocities committed under that banner or simply relaxed about them. It is not controversial in the Labour leader’s office to see the fall of the Berlin Wall as a sad event. Corbyn’s inner circle includes former senior Communist party members and Stalinists.A lot more than seven Labour MPs think Britain would be badly governed by such people and that the levers of state power – the army, police and security services – must never come under their hands.The usual defence against charges that the party has been captured by extremists is to wave the 2017 election manifesto. It pledges nothing more sinister than a spot of light renationalisation, which is meant to prove that the whole project would look centrist by the standards of continental Europe. If it seems ultra-left it is only because Margaret Thatcher sent Britain hurtling off to the right. Many Labour moderates suspect the trajectory is to a darker place, and it is more than a hunch. Their view is based on the Corbyn’s past associations, familiarity with the tactics of the hard left at local party level and the invective of online trolls. But that is thin evidence in the court of members’ opinion. The leader’s testimony as a mild-mannered peacenik is more persuasive. So the question of what Corbynism really means has been parked. The model could be anywhere between Venezuelan socialism and Swedish social democracy. It can sound revolutionary for whipping up passions at a rally and reasonable for reassuring swing voters. It wants to abolish capitalism at the demo but only to reform it on the doorstep.Those are not pillars supporting the same roof of a broad church. They are rival conceptions of what a government is for. Only in opposition can the cracks be painted over with gooey red gloss from the tin marked “Labour values”. This is the stuff that non-Corbynites reach for when they want to indicate their belonging to an institution that no longer belongs to them. Its raw material is moral certainty that progress and social justice are the exclusive property of the left, represented uniquely by Labour. It follows that any government sporting Labour branding is better than any alternative.That view has been borne out often enough by appalling Conservative administrations, but it breeds ethical complacency. It implies that the merit in any idea – or person – can be dismissed simply by applying the label “Tory”. That is also a device for enforcing party discipline. Fear of ostracism keeps many unhappy moderates feigning loyalty to the church of Corbyn. (But excommunication is no threat to those who have renounced the faith.)There is another flaw in the axiom that left is always good. It invites the conclusion that lefter must be even better and leftest the very best. It is a formula for romanticising dangerously extreme politics. Seven ex-Labour MPs this week refused to indulge that trend any longer. Their decision has been mourned as tragic by some former colleagues and denounced as wicked by others, which is always the response of believers to apostasy. But the split is just the expression of a banal truth: parties cannot be infinitely broad. People with incompatible views on politics, economics and history cannot all be right about what Labour represents. It is ridiculous to campaign for your party while dreading the prospect of its leader becoming prime minister. It is possible to stay with Corbyn or fight Corbynism, but not both."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/104683454dd6d20066ccb481978992a4675347ed/29_0_3680_2208/master/3680.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0e2efe8165e2bd0e94469716fce69f94","title":"the guardian view honda closure of course its partly about brexit","story":"The Japanese carmaker’s decision to shut its Swindon factory is part of a pattern in which Brexit uncertainties play a significant roleFirst, the uncontroversial bit. Honda’s decision to close its factory at Swindon is a body blow to the west of England economy, to the British car industry, and to the UK manufacturing sector more widely. It will not be easy for the Wiltshire town to absorb the massive hit. Now, the more controversial part. The Japanese carmaker’s decision reflects several factors. These include a Europe-wide market shift from diesel to electric cars. But it unquestionably also reflects continuing uncertainty about Brexit’s impact on the UK economy and the fear of a no-deal exit from the EU – and anyone who pretends otherwise is simply not telling the truth.Honda has been in Swindon since 1989. It came because the UK went to great lengths to persuade the car giant that Swindon was the right site to supply the European Union market, of which Margaret Thatcher’s Britain was a keen advocate. Output has declined since the financial crisis, leaving only one model, the Civic, in production at a factory that used to produce three. Nevertheless, until now, Honda has not closed a vehicle factory in its 70-year history anywhere in the world. It has also tried hard to keep Swindon open, even though production of 160,000 vehicles a year there is “sub-scale” when compared with the output of 2m in China and the US. Now Swindon is to close in 2021, leaving 3,500 Honda workers out of work, along with at least that number in the supply chain and associated businesses.Announcing the closure on Tuesday, Honda said Brexit was not taken into account. “This is not a Brexit-related issue for us,” said its senior vice-president for Europe, Ian Howells. The company is being too polite. In the past, Honda has been keen to warn against the consequences of a disorderly Brexit. If Britain were to leave the EU customs union, the company said last summer, border checks could clog up the company’s waste-averse supply chain. The breadth of the Brexit challenge was “unprecedented in terms of its total impact”, said the same Mr Howells. That challenge has not changed, and is now potentially more acute as the prospect of no-deal deepens.It would be wrong to argue that Honda’s decision is solely about Brexit. The global market for cars is restructuring in response to threats to the ecosystem caused by harmful car emissions. But it is equally wrong to pretend that it has nothing to do with Brexit either. By leaving the EU, Britain is reneging on the access to the European market it originally offered to Honda Honda is therefore bound to think again. In a European car market that, like markets elsewhere, survives on high-volume, just-in-time production, Brexit removes the Swindon plant from the arena without compensating gains. With tariffs between the EU and Japan now ending, and Brexit likely to raise the cost of parts and reduce access to the EU, Britain’s decision leaves Honda with few real options.Honda’s decision in Swindon is also part of a pattern. Nissan is scaling back its plans for Sunderland. Toyota may leave Burnaston. Likewise BMW in Cowley. The business secretary, Greg Clark, maintains a calm veneer about Honda, but his words – “devastating”, “dismay” – convey something close to panic at the existential threat facing parts of British industry. Nor is the mood confined to multinationals: the farmers’ union president talked in similar terms – “catastrophe”, “nightmares” – on Tuesday too. The reaction of doctrinaire Brexiters, meanwhile, is shameless. “Nothing to do with Brexit whatsoever,” says the chair of Leave Means Leave. Oh, but it is. It really is. Leaving the single market and the customs union is their mess. Even now, they must be stopped."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2a4644e95663e9e1e7f791d8acc7e010bc6d5727/0_373_5906_3543/master/5906.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5c3f55641a18ebffe124ebbb8dc1570f","title":"the return of king rat derek hatton marks a new low for labour","story":"What with the vicious antisemitism row and a party split, it seemed things couldn’t get worse. Then look who turned upIn a single day, the Labour party has lost Luciana Berger and “gained” Derek Hatton. As swaps go, this isn’t dissimilar to giving someone an orgasm and them giving you gonorrhoea: the loss of a hard-working, campaigning constituency MP (Berger was among seven MPs to resign from Labour) and the official welcoming back, by a three-person panel, of a man so odious that he infamously delivered redundancy notices by taxi to his own council staff.To sum up Hatton in a brief vignette: at the 2016 Labour party conference in Liverpool, I was in a coffee shop searching for wifi, and hit on a hotspot someone had called “Derek Twatton”.Liverpudlians don’t even need to have been born during Hatton’s 80s tenure as deputy leader of Liverpool city council to know the havoc he wreaked on the city. As with stories of Beatlemania, Hillsborough, The Sun, and later Anthony Walker, Scousers pass their history on. But for those who don’t know who Hatton is: he was a member of the Trotskyist faction Militant Tendency, and became deputy council leader just five weeks before Margaret Thatcher’s 1983 landslide win (and Michael Foot’s disaster). The Labour council was the first majority one in a decade for the city.Hatton, who eclipsed the mild-mannered leader, John Hamilton, was right to be furious with central government grant cuts and underfunding of Liverpool during Geoffrey Howe’s mooted “managed decline” policy for the city after the riots of 1981, and when changes in shipping practices – the rise in the use of containers in particular – were having a devastating impact on a proud port. Deprivation and unemployment were widespread. But Hatton’s response was to set an illegal budget – expenditure exceeding income – and to gamble that the government would make up the £30m overspend. Other councils also affected by central government grant cuts managed to set legal budgets.Opposite my former school, there used to be Harthill Gardens, known as the “Kew Gardens of the north”. When the gardeners were called out on strike, they rebelled, fearing the impact on the flora. In an act of political revenge, and a mark of his character, Hatton sacked the gardeners and bulldozed the gardens. A famous banner held aloft in protests against the council at the time read: “Hitler only destroyed half of our city. Hatton tried for the lot.”Militant’s grip on Liverpool came to an end with Neil Kinnock’s famous speech at Labour’s Bournemouth conference in 1985. Then party leader, Kinnock blasted Hatton’s running of the council as “grotesque chaos”. The NEC eventually voted 12 to six to expel Militant members. Hatton was put on trial on corruption charges, in response to Merseyside police’s brilliantly named Operation Cheetah, though he was eventually acquitted. Liverpool’s economy did not recover until the late 1990s.This is the man Labour has just readmitted to the party. A man who was literally cast as King Rat in a pantomime. In recent years, Hatton has even turned his hand to espousing ignorant ideas around rape cases, because he is committed to always becoming that bit worse.But it is perhaps most egregious that Berger’s heartfelt statement on antisemitism has been met with Hatton’s readmittance. Just a few years ago, Hatton tweeted about “Jews with any sense of humanity”. The intellectual vacuity of antisemites, unable to distinguish between Netanyahu’s government and past Israeli administrations and an entire group of historically oppressed people, or their right to a homeland, continues to take the breath away. It is a truly depressing thought, a morally vacant one.Stella Creasy has told Sky News that Hatton’s return “absolutely beggars belief. I’m not going to pretend otherwise”. Lucy Powell has said the “timing could not be worse”, while the former Welsh minister Alun Davies called the decision “appalling. I do not want to be in the same party as this man”. Neither do I.Whatever one thinks of the newly formed Independent Group – and it has always been my view that those who resign the whip, or cross the floor, should stand in byelections – Labour’s reaction is dreadful. Referring to himself in the third person Hatton told Radio 4 this morning: “I can assure you, Derek Hatton will not be the candidate for Wavertree,” referring to Berger’s constituency seat. But “Degsy”, the nickname he gave himself and had made into a numberplate (DE5SY) is back espousing socialist values he disavowed. He’s sucking up to Jeremy Corbyn, though two years ago he wrote that he had “serious doubts about him”.In response to a query about how his new capitalist lifestyle aligned with his apparent socialist beliefs – Hatton once said: “My days in politics were a very long time ago and I lost interest in it after I was expelled from the city council.” The man doesn’t have an honest bone in his body. I hope someone writes him a note telling him where to stick it, and delivers it in a taxi. Derek Twatton, indeed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2774b88e8cd3d278536727a92b071fbd9962d61c/0_0_941_575/master/941.jpg?width=300\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5614a88c23fdc7453289018a53f94b63","title":"im not spending money on that the rise of the teetotal student","story":"Universities are seeing an increase in teetotal clubs and alcohol-free accommodation. Why are students drinking less?Like most students heading off to university, Emily Proctor, 19, felt apprehensive. But it wasn’t just the thought of leaving her family and making new friends that caused her to be anxious Proctor was concerned about how she’d fit in as a teetotal student.“I was worried as I knew that much of university life involves going out drinking, especially in the first year,” explains Proctor, who is studying law at Swansea University. To help alleviate her concerns, she signed up for the university’s alcohol-free accommodation. “I didn’t want to be around people who were partying constantly and coming home drunk,” she says. “I wanted to be around similar people who I could chill with instead of going out every night.” Proctor, who doesn’t drink alcohol as it’s never appealed to her, says that decision has proven to be a wise choice. “It worked out well in the end as I have friends that I stay in with and we might play cards, or go to the cinema or out for meals.”Universities are keeping apace with this cultural shift. A growing number of institutions such as Swansea, St Andrews and the University of Aberdeen offer dedicated alcohol-free accommodation.Universities are trying to shake off the drinking culture that has been embedded within university life. Aberdeen University’s student association asks all of its societies and clubs to run at least one alcohol-free event during freshers week, while Bristol holds a number of alcohol-free events during welcome week and has increased the number of alcohol-free drinks available in its union bar.Changes in students’ drinking habits have driven the University of Hull to make a number of adjustments. “We know that many of our students drink less regularly than they did five to 10 years ago, and we have many students who do not drink for cultural or religious reasons,” says Osaro Otobo, president of Hull University union. “We have reduced our club nights from twice to just once a week.”Students are taking the matters into their own hands and establishing societies that don’t revolve around drinking. “Our socials involve meeting for a hot beverage and cake every Thursday,” says Maria Marr, 22, president of the Sober Socials Society at Newcastle University. “We started the society in 2017 with 20 members and have now more than doubled it to 57,” adds Marr, who is studying a master’s in professional translation for European languages. While not completely teetotal – she might have one glass of wine a month – she believes more students are emerging as non-drinkers. “People are realising that you don’t need to give into social pressure. Alcohol is one those things you’re supposed to do when you grow up but a lot of people don’t like the taste and think, ‘I’m not spending money on that.’”George Pitt, 19, a teetotal medicine student at the University of East Anglia, says that while there is undeniably a massive drinking culture at university, “alcohol is not the be-all and end-all of socialisation”. Pitt, who is a member of the UEA Societea, a club where drinkers and non-drinkers meet for tea, adds: “The reality is most people don’t care too much as long as you don’t lord yourself over them or try to change them, so it’s really easy.”For those staying off the booze at uni, Marr’s advice is to look for societies and events where there isn’t a big drinking culture and to be upfront about your habits. “Of course people will try to encourage you to drink. You will have to deal with that, but don’t feel bad for the fact you’re not doing the same as everyone else.”Proctor adds: “Sometimes it can be hard as quite a lot of people drink quite heavily, but I’ve still been able to meet friends through my accommodation, societies and my course. It’s definitely been easier than I thought.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f727e2b4167e4a5eb2398cab59fdf9918bd2031d/0_188_2822_1693/master/2822.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2526a90c98a22c8ba440a629aad309e1","title":"king karl 12 moments that made lagerfeld a legend","story":"The late designer spent 65 years at the top of fashion, but he was equally known for his put-downs, his personal style and even his petsKarl Lagerfeld moved to Paris from his native Hamburg as a teenager and, although he had no formal fashion or art school education, soon made his mark. At the second Woolmark prize, in 1954, he won the best coat category at the age of 21. While this achievement showed Lagerfeld’s precocious talent, his rival – Yves Saint Laurent – was already on the scene, winning best dress design at just 18. Throughout their lives, the two men were great friends and rivals in both work and love. Saint Laurent was the subject of one of Lagerfeld’s famous put-downs. “He is very middle-of-the-road French, very pied-noir, very provincial,” he said in 1984.Lagerfeld spent an astonishing, world-record-breaking 54 years at Italian house Fendi, producing more than 100 collections for it. This is a lifetime in an industry where designers, like football managers, are ditched after only months in charge. The young designer was, at the time, a freelancer working for Krizia and Charles Jourdan. The Fendi sisters hired him to bring some youth to the fur-centric Italian brand and he delivered, with tufted, dyed and shaved fur coats, the opposite of the grown-up floorlength minks seen at the time. In the process – and over the decades – he became enemy No 1 of animal rights groups. Peta’s UK director Mimi Bekhechi called him “an undertaker”. Silvia Venturini Fendi, meanwhile, described him as “my mentor and my point of reference.”By the 70s, Lagerfeld was part of the Le Sept set, a group of Parisian bohemians for whom work and life – and often night and day – were happily blurred at the tiny Parisian nightclub. The designer was friends with Saint Laurent, the model Donna Jordan and the illustrator Antonio Lopez, and he met his lover of 18 years, Jacques de Bascher, about this time. Warhol, who could sniff out a glamorous set across oceans, immortalised Lagerfeld and friends in his film L’Amour. Some of it was filmed in Lagerfeld’s apartment, where the drama unfolds. Lagerfeld played a version of himself and french-kisses with Jordan at one point.Lagerfeld joined Chanel on a part-time basis in 1983, continuing to design for Chloe, Fendi and others. It was, however, his work for Chanel over 36 years that made him famous. His first show didn’t wow the critics and was notable for its concentration on 20s silhouettes rather than the pastel skirt suits Chanel was known for. Women’s Wear Daily wrote that Lagerfeld “committed too many Chanel Dont’s and not enough Do’s” in the collection. Over the next decades, the designer proved the critics wrong, as he reinvented the brand’s double Cs, tweed and pearls time and time again. “The good thing about Chanel is it is an idea you can adapt to many things,” he said.“Fashion is about today,” said Lagerfeld in a 2007 New Yorker profile. The designer arguably owed his longevity to his ability to tap into the zeitgeist way beyond clothes. His collections have referenced everything from climate change to Amy Winehouse and modern feminism. This show is an early example of pop culture on Lagerfeld’s Chanel catwalk. It featured the supermodels Kate Moss, Carla Bruni and Naomi Campbell in bucket hats, baggy trousers and denim. One model wore overalls and roller-skates. It was a long way from Chanel pre-Lagerfeld, something the designer said was only worn by “Parisian doctors’ wives”.Lagerfeld was one of the most recognisable fashion designers in the world – thanks to his uniform of black suit, white shirt, fingerless gloves, pompadour and sunglasses. This look came together in the noughties, combined with drastic weight loss. “I suddenly wanted to wear clothes designed by Hedi Slimane,” he said, referring to the Dior Homme designer whose suiting is notoriously made in tiny sizes. Lagerfeld stuck to his diet – no sugar, cheese or bread, around 10 cans of Diet Coke a day – continuously, with no temptation. “I’m like the animals in the forest,” he said. “They don’t touch what they cannot eat.”In 2004, the idea of a designer collaboration with a high-street brand – now commonplace – was a new concept. Lagerfeld – forever the multitasker – became the first designer to collaborate with H\u0026ampM in its now yearly collection. Taking inspiration from his own monochrome look, he also appeared in the advertising campaign with models. The collection was a great success, selling out within minutes. This was a one-off, however. Lagerfeld criticised the limited quantities of the items produced by the brand. “It is snobbery created by anti-snobbery,” he said. His response wasn’t entirely inclusive, however a newly svelte Lagerfeld was also displeased that the chain had produced the collection in larger sizes.Western brands began to court Asian consumers in the noughties and Lagerfeld was ahead of the curve. He brought the Fendi show to the Great Wall of China in 2007, at a cost of more than $10m (£8.8m) and a year’s planning. It featured 88 looks – a number associated with prosperity in China – lots of red (for luck) and Chinese models. Asked where the brand’s show could go next, Silvia Fendi responded: “Maybe the moon.” You get the feeling Lagerfeld would have loved that idea.There can’t be many cats that boast a personal maid, travel by private jet, have their own book, an Instagram account, a Wikipedia page and a product line of their likeness. But Choupette is a special kind of feline. Given to Lagerfeld by the model Baptiste Giabiconi – who initially had Lagerfeld cat-sit Choupette while he was on holiday – she turned the designer into an alpha cat person. Lagerfeld told Numero magazine that Choupette stole his heart because “she is pretty to look at and has good poise, but her main quality is that she doesn’t talk”. In 2013, he proclaimed he would marry the cat if it was legal. Who will take over her care is as yet unknown.As his career developed, Lagerfeld’s reputation for put-downs grew, too. Stella McCartney’s appointment at Chloé prompted the industry-famous comment: “I think they should have taken a big name. They did - but in music, not fashion.” Pippa Middleton, Hedi Klum and Lana Del Rey were all subjects of his criticism. Later, body size became a focus. Asked of his opinion of Adele in 2012, he said: “She is a little too fat, but she has a beautiful face and a ine voice,” prompting an uproar online. Lagerfeld became so famous for his barbs that a book of his quotes was published in 2013.By the 2010s, Chanel’s fashion shows (of which there are a staggering seven annually) were known not just for clothes but for jaw-dropping sets. Taking the idea of experiential to the extreme, they somehow melded an art installation with a Disney-style theme park. These chimed perfectly with the social media age, when influencers attending fashion shows wanted way more than a snap of a model on the catwalk. Lagerfeld delivered – the Chanel supermarket, complete with double-C rubber gloves, cornflakes and cleaning products, is now the stuff of legend in fashion. It was only beaten by the Chanel rocket, three years later, which came with its own emoji.German-born Lagerfeld spent most of his adult life in Paris, designing for the Frenchest of French brands. It could be said that his outsider view was his great strength – allowing him to use the tropes of French chic, from Breton stripes to the brasserie, without self-consciousness.

Maybe something was in the Hollywood water. Whatever the reason, 1999 yielded a bumper crop of movies about angry, ordinary men throwing off society’s shackles and finding something extraordinary in themselves.Fight Club and The Matrix purported to see past the blinders keeping everyone in line, and revolted against the sinister forces (capitalism and parasitic brain-vat robots respectively) exerting their invisible control. In American Beauty, a henpecked husband gave himself a new lease on life by rejecting suburbia for a simpler existence of weightlifting, pot-smoking, and skirt-chasing. But the most revealing film of that time, about the stifling influence of work and the evolving mores of masculinity, has to be Office Space.As profoundly unmotivated systems programmer Peter Gibbons, Ron Livingston and his don’t-give-a-shit shrug provided a generation with a hero. Writer-director Mike Judge has spent his entire career jabbing at the indignities of having a job, and in Peter he found the ideal vessel for his contempt. He punches the clock at the oppressively grey headquarters of Initech, a company whose ill-defined mission might as well be breaking the souls of its employees. It’s the most banal vision of hell: lethal doses of tedium, an unceasingly chirpy customer relations rep one cubicle over, an ineffective flow of management so dense with bureaucracy even Kafka would have banged his head against his desk. Other irritants have more of a personal sting, such as the smug pleasure boss Bill Lumbergh (Gary Cole, doing a bargain-rack Gordon Gekko) takes in by informing his underlings that, yeah, they’re gonna need to come in on Saturday.Peter and his colleagues’ ill-conceived scheme to get rich skimming fractions of pennies from the corporate kitty gives the loose, shaggy plot a semblance of direction, but Office Space would be more accurately clocked as a character study about a man who refuses to take any more. The aggressive regular-guy-ness of Livingston empowers anyone sharing his middle-income lot – not well-off enough to enjoy being rich not poor enough to have the hardship to account for his misery – to access him as a surrogate, making his strike against the coffee-slurping overlords into a slacker wish-fulfillment fantasy.His version of getting unplugged from the matrix comes when a hypnotherapist drops dead in the middle of their session, which leaves Peter in a state of new enlightenment. It means all he must do to change direction is simply decide to do so. He starts coming to work in flannel shirts and jeans, ignoring the memos telling him things he already knows, and eventually skipping out entirely to embrace absenteeism as a philosophy. His willingness to think past the conformity of the zombies pacing the corridors catches the attention of his supervisors and lands him a promotion – perhaps Judge remembered the feeling when he realized the loathing of authority that made him unemployable could mean success in entertainment.While this critic is relieved to confirm that two solid decades of incessant “I believe you have my stapler” stammerings from unfunny men at bars have done nothing to detract from this film’s hilarity, certain aspects have aged.Early on, during a late-night gripe session with Peter, one of his pals suggests that the stability and consistency of their work may have its merit, and gets summarily dismissed. That Peter and the film itself consider a reliable paycheck a fate worse than death may baffle an 18-year-old today, reared in a world of few jobs for young people, inhumane conditions at the world’s biggest corporations, and millennial burnout. A new generation is leaning in favor of socialism to stop widespread poverty and viciously exploitative business practices. Peter’s idea of suffering is being bored – did we ever have it so good? Take a step back, and a viewer can see people growing more desperate, aware, and politicized in their rebellion.The other element binding this film to its era are the distinctly male overtones to Peter’s metamorphosis into his best self. He finds happiness by getting back in touch with the physical instincts from which eight hours under fluorescents can estrange a man. He finally ditches his unfaithful girlfriend and shacks up with a local waiter played by Jennifer Aniston, an epitome of cool to Peter for sharing in his apathy. He eventually ends up getting a new gig on a construction crew, which Judge makes out to be good, honest work. At the risk of putting too fine a point on it, Judge even splices in a few shots of Peter catching a fish. The film imagines his transformation not as an evolution, but a devolution in the direction of our primal hunter-gatherer origins.Though he’s defined by his lack of extraordinary qualities, Peter’s as much of a chosen one as his contemporary Neo. He takes it upon himself to carry the mantle of his fellow men, left flabby and neutered by the creature comforts of mild prosperity. His crusade against the tyranny of the 9-5 would refine its social component to shed the hangups about manliness, and the economic stakes would rise considerably over the following decades. But Peter remains an everyman for his particular moment, an embodiment of the Gen-X ideal, a genuine soul standing tall against sellout-ism – the dream of the 1990s."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6afcce8741b124f61a1d4e6ab299148d3147d1d8/181_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=92bca81d90c7111ee554aea7665c7e82","title":"uk box office lego movie 2 the second part instant family","story":"How to Train Your Dragon sequel flies high as school holidays arrive, but The Kid Who Would Be King fails to reign supremeWith most schools on half-term, the Lego movie should enjoy strong business this week. It faces competition from DreamWorks Animation’s How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World, which managed £1.65m at the weekend. By releasing a week earlier, the Viking adventure has built up a higher total, £11.5m, and will probably retain a lead over its Lego rival at the end of the films’ runs.Boosted by previews totalling £485,000 and with takings just below £2.47m, Instant Family almost pipped The Lego Movie 2. Less than £3,000 separated the two films, although Instant Family had the benefit of its previews tally.The film represents a change of tone for Sean Anders who had writing andor directing credits on Sex Drive, We’re the Millers, Horrible Bosses 2 and both Daddy’s Home films. Mark Wahlberg and Rose Byrne star as a married couple who adopt a set of young siblings. The comedy-drama is inspired by the experiences of Anders and his wife, who themselves adopted three children.Instant Family opened in the US in November, beginning with $14.5m on its way to $67m. Not counting previews, the UK debut number is £1.95m – by industry rule of thumb, that’s ahead of the UK equivalent of the US opening figure (which would be £1.45m). Instant Family has a 12A certificate, and might hold up reasonably well during the half-term holiday.Landing in seventh place, family adventure The Kid Who Would Be King struggled to define its niche. Unlike the Lego or Dragon films, the live-action quest tale doesn’t benefit from a strong recognition factor – unless you count the King Arthur legend, on which the story draws. Director Joe Cornish previously made Attack the Block, which had a distinctly different audience skew.The Kid Who Would Be King began with an uninspiring £667,000, including modest previews. Attack the Block began with £837,000 (£1.13m, including previews) in May 2011. Cornish has enjoyed bigger success as a screenwriter, with credits on Ant-Man and The Adventures of Tintin.The Favourite faced competition from other awards-friendly releases, Green Book and If Beale Street Could Talk – the latter boosted by its expansion from 52 to 339 cinemas. Below The Favourite in the chart are Mary Queen of Scots, Vice, Can You Ever Forgive Me?, Stan \u0026amp Ollie, All Is True, Boy Erased, Beautiful Boy and Colette.

Here are some hints for making a little knowledge – and some orbital shaking – go a long wayNever ruin your palate by drinking fine wine, they say: the last thing you want is to find that perfectly acceptable bottle of supermarket plonk turning sour in your mouth because you’ve supped too long at the altar of Gevrey-Chambertin.But talking the talk can still be pretty useful: there’s nothing like a smattering of well-chosen phrases about “botrytis” (mould, counter-intuitively, a good thing, also known as “noble rot”), “malolactic fermentation” and “ullage” to put the most irritating know-all in their place.Becoming a fully paid-up oenophile is a long process, however, and one that few of us have the time or patience to master. Here, then, are our top 10 tips for sending your life a little Sideways without alienating all those around you.1. Rope in an expert, specifically one gifted in the art of distilling their knowledge. Jancis Robinson, for example, shoots peas through a whole lot of wine-related myths in her book, The 24-hour Wine Expert. You don’t need an array of glasses to enjoy wine (she recommends a grand total of one) don’t sneer at a screw-top the colour of a wine is less important than its weight when it comes to matching with food. Hearteningly, she also advises beginning your studies into the finer aspects of the grape by assembling a large number of bottles and a group of friends the proportions she leaves up to you.2. In the same vein of myth-busting, you’ll sound quite the connoisseur if you ask for an ice-bucket for a bottle of red – many in the know believe that, these days, red wine is served far too warm. Similarly, don’t leave the white in there for too long it’s supposed to be chilled, not turned into a slush puppy.3. Central to the business of tasting wine is the art of the swirl: it needs to be slow enough to incorporate oxygen, but not too slow determined enough to create little wine arcs but not so vigorous that it sloshes over your top. What you need is “orbital shaking”, and so precise an art is it that oenodynamics are now studied by physicists. For real. Afterwards, comes the sniff, which can best be boiled down to: quick, followed by slow.4. Be careful what you diss wine fashions change more quickly than hemlines. Currently undergoing a reputational resurgence is none other than lambrusco, the fizzy wine from Emilia-Romagna previously associated with 1980s teen parties, now newly suave, thanks to a little less sweetness and an image makeover. More tips for 2019: Croatia, Crete and Canada will all be making appearances on the wine buff’s wishlist.5. Additionally, sherry is now hip, and shows no signs of not being so. Until they discover the thing that used to be less hip than sherry. Wincarnis, anyone? Buckfast?6. You will have to conquer the embarrassment of some wine terminology. Yes, they really do talk about “mouth-feel”, which – disappointingly – appears simply to mean what wine feels like in your mouth they do call wine being “aggressive”, as if it were a therapy session and phrases such as “fruit-forward” do exist. There is genuinely a thing called “bottle shock”.7. But don’t be taken in by the apparent egalitarianism and increasing inclusivity of the wine world. Every guide will tell you that the most important thing is to find a wine you like – and to enjoy it. They don’t mean it, as you’ll find out if you turn up to dinner at their house with a bottle of Blue Nun. That’s when they start talking about things like regions and varietals.8. This is a tough one for some keen topers to swallow. But all the pros say it, so it must be true. You’re not supposed to fill the glass to its brim something to do with oxygen. Even the esteemed Jancis Robinson advises not filling the glass more than halfway up. For Brits, especially, keen on value for money and historically scarred by early closing times, this seems to go against common sense – who knows when the bottle’s coming round again, after all? But if moderation is the way forward, then so be it. Just make sure you’ve secreted an extra bottle at your end of the table.9. Treading the fine line between stingy and spendthrift is key in choosing a decent wine from, say, a supermarket. Go too low, and you’re just paying for label design, duties and other overheads break the bank and you could simply be throwing money away on fancy name recognition. And to repeat an oft-debunked canard: never order the second cheapest bottle on the wine list that’s what the establishment expects you to do and they price accordingly.10. Know when not to serve it at all. Restaurateur Mark Hix knows his way around a decent bit of grub and, when I interviewed him once, seemed unconvinced that red wine was the right accompaniment for a groaning cheeseboard too much flavour, all at once. His answer was a top-notch tequila – but that’s a whole other story."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/266b1a6ff44a629e7d9cfe599b90c6ec2a4cf612/476_122_2761_1657/master/2761.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6e8931d728ddd83fd11f0c2bb37548de","title":"barcelona lyon champions league match report","story":"Barcelona failed to score despite managing 25 shots in their goalless stalemate at Lyon in the Champions League last-16 first leg, leaving the tie finely balanced.Only five of the visitors’ attempts were on target but neither Lionel Messi, Ousmane Dembélé nor the disappointing Luis Suárez could beat the Lyon goalkeeper, Anthony Lopes, at the Groupama Stadium.Lyon could even have taken the lead were it not for a splendid Marc-André ter Stegen save in the first half when the German tipped a ferocious Martin Terrier shot on to his crossbar.The Barça defender Clément Lenglet said: “We came here to try and put in a good performance but we couldn’t get the goal.

This season they are still in contention for a quadruple and, though De Bruyne described this as “nearly impossible”, he is unfazed by City having to adjust their play to beat teams.In the league City have 65 points and lead Liverpool on goal difference, though the Merseyside club have played a match fewer.“Titles are the most important thing. We also do different things. We have main guidelines for what we always do but we try to adapt. We also know if teams do other things we must try something else as openings come in a different way, we try to adapt and dominate games. Sometimes in games that are more difficult we try to win in another way.”The midfielder added: “I think the goal is not to win the four competitions. The goal is to win every game and the further you progress, you want to win the next game. You cannot say at the beginning we are going to win four.”The next stage of this starts on Wednesday at Schalke. “We want to progress to the quarter-finals and be closer to winning it,” said De Bruyne. “But to win all four and set that standard is nearly impossible.”When City’s run of only five wins in their last 11 matches in Europe was raised, De Bruyne said: “First of all, the level of Champions League is still higher than in the Premier League, that’s why only the best teams play.“Second it doesn’t matter how many games you lose – you want to win as many as possible – but in the end it’s about winning the trophy and trying to perform the best.”John Stones and Gabriel Jesus were unable to travel because of injury and Guardiola said City’s punishing schedule was the reason why. “John has a groin problem and Gabriel finished the game in Newport with a hamstring problem. They are not big ones, the doctor told me, but enough of a problem not to be here. That’s normal when you play every three days for three months. We played 25 games in three months.”Although Schalke are 14th in the Bundesliga, Guardiola remains wary of them. “If you want to go through, you have to be yourself every minute and after we will see. I want us to be ourselves.

His warning about the enduring strength of old adversaries Bayern Munich did not. Wise heads rather than old legs told for the German champions as Liverpool were frustrated at home for the first time in this season’s Champions League. They will hope for greater adventure from Niko Kovac’s team at the Allianz Arena and to punish it.Klopp was involved in a heated exchange with his opposite number on the final whistle but, as he conceded afterwards: “Day by day the result will feel better for us.” Liverpool kept a clean sheet without Virgil van Dijk and with the goalkeeper Alisson offering Bayern greater opportunities than they engineered themselves. They extended their unbeaten run at home in Europe to 20 ties and maintained a record of never having lost to German opposition at Anfield. A goalless first-leg draw will also stir memories of the 1981 semi-final when Liverpool advanced on away goals in the second leg in Munich. But, on a cold and relatively flat February night the result felt like meagre consolation against a supposedly vulnerable Bayern team undergoing transition with Kovac.Anfield frustration stemmed not only from their opponents’ resilient and organised defending. It was self-inflicted too. Sadio Mané squandered a gilt-edged chance to change the complexion of the last 16 tie and Klopp lamented the succession of poor final balls that offered Bayern respite. Mohamed Salah and Roberto Firmino were kept subdued, understandably so in the latter’s case given he had suffered a virus 24 hours before kick-off.Bayern, their fans and Liverpool will expect, must show more willingness to attack on home soil in three weeks’ time. Klopp’s team will have to improve on three poor away performances so far in this season’s competition to progress. “Not perfect,” the Liverpool manager said. “But good enough.”The Champions League has provided an inspirational release for Liverpool during barren times in the Premier League but the dynamic has altered with Klopp’s team in pursuit of the club’s first championship since 1990. Perhaps that explained the lack of intensity and certainty in Liverpool’s performance with a key domestic date awaiting at Manchester United on Sunday. Or perhaps, more likely, the team that has reigned supreme in Germany since 2012 was not the creaking, vulnerable unit advertised.Bayern were patient, intelligent but conservative in possession, a consequence of both Liverpool’s pressing and their own contentment with a goalless stalemate. The visitors were encouraged forward more by Liverpool’s defence giving up chances far too cheaply than their enthusiasm to support Robert Lewandowski.A dip in the defensive strength and organisation that has characterised Liverpool’s title challenge might have been expected with Van Dijk serving a one-match suspension but his replacement, Fabinho, impressed greatly. The problem was Alisson’s carelessness in possession. He had already escaped with one loose pass to Thiago Alcântara when dawdling too long on a Joel Matip back pass. Lewandowski hassled the Brazil international into an error that ended with Kingsley Coman shooting into the side-netting. In fairness to the Liverpool keeper he made a vital block from Matip when the central defender sliced a Serge Gnabry cross towards his own net.Liverpool closed the first half on top but their increasing threat proved deceptive in a tepid second half. Salah volleyed their first opportunity at Manuel Neuer when picked out by a superb ball over the top from Jordan Henderson, who impressed against Bayern’s midfield three. The Egypt international also headed a clearer opening wide when Trent Alexander-Arnold’s inviting lob found him unmarked at the back post.Twitter: follow us at @_sportFacebook: like our football and sport pagesInstagram: our favourite photos, films and storiesYouTube: subscribe to our football and sport channelsLiverpool’s best chance landed at the feet of Mané after Firmino had released Naby Keïta with a deft touch. Keïta’s shot deflected off Niklas Süle to Mané who, unmarked but with his back to goal, dragged a shot well wide on the turn. Mané sought to make amends with a theatrical overhead kick from another deflected Keïta effort but with the same result. A trip on the Senegal international by Joshua Kimmich yielded the night’s first booking and suspended the influential full back from the second leg. His absence may be felt at the Allianz Arena.Fabinho minimised the impact of Van Dijk’s absence on Liverpool with a composed display in the heart of defence. Together, the Brazilian midfielder and Matip kept Lewandowski quiet, with Bayern’s brightest moments provided by Coman and Gnabry down the flanks. The Poland striker’s first sense of goal arrived from a Coman cross early in the second half but Fabinho intervened with a well-timed tackle. He produced another to prevent the France international leading a dangerous counterattack late on.The Bayern performance was increasingly safety-conscious the longer the stalemate remained, though inviting Liverpool forward in numbers was not without its risks. Süle was fortunate to see his clearance strike Andy Robertson and sail over Neuer but also wide of goal when he intercepted one Liverpool counter. Gnabry was required for a vital defensive touch just as Mané sized up another sight of Neuer’s goal as Liverpool searched for a breakthrough that, as a resigned Anfield appeared to sense, never seemed likely. “We had what we wanted from this game,” Kovac tellingly admitted."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4b301662535c14dac2b1a0014a2c409a8269520a/0_92_4163_2498/master/4163.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1622e88d36c1bd876fe8e987e6f923c9","title":"fortnite makers epic games sue organisers of shambolic uk event","story":"Epic Games takes action over game-themed festival where people spent hours queuingThe makers of Fortnite have taken legal action against the organisers of a disastrous live event based on the computer game.Hundreds of people demanded refunds after spending hours queueing to enter the site and collect wristbands at the Fortnite Live event on Saturday in Norfolk.Attendees also complained that attractions were underwhelming and ticket prices were too high. Some were given refunds on the day by the organisers, Exciting Events, but the festival’s Facebook page has disappeared.An estimated 2,800 people turned up at Norfolk showground near Norwich but there was only space for four children to practise archery at the same time and one climbing wall tower, which could accommodate three climbers.A spokesperson for Epic Games said: “The quality of our player experience is incredibly important to us, whether it’s inside the game or at official public events like last year’s Fortnite Pro-Am. Epic Games was not in any way associated with the event that took place in Norwich and we’ve issued a claim against the organisers in the high court of London.”Fortnite is a “battle royale” free online game that allows up to 100 characters to fight for survival on a dystopian island. In November, it was reported to be the world’s biggest video game, with 200 million registered users worldwide.Despite the event’s poor reception, Shaun Lord, the owner of Exciting Games, suggested it would bring the festival back next year.On Sunday, Lord said eight of his 19 staff had not turned up on Saturday, leading to problems with queues. He said he had given a refund to everyone who had asked but refused to say how many people had claimed one. “We are dealing with people on an inidual basis,” he said.“There are a lot of people who have told me they have had a fantastic time and their kids have thoroughly enjoyed it. We will take everybody’s feedback into consideration and we will act on it.”Since its release in 2017, the popularity of Fortnite has exploded. Victory dances featured in the game – including the “floss” – have been banned in some school playgrounds after they became a craze among children.Earlier this month, the electronic music producer and DJ Marshmello gave the first ever concert inside the game."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5e74e1cee1762d4a9b766128a9c30ee2c0bd2836/0_238_3640_2184/master/3640.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=895e9432187f50f102b4dd833a01b043","title":"young people hold the power the movement against fgm in pictures","story":"More than 200 million women and girls have undergone female genital mutilation and about 3 million more are at risk every year.

After all, a stopped clock is right twice a dayIt was the merest hint of an olive branch. A chink in the denial. During a rather tetchy and uninspired speech at the annual conference of the manufacturing trade organisation, Make UK, Jeremy Corbyn did just about manage to squeeze out, by way of a passing aside, that he was disappointed a small number of MPs had decided to take a different path. Then it was back to the business at hand.The Labour leader had arrived at the conference accessorised by his shadow education secretary, Angela Rayner, and the shadow junior education minister, Gordon Marsden. Neither of whom was asked to contribute a word and who appeared genuinely confused as to why they were being made to sit on the stage throughout the half-hour session. As was everyone else. Maybe it was a hostage situation. In case they were thinking of defecting to S Club 7.His message was clear enough. The same as it ever was. Nothing had changed. The government had wrecked the economy but Labour would put things right by establishing a commission of lifelong learning. Theresa May had also made things worse with her handling of Brexit and, though all options remained – the possibility of a second referendum was forced out in a whisper – on the table, what the country really needed was a general election. Thank you and good night.The smattering of applause suggested no one else in the room much fancied another election. At times like these, Corbyn is his own worst enemy. It helps to meet your audience halfway by acting as if you are engaged and interested, rather than just looking a bit bored and repeatedly shouting that you are right.But that just isn’t the Labour leader’s style. When he thinks he right, there’s just no backing down. If history isn’t yet on his side then it will be at some point in the future. After all, a stopped clock is right twice a day. So when the inevitable questions about the S Club 7 – “Because there is truly no other party like an S Club party” – and the Etc Declaration came at the end, Corbyn was entirely unrepentant.Regrets, he’d had a few. But then again, too few too mention. Did someone say that seven MPs had resigned from the Labour party? Well, it was no big deal. He’d never really cared for any of them. Who were they again? Oh yes, there was that Luciana woman who had been droning on about antisemitism for years. Thank God he’d never bothered to talk to her. And the rest were just a bunch of pro-EU Blairite losers. Good riddance to the lot of them.And if there were any other Labour MPs out there who wanted to join them they were welcome to walk. Sod ‘em. They could all be replaced easily enough. Tom Watson and John McDonnell had asked him to reflect and listen and he’d done just that. He’d reflected and listened and decided that everything was pretty much tickety-boo. His policies were just fine, he was just fine. It wasn’t him that had to change, it was everyone else. Always had been, always would be. You didn’t get a caring Labour party by falling over yourself to be nice to people. Meet the new Jeremy. Same as the old Jeremy.The Labour leader wasn’t the only politician to be in denial. At the beginning of his statement to the Commons on Honda’s decision to end production in Swindon, the business secretary, Greg Clark, had done his best to talk about anything but Brexit. Honda had said the closure was nothing to do with Brexit and who was he to contradict them?Slowly, though, the scales of self-deceit began to fall away. Clark is at heart a decent man and can’t maintain the cognitive dissonance of talking stuff he knows to be bollocks for any length of time.His breaking point came when Suella Braverman, one of the more intellectually challenged of the Tory backbenchers whose only positive contribution to the country has been to resign as a minister, declared it was a complete coincidence that so much economic bad news happened to be breaking while the government screwed up Brexit.This was too much for Clark. He placed his hands over his ears, begging her to stop. What bit of a no-deal Brexit being a complete catastrophe did she not understand? Of course the uncertainty over Brexit was a factor in overseas businesses pulling out of the UK. It was a no-brainer. He had been on his knees begging Theresa May to face down the ERG and do something sensible in the national interest. But if nothing changed then S Club 7 might just become S Club 8.

He called the plan a “valuable effort” that should be looked at again during the transition period, but said it could not provide a solution now.“It is clear that the EU will not consider replacing the backstop with such an alternative arrangement now, in order to address our immediate challenge,” he said, adding that the alternative arrangement would “require significant changes to EU legislation and customs practices that would need to be negotiated with the EU member states and others”. No 10 had been hoping to secure a renegotiated withdrawal agreement and put this to parliament next week, but senior sources acknowledged time was running out. Hammond hinted the vote could still come next week, saying that “over the next few days, Members of Parliament need to think long and hard about the choice before them.” The Malthouse compromise was named after the housing minister, Kit Malthouse, who helped draft it as an attempt to find a Brexit deal the warring sides of the Tory party could back.The most hardline Eurosceptics have repeatedly said they will only support May’s deal if the compromise is written into the EU withdrawal agreement to replace the backstop – the mechanism that would keep the UK in a customs union if there were no solution to the Irish border.However, Jacob Rees-Mogg and Steve Baker insisted the Malthouse agreement was “still live and kicking” and said they looked forward to further developments.No 10 appears to be placing its hopes for breaking the deadlock with the EU on legal assurances that the Irish backstop potentially binding the UK into a customs union would not be permanent.Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, held talks on Monday with the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier.He is understood to have warned Barnier that the consequence of the deal not passing would result either in a no-deal or in parliament taking control of events, adding extra uncertainty and difficulty to the UK-EU negotiations.If May and Juncker can agree a possible way forward on Wednesday night, officials will then start work on the technical and legal practicalities. The goal is for Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, to be able to change his legal advice to the government, which currently states that the backstop could mean a permanent customs union. Cox is expected to give a speech later this week setting out his thinking.At a press conference in Stuttgart on Tuesday, Juncker played down expectations over his meeting with May. He said: “There isn’t enough movement for me to be able to expect this to be a discussion with a concrete outcome.”“I don’t know what Mrs May will communicate to me tomorrow,” he said, adding that he was unsure what “our British friends would actually like to have”.The gap between the expectations in parliament and the reality of the talks in Brussels was made clear on Tuesday by the European commission’s chief spokesman ahead of May’s visit.Asked about Barnier’s two-hour meeting with Barclay and Cox on Monday, the spokesman said: “We cannot accept a time limit to the backstop or a unilateral exit clause and further talks will be held this week to see whether a way through can be found that could gain the broadest possible support in the UK parliament and respect the guidelines agreed by the European council.”EU sources expressed frustration that they were having to “re-educate” Cox, who is new to the talks, about the lack of realism in the central demands made by May. Sources said Barnier and his deputy, Sabine Weyand, had been “forensic” in their dismantling of the Malthouse compromise on Monday. Barnier told Barclay that suspending EU law on the border was not a viable solution to the problem. Weyand later privately lamented that the EU was having to repeat arguments to Cox first made in August 2017.Officials are looking at translating into legal text the previous commitments by Juncker, and his European council counterpart, Donald Tusk, about the temporary nature of the backstop, and their intention to work on a technological solution to supercede the backstop in the future.But officials are sceptical that such a move would satisfy the Democratic Unionist party or the Tory Brexiters, who had been led to believe the withdrawal agreement would be reopened in order to win their support.With the negotiations at an impasse, the foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, is expected to appeal to Brussels to help the UK come up with a solution during a visit to Berlin.Between talks with the German foreign and finance ministers, Heiko Maas and Peter Altmaier, Hunt is expected to warn that failure to ratify the withdrawal agreement will be “deeply damaging, economically and politically”.“In the vital weeks ahead, standing back and hoping that Brexit solves itself will not be enough”, Hunt will say. “The stakes are just too high: we must all do what we can to ensure such a deal is reached. At this momentous time, a heavy responsibility falls upon all of us. We do not want historians in the future to puzzle over our actions and ask themselves how it was that Europe failed to achieve an amicable change in its relationship with Britain – a country that is not simply a partner but a friend and ally in every possible sense.”With time running out, cabinet was also updated on the option of a no-deal Brexit if May cannot get her withdrawal agreement approved by parliament. One cabinet source said only Liz Truss, the secretary to the Treasury, spoke up emphatically in favour of keeping no deal as a negotiating option.“I can’t understand how a No 2 at the Treasury could still countenance keeping that on the table,” the cabinet source said, but added that the general mood in the room had noticeably turned against no deal as a negotiating tactic."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fac0675e8a0a35a8e887a04a7473b3119a716487/0_67_3546_2128/master/3546.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=742354fa26c0e6afeeef59d56c37eb0a","title":"jonny may england six nations form psychological effect","story":"The wing is the most improved player in world rugby and, with Wales next up on Saturday, he admits his searing displays now constitute a psychological barrier for opposition teamsAt this rate Jonny May might have to consider changing his surname. Nowadays it is less a case of “may” than “will” when the Leicester wing hurtles towards a try-line, to the point where Wales will have to make special plans for England’s prolific flyer in Cardiff this weekend. Give him half a yard and he will – not may – take full advantage.Twelve tries in his last dozen Tests, including a hat-trick inside the opening 29 minutes against France last time out, is a world-class strike rate by anyone’s standards. The last time he faced Wales he scored twice at Twickenham, the only tries of a low-scoring game. His tally of 22 tries in 42 Tests has elevated him to seventh on the list of England’s all-time try scorers, with the power to edge past, among others, Jason Robinson’s 28 in 51 Tests by the end of the year.Not that “edge past” is May’s modus operandi. The 28-year-old is flying, to the point where France seemed petrified any time the ball came within 10 metres of him. “Yeah, I guess that’s true,” he says, when asked if his form is having a psychological effect on opponents. Never mind English rugby, there is no more improved player in the world over the past 12 months.Even May himself is delighted by the eye-catching progress he is making. While his scorching effort against New Zealand at Twickenham in 2014 is still among his favourite tries, he now has many more strings to his bow. “I am a different player to what I was,” he acknowledges, quick to stress his good fortune to be on the end of an increasingly dangerous attacking backline. “I have scored a lot in my last 12 Tests, more than in my first 30. Is that luck? Maybe it is, but I know my game is better and tries come with that.”It has also done him no harm that the game is tilting towards greyhounds like him who are alert, keen and quick enough to chase down well-executed attacking kicks. “That’s the way the game’s gone at the moment,” he says, nodding. “People want 14 men in the frontline with aggressive defences and players getting off the line. Where does that leave the space? A lot of the time it’s behind them. Will the game change? In 10 years’ time maybe it’ll go back to putting wings back and softer defences. But the way we want to be thinking is: ‘We’re not robots, where is the space?’ There’s always going to be some somewhere.”His burgeoning confidence is a far cry from his early England days when he was mostly happy just to be there. “I wasn’t doubting myself but I knew in the back of my head that I was running out of chances. I knew there was pressure on me. I could do it at Gloucester but hadn’t quite done it here.” He has worked hard to turn himself into a player capable of more than just the odd champagne moment. “What’s been a little bit funny to me is everyone saying ‘wow’ now whereas I feel it hasn’t happened overnight. I feel like I’ve been working hard over a long period of time.”The next goal is to be mentioned in the same breath as New Zealand’s Ben Smith – “He’s the smartest rugby player” – and to distance himself from scurrilous rumours that he was once, ahem, possessed by a chicken. “It’s a bit silly isn’t it? I don’t think at any stage that has happened,” says May, blushing ever so slightly.This week, instead, he is focused on scoring for the fifth consecutive Six Nations game, further buoyed by a pep talk from the former England and Chelsea captain John Terry, who attended training in Bagshot on Tuesday. “He spoke a lot about the leadership group he had at Chelsea. A core group of players setting the standard and how José Mourinho came in and changed the way they train. It was quite reassuring because we could relate to a lot of things he was saying.” Not so reassuring for Wales as they prepare to meet English rugby’s answer to Didier Drogba."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8d2c8e230b41f548fb343f7bd88aab241ea37b52/0_44_3499_2100/master/3499.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=99fddd8982cca1c462506357c31c5fe7","title":"lando norris f1 mclaren lewis hamilton barcelona","story":"• 19-year-old’s time in testing is second only to Charles Leclerc • Lewis Hamilton completes 74 laps and is 10th-fastestLando Norris, who took to the track for the first time as a Formula One driver in testing on Tuesday, capped a strong performance by setting the second-fastest time. The 19-year-old McLaren driver will be the youngest British driver to take part in F1 when he makes his debut at the Australian Grand Prix in March and has made a controlled and confident start to his new career.Norris has already shown promise and he was able to exploit McLaren making a far stronger start in testing than they have in the previous four years. His time, set in the last hour of a day during which he completed an impressive 104 laps, was just over three-tenths down on Charles Leclerc in the Ferrari, who led the timesheets throughout.“It’s good I managed to do some longer runs, good to know we can get through a whole day with no big problems,” Norris said. “But it is only day two. We want to get through this test and identify any problems there might be and make sure we figure them out before Australia. It’s good confidence for myself and for the team.”He believes the team and car have made a step forward since their difficult 2018 season. “The motivation, how everyone works, seems to be going in the right direction,” he said. “Some of the niggles we have had to overcome have been ironed out. Everyone is working together in the correct way and everyone is very motivated.”Williams are hopeful they will be able to run their car for the first time in testing on Wednesday. The team missed the first two days because their car was still being worked on at the factory. It is expected to arrive from the UK in the early hours of Wednesday morning and they are aiming to make it ready for the afternoon session.Ferrari were once again on top with Leclerc, in his first time behind the wheel for the team, putting in an impressive performance and racking up 157 laps.Lewis Hamilton took the Mercedes out in the morning, completing 74 laps of consistent running in 10th place. Daniel Ricciardo set some good times for Renault until part of his rear wing came off in the morning run, ending his session. Red Bull, too, looked competitive and reliable until Pierre Gasly went off having completed 92 laps."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7930d86558042c1e943a9d8414cfaee153122ff3/0_154_3257_1955/master/3257.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=16655336992eb834b336036f149d7ee8","title":"naomi osaka kristina mladenovic dubai sascha bajin","story":"• Osaka beaten 6-3, 6-3 in Dubai• Australian Open winner parted with Sascha Bajin this monthThe world No 1, Naomi Osaka, crashed out of the Dubai Duty Free Tennis Championships after losing in straight sets against France’s Kristina Mladenovic.Osaka, who announced a surprise split from her coach Sascha Bajin this month, was beaten 6-3 6-3 in the second round, having received a first-round bye as the top seed.The 21-year-old, who won the Australian Open last month and the US Open last year, gave no reasons for ending her successful partnership with Bajin.Osaka enjoyed a remarkable rise up the world rankings after first linking up with Bajin in the 2017 off-season.

The comic dialogue is so delightful that it’s tempting to resent its interruption by songs that sometimes seem to have been included merely to justify the show’s title.This isn’t a serious handicap because John Sullivan (1946-2011) was one of the greatest ever TV writers, bringing to the sitcom a Dickensian knack for characterisation and catchphrases.The creator’s son, Jim Sullivan, and Paul Whitehouse, who also appealingly plays a cameo role as Grandad Trotter, have exhaustively combed the seven series and 16 specials of Only Fools and Horses, broadcast between 1981 and 2011, for the senior Sullivan’s absolute best punchlines, puns, malapropisms, misunderstandings, and sight gags.The two most famous visual jokes in the TV show – involving a wobbling chandelier and a hinged flap on a bar – are either included, or alluded to, both nicely timed to tease the audience’s anticipation of whether they can be staged. Fresh material includes an enjoyable fantasy flash-forward from the show’s 1989 setting to the Peckham of today, where posh coffee, old clothes and houses are being sold to people who may be getting as dodgy a deal as the customers of Trotter Independent Trading.It’s hard, though, to escape the feeling that the score came up short. The 20 songs  the work of 11 composers or lyricists. John Sullivan’s theme tune for the TV series, that catchy mockney anthem to tax evasion and Thatcherite values, is flanked by several originals from combinations of Jim Sullivan, Whitehouse, and the late Chas Hodges. The younger Sullivan fittingly invokes Lionel Bart, the leader of the East End musical genre with Oliver and Fings Ain’t What They Use To Be, in a lovely ballad of yearning, called The Girl, and gives Del Boy a witty wide-boy’s love song, Bit of a Sort.But these new numbers are padded out with jukebox inclusions, including two old Chas and Dave hits and the Bill Withers soul song Lovely Day, always worth a listen but, in this musical, feeling as knock-off as the goods on Del Boy’s market stall.Performers in an adaptation of a beloved cultural product face the dilemma of whether to impersonate the original stars. Tom Bennett’s Del Boy affectionately channels David Jason’s jaunty misplaced confidence, while Peter Baker, as the monumentally thick Trigger, is more of a lookalike for Roger Lloyd Pack’s TV turn than a Tussaud’s model could manage. Dianne Pilkington benefits from claiming greater interpretative freedom with Raquel, Del Boy’s love interest, giving the character a strength and iniduality that usefully dilute the period sexism of some of the authentic 1980s pub-talk.The finest collection of vintage gags on the London stage should allow the show to make a fair amount of what Del Boy calls “lovely jubbly”.

Bravo, Laura DodsworthMe and my vulva: 100 women reveal allFirst things first: the documentary 100 Vaginas (Channel 4) was not about 100 vaginas – it was about 100 vulvas. They were photographed up close and personal by the artist Laura Dodsworth with their owners invited to sit, look and talk about them afterwards as part of a project that follows on from similar ones she has done involving breasts and penises (separately, for the avoidance of doubt). Presumably the powers that be thought calling it 100 Vulvas would lead too many unsuspecting viewers to settle down in anticipation of a programme about the history of Swedish engineering.It was not. It did what it should have said on the tin. My mother was a gynaecologist for nearly 40 years and I now feel like the Queen Mother felt about the bombed-out East End after Buckingham Palace was hit I can look her in the eye. Mainly because I’m never looking at anyone anywhere else ever again.My unwillingness, nay inability, to face one, let alone 100 vulvas is very much the point of Dodsworth’s project and the programme. My labiaversity is symptomatic of a world in which, as the various women who took part noted, its physical appearance and makeup is rarely discussed. And while we are taught endlessly about the blood, birth and pain it will bring to us, its potential for pleasure is only ever really noted in relation to others. “We live in a society that treats women entirely like a cock pocket,” said one woman.That makes it sound like an angry programme. It wasn’t, although there were expressions of it throughout, especially in the sections about rape and other violence done to women. “I wasn’t prepared,” said Dodsworth in voiceover, “for the amount of trauma and pain I’d hear about.” There were accounts from women raped in childhood, too young even to put words to their experience. A woman who had undergone full female genital mutilation (“We were lucky – we could afford a local anaesthetic”) spent six years in hospital and was rendered infertile as a result – “All to prove to my future husband that I was a virgin.” And there were testimonies from women alienated from their bodies by the effects of extreme religious upbringings (“It having a smell, having hair – that’s something I’m still working on,” said a young woman whose fear of sin had induced vaginismus for years), women sewn up incorrectly after birth and other brutal, unacknowledged truths that have ned the ages.What it undoubtedly was, instead, was gently but firmly and relentlessly radical. It’s not until you see a full set of female genitals filling your screen that you realise how little you see anything of or about them in wider culture. It’s not until you hear women laughing and describing how they masturbate and how their bodies change as they do that you recognise that while male masturbation is an openly acknowledged fact (and practically a sitcom staple), the female equivalent is effectively denied, except when co-opted in service to porn.And it’s not until you hear women talking candidly about their own bodies that you realise how little you know about your own, or how your friends feel about theirs. It’s not until you hear women talking honestly about birth or loss of virginity, infertility or menopause that you realise just how much obfuscatory cant you usually hear, and how narrow even the most broadminded approaches and attitudes are.Dodsworth’s photographs and film, and the women who have chosen to spread their legs for her lens, strip away the absurd normalisation of all this in a way I cannot remember having seen before (and I think I would – I was still seeing vulvae when I closed my eyes two nights later). I rarely use the word, because it makes my teeth itch, but it was genuinely empowering. I still don’t fully understand my mother choosing to spend four decades at the business end and I’m certainly still not going to look at mine. But by the end of the hour I was no longer screaming and automatically lunging for the remote whenever another quartet of lips filled the screen. Rome wasn’t built in a day and 40 years of internalised misogyny coupled with natural squeamishness cannot be dismantled in an hour. But in such small increments, here brought about by others’ considerable confidence, bravery, selflessness and artistry, do we measure progress."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d237a03ae3fec77bbc5cb038ff90a70ab563ff9/0_225_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=28fc449c79e68ab3efc538fa6768591d","title":"bernie sanders announces 2020 run presidency","story":"Bernie Sanders, the independent senator from Vermont whose 2016 presidential campaign helped energize the progressive movement and reshaped the Democratic party, has entered the 2020 race for the White House.Sanders, a self-styled democratic socialist who spent much of his nearly 30-year congressional career on the political fringe, cast his candidacy as the best way to accomplish the mission he started three years ago when he ran against Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination.“Together, you and I and our 2016 campaign began the political revolution,” he said in an email announcing his decision to supporters on Tuesday morning. “Now, it is time to complete that revolution and implement the vision that we fought for.”Sanders, 77, running as a Democrat again, believes he can prevail in a crowded and erse field that includes several female and minority candidates, and then beat Donald Trump, whom he called on Tuesday “the most dangerous president in modern American history”.Asked in an interview on CBS on Tuesday morning what would be different about his 2020 campaign, Sanders replied: “We’re gonna win.”Whether he can once again capture grassroots support, and whether the energy of his past campaign will pass to other candidates, will likely be a central factor in determining who Democrats nominate to take on the sitting president.The progressive policies Sanders helped popularize in 2016 – Medicare for All, a $15-an-hour federal minimum wage, tuition-free college, demands to fight climate change more aggressively and to tax the wealthy at a higher rate – have now been broadly embraced by several other presidential candidates.Sanders wrore: “Three years ago, during our 2016 campaign, when we brought forth our progressive agenda we were told that our ideas were ‘radical’ and ‘extreme’. Well, three years have come and gone. And, as result of millions of Americans standing up and fighting back, all of these policies and more are now supported by a majority of Americans.”Sanders will face opposition from moderate Democrats and from Republicans who are likely to use his candidacy to paint the party as too liberal. In a preview of Trump’s re-election campaign, the president used his State of the Union speech this month to warn against what he said was the creep of socialism in America.Trump 2020 campaign spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany said in a statement: “Bernie Sanders has already won the debate in the Democrat primary, because every candidate is embracing his brand of socialism.“But the American people will reject an agenda of sky-high tax rates, government-run health care and coddling dictators like those in Venezuela. Only President Trump will keep America free, prosperous and safe.”Sanders made clear on Tuesday that he plans to go after Trump directly in his campaign.In an interview with Vermont Public Radio, where he first announced his bid, he said: “I think the current occupant of the White House is an embarrassment to our country. I think he is a pathological liar. I also think he is a racist, a sexist, a homophobe, a xenophobe, somebody who is gaining cheap political points by trying to pick on minorities, often undocumented immigrants.”After a midterm election cycle that saw women and minority candidates sweep to power, the nominating contest is likely to be fought not only over ideology but over identity and electoral strategy. Already, the 2020 candidates are being pushed on how they can appeal to the Democrats’ broad range of demographic groups, which includes working-class families, black and Latino voters, suburban women and young people.This year, Sanders apologized publicly and privately to former female staffers after allegations of sexual harassment by male staffers on his 2016 campaign. He has also continued to stumble on questions about race, despite a years-long effort to improve his standing with minority voters.Still, no candidate will enter the race with as many advantages as Sanders, who ended the 2016 primary with more than 13m votes and nearly $230m raised, much of it through small donations. Now he begins a second run not as a political outsider but as a top-tier candidate with near-universal name recognition, a dedicated following and an unrivaled donor list.To this point, Sanders’ campaign announced on Tuesday night that in the first 12 hours after his launch, the senator raised a stunning $4m from 150,000 donors in all 50 states. The average donation was $27 – the same small-dollar amount he often touted as a sign of his grassroots revolution in 2016.Meanwhile, his launch video was viewed nearly 6m times while he received 330,000 “pledges of support”, roughly a third of his goal to reach one million to build an “unprecedented and historic grassroots campaign”.And a series of early hires for top roles are intended to illustrate Sanders’ commitment to demographic and geographic ersity.Faiz Shakir, the political director of the American Civil Liberties Union, will serve as campaign manager. The 39-year-old former aide to Harry Reid will be the first Muslim to manage a presidential campaign. The campaign also hired the progressive organizer Analilia Mejia to be the political director and the activist Sarah Badawi to be her deputy.Yet he will likely face far greater scrutiny, in a growing field already populated by colleagues and allies including the Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren, his closest friend in Congress.Senators Kamala Harris of California, Cory Booker of New Jersey, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota have all entered the race, as have lower-profile contenders including the former San Antonio mayor and federal housing secretary Julián Castro and Pete Buttigieg, the young mayor of South Bend, Indiana.The former vice-president Joe Biden, former Texas congressman Beto O’Rourke and billionaire businessman Michael Bloomberg are all weighing whether to run.With a fractured Democratic field, advisers believe Sanders’ core support, should he retain it over the next year, will be enough to power his campaign in the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary, the early voting states that helped lift his 2016 campaign.He is likely to benefit from a campaign waged by his allies to reform the party’s primary process, which succeeded in stripping voting power from the so-called “superdelegates”, a major source of controversy in 2016 when Sanders lost the battle for the nomination to Clinton.Born to Jewish parents with roots in Poland and Russia, Sanders grew up poor in a cramped apartment in Brooklyn, New York. He graduated from the University of Chicago, where he became involved in the civil rights movement. In 1981, he was elected mayor of Burlington, Vermont. In 1990, Sanders became the state’s sole representative in Congress, where he served until he joined the Senate in 2006.Following the election of Trump, Sanders published a book titled Our Revolution: A Future to Believe In. He has four children and is married to Jane O’Meara, a former president of Burlington College and his closest adviser."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b84ce2724b1c86446f388091af16193e37d0a8b6/0_60_4800_2880/master/4800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=02a01ccc26599c98124f662526d78fd0","title":"deal to free hodeidah may open way to aid in yemen un envoy says","story":"Accord between government and Houthis welcomed but famine ‘still stalks this land’, warns UNA breakthrough agreement on the pullback of forces around the Red Sea port of Hodeidah may open the way for a large increase in the flow of aid into Yemen and prevent the country turning into a “bloody slaughterhouse”, Martin Griffiths, the UN special envoy for Yemen said.The breakthrough was made at the weekend between military officials from the Yemen government and Houthi fighters controlling the port and city, and the redeployment of forces by the warring parties could start “possibly even today or tomorrow”.Assessing the broader progress since an outline UN-sponsored agreement was reached between the parties in Stockholm in December, Griffiths said a “bloody slaughterhouse” has been avoided, but he also warned “famine still stalks this land”.The UN is expected to ask for a further $4bn (£3.1bn) this year to alleviate the suffering of civilians at a conference next week in Geneva.“Yemen, unlike some other conflicts, is solvable,” Griffiths said after months shuttling between Yemen’s key cities of Sana’a, Aden, Hodeidah and Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia – the single most important external player in the three-year conflict.Griffiths, speaking from Amman, in Jordan, said the prospect of the civil war remaining unresolved was terrifying. “A famine is stalking the country, and there is the threat to Red Sea shipping. The alternative to peace is so graphic in Yemen that it is a spur to the goodwill on which I am counting.”Griffiths spoke after Houthi rebels and Yemen government commanders agreed at the weekend to launch the first phase of a redeployment of their troops around Hodeidah, the Houthi-held port and gateway for aid into the country.The redeployment of troops around Hodeidah was agreed in principle in talks in Stockholm in December, but the proposed implementation timetable has been missed badly, leading some observers to claim the process might be doomed.He said the controversial issue of a future depoliticised Hodeidah security force – coastguards in the port and police in the city – had now been passed to him to discuss with the two sides.Griffiths said the agreement was only “an interim, stop-gap arrangement” to demilitarise the city of Hodeidah and did not decide the wider issue of sovereignty in Yemen.He also said aid needed to increase massively to cope with the threat of famine.﻿He added the trust in the UN was also improving. “The UN has had a relationship of ups and down with Yemen. So for the UN to deploy a mission like this into the heart of the conflict is to throw a big stone in the pool. It has a big impact. The UN presence in Hodeidah is destined to be roughly the same size as the current UN humanitarian presence for the whole country, and that in itself is one of the largest UN humanitarian presences in the world.”The additional monitors will ensure a better system to control the breaches of the ceasefire claimed by either side. “The level of violations of the ceasefire has consistently been good over time, given the context. There have been spikes, but … there has not been any taking of territory by one side or the other.”Griffiths said international pressure had helped persuade the two sides to keep talking. “I think the heightened battle for Hodeidah had been continuing for four or five months, and the mass of international opinion wanting this war to stop has had a major impact on military planning. Hodeidah was the centre of gravity for the war, and we have been able to pull back from a bloody slaughterhouse.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c96e2e28dedcd138b6136b2da00be852f3a2055e/0_508_6432_3860/master/6432.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=40ae1a59b3be2880e3ffb024d9e265ab","title":"palestinians patrol hebron israel ejects foreign peacekeepers","story":"Volunteers in blue uniforms begin escorting Palestinian children past Israeli settlers to schoolPalestinian activists in the flashpoint city of Hebron have started patrols to prevent attacks by settlers after Israel’s widely criticised expulsion of an international observer mission.The Temporary International Presence in Hebron (TIPH) was first established more than two decades ago after a far-right Jewish extremist murdered 29 Muslims at a mosque in the city.TIPH has since monitored and documented altercations in the West Bank city, in particular between Palestinians, the Israeli army and members of a several hundred-strong ultranationalist settler movement who live in heavily fortified districts.The body’s forces, a team of 64 observers from Italy, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and Turkey, had escorted Palestinian children who needed to walk past settler areas to get to school.“Their absence is a big gap,” said Issa Amro, a local activist leader who set up the civilian patrol of 18 volunteers, all wearing blue uniforms with the word “observer” written in English, Arabic and Hebrew. “We escort kids to schools, we try to document human rights violations using video cameras … we try to protect Palestinian homes,” he said.As soon as he began a week ago, Amro’s mission drew anger from settlers. He published a video of a woman slapping him and other volunteers being pushed around.More than 200,000 Palestinians live in Hebron, the occupied West Bank’s largest city. But the presence of settlers has effectively shut down local life in the main souk as army checkpoints cut off the area.Central to the volatility is Hebron’s leading holy site, which Jews call the Tomb of the Patriarchs while Muslims refer to it as the Ibrahimi mosque, after the patriarch Abraham, a key figure for both faiths.Last month, Benjamin Netanyahu announced that the mission’s mandate would not be renewed, saying Israel would not “allow the continuation of an international force that acts against us”.The move was interpreted as a nod to domestic far-right voters as Netanyahu seeks re-election in April. TIPH has been the focus of controversy in Israel recently after one of its observers was deported for slapping an Israeli child and another was filmed puncturing the tyres of a settler’s vehicle.The ejection of the observers drew widespread international condemnation. In a joint statement, TIPH member countries said it undermined one of the few established mechanisms for conflict resolution between Israelis and Palestinians. The EU said it risked further deteriorating the already fragile situation on the ground.Chris Eijkemans, the local representative for Oxfam, said the departure was “a dangerous green light for more violence”.Most world powers consider settlements to be illegal under international law, which forbids the transfer of civilians into occupied land. Settler violence against Palestinians living in the West Bank has been rising since the beginning of 2017, according to the UN. Incidents often follow attacks by Palestinians against Israelis.While TIPH observers were never authorised to interfere in incidents or disputes, they patrolled seven days a week and their mandate intended their presence to give “a feeling of security to the Palestinians of Hebron”.Amro says his volunteers are not as well trained as the TIPH, but more importantly, they do not have diplomatic backing. While Israeli soldiers could not force TIPH observers away from any areas of Hebron, his group has been banned from parts of the city after the army declared it a closed military zone.After the TIPH observers packed up, he said: “The soldiers are acting differently, the settlers are acting differently.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2c77e09573002530b161046cef6c2e9f66ae09b6/0_0_900_540/master/900.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e2c858adb943711adf084a713ec4d7ca","title":"sharm el sheikh locals lament wall going up around resort","story":"Project aims to recoup lost tourism income since downing of Russian plane in SinaiEgyptian authorities have started work on a concrete barrier around the Sinai resort town of Sharm el-Sheikh, which has struggled to attract tourists since a Russian passenger jet crashed in the region shortly after taking off in 2015 in a terrorism-linked attack, killing 224 people.Despite photographic evidence to the contrary, the governor of South Sinai denied a wall was being built.“It’s not a wall, who told you it’s a wall. We don’t have a wall,” said General Khaled Fouda. The project, he said, consisted of a mix of high concrete barriers and at least 37km (23 miles) of razor-wire fence, with “four very beautiful doors” to access the town.It was intended to “beautify and secure Sharm el-Sheikh”, he said. “We are doing this for the future. The project will help Sharm el-Sheikh recoup lost tourism revenues.”Photos and video show the construction of a concrete barrier estimated to be up to six metres high, which residents fear will encircle the perimeter of the town.Similar plans for a wall around the town were considered by the South Sinai authorities in 2005 but scrapped. Fouda declined to state why the project had been revived.Kelly Walmsley, a manager at the Rixos resort in Sharm el-Sheikh, said she had not been informed about the work. “To be honest, nobody really understands what’s going on,” she said.A resident, who asked not to be named, said checkpoints and cameras already surrounded the town to provide security. “For us residents, it’s ridiculous. The beauty of the place is being covered up with a fence. Sharm el-Sheikh is well-known for its mountains and desert – this thing will destroy the view,” the resident said. “This security barrier isn’t going to make a difference, it will just annoy people more and it won’t stop terrorism. It’s a joke. Any tourist coming out of the city will be worried they’re not safe – this will affect tourism.”The wall will also cut off Bedouin communities in the surrounding desert area, a likely point of contention especially after authorities enlisted the Bedouin to help combat jihadi elements elsewhere in Sinai. “This wall tells the Bedouin that they’re not part of the community – it sends the message that they’re not worth protecting from terrorism,” said the resident.A ban on direct flights from the UK to Sharm el-Sheikh is still in place after the jet attack. The Egyptian authorities have since enhanced security measures at Sharm el-Sheikh airport, hoping for the return of flights from Russia and the UK."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3799495.1550602333!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"deal done on phibsborough shopping centre and dalymount sites","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDublin City Council has long wanted to redevelop the properties that form the heart of Phibsborough villageA deal to clear the way for the redevelopment of Phibsborough shopping centre, and neighbouring Dalymount Park stadium has been struck between Dublin City Council and developers.The council bought Dalymount, which sits directly west of the shopping centre, from Bohemians Football Club for €3.8 million in 2015. It plans to build a new stadium and have Bohemians and Shelbourne as tenants.City councillors were this week told that a “settlement” had been reached with the developers, MM Capital, headed by Derek Poppinga and Peter Leonard, to allow both projects go ahead.The developers will pay the council €40,000 for the plot of land and build a public plaza between the centre and the stadium.Dublin City Council wants to turn Dalymount into a €20 million, 10,000-seater stadium and plans to seeks funds from the Department of Sport before the end of April.No sunsetsThe existing stadium was first laid out a century ago. The pitch will be laid out on a north-south alignment, rather than east-west, as it is currently, to ensure better light and to prevent matches being affected by sunsets.Work is due to finish in 2022. Retail space in the centre will be tripled, along with a seven-storey-high student accommodation block.However, the eight-storey 1960s concrete tower cannot be demolished because the developers do not own two of the businesses underneath it: a Tesco supermarket and an Eddie Rockets restaurant. These, and a Tesco off-licence nearby, will remain as they are.Instead the tower will be clad with a metal mesh. Apart from the eight-storey tower, most of the centre today is a one-storey strip mall, topped with car parking.The developers plan to build up the site with heights ranging from three to seven storeys, including new shops, offices, restaurants and student accommodation.Dublin City Council has long wanted to redevelop the properties that form the heart of Phibsborough village, drawing up a plan in 2008 to create a new “village centre”.Bohemians had at the time planned to sell Dalymount and move to a green-field site close to Dublin Airport. However, the plan collapsed when the economy crashed."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"After election extra MEPs in Ireland South and Dublin must wait to attend parliamentSettlement between Dublin City Council and developers will enable redevelopmentFine Gael Ministers concerned about potentially steep hikes in property levyRCNI to discuss potential reforms and establishment of special family law courtPenalties meted out for transgressions including failing to keep an appointmentHospital says an audit trail is created so any abortion data breach could be tracedInquiries in other jurisdictions to be admissible in fitness-to-practise cases \u0026ndash new BillThree-day talks to cover economic interventions and state aid for vulnerable industriesDublin City Centre Traders Alliance say plans must be sent to An Bord Plean\u0026aacutelaIHBA calls for extension of help-to-buy and affordable loan schemesLancet study: Increasing vaccinations and HPV testing could prevent almost 2,500 casesBumper pay day for lucky lotto punter as this jackpot tops Ireland\u0026rsquos largest prize to dateFinley Gannon (18) had disappeared after attending nightclub on Friday nightPSNI said body was found at house at lunchtime on Tuesday afternoonIllness can be difficult to detect and publicity claims it could save thousands of lives\u0026lsquoAbuse broke your heart and spirit and sometimes you couldn\u0026rsquot tell anyone for years\u0026rsquoPrize is biggest ever on island topping Co Down couple who won in JanuaryDoherty defends scheme as English company linked to contract goes into administrationUntrue to suggest stories were \u0026lsquogratuitous, cynical and unwarranted slur\u0026rsquo, former SBP editor saysDogs Trust\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquoA dog is for life\u0026rsquo message still relevant as it receives 370 requests to give up animals"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3799664.1550613325!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"government two weeks from pivotal brexit decisions","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTánaiste Simon Coveney and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar. Photograph: James FordeThe Government will begin making major decisions to prepare the country for a no-deal Brexit – such as saving vulnerable industries and companies from collapse – within a fortnight.Ministers have been given a “sobering” overview of moves to be taken in the coming weeks as Brexit day approaches without any breakthrough in the current impasse between the EU and UK.British prime minister Theresa May will meet European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker in Brussels today as the UK prepares to outline the legally binding changes to the Brexit deal. Mrs May\u0026nbspis seeking\u0026nbspto address MPs’ concerns about the Northern Ireland backstop, the guarantee that there will be no hard border even if future EU-UK trade talks fail.The commission says the EU wants to help the prime minister to win a majority at Westminster for the deal but has ruled out renegotiating the legally binding withdrawal agreement.At Cabinet in Dublin yesterday, Ministers were told that key decisions to prepare for a no-deal Brexit on March 29th would have to be taken at the start of next month.Sources said this included making “economic interventions and state aid applications to save industries and companies”.The Cabinet will hold three meetings within five days – on March 4th, 5th and 8th – one of which is expected to be held over dinner at Farmleigh House in the Phoenix Park.Sources said the Cabinet was told key decisions on how to prepare ports and airports, and to support businesses most at risk from a no-deal Brexit, must be taken at that point. Another meeting will not be held until March 20th due to Ministers travelling abroad for St Patrick’s Day.While it is understood that no specifics were discussed, well-placed sources said there was a reference to the agri-food sector.Food tariffsMichael Gove, the UK environment secretary, yesterday confirmed food imports would be subject to tariffs in a no-deal scenario. The Irish Farmers’ Association said this “demonstrates the gravity of the situation for the Irish farming sector”.The UK has not yet confirmed what level of tariffs it will apply, but if they are based on World Trade Organisation levels, then food will be the sector hit most severely.Minister for Agriculture Michael Creed has said tariffs on Irish food imports into the UK would come to about €1.7 billion a year.Martin Fraser, the secretary to the Government, is understood to have outlined the activities of the coming weeks to Ministers yesterday. Other key events mentioned at the meeting included further votes in the House of Commons and the publication by the British government of tariff schedules that will apply in a no-deal scenario.Ministers also approved the omnibus legislation that will be needed in the event of a no-deal Brexit. The legislation will be published later this week and is set to be debated in the Dáil, with a view to its passage through the Oireachtas being completed by Brexit day.Sources said there was still significant distance between what the UK was asking for and what the EU could offer by way of assurances on the backstop.The British government has yet to put forward a “firm ask”, or definite idea on how to proceed. It is understood to still be talking about ideas Brussels has already ruled out, such as a time limit on the backstop or a unilateral exit clause from its provisions.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: APChristian LutzThe two lowest polling candidates in the European Parliament elections in May will not take their seats until the United Kingdom leaves the European Union, under plans approved by the Government.Ireland was allotted two extra seats when the European Council decided in June to redistribute 27 of the 72 seats that will no longer be needed to represent UK interests.The ision was made on the basis that the UK would leave on March 29th. However, a decision by London to seek an extension in Brexit negotiations will leave Ireland’s extra candidates in limbo.The European Parliament elections will be held at the end of May 2019 across Europe. Before elections can be held in Ireland, the Government must pass legislation to give effect to the changes.Depending on what action London takes, Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government Eoghan Murphy will table amendments to the European Parliament Elections (Amendment) Bill 2019 currently before the Dáil.If the UK has not left by the time the new parliament must meet, the last candidate elected in the Ireland South constituency and the last elected in Dublin will not take up their seats until the UK has left.“As these constituencies were allocated the two additional seats in the review carried out by the Constituency Committee, it was deemed appropriate that they would be identified as the seats that would not be taken up until the UK has left the EU,” the department said.Details around whether these candidates will get paid have still to be worked out, and it is likely that the Government will defer the matter to the European Commission for a decision.Ireland’s extra seats were shared out between Ireland South and Dublin by European Parliament Constituency Commission, which recommended that Dublin should grow to a four-seater.In addition, Ireland South, which will now be a five-seater, will expand to take in Laois and Offaly. The Midlands North West constituency remains a four-seater.The prospect of people in Northern Ireland being able to vote in European Elections has also been ruled out, despite Sinn Féin’s calls that one of Ireland’s extra seats should be used to represent them.But the Department said on Tuesday that “under European law, only citizens of the union are entitled to vote and stand for election in European Parliament elections.“This means that when the United Kingdom withdraws from the European Union, British citizens resident in the State will no longer have a right to vote at, or stand as candidates in, elections to the European Parliament held in Ireland.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3799683.1550614458!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"miriam lord reeling from all the spin","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tWhat’s the big deal about it anyway? That’s the impression Leo gives every time questions about the national children’s hospital come up. Photograph: Colin Keegan, Collins DublinWon’t be long now before Bob comes to the rescue, freeing Leo from the daily drudge of the same questions about the national children’s hospital from the same Opposition dimwits who don’t want to listen to his answers and won’t give him respect.That would be Bob, also known as Brexit Omnibus Bill. Omnibus Bill will be formally introduced to the nation on Friday and his arrival should shunt most of the unwanted hospital attention away from the Taoiseach for a while.What’s the big deal about it anyway? That’s the impression Leo gives every time the subject comes up. As he sees it, we have a simple Over-Under building situation: his critics say the cost of the hospital has massively overrun, he says the cost of the hospital has merely been underestimated. It’s the same thing, just approached from opposite directions. Why will nobody listen to him? He knows absolutely why: spin.The Taoiseach seemed very frustrated on Tuesday when he took to the floor for Leaders’ Questions, having to give answers he has given more than once already about how the project is turning out to be far more expensive than originally thought. It’s not as if the vast sums of money people are complaining about have even been spent yet, he pointed out, again. And when it is spent (and more besides), that cash will represent only a small billion or so drop in a multi-billion euro ocean, or envelope, as they like to call these things around Government Buildings. He cannot fathom the fuss. He rounded on an Opposition which, he charged, is interested only in “spin . . . yarns” and “conspiracy theories”. And to think he was in Lisbon (for the benefit of the Opposition dimwits and media dullards, that’s the capital of Portugal) just a few days earlier from where he tweeted matter-of-factly about having “Caught up with Portuguese PM Antionio Costa over the weekend for a good talk” on the impending European elections, the “ever-closer” relationship between Ireland and Portugal and the possibility of a no-deal Brexit.Micheál, Mary Lou and Mattie may have been annoyed about the children’s hospital, but the political correspondents lobby was furious about the lack of transparency surrounding this bi-lateral in Lisbon, having received no notification of the meeting or subsequent information about what the two leaders discussed. This was viewed as a disappointing breach of long-standing protocol and a worrying precedent.Communications But there isn’t much you can tell the Taoiseach which he doesn’t already know, particularly when it comes to communications, an area in which he holds a particular interest. So when Micheál Martin took a swipe at the Government’s determination to “control the message around the overspend” as opposed to controlling the cost overruns, it didn’t play well. The Fianna Fáil leader believes the Government became so obsessed with the PR value around launching this much-needed hospital that it completely overlooked the building management costs.He pointed to all the publicity involved – “the Government was good on the hard hats, it was good on the yellow vests. It was good on the videos, YouTube, you name it there was no lack of communications around this hospital right from the get-go,” he said. Even before the detailed design was worked out, it was a case of “get it on the ground, get boots on the ground, get it working from the public relations perspective”. Conspiracy theoriesBut the Taoiseach had a good answer. There are no politicians or no political advisers on any of the boards or committees overseeing the development. “I think, once again, this sounds like one of your conspiracy theories, deputy Martin.” Wearily, he turned to the Ceann Comhairle and sighed about how Opposition members repeatedly “put out a yarn, perpetuate it for days in the media and when they are about to be found out, they shout you down”.Micheál came back with a zinger. “Taoiseach, you’re correct – the politicians weren’t on the board . . . they weren’t in the sub-committees. But they were in all the photographs, they were in all the videos, they were in every communication presentation for this hospital.” As for yarns, noisy TDs across the floor were not going to be taking any lectures from Varadkar’s Government about spinning the news. In that regard, the Dáil chamber is an assembly of the guilty. Then Micheál reminded Leo about the inidual who was in charge of the Department of Health when a very rosy estimate was advanced of how much the children’s hospital would cost. “When you’re talking about yarns, Taoiseach, the biggest yarn we heard in the last three years was in 2016 when you, as minister for health, said it’s €650 million all in! . . . It’s now €1.7 billion and climbing. So don’t talk to anybody here about yarns, Taoiseach, because people are quite frankly fed up with yarns and fed up with the public relations and fed up with the spin. They want substance and they want facts.”And the argument spin spun again, this time with the Fine Gael leader accusing the Fianna Fáil leader of spin and the Sinn Féin leader saying that the Minister for Health was spinning every bit as much as his boss whereupon the Taoiseach accused Mary Lou of spinning “all over the country” and Mattie McGrath called him a “spinning machine”.Leo says the cost overrun at the hospital is now being cited by Opposition TDs as the reason why local projects are being shelved or delayed, when the reason is completely unrelated. Which is entirely believable.“What is happening in here,” he railed, “is pure cynical spin from the Opposition.” You’d miss the innocence of Brexit. Bring on Omnibus Bill and Bob.

Director of Corporate Enforcement Ian Drennan told an Oireachtas committee his office’s investigation into former Anglo Irish Bank chairman Sean FitzPatrick and his loans at the bank “went wrong in a pretty catastrophic way.”“The wheels came off,” he said.No organisation, however big or small, would have been able to cope with the investigation into the bank that was “completely unprecedented” in terms of its scale, he said.“If December 2008 happened again in the morning, are we equipped for that? No. There are very few organisations in the country that would be,” Mr Drennan told the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Business, Enterprise and Innovation.The Anglo investigation was “off the scale” requiring “massive lines of inquiry which in turn resulted in uplifting hundreds upon thousands if not millions of documents,” said Mr Drennan. The Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement (ODCE) had “no understanding of what it was getting into,” he said.“Now I suppose we do know the risks are enormous. A lot more thought would have to go into identifying those risks and mitigating in an appropriate manner such that we didn’t have repetition.” Same risksAsked by the committee’s chairwoman Mary Butler, Fianna Fail TD, whether the new legislation setting up the ODCE as a new white-collar crime agency, the Corporate Enforcement Authority would make his office robust enough, Mr Drennan said that it would undoubtedly help to hire staff and bring in outside expertise. “Hindsight is 20:20,” said the director. “Anybody, if they were in that situation again without knowing what was to come, runs runs the same risks. Mr Drennan said the Anglo investigations were “completely unprecedented” in terms of the “sheer scale of five separate strands of investigation, each of which on their own merits were enormous.”“In reality, any organisation, irrespective of how big or small it is, if you tried to try to carry that kind of load across a relatively small number of people, that level of complexity… things go wrong and unfortunately, in this case, they went wrong in a pretty catastrophic way and the wheels came off,” he said.Submission declinedHe told the committee that he had offered to provide it with a submission detailing the ODCE’s failures and additional reasons around the collapse of FitzPatrick trial but that the committee had twice declined to accept it.The “net effect” of refusing to accept the submission was “unfortunately, the committee is not in a possession of the necessary information to enable it to reach evidence and fact-based conclusions,” he said.Ms Butler , said that it had agreed to take submission of Mr Drennan’s report and that the committee would be in contact with his office in the next day or two to arrange to receive it. Mr Drennan said that he did not think the ODCE staff had “any inkling” at the time of the Anglo’s collapse of the potential scale of the investigations. He acknowledged that there were “regrettable, very serious failures” but successes too.Very few organisations in the State would be equipped to deal with the Anglo investigation. He described the episode as a “perfect storm” given the “enormous pressure” on the Exchequer at the time of the crash.The director told the committee that notwithstanding the failures in the FitzPatrick investigation, high quality investigative work was done but it “unfortunately came at a considerable human cost.”Fianna Fáil senator Aidan Davitt asked Mr Drennan to elaborate on this “poignant line.”“Human cost is a poignant term and I hope none of the iniduals concerned will mind me saying so: a lot of people were very badly damaged by this experience,” the director replied, without naming any inidual. Mr Drennan said there was a “narrative in the public domain” about what had happened that was “not complete.” “There are dots to be joined and there are bits missing. I think if and when the full story ever comes out, it will put quite a different complexion on it,” he said. “Certain things were ventilated in court, certain things were not. In fairness to the iniduals concerned -and one in particular - I don’t think it would be appropriate for me to go beyond that, other than to say I observed this first-hand, I chose those words very carefully,” he added, referring to his “human cost” line.Last week, Mr O’Connell wrote to the committee to say that he had new information about the botched Fitzpatrick investigation that was never aired at trial and he would be willing to share it with the committee.Explaining the ODCE’s failure in taking witness statements from Ernst \u0026amp Young, now EY, Mr Drennan drew a contrast from taking a statement from a witness observing an assault in the street and from an audit partner given that the audit of a listed company was a large undertaking and a substantial number of people.Professional firms guard their reputations and litigation risks “very jealously” so taking a statement was not the same as a witness statement in an assault. The judge’s criticisms reflected “the complexity of that,” he said.The judge in the FitzPatrick case found that “all concerned, either completely lost sight of the fact that what was happening was inappropriate or failed to recognize in the first instance that it was inappropriate,” he said.The process “ultimately fell foul” of the prohibition on the coaching of witnesses and the contamination of evidence, he said.Mr Drennan said the factors that led to the collapse ofMr FitzPatrick’s criminal trial “extend well beyond” failures within the ODCE..Mr Drennan sought to cast wider blame beyond his office for the decision of a trial judge to direct the acquittal of Mr FitzPatrick over alarming flaws in his prosecution.Mr FitzPatrick walked away a free man in 2017 after the collapse of a retrial. He was accused of furnishing false and misleading information to Anglo’s auditors over the scale of his loans at the bank – charges he denied. Judge John Aylmer, on day 126 of the State’s longest running criminal trial, brought proceedings to a close after he criticised how the (OCDE) conducted its investigation into Mr FitzPatrick.The judge found that the ODCE coached and cross-contaminated evidence in preparing witness statements taken from two partners at Ernst \u0026amp Young, Anglo’s auditors, and that it adopted an “inappropriate, biased and partisan approach that tried to “build and defend” a case against Mr FitzPatrick rather investigate the alleged crimes.Mr FitzPatrick’s first trial collapsed after Kevin O’Connell, then legal adviser to the ODCE, admitted shredding a number of relevant files in a “panic” after he found he had not disclosed documents to Mr FitzPatrick’s lawyers.‘Unprecedented’ scaleIn his first appearance before an Oireachtas committee since he became director in 2012, Mr Drennan said that “the seriousness of the investigative failures” that occurred within the ODCE were “fully acknowledged.”The committee sat after meeting private session for two hours, delaying the scheduled start of Mr Drennan’s appearance. The committee met briefly with Mr Drennan and his officials in private session before the hearing began.In his opening statement, the director told TDs and senators that he would could assure the committee that “valuable lessons, particularly as regards risk management, have been learned.”The corporate watchdog was called before the committee to question whether the ODCE was fit for purpose and to examine new legislation proposed by the Government to replace the ODCE with a new white-collar crime agency, the Corporate Enforcement Authority, in response to the criticisms raised around the investigation.Mr Drennan sought to cast the “serious failures” in one of its five investigations into Anglo as a “subset” of the ODCE’s broader enforcement work. He said that it could not be validly extrapolated to draw conclusions on the office’s overall fitness for purpose almost 10 years over the failures in that single investigation. He accepted that the scale of the ODCE’s five investigations into Anglo was “unprecedented, not merely in terms of the ODCE’s history up to that point but, arguably, in the history of the State.”“Unfortunately, the risks associated with taking on a suite of investigations of this scale were not sufficiently appreciated at the time, as a consequences of which those risks were not appropriately mitigated,” he said.Witness statementsMr Drennan pointed out that Judge Aylmer cited the “most fundamental error” as being the manner in which the ODCE took witness statements from two audit partners at Ernst \u0026amp Young, now EY, when the ODCE took 60 statements from other witnesses which attracted no criticism from the judge or Mr FitzPatrick’s defence team.“The factors that contributed to the trial judge ultimately directing the jury to acquit the accused extend well beyond the failures within the ODCE,” he told the committee.While it may not “fit neatly with the narrative,” Mr Drennan pointed out that four of the five Anglo investigations conducted by the ODCE resulted in convictions.“Sight is sometimes lost of that fact,” he said. He defended the investigation work carried out by the ODCE in the Anglo inquiries.“Notwithstanding the failures that occurred in the investigation that preceded DPP v FitzPatrick, an enormous level of high quality investigative work was done over that period – an achievement that, unfortunately, came at a considerable human cost,” said Mr Drennan.Last week, Mr O’Connell wrote to the committee to say that he had new information about the botched Fitzpatrick investigation that was never aired at trial and he would be willing to share it with the committee.He complained in his 10-page letter that he has become “the personification” of all that went wrong with the investigation and prosecution and suggested that he is not wholly to blame."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3799535.1550603944!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"may returns to brussels as uk prepares brexit backstop plan","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritain’s attorney general Geoffrey Cox leaving Downing Street after a cabinet meeting on Wednesday. He is expected to return to Brussels to meet EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier. Photograph: Tolga AkmenAFPGetty ImagesTheresa May will meet European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker in Brussels on Wednesday as Britain prepares to outline the legally-binding changes to the Brexit deal it seeks to address MPs’ concerns about the Northern Ireland backstop. The commission said on Tuesday that the EU wanted to help the British prime minister to win a majority at Westminster for the deal but ruled out renegotiating the legally binding withdrawal agreement.“The EU 27 will not reopen the withdrawal agreement, we cannot accept a time limit to the backstop or a unilateral exit clause,” commission spokesman Margaritis Schinas said.The prime minister told cabinet ministers on Tuesday that “alternative arrangements” for the Border could not replace the backstop, as Conservative backbenchers behind the so-called Malthouse compromise have argued.Brexit secretary Stephen Barclay and attorney general Geoffrey Cox are expected to return to Brussels to meet EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier following their talks on Monday.After Monday’s meeting, a spokesman for the Brexit department said Mr Barclay discussed the “alternative arrangements”, which include technological and administrative measures to ease friction on the Border.“While the commission engaged seriously with these proposals it expressed concerns about their viability to resolve the backstop. We agreed to keep exploring the use of alternative arrangements – especially how they might be developed to ensure the absence of a hard border in Northern Ireland on a permanent footing, avoiding the need for the backstop to ever enter force,” the spokesman said.The EU expects Mr Cox to present draft legal text which he believes would enable him to change his legal advice to the government that Britain could be trapped within the backstop indefinitely. MPs are due to debate Brexit next week, when they are likely to get a chance to vote on an amendment that could compel the prime minister to seek an extension to the article 50 negotiating period by mid-March.ERG fearsModerate Conservatives fear that hardline Brexiteers in the European Research Group (ERG) are seeking to push Mrs May into leaving the EU without a deal. Former prime minister John Major on Tuesday night urged the “mainstream majority” of MPs to assert themselves against what he described as Brexit zealots who were manipulating the Conservatives.“The decision parliament takes next week can undermine or revive the reputation of representative politics and from that flows so much of our whole way of life,” he said.“Every so often, in our long history, there has come a moment when parliament has had to dig deep into its soul. Now is such a moment.”Jeremy Corbyn on Tuesday expressed regret at the decision of seven MPs to leave Labour in protest against his leadership and his approach to Brexit and to anti-Semitism within the party. But he rejected their claim that he had failed to respond to concerns they expressed.Shadow chancellor John McDonnell promised that Labour would undertake on “a mammoth, massive listening exercise” in response to the resignations.“If it’s about the style of the leadership we’ll address that. If it’s about policy we’ll listen to that as well,” Mr McDonnell said.Ruth George, a Labour MP close to the leadership, apologised on Tuesday after she suggested that the breakaway group might be secretly funded by Israel. “I had no intention of invoking a conspiracy theory and I am deeply sorry that my ill-thought out and poorly worded comment did this. I withdraw it completely,” she said.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches. See more here.

This is exactly the right thing to do.”Ms Begum travelled to Syria from her home in east London in December 2014 and married an Isil fighter.Her first two children died, and last week she was discovered in a refugee camp where she issued a plea to return to Britain.But despite saying she wants to bring her baby son up in the peace and security of the UK, she has insisted she has no regrets about travelling to Syria.She has also been criticised for likening the deaths of 22 people in the Manchester Arena terror attack to the civilians being bombed in Isil territory.Earlier the Met Commissioner, Cressida Dick, had said Ms Begum could be arrested and potentially charged if she ever returned to the UK.But she also acknowledged that travelling to Syria was not an offence in itself, and said the police would need evidence that she had been involved in crime or terrorism in order to bring charges.It comes as a report suggests that many of the girls who have travelled to join Isil are far from vulnerable and naive.A study by the Henry Jackson Society found evidence that while boys tended to join Isil under the influence of family members, girls were more likely to have sought out extremist material on their own.Analysis of 20 cases found that Isil brides tended to be self-radicalised and motivated by the prospect of marrying a man of their choice.Isil schoolgirls\u0026#039 journey into SyriaMs Begum has insisted that while living in the self declared caliphate her only role was as a housewife and mother and there is no evidence of her having done anything wrong.Speaking about the case, Ms Dick said if the teenager returned to the UK she could face questioning but that the current law might not be sufficient to see her prosecuted.The Commissioner explained: If she does, under whatever circumstances, arrive at our borders somebody in her type of circumstances could expect to be spoken to and if there is the appropriate necessity, to be potentially arrested and certainly investigated.”“If that results in sufficient evidence for a prosecution then it will result in sufficient evidence for a prosecution. The officers will deal with whatever they are confronted with.The Commissioner added: “If there is insufficient evidence for a prosecution it is our job to look at the threat they pose if they are returning from Syria and we do that with every single person who comes back from Syria and then manage the risk with colleagues in the (security and intelligence) agencies.Ms Dick went on: Some people returned from that area in the early days who had almost certainly done nothing other than humanitarian aid work – we talked to them and assessed their risk. Many people have come back and just gone on with peaceful lives.”When Ms Begum first travelled to Syria, Sir Mark Rowley, who was then the head of UK counter terrorism, suggested the girls might be treated as victims of grooming, but Ms Dick said: We\u0027re a long way down the road since then.READ MORE: Allison Pearson:  Sorry my heartless little jihadi bride, but you made your bed and now you can lie in itREAD MORE: Allison Pearson: Thank God, Sajid Javid grasped Shamima Begum is the one person uniting Britain – against her Teenager in Lincoln Memorial protest sues Washington Post for $250 millionNHS staff to get safe spaces and 24 hour helpline to avoid burnoutScreen time can be good for children, says Education Secretary, despite fears of parentsThousands of girls as young as 13 turn to cosmetic surgery as social media pressures mountJoan Ryan becomes eighth Labour MP to quit, blaming \u0026#39culture of anti-Semitism’ under Corbyn leadership100 Vaginas, review: far more than mere titillation – this was an important sex education filmWorkers over 50 have fuelled rise in UK employment over past decadeLoved ones\u0026#39 bodies left at homes for days after families sign up to \u0026#39cowboy\u0026#39 cremation plansTory former minister says she is prepared to join Independent Group over BrexitEU in spat with Hungary over anti-Juncker campaign  Theresa May could hold meaningful vote next week in bid to see off threat of ministerial resignationsUS police investigate Sir Philip Green for \u0026#39grope\u0026#39 after complaints by fitness instructorSecurity guard who protected Princess Anne had home raided before being sent to immigration detention, it emergesComment: I helped expel Derek Hatton from the Labour Party - why on earth are they letting him back in?White House \u0026#39tried to rush\u0026#39 sale of nuclear power technology to Saudi Arabia, report saysPrince Harry dishes up a hot lunch for children as he warns closure of \u0026#39vital\u0026#39 youth clubs leave them socially isolatedDuchess of Sussex baby shower: inside the New York hotel where old friends and celebrity guests put on a five star party Leader of Nicaraguan protests against Ortega sentenced to \u0026#39ridiculous\u0026#39 216 yearsComment: Sunny Nature has a spring in \u2028its step – but it’s out of kilterProposal to research \u0026#39trans regret\u0026#39 rejected by university for fear of backlash, claims psychotherapistWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day 19 february 2019","story":"A veterinarian from the zoo of Besancon, in eastern France feeds Soa, a female crowned sifaka. The crowned sifaka is a critically endangered species from Madagascar.

The different social positions of the interaction are exaggerated by the visual dimensions, with passer-by almost always standing above, leaning over, talking downMiles Celic, chief executive of lobbying group The City UK,\u0026nbspsaid: “These permissions for clearing are a helpful step forward, but they are only a partial and temporary fix.“Time is running out to resolve these technical issues, and while such temporary fixes are essential, long-term stable solutions are needed to provide the certainty that customers and clients across the whole of Europe and beyond need.”A report for the London Stock Exchange in 2016 found that up to 83,000 jobs related to clearing could be lost in a worst-case Brexit scenario.The European Commission put forward proposals in 2017 which would impose stricter supervision of clearing houses by EU central banks and Esma, and in some cases force bigger organisations to move operations to the bloc.However, moving euro clearing would be costly and complex which experts predicted would make transactions more expensive and the financial system less safe.Why an area ‘showered with EU cash’ still thinks Brexit is a good ideaClearing houses are a crucial part of the “plumbing” of the financial system. They act as middleman between buyers and sellers of derivatives – financial contracts tied to the underlying value of a share, index, currency or bond.Buyers and sellers deal with the clearing house\u0026nbsprather than each other, absorbing losses if one counterparty fails to pay up.This helps to prevent a domino effect of losses spreading through the financial system when one company defaults.We’ll tell you what’s true.

The different social positions of the interaction are exaggerated by the visual dimensions, with passer-by almost always standing above, leaning over, talking downMiles Celic, chief executive of lobbying group The City UK,\u0026nbspsaid: “These permissions for clearing are a helpful step forward, but they are only a partial and temporary fix.“Time is running out to resolve these technical issues, and while such temporary fixes are essential, long-term stable solutions are needed to provide the certainty that customers and clients across the whole of Europe and beyond need.”A report for the London Stock Exchange in 2016 found that up to 83,000 jobs related to clearing could be lost in a worst-case Brexit scenario.The European Commission put forward proposals in 2017 which would impose stricter supervision of clearing houses by EU central banks and Esma, and in some cases force bigger organisations to move operations to the bloc.However, moving euro clearing would be costly and complex which experts predicted would make transactions more expensive and the financial system less safe.Why an area ‘showered with EU cash’ still thinks Brexit is a good ideaClearing houses are a crucial part of the “plumbing” of the financial system. They act as middleman between buyers and sellers of derivatives – financial contracts tied to the underlying value of a share, index, currency or bond.Buyers and sellers deal with the clearing house\u0026nbsprather than each other, absorbing losses if one counterparty fails to pay up.This helps to prevent a domino effect of losses spreading through the financial system when one company defaults.We’ll tell you what’s true.

Police said a man was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder and remains in custodyMore than a quarter of four and five-year-olds lack the early communication skills, such as being able to talk about events in the past or future, expected by the end of reception year, DfE figures show.Mr Hinds, who has pledged to halve the number of children starting school without vital literacy skills by 2028, admitted that the word gap had perhaps been “exacerbated” by some technology.But he added the “Sesame Street effect”, which shows that the TV programme had an educational effect on children who watched it, suggests that toddlers can also learn from apps and screen time.Screen time for children under two more than doubles in 17 yearsAs part of the government scheme to boost literacy, disadvantaged families with children aged two to four, will receive free access to quality learning apps for phones and tablets in up to 12 pilot areas.Thousands of families in the north of England will be sent tips via text message, educational toys and books as part of the programme to help boost children’s language and literacy skills at home.Mr Hinds described children’s early development and gaps in school readiness as a “profound issue”.On average, disadvantaged children are four months behind in their overall development at age five. By the time they take their GCSEs they are, on average, 19 months behind their peers in attainment.He said: “Screens can be an easy distraction for children, but harnessing the power of technology to support early communication and development means that we have another tool in our arsenal to help young kids develop those skills.”Author Philip Pullman previously said that parents needed to get off their mobile phones and speak to young children to boost their vocabulary.It came after early years experts suggested that children had poorer language skills because parents were too distracted by their digital devices to help them out.We’ll tell you what’s true.

Some suggest that it will ban memes, by forcing websites to automatically check for the use of\u0026nbspany media that is owned by somebody else, and that it could stop websites such as Google and YouTube from working.The blog post from the commission appeared aimed at taking on those criticisms.

It could be twisted around to allow the different parts of the phone so that the screen touches itself, for instance, or so that both parts of the screen are on the outside.The patent filing includes a full 24 images, showing different ways the phones could bend. And they don\u0027t apply only to iPhones – with features that could work for iPads or even Macs shown as well.For instance, one shows the screen bent so that it is sitting in a pyramid shape. That means two people sitting across from each other could be looking at the same display.Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 42Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.5G wireless internet is expected to launch in 2019, with the potential to reach speeds of 50mbsUber has halted testing of driverless vehicles after a woman was killed by one of their cars in Tempe, Arizona.

Samsung\u0027s foldable phone is due to be released in the coming weeks, and other companies are already preparing their own rivals.Other companies have chosen to sit out of the growing trend, however. LG has said that it will not release a foldable phone just yet, and that it was too early for the devices.It might also be that Apple does not reveal a foldable phone at all. The company regularly files patents for products that never actually make it to market, or arrive in a completely different form.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The main upgrades will include tools that allow the phones to use precise indoor positioning and navigation, a frosted glass casing, better Face ID facial recognition, and bigger batteries.The biggest new feature however is said to be a triple-lens camera, which is endorsed by the new report and has been widely rumoured.

That was first shown off in 2017, as a wireless charger that could power up AirPods, an iPhone and an Apple Watch at the same time – but despite the promise it would come soon, nothing has been said about it since, and some have even suggested it might not be coming at all.The AirPods themselves will also receive an update. They will include wireless charging capabilities and improve Bluetooth – and might also feature a whole range of other more exciting upgrades.Both the AirPods and AirPower mat are expected to be released in the first half of the year. Apple almost always releases new iPhones in September, and it is not clear when the Macs will arrive.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Vets would therefore like to see a ban on non-stun slaughter to prevent the suffering of millions of animals.”The RSPCA, which\u0026nbspsaid its concern was not over expression of religious belief but\u0026nbspanimal welfare,\u0026nbspcalled on the government to ensure trade deals with other countries did not include non-stun meat and to make labelling compulsory, until it introduced a no-stun ban.We’ll tell you what’s true.

Only very detailed future archaeological research will stand a chance of finding the route and cracking that particular mystery.In the first, more maritime\u0026nbspscenario, the stones would potentially have been moved by raft (or catamaran) down Pembrokeshire’s river Taf into the Bristol Channel and then along England’s river Avon to within 20 miles of the Salisbury Plain site earmarked for Stonehenge.In the second scenario, the stones would have had to be carried by stretcher or hauled on sledges (or possibly rollers) for long distances over often extremely challenging terrain (with only limited opportunities for river transport).This second method would certainly have had ostentatious political and ideological advantages – but it would have required vast amounts of manpower, time, effort and intertribal or interclan acquiescence.The discovery of the stone quarrying tools, which date\u0026nbspto the approximate time of the construction of the first stone phase of the monument (c 2900BC), proves\u0026nbspbeyond reasonable doubt for the first time\u0026nbspthat Neolithic people quarried the Welsh stones that ended up being used to build the world’s most famous prehistoric temple.But why did the builders of Stonehenge want to get their standing stones from 175 miles away when they could have used perfectly good local stones from Salisbury Plain?The answer is probably genealogical. Chemical\u0026nbspsignatures found in the bones of early Stonehenge people\u0026nbspsuggest many of those iniduals were originally from western Britain,\u0026nbspnot from Salisbury Plain. It is therefore conceivable that the stones of early Stonehenge were brought to Salisbury Plain from the area associated with the builders’ ancestors.Fascinatingly, in much later (medieval) Arthurian literature, the stones of Stonehenge are said to have been brought by the magician Merlin from the far west (although, in the legend, from Ireland, rather than southwest Wales).The fact that the stones were brought from Pembrokeshire to Salisbury Plain raises another key mystery. If indeed they were transported to their new home as clan or tribal heirlooms, then it suggests they already possessed great significance. And that implies the possibility that they had already functioned as a ritual monument (ie\u0026nbspas standing stones) in Wales, long before they were taken to Salisbury Plain.So the big archaeological question is whether the initial stones of Stonehenge were second hand or freshly quarried for use so far away. If the former theory is correct, then the original Stonehenge was actually in Pembrokeshire – not in England. The hunt is therefore now on for the original site of this potential Welsh proto-Stonehenge.Without doubt Salisbury Plain’s world-famous prehistoric temple still holds many secrets – but archaeological research over the coming years is likely to reveal them.British people ‘more familiar with Eiffel Tower than Stonehenge’Groundbreaking research reveals origins of people who built StonehengeThousands gather for summer solstice sunrise at Stonehenge Stonehenge tunnel ‘could destroy traces of human life from Ice Age’Congestion expert warns worst Christmas jams will be at StonehengeThe discovery of the quarrying tools – published today in the British archaeological journal\u0026nbspAntiquity –\u0026nbsphas been made by a team of archaeologists and geologists from UCL, Bournemouth University, the University of Southampton, the University of the Highlands and Islands and the National Museum of Wales.Professor\u0026nbspPearson said: “What’s really exciting about these discoveries is that they take us a step closer to unlocking Stonehenge’s greatest mystery – why its stones came from so far away.“Every other Neolithic monument in Europe was built of megaliths brought from no more than 10 miles away. We’re now looking to find out just what was so special about the Preseli Hills 5,000 years ago, and whether there were any important stone circles here, built before the bluestones were moved to Stonehenge.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

But Philip Hammond, on a subsequent visit to Beijing, declared: “I was privileged earlier this year to represent the UK at the first Belt and Road forum and one of the things we will discuss is the opportunity for closer collaboration in delivering the ambitions of the Belt and Road programme.”The Royal United Services Institute (Rusi) report –\u0026nbsp“UK Vulnerable to Chinese Influence and Interference Operations”\u0026nbsp– calls for scrutiny of the “risk of financial dependencies being set up through consultancies offered to retired politicians, who the CCP\u0026nbsphopes will push a sympathetic narrative.“The case of former British prime minister David Cameron, who is involved in a large China fund which aims to invest $1bn\u0026nbspin BRI projects, has gained some attention.“The question of ‘elite capture’ by the CCP has not been closely examined. It should be, including the issue of how much time should elapse between government service and working for Chinese state or quasistate organisations.”There is no suggestion in the report that the Chinese have tried to influence Mr Cameron.Turkey risks angering China by criticising treatment of Uighur MuslimsTrump \u0027most excited\u0027 about death penalty for drug dealers in ChinaChina’s birth rate falls to lowest level in modern historyVideo of Muslim poet ‘jailed for song’ proves he’s alive, China saysThe Rusi document, compiled by Charles Parton, a former diplomat, states: “The UK’s departure from the EU may increase the Chinese Communist Party’s desire to interfere, as it seeks to implement further a ide-and-rule\u0026nbspstrategy, aimed at imposing its global vision and promoting its interests”.The report calls for the development of “systems to prevent non-transparent financing of political activities and lobbying by CCP-backed iniduals and organisations the ultimate donor should be clear, even when monies are channelled through British citizens.”There are differences, on the whole, between the types of interference by the Kremlin and Beijing, according to the report.“Except in the sphere of espionage and cyberattacks, CCP interference is not of the Russian kind, which is more deliberately hostile, even destructive. It is more subtle, incremental and often under the radar, although it is occasionally brazen.”The main goal, it is held, is to promote a “ruthless advancement of China’s interests and values at the expense of those of the west, including through actions which encourage self-censorship and self-limiting policies”.It points, as an example, to universities and research centres where “junior academics often self-censor to avoid having access to research opportunities withdrawn. Chinese interference in academic freedom also extends to putting pressure on academics, born in China and working in the UK to support the CCP line”.There must be great caution, the report maintains, in allowing Chinese participation in the UK’s critical national infrastructure.CCP interference is not of the Russian kind, which is more deliberately hostile, even destructive. It is more subtle, incremental and often under the radar, although it is occasionally brazenThe search for an optimistic post-Brexit future must not blind the UK to the risks involved, the report cautions. “The UK needs to realise that behind the enticing, but essentially meaningless, language of ‘win-win’ or ‘shared future for mankind’ lies a ruthless CCP agenda to advance its and China’s interests.”“The UK will not change that, but its aim must be to channel it into a genuinely balanced relationship. In achieving that, language is important: if there must be talk of ‘the Golden Era’ (and within China, the phrase does help UK interests), the UK should not allow it to cloud its perceptions. The UK’s goal must be genuine reciprocity and an equal, mature and comprehensive relationship.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

We don’t believe they’ll get a No Deal exit either, and eventhey did the short-term chaos would kill their party.Instead Parliament would postpone Brexit, possibly finishing the Tories for a generation. This current purgatory would go on for months longer — maybe long enough for Remainers to reverse the referendum result.The Government would have failed in its only mission. It would instead have undermined our democracy and ensured bitter isions that would never heal.The one person unable to compromise, oddly, is the Prime Minister. Because what Brussels, Labour and Tory Remainers glibly ask of her, a permanent customs union, ALSO wrecks her party and destroys Brexit’s economic case.It was folly to expect the Tory ERG group to vote to “take No Deal off the table” on Thursday night. Logic was on their side, at least.But they need to think hard now how they will feel on March Brexit is put off and they are blamed. If they have opened the door to a toxic, anti-Semitic, anti-Western Labour rabble so crazed by ideology they cannot even allow Winston Churchill’s historic defeat of Nazism to trump his other failings.A party committed to massive tax rises, maybe even a  per cent windfall levy on anyone’s “wealth”. A party led by pension-age Marxist revolutionaries friendly to Putin, Hamas, the IRA and hard-left dictators but hard on private enterprise, job-creation and free speech.We sincerely hope Labour moderates stop dithering and resign to undermine Corbyn and McDonnell. We marvel that so many can still stomach these sinister men poised to do unimaginable harm.But eventhey can’t grasp that, Tory Brexiteers can. And we say this to them:Wake up.

And it was an old-school print journalist, the brilliant Anthony Loyd of The Times, who found Begum in a Syrian refugee camp containing almost , people.Loyd’s interview with her is a gripping insight into the twisted mind of a British youngster who ran off to join IS’s murderous caliphate. And the BBC had bugger all to do with it.While BBC staffers were sipping their skinny lattes and nibbling almond croissants in Broadcasting House, a journalist from The Times got his scoop the hard way, tramping into a chaotic refugee camp in one of the most dangerous parts of the world.Why does this matter  Because this country has one of the most vibrant newspaper industries on the planet.And the bloated, over-funded BBC is KILLING it.The Cairncross Review, a Government report into the future of UK journalism, revealed this week how tax-dodging tech giants Facebook and Google, together with the publicly-funded BBC are annihilating our free Press.They have already destroyed what was once affectionately known as “the local rag”.Over the past seven years, hundreds of local papers have shut down and thousands of regional journalists have lost their jobs. , journalists worked on local newspapers in  — now it is just ,. And it is your money that bankrolls the BBC.At a time when the BBC is contem­plating ditching free TV licences for the over-s, the debate we should REALLY be having is about how much of your money we should be chucking at Auntie.We have a great newspaper industry and it is worth preserving.Because it wasn’t the BBC that broke the story of MPs fiddling their expenses — it was a newspaper . And it wasn’t the BBC that broke the story about charity Age UK receiving £million from an energy company to flog gas and electricity to pensioners — it was a newspaper .It wasn’t the BBC that dared to publish the names of the killers of Stephen Lawrence — it was a newspaper .And what was the most-read story on the BBC last year  Strictly minx Katya Jones snogging Seann Walsh  — a Sun on Sunday exclusive.The BBC, like Facebook and Google, is a parasite that lives off the flesh of real news-gatherers.What makes the BBC dferent from the tax-dodging tech giants is that we love it. And you can’t grow up in this country and not have a deep and abiding affection for the BBC.I have endless happy memories of the BBC — from Match Of The Day to Top Of The Pops, from David Attenborough documentaries to The Likely Lads, from Fawlty Towers to the Hairy Cornflake.But the BBC has got far too big, far too bloated and far too wealthy.Lord Reith, the visionary behind it, wanted our state broadcaster to “inform, educate and entertain”. Lord Reith never dreamed of a state broadcaster that was all-powerful.The BBC gets far too much of your money and spends it far too easily. Why does the BBC need to be over every nook and cranny of the internet To the generation growing up on Netflix and YouTube with an entire universe on their smartphones, the BBC pocketing more than £ a year from everyone with a TV set is absurd.The BBC has got too big for its publicly-funded boots.That’s what we should be talking about — not the merits of free TV licences for granny and grandad!The Cairncross Review told how the BBC’s expansionist online empire has come very close to destroying the local newspaper industry.Are we really going to keep giving the BBC £billion every year so it can do the same to the national newspaper industry In the same week as the Cairncross Review came out, Bruce Sharma, , fought off thieves armed with a hammer and a machete with just his rolled-up copy of The Sun.Bruce was reading The Sun in Ram Stores in Long Eaton, Derbys, when the hooded pair burst in demanding money. “Instinct took over and I tried to whack them with the paper,” says Bruce.You can’t do that with a TV licence.GORDON Banks lit up my childhood.For my generation – a wide-eyed kid on that magical summer’s day in  – those World Cup winners will always feel like family.Gordon never got a knighthood.

But Banks collects him with his left hand under the mutt’s chest and his right hand on the dog’s butt – a perfect catch.Rest in peace, Gordon. Always England’s No.LABOUR’S John McDonnell, who has spent his political career licking the boots of the IRA, describes Winston Churchill as a “villain”.Not the same Churchill who inspired this country when we stood alone against Nazi Germany’s subjugation of Europe  Yes, that’s the chap.IRA groupie McDonnell reckons the greatest Englishman in history was a villain because Winnie sent troops to Wales during a miners’ strike in .History tells us that Churchill was reluctant to involve troops in a miners’ strike.But why bother with the facts The likes of John McDonnell despise this country, our heroes, our history and believe the British are always the wicked ones.Even when fighting for our lives against Hitler!GAVIN “Mad Dog” Williamson, our gung-ho Defence Secretary, says excitedly that the RAF will get “swarm squadrons” of drones to confuse enemy defences.Mad Dog is full of ideas about how the UK is ready to use “hard power” against Russia and China.Williamson’s moronic sabre-rattling disturbs real soldiers.“We don’t want a war in the South China Sea,” says Admiral Lord West of Spithead, a former head of the Royal Navy, who counsels against “talking wildly and loosely” about fighting China.Now Williamson’s macho posturing is causing our country harm.China’s Deputy Prime Minister, Hu Chunhua, was due to hold trade talks with Chancellor Philip Hammond but cancelled the meeting because our Mad Dog Defence Secretary had been ranting about China’s military ambitions.The UK does not want to fight a war with China and Russia, Mad Dog. We want to TRADE with them.Memo to Mrs May – your Defence Secretary is a national embarrassment.“I have a little wine with meals, and a Guinness or a beer or two, but otherwise no.

However, the door should be left open for hershe shows heartfelt contrition and agrees to speak out on behalf of our nation against radicalisation.She has to be investigated for any criminal actions she has undertaken.

This means controlling her movement, access to the Internet and to whom she comes into contact with.

The gaping wounds left by this internal conflict could soon prove fatal to him.There were sharp intakes of breath yesterday when seven moderate Labour MPs announced they have resigned to set up a new Independent Group.Their number may be small — and none of them, except perhaps Chuka Umunna, may be household names — but their move is certain to have a huge impact on British politics.It throws the Opposition into chaos.  Beleaguered by dismal poll ratings, serial incompetence, isions over Brexit and accusations of extremism, Corbyn will now come under brutal pressure.The Gang of Seven’s decision to quit will feed into the narrative that he is a Marxist mediocrity, whose toxic spell at the helm since  has not only dragged his party to the lunatic fringe but has also allowed vicious anti-Semitism and intolerance to flourish.The seven splitters made precisely those charges yesterday, using language that  will be gleefully exploited by Labour’s opponents.Luciana Berger, the MP for Liverpool Wavertree who has endured death threats and deselection attempts from socialist zealots, said she would be “sickened and ashamed to remain in the Labour Party” because of the  “culture of bullying, bigotry and intimidation”.Equally powerful was Chris Leslie,  the Nottingham East MP, who argued that Labour had been “hijacked by the machine politics of the hard Left”, peddling “abuse and hatred”.Labour’s turmoil follows the battering that Corbyn received in a new book by investigative journalist Tom Bower.With a wealth of shocking details, it exposes the full scale of the Labour leader’s dreary left-wing fanaticism, his links to anti-Semitism, his anti-British instincts and his low intellectual calibre.As the book graphically demonstrates, never was there any politician less fitted for the premiership.Given the y charge sheet against Corbyn, it is amazing that the party split did not happen earlier. But the moderates hung on in the forlorn hope that Corbyn might change or that Labour might move back towards the centre ground.There was never any chance of that.Corbyn and his dogmatic followers are not interested in compromise or debate — only in enforcement of their warped ideology.  They have turned what was once a broad church into a narrow personality cult.In fact, many Corbynites, like a kind of Trotskyite Taliban, welcome the split because they see it as an opportunity to rid the socialist creed of impurities.“Though cowards flinch and traitors sneer, we’ll keep the Red Flag flying here,” screeched the infantile Young Labour movement.Yet the charge of cowardice is an absurd one to make at the splitters.It took courage to quit. Most of them had relatively safe Labour seats. Yet they have put their political careers and livelihoods at risk in protest at Corbyn.In addition, they will be forced to endure a barrage of abuse from party members, since Labour is a profoundly tribal movement, where betrayal is regarded as the darkest sin of all.But this will only be the start of a major rebellion against Corbyn.To the Gang of Seven can be added three other moderate former Labour MPs who already sit as Independents, namely Frank Field, Ivan Lewis and John Woodcock, who describes Corbyn as “a clear risk to national security”.Public interest in the new group is strong. By early yesterday evening they had gained , followers on Twitter.And more Labour MPs are likely to resign, emboldened by the Gang Of Seven.  It should be remembered that in  no fewer than  Labour MPs —  per cent of the parliamentary party — openly declared their lack of confidence in Corbyn’s leadership.Tellingly, Tom Watson, the Deputy Leader, said in a bitter swipe at Corbyn yesterday that he “no longer recognised” his own party and merely condemned the defections as “premature”.Even with its modest beginnings, the Independent Group launch represents the biggest split in British politics since the formation of the SDP in , when Labour was lurching to the Left under Michael Foot. But the parallel with the SDP also highlights the weakness of the new group.The SDP was headed by the big figures of Roy Jenkins, David Owen and Shirley Williams, all experienced Cabinet Ministers and potential premiers.There is no one remotely of that stature among the new Independents.Their most high-profile member, Umunna, briefly ran for the Labour leadership in  but withdrew at the first whf of media scrutiny.Nor does the Independent Group have a coherent set of policies beyond being anti-Corbyn and pro-EU.In contrast, the SDP had a clear stance in favour of Britain’s nuclear deterrent, Common Market membership and the market economy.The splitters’ claim to be standing up for democracy is also weakened by their reluctance to accept the result of the  EU referendum, the greatest democratic exercise in British political history. Indeed, in their Remoaner posturing, there is an unpleasant air of the narrow, metropolitan progressive elite about their operation so far.Nevertheless,they help to prevent the election of Corbyn, they will do a service to British politics, just as the SDP helped to halt the advance of Foot almost  years ago. If the new Independent Group is really to reshape the British political landscape, it will have to be far more than just a narrow, elitist breakaway from Labour.A burst of anti-Corbyn hype is not enough. To become an authentic third force that dominates the centre, it will have to attract MPs from other parties.That means taking over the increasingly moribund Lib Dems, now led by the ineffectual Sir Vince Cable.More importantly, it   requires winning over Left-inclined Tories and anti-Brexit MPs such as the noisy Anna Soubry and the former GP Sarah Wollaston.Gaining Conservative support was precisely what the SDP failed to do, ultimately dooming it to failure. Just one Tory MP, Christopher Brocklebank-Fowler, became a Social Democrat.Gang of Seven member Gavin Shuker said that Labour had “turned its back on the British public”.He is absolutely right — which is  why Corbyn’s mob must not be allowed near power. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

OK, give up.Unless, of course, you live in the constituency of Ilford South, in which case you’ll hopefully recognise Mike Gapes, the man who’s been your MP for the past  years.But otherwise, therein lies the problem for the new “Independent Group” of seven MPs who have courageously quit Corbyn’s “institutionally anti-Semitic” Labour party – most of us will only recognise two of them, Chuka Umunna and Luciana Berger.And until some recognisable big hitters jump ship, they’ll struggle to gain traction with an electorate that – regardless of being left or right wing – currently feels that all politicians blend into one.In the meantime the, er, magnicent seven are in search of a catchy name, and of course, New Labour isn’t an option – not least because they are branding themselves as centrist and hoping to attract disaffected MPs from other parties too.“Central Perk” perhaps  “Middle-earth” “Centre Forward” with Alan Shearer as brand ambassador Suggestions on a sustainable postcard please.Ditto. Same goes for simply slicing out the green bits on a loaf of bread and consuming milk eggs that are out of date but pass the all-important snf test.All of which makes my ­millennial offspring recoil in disgust.Asked where fond jam-maker Jeremy ­Corbyn stands on this isive issue, a s­pokesman says: “He personally never gets to the point of scraping or ­chucking mould.”Yawn.As one wag pointed out, it’s a blatant attempt to appear superior without actually ­settling the issue in question.Much like his position on Brexit.Talking of which, doesn’t the impasse on Brexit merely reflect how reliant the majority of politicians have become on the EU telling them what they can and can’t do And that now they have to make decisions themselves, the leadership skills required to do so are sorely lacking ROLLING Stone Keith Richards says he is ­cleaning up his ­lestyle.“I’ve knocked the hard stuff on the head,” he declares.So what does his tough new health regime involve Er, “a little wine with meals, and a Guinness or a beer or two”, no exercise, as he doesn’t want to ­damage his jointsand a continuing cigarette habit because “I just pick them up and light them without thinking about it”.Bless him.When it comes to clean ­living, he makes Rab C Nesbitt look like Elle Macpherson.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They will sit as ‘Independents’.But speaking yesterday Mr Umunna said the seven hoped to register as a new political party “by the end of the year”.

Another linked with leaving, ex-Tory Minister Nick Boles said suggestions he could walk were “b*****ks”.Amid the bitter fallout from Tuesday’s historic announcement, Labour’s Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell struck a conciliatory tone yesterday by admitting Labour had to “reach out” to stop others leaving.But it emerged party chairman Ian Lavery had already written to members in each of the seven MP’s constituencies to start the process for selecting new Labour candidates in each patch. And ex-‘Militant’ Derek Hatton incensed moderate MPs by saying the seven “must resign” and fight by-elections on his first day back as a Labour Party member.Speaking in London yesterday Jeremy Corbyn said he “regretted” the decision by the seven to go.  But he side-stepped questions about whether he would act on Deputy Leader Tom Watson’s demands and shake up his Shadow Cabinet team. Last night it emerged Mr Watson has been shut out of Labour’s Shadow Cabinet discussions on Brexit.Mr Corbyn said: “I recognise that being leader of the party means you have got to take people with you, and I am determined to do that so that we can – when an election comes – present those policies to the public as a whole.”Business Minister Richard Harrington - an ardent Europhile - yesterday said he “perfectly understands” why the Labour ‘Gang of Seven’ left.  Challenged whether he could join her said his battle was inside the Conservative Party.  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He added: “I believe that will become the Plan B.”And in a sign of the open revolt the PM faces next week, his boss the Business Secretary Greg Clark declared the failure to rule out no deal as “unacceptable”.He told the conference: “A situation in which our manufacturers don’t have the certainty that they need about the terms under which over two-thirds of our trade will be conducted in less than  days time is unacceptable.“It needs to be brought to a conclusion and without further delay.”Issuing a rallying cry to Tory Remainers, Sir John said at an event at the University of Glasgow last night: “Within a few days, Members of Parliament will make decisions that will determine all our futures.“I believe we have a right to expect them to vote for an outcome that best protects the future welfare and prosperity of our nation – without fear or favour, and without deference to Party allegiance.”Sir John also branded members of the Brexiteer ERG group of Tory MPs “zealots” who are determining Government policy through “intransigence”.He claimed the “extreme” members of the ERG had no affinity to tolerant conservatism.The former PM said: “In Parliament, the European Research Group has become a party within a party, with its own whips, its own funding and its own priorities.“Some of its more extreme members have little or no affinity to moderate, pragmatic and tolerant Conservatism.“The ERG does not represent a majority view but - with a minority Government, as now - can determine policy simply by being intransigent: which is precisely what it is doing.“Some - who can fairly be called zealots - seem incapable of looking beyond the one issue of Europe.“It’s not just that it dominates their thinking - it seems to obsess them.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

However, the EU shot down her hopes of progress on thrashing out plans to resolve the Irish backstop, the insurance policy aimed at preventing a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic in the event of no agreement on a future relationship.   Commission spokesman Margaritis Schinas insisted Brussels was not prepared to give ground on Mrs May’s key demands - either to include an exit clause or a time limit on the backstop or to replace it with an alternative arrangement. “The EU will not reopen the withdrawal agreement. We cannot accept a time limit to the backstop or a unilateral exit clause,” he said. “Further talks will be held this week to see whether a way through can be found that would gain the broadest possible support in the UK Parliament and respect the guidelines agreed by the European Council. “We are listening and working with the UK Government to see how we can work for an orderly withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union on March . That is where we are.” Mrs May’s spokesman said: “There is a process of engagement going on. “Tomorrow is obviously a signicant meeting between the Prime Minister and President Juncker as part of that process.”  He added: “It is still the position of the European Union that they want the United Kingdom to leave with a deal because they acknowledge that is in the interests of the European Union.”Earlier, Labour accused the Government of “wandering in the wilderness” as ministers were pressed to reveal what progress has been made in Brexit negotiations.Shadow Solicitor General Nick Thomas-Symonds said with  days until the UK leaves the EU, “we are nowhere nearer to having any further clarity on this issue”. He added: “We are about to make a momentous decision on the future of our country. The Government needs to be clear with this House as to precisely what its strategy is. “Running down the clock is reckless and irresponsible. Surely this nation deserves better than a Government wandering in the wilderness, not even sure about what its next move is.” Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay last night told Sky News the UK would take new legal proposals out to the EU. He also confirmed the Malthouse Compromise plan would only form part of future relationship discussions rather than the withdrawal strategy. But Brexiteer Steve Baker, who is one of those involved in the compromise, insisted the plan was alive and kicking. Meanwhile, farming leaders warned a no-deal Brexit is the “stuff of nightmares”. National Farmers’ Union president Minette Batters said it was “absolutely shocking” it was unclear what trade conditions farmers would face. “Leaving the EU without a deal would be a catastrophe for British farming,” she told the NFU annual conference in Birmingham. Environment Secretary Michael Gove warned that leaving without a deal would trigger “signicant costs to our economy - and in particular to farming and food production”. Warning of high tarfs for sheep and beef exports to the EU and new border checks, he added: “Small businesses, and small livestock farmers, would be inescapably the worst hit.” No-one should be “blithe or blase about the consequences”, he said.

Some critics were believed to have made formal complaints to the Conservative Party asking for an disciplinary probe. But the Conservative Party today said his actions are ineligible for an investigation under the partys Code of Conduct - because the Code doesnt cover Parliamentary proceedings. A Conservative spokesman told the Mirror: “The Conservative party will examine complaints in line with our Code of Conduct procedures. However Parliamentary proceedings do not fall under the remit of the Code.”   It comes after a reply to an apparent complainant was handed to BuzzFeed News. The leaked message said: I have decided to dismiss your complaint because it does not fall under the Code. The Code states in no way should anything in this code interfere with an elected representative carrying out his or her duties and exercising his or her judgment in relation to his or her work. Sir Christopher Chope was carrying out his duties and exercising his judgment when he voted and commented as he did. A Tory spokeswoman refused to comment on leaks. At the time of Sir Christophers actions Nimco Ali, founder of the Daughters of Eve charity, called for Sir Christopher’s deselection and tweeted: “What we need to change is some of the people sitting in the Commons and the Lords who are not fit for the roles they hold.” His actions were condemned by fellow Tories including his neighbouring MP Simon Hoare who tweeted: “It’s time he considered his position and frankly buggered off. Home secretary Sajid Javid said he was “very disappointed” in Sir Christopher’s objection and pledged: “We will do all we can to protect girls at risk.” The government’s chief whip Julian Smith MP tweeted: “Working to find ways ASAP to bring back FGM Bill in Government time – confident we can do so.”  The backbench Bill would make it easier for judges to step in and place child victims of the practice in care - taking them away from their parents. The Bill was fully approved by the House of Lords in November - but because it was not proposed by the government, received only limited debating time in the Commons. The government is now bringing forward anti-FGM proposals in its own time, making them far more likely to pass. Sir Christopher previously failed to comment when approached by the Mirror. But he told the Dailyhe was in favour of the FGM legislation but wanted it to be debated properly by MPs. He said: “It is a fundamental point… Even the Government insists on having its own Bills debated on second reading. Asked about his response to the criticism from the Cabinet ministers, he said: It is a pity they are indulging in virtue-signalling rather than looking at the substance. He added: My constituents know what I am doing. We are having letters saying what is Parliamentary democracy all about  I object to Bills going through undebated at second reading.

Angela Smith said yesterday that comparisons with the SDP do not “stand up to scrutiny”.  “This is a dferent century and the challenges that the country faces are on a scale that I don’t think we have seen at any other time in the post-war period,” she said. There is no doubt that Brexit is testing traditional political allegiances. Many voters now identy themselves by how they voted in the referendum, rather than by which party they tend to support.  But it is far from certain this upheaval will lead to a redrawing of the political map. Historian Dr Matt Cole, from Birmingham University, said: “The inidual MPs have a steep hill to climb, it is rarely successful. “The culture of British politics is one in which the main political parties, however unpopular they are, nonetheless are incredibly resilient. “They are like a company that nobody likes the products of, but they can’t stop buying them.” The two main parties’ joint vote in  was the highest since , he said. There may be, as Ms Smith said, a large number of people who feel politically homeless. But evenyou provide then with a new house the chances of breaking the two-party monopoly are slim.  Unlike in , the seven dissident MPs cannot claim to be political heavyweights. The founders of the SDP included Roy Jenkins, a former Chancellor and Home Secretary, David Owen, a former Foreign shySecretary, and Shirley Williams, a former Education Secretary. The highest rank achieved by Chuka Ummuna was shadow Business Secretary under Ed Miliband. At the moment, the Independent Group lacks all the components required to form a new party – a grassroots base, money and a distinct agenda. The MPs were brutally honest in saying what they were against: the failure to tackle anti-Semitism the hard Left’s grip on the party machine the lukewarm opposition to Brexit.  They were less clear when it came to spelling out what they did stand for. But this does not mean the Labour leadership has nothing to fear from the breakaway. The centrist seven could be joined by other MPs, including Conservatives, and their message may shyresonate with disillusioned Labour councillors, activists and voters. Which is why many expected a stronger response from the Labour leadership to the most serious fracturing of the party in almost  years. It was moment when the party’s MPs and activists looked for reassurance and direction. Instead, Mr Corbyn issued a tersely worded statement expressing his disappointment and sent an email to members urging them to stay united.  There should have been, at the very least, an acknowledgement that the criticisms made by the departing seven would have chimed with many Labour MPs and supporters. Those who may still quit need to hear from the Labour leader why they should stay. It was left to Deputy Leader Tom Watson to try to articulate the mood of a dismayed and anxious party. His warning that unless things change others could follow the seven out of the door was a direct challenge to Corbyn. Labour could only prevent others from leaving, Watson said,we “reach out and extend beyond our comfort zone”.  There was also a more veiled message that the leadership needed to listen to the Parliamentary Labour Party on Brexit. It was noticeable that in his email to party members, Mr Corbyn reaffirmed that the option of a second referendum remained on the table. Some believe that unless he follows through on this demand then other MPs could join the nascent Independent Group. How the leadership responds will be a major factor in determining whether the breakaway MPs are a flash in the pan or a new movement. If allies of Corbyn turn viciously on the quitters they will confirm their reasons for leaving and could encourage others to follow.  The leadership must ask itself why moderate MPs feel they can no longer stay in the party and respond to concerns about Brexit and anti-Semitism. At stake is Labour’s chance of winning the next election. In dozens of marginal seats the Independent Group could split the opposition vote and allow the Tories to keep power. The legacy of the SDP was to force Labour to sht to the centre, where elections are usually won or lost. Today’s seven MPs may have decided to sacrice their careers for the same ambition.

Tragic superhero Brett Kinloch, , died the same day that his we Nicola went into labour with their third daughter. He had been fighting a brain tumour for four years. Nicola, her mum Jill, and newborn baby Ariya were on the motorway to see Brett just  minutes after giving birth. The mother-of-three gave birth to their daughter at Luton and Dunstable Hospital, Bedfordshire, last Monday and drove  miles to see Brett at Milton Keynes Hospital. Nicola, , said: It sounds horric but it could have been a lot worse - she could have been born  hours later. I take a lot of comfort in the fact he did meet her. I laid her on top of him and she had a cuddle. He could hear what was going on and he knew we were there, Ill always be grateful for that.   Nicola and her daughters - Freya, four, Ella,  months, and newborn Ariya - have been comforted with round-the-clock support from family, friends and the community. The mother-of-three added: I can never thank the NHS enough - the call-out doctor called Tim who kept Brett alive, the paramedics that took him over there - there were nurses from all areas of the hospital that just wanted to do everything they could. The midwives Hayley and Laura at LD Hospitalworked tirelessly and compassionately to get me on the road as soon as possible. There was no-one at the NHS who didnt go above and beyond to help us.   Brett, from Northampton, was a PE teacher and head of department at Cedars Upper School in Leighton Buzzard, Beds. Brett and Nicola met when they began their PE teacher careers at Milton Keynes Academy, Beds., in . The father-of-three learned of his grade  glioblastoma brain tumour four years ago - shortly after the birth of his eldest daughter, Freya. Brett was originally given a prognosis of just  months but Brett battled hard to recover and the family raised money for treatment abroad. But just before Christmas last year, while Nicola was expecting their third child, the couple received the heart-breaking news that Bretts tumour had regrown. The family were told that the tumour was in an area of the brain that was inoperable and Bretts condition deteriorated. Before he died, Brett told his young family that everything is going to be okay - things will be dferent but they will be okay. Nicola said: Brett never never made excuses and he lived le to the full. He was still working three weeks before he died, he wanted to provide for his family. He loved le and he never made excuses, never let [his illness] stop him living. We went on holidays abroad, we took the kids to Disneyland. Even when he could no longer drive, he got a bus pass and would take Freya out. Speaking about her three daughters, Nicola added: Freya is absolutely devastated. We lost my grandmother last year and so she has some understanding of what it is to lose someone. She used to call him her superhero handsome prince and they did everything together - he was such a good dad. A family friend also paid tribute to the fantastic care that Nicola gave to her husband throughout his illness. Nicola said: The offers of help and support from our family, friends and even complete strangers have been so lovely and humbling - I appreciate every one of them. Brain Tumour Research have been thanked for their ongoing support and the family wishes to highlight the charitys Wear a Hat Day on March .An online fundraiser for the Kinloch family has also been set up at www.gofundme support-the-kinloch-family .In just five days, the page has already raised pound, of its pound, goal.

The men can be seen fighting each other during the clash, which is believed to have been filmed in Saxon Road, Luton. In the shocking clip, a terried woman can be heard desperately screaming for help as a thug repeatedly bashes another man in the head with the baseball bat. The incident is believed to have taken place last week, although the reasons behind the fight are not clear. The video - filmed by an unknown bystander from their residential window - begins with the five men fighting by a parked car.    A pair of thugs, one of which is wielding a baseball bat forcibly kick and drag a male passenger out of the parked car and pull him on to the street. Another man tries to fight off the two men and this prompts th assailants to punch him instead. As the male passenger is carried to safety by someone , thugs start savagely attacking and kicking the man. One of the the yobs starts repeatedly beating the man across his head with the baseball bat. The petried female car passenger can be heard screaming: Stop! Please! as the pair of assailants beat the man with the bat and he cowers in pain. Another woman can be heard yelling: Call the Police! as the violence intensies.   Suddenly the filming residents shouts at the men Yo! Relax! as the video cuts to an end. A spokesman for Bedfordshire Police said: We take reports of violence on our streets incredibly seriously, and wont tolerate this kind of behaviour or the use of weapons. Wed urge anyone who witnesses incidents like this to report it to us so we can investigate to try and find those responsible, ensuring they arent able to cause further harm.  The street where this incident is believed to have taken place saw serious violence back in September. Gangs armed with baseball bat and knives clashed and left a teenager fighting for his le. Following the street fight, it was reported that six other people, including three teenagers, were taken for further treatment with serious injuries, including stab wounds. Earlier this month, Chief Constable of Bedfordshire Police, John Boutcher told Conservative MP for South West Bedfordshire, Andrew Selous how the county literally ran out of officers on the day of the brawl and was unable cover incidents after a spate of crime across the area.

After receiving three messages from the stranger, Mary, who was also married to someone  at the time, responded to let Peter know he must have the wrong number. But their relationship soon blossomed over text messages and the pair confided each about their failing relationships - until Peter travelled from Bolton, Lancashire, to stay with Mary and her then husband.   When Peters we found out about their friendship and Mary eventually split from her own partner, the pair realised that fate had brought them together. Despite the unusual method of meeting and the -year age gap, the couple claim their shared sense of humour ensures they are well matched. Mary, from Newcastle, Tyne and Wear, said: It was fate that brought us together. When I first received Peters messages, I just ignored them - I had no idea who they were from. I was receiving messages in the early hours of the morning because Peter worked at a similar time to me and thought he was texting his we. Then one day I had the courage to say Im sorry, but I dont know who you are and he apologised. But we kept in touch on and off about our days after realising we both worked similar hours. We chatted about what was going on in our lives and eventually got round to talking about our relationships at the time.  It turned out Peter was having the same problems in his relationship too and we used each other as a backbone really. After over a year of texting and talking on the phone as just friends, Peter had a blazing row with his we and came to stay with Mary and her then-husband. Mary said: Peter came up for a couple of days after an argument with his we and he stayed at my house with me and my husband. Before he came to Newcastle hed only sent me one photograph of himself and his son at his wedding - thats all Id seen. But I knew he was in need and after talking to my ex-husband, he suggested he came and stayed with us. There was nothing romantic at that point. He tried to get his head together while I just got on with my normal routine. After Peter went back to his hometown of Bolton in March , he left his we a couple of weeks later and went to stay with a friend. In July, Mary left her husband and went to stay with her sister, while Peter decided to move up to Newcastle to be near her - although they insist they were only friends at this point.  It wasnt until later that year that the couples friendship evolved into something more as they helped each other through orces and decided to take a trip to Blackpool. On their , they finally decided to give their relationship a go. Mary said: We didnt decide what was going on until we went to Blackpool just to seewe could work as a couple. At first I thought the age dference would be an issue but it wasnt. We had a lot in common, the same sense of humour and most importantly I trusted him to keep me safe. Its been a lucky escape to a better place. People are always so shocked when we tell them how we met. Theres a girl at work this week who asked Peter - she couldnt believe it. In , after  years together, Mary and Peter finally married at a low-key ceremony surrounded by close friends and family. Mary said: Everything was lovely. I didnt have a new dress - I had a dress that had been made for me previously. Peter had a kilt from his first wedding so we had that all dismantled.   I made the flowers myself and all the button holes for the men. I also made my own wedding cake. Our wedding song goes back to the time we actually met - it was Daniel Bedingfields I Will Never Leave Your Side. Peter, who now works at the same supermarket as Mary in Newcastle, split up with his we after she reportedly became jealous of their friendship. He believes they grew together because of their shared sense of humour and similar experiences. Peter said: Id just bought a new phone so was saving my ex-wes number, but must have typed in the wrong digit. There was one number dferent between my we at the time and Marys numbers. Id sent a few messages and Mary eventually messaged back explaining Id got the wrong number. She explained who she was but I didnt mention it to my we because we were going through a bad patch. From the same day we started talking to each other. It was a case of messaging back and forth then. Eventually, my we found out about Mary but I was still keeping in touch and ringing her. She didnt like that - you can understand why. One day it just got too much and I left. I had to find somewhere to live. I had to sleep on my friends sofas for a couple of months until I could move up to Newcastle. I soon had a job lined up though and in July  I moved up there. I was in the flat for about  months until  when Mary and I got a house together. Weve got the same sense of humour and in the early days we could talk about the things that were going on in our lives. Thats how we grew closer.

The prison holding the British mum, , after she was sentenced to five years for spying has reneged on its promise to allow her important health checks. Bosses are demanding she first writes them a grovelling letter of apology over last month’s protest with fellow political prisoner Narges Mohammadi. Nazanin’s husband Richard Ratclfe said: “They were outraged by the idea they needed to personally apologise to be given health treatment.” Desperate Nazanin forfeited food for three days to demand denied medical care after finding lumps in both breasts, and suffering numbness and pain in her neck, arms and legs.  The pair ended their strike when the jail agreed to check-ups, but weeks later treatment has again been blocked. After the strike, Nazanin was allowed to visit the Iranian government-run Health Commission, where a neurologist suggested she was too ill to be in prison. But although doctors there ordered scans, the prison clinic has blocked them until they receive written apologies from both women. Nazanin’s extra plea to see a psychiatrist has not been met at all. Richard said yesterday: “The neuroshylogist said she clearly had a problem and needed scans. The next day she saw a doctor about the lumps and he said they needed to do scans.  “But the scans got blocked by the head of the clinic in the prison who told them they wouldn’t do anything until she had written a personal apology an apology for the ‘mistakes they made’, meaning the strike. I don’t think he’ll deign to name it.” He added: “The neurologist hit her with a hammer on the knee and there was no reaction at all. She had no grip in her hand as well. He said, ‘why are you even in prison in a condition like this ’” Richard explained the manipulation is all the more sickening because the Iranian ambassador is claiming Nazanin is receiving treatment. Nazanin and Narges have refused to write the letter. But Richard does not believe Nazanin has decided to strike again. “She is very low,” he said. “It’s not an act of defiance for her, it’s an act of despair. It’s more the sense of ‘What more can I do ’ She is really clear she can’t go on much longer.”  Nazanin was arrested at Tehran airport in April  and sentenced to five years on accusations of spying. Iranian prosecutors have told her it is connected to the repayment of a debt owed by Britain to Iran for a cancelled arms deal in the s but neither country has confirmed this. The charity worker, from London, had been visiting her parents on holiday with her daughter Gabriella. Gabriella, now four, lives with her maternal grandparents in Tehran so she can visit. But Richard has been refused a visa and has not seen his daughter or we since they left Britain. Nazanin’s despair increased last week after the th anniversary of the Iranian Revolution, a period of clemency when many prisoners were pardoned.  The next opportunity for clemency is the Iranian New Year, on March . Richard said: “I think she will keep going until New Year and then heaven help us what happens afterwards.” This week Gabriella gave a heartbreaking glimpse of le with her “daddy in London” and “mummy in prison”. Richard is keen she begin school in the UK this autumn, but knowing the importance of having her close to Nazanin, he has always told his we this is “her decision”. He fearsshe is not released next month, it will be an even harder one to make. “At the moment we are worrying about bringing them both home in March or dealing with the fallout in April,” Richard says. There is also the fear Gabriella may not be able to come home alone at all. “We have had mixed messages from the Iranian authorities,” he says. “The government insisting there is no impediment at all, and the judiciary saying they won’t let her go until her mother’s release. You can’t tell from rhetoric what will happen.” "},{"url":null,"title":"prince harry pleas support youth","story":"NewsPrince Harry pleads for support for youth centres that help feed kids in school holidaysPrince Harry spoke out during a visit to Streatham Youth and Community Trust’s John Corfield Centre in Streatham, South LondonShareCommentsByRussell Myers:,  FEB Updated:,  FEB NewsPrince Harry described youth centres as places where children can feel safe to discuss their concerns \"Get the biggest Royal Family stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe Duke of Sussex has called for more support for under-threat youth centres, as he praised the irreplaceable work that they do. Prince Harry made the plea as he visited a centre that runs a programme that helps to feed and entertain children during the school holidays. He spoke at Streatham Youth and Community Trust’s John Corfield Centre in Streatham, South London. The prince described youth centres as places where children can feel safe to discuss their concerns, which he said are exacerbated by technological advancements. He said of modern le: “We’re adding to social isolation – whether it’s the nine-year-old on the phone, or computer games – for young people nowadays to be caught up in a world like this, we are adding to a whole list of issues that already existed.  And then by closing places like this down – the one place which they really have to come and have a normal conversation about mental health, their lestyle, issues at home... “These places are a community hub. And I don’t think people over the years have understood or realised how vital this is to the younger generation.” Harry chatted with children and helped staff to dish out lunch at the centre, which runs the Fit And Fed programme. Launched by charity StreetGames, the scheme aims to tackle hunger, inactivity and isolation during the school holidays.

The Tornadoes are undertaking a tour of the UK that will overfly most RAF bases and other key sites associated with the aircraft.

Wing Commander James Heeps said: It is a great privilege to be part of a national event that allows the public to say farewell to a brilliant aircraft that has been the cornerstone of our operations for so many years. Its also a sad occasion because it will mean that from the end of next month the Tornado will never fly again.  Eight Tornadoes, which were stationed at RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus and used in the fight against Islamic State, ed home to RAF Marham, in Norfolk, earlier this month.

Rain is expected to hit tonight and into tomorrow, but it should become very mild by the weekend in warm southwesterly winds. The country will be on the edge of a ridge of high pressure which will lure the very mild flow towards the UK from south of the Azores, pushing temperatures to unseasonably mild levels.   The Weather Outlook forecaster Brian Gaze told The Sun : “Computer models show record C February temperatures are possible from the coming weekend. “Plumes of warm air from the Sahara are due in coming days and also in spring. C is certainly likely by April. “Theres a good chance of another fine summer due to the past  months’ continuing pattern of high pressure blocking, which brings hot conditions in summer.”   Record February highs are possible with some computer models suggesting it could reach C by Saturday - compared to a usual -C for the time of year, the Weather Channel said. The record temperature for February is .C set in  and forecasters have predicted values could even rival that level in some spots.

Tara Gratton, , claims doctors were baffled by her partially formed vagina before she was diagnosed with Mayer-Rokitansky-K ster-Hauser syndrome . Its a congenital disorder that affects the female reproductive system. After being diagnosed with the most severe form aged , the support worker was told she had no vaginal tunnel, no womb, no cervix, no fallopian tubes, and only one kidney. Tara was left devastated after realising shed never be able to carry her own child but after meeting partner, Stuart Pretswell, , the couple began researching their options.   She opted to have her vaginal tunnel rebuilt through using her bowel as a teenager and is now on the waiting list for a womb transplant - with the couple now hoping, through using her own eggs, theyll be able to start their own family. Tara, from Stakeford, Northumberland, said: At  years old I was diagnosed and had my first surgery so Id be able to have sex as an adult. I had a vaginal tunnel built from my bowel as only part of my vagina had formed properly. My surgery was a risky one as it involved using two inches of my bowel to create a new tunnel opening. I was really young but naturally I was embarrassed about my condition back then as it was so rare. Since then I have met my partner, Stuart, and were desperate to have a family after meeting four years ago.   I dont have a womb so the next surgery I need is a womb transplant. It would be amazing to have our own family to show others anything is possible. Tara was first diagnosed with constant kidney infections before doctors did further tests and realised she had MRKS - a rare disorder that affects  in , females, in ying degrees. She added: My parents had originally taken me to the doctors when I was three, as I kept having kidney infections and nothing seemed able to stop them. I spent a long time in Newcastle Childrens Hospital and with antibiotics, it was eventually managed quite well. It took them a long time to discover what was actually causing all my problems, and doctors even said, it was the first time theyd ever seen a girl like me.  Tara decided to have the invasive vagina surgery at  to give herself a normal future. She added: After the surgery I had to have lots of dilation therapy - which essentially stretched my vagina. Doctors thought I didnt have any oies but as I grew older, I discovered that they were wrong - I did have oies which meant it was possible for me to have children - but I would have to go through IVF and alternative routes. After finding her current partner Stuart, also a support worker, Tara was open about her condition and together theyre excited about the prospect of starting a family together. Tara has since applied for the womb transplant trial, that has only recently become a viable option. The first baby from a womb transplant from a deceased donor was born in December of last year. However, with a long waiting list, Tara is also looking into surrogacy as a possible path. Tara said: We have two embryos in storage and are raising money to cover any potential costs from surrogacy. Now I want to help others like me by speaking out. It took me a long time to get a diagnosis, and to find help - but with more awareness, more support could become available. Tabitha Taya, founder of LivingMRKH, one of the UKs only support groups, said: We first met Tara back in  after she reached out to us after she read our LivingMRKH founders story in a daily newspaper. It is now a pleasure to work with her in sharing her message to help others. We have since got to know Tara through several social gatherings held to support those living with this condition. We all have dreams and aspirations, to be a mother is one of Taras and we wish her and her partner all the very best. The road to parenthood for those with MRKH can be challenging, but not impossible, its important to remember the condition does not define us and there are options available to make our journey a little less stressful and isolating. We hope Taras courage to share her journey provides hope and inspiration to our fellow community.

However, despite being firmly all for them, one bride-to-be has found herself a little alarmed by some clauses in the pre-nup her fianceacute, a successful neurosurgeon, has presented her with.Alarm bells started ringing while she went through the legal document with her fianceacutes father, who happens to be a lawyer.Turning to Reddit for some casual legal advice, she explained: My fianceacute put a few odd clauses in our prenup, such as an infidelity clause soI cheat on him, I walk away with basically nothing.That doesnt sound completely outlandish to us, but then it gets a lot weirder.  The oddest of them all to the unnamed woman is the compensation for children clause. She continues: I am not sureI interpreted this correctly so anyone may correct me, but in the prenup my fianceacute mentioned that for every child I have for him, I get a chunk of money., which to me doesnt sound legal but maybe it is  But thats not all. Her charming husband-to-be then added in a WEIGHT-LOSS clause. The woman explains: He put in a clause that stated that I have to lose any weight I gain after child birth, at least lbs of it in the first year following childbirth.  Thats kg - at least - she has to lose within  months.According to BabyCentre getting your body back to normalafter having a baby in a safe and healthy way can take between six to eight months, but could take longer.Following this particular bombshell, a huge number of the responses urged the woman to hire her own lawyer, someone is is NOT her father-in-law.  There were also some valid points about making sure the clause went both ways. I would add to it thatthe husband also gains  pounds and does not lose it within a year then it invalidates the requirement on her. It should be equal on both parties. Same thing with the cheating clause and any other rule,” one response read. I were in your shoes, I’d want a counter clause saying that he needs to provide childcare and a personal trainer, nutritionist and chef to come to your home while you’re trying to meet his unrealistic expectations, another added.

Although they are still shyendangered, it is an extraordinary conservation success story, in large part thanks to Sir David. We have come to Rwanda’s Volcanoes National Park in the Virunga mountains to retrace his steps, and try to understand his achievement and find descendants of the cheeky gorillas he met.   We are here with biologist Ian Redmond, , who, in the s, worked in this dense jungle as a -year-old assistant to primatologist Dian Fossey, who had studied these groups, giving them each names. Ian, who held the microphone as the gorillas gently teased Sir David like a brother, says the film “helped change the fate of a species”. The gorillas were targeted by poachers, who cut off their hands and feet as trophies, and stole their babies to sell. Ian says: “First, Sir David demolished the King Kong myth by being so clearly accepted by the gorillas. He turned people’s opinions of them around. “He never expected to get this close, but they took to him, although he certainly didn’t expect Pablo to sit on him. “There was even a moment, when the lens was being changed, when Poppy’s sister, Puck, took hold of his head and peered right at his face. “When you’re with a family of resting gorillas there is no fear. That’s what people saw and they loved them. “Afterwards, he used his reputation to raise money and get organisations involved.”  The family tree of those gorillas is now long. A census carried out exclusively for the Mirror reveals sisters Poppy, Puck and Tuck, the female gorillas in Attenborough’s film, have  children,  grandchildren, and one great-grandchild between them. Our aim was to meet some of the youngest starlet Poppy’s brood. Until last year, she was a regular face in the forest, at the age of  the last of the bunch alive. Then she went missing, thought to have died from natural causes. As we watch, her daughter Ururabo’s family begin to move about. Imena’s awesome hands, fingers like bananas, encircle crackling shoots as Ururabo strides gracefully through the butterflies with her baby on her back. Later, crawling on our knees through goose grass and wild celery, we find silverback Agahebuzo, the strapping, -year-old grandson of Tuck. As he sinks back for a snooze, he raises his leg and clutches it with his plate-sized hand, ashe’s doing yoga. It is hard to believe anyone could knowingly hurt these serene beings, who share % of human DNA.  As Sir David said: “There is more meaning and mutual understanding in exchanging a glance with a gorilla than any other animal I know.” After a little fearfully catching Agahebuzo’s knowing brown eyes, the same colour as my own, I understand. But in the s, they were prey. Just before Sir David arrived, a male christened Digit was speared to death, his hands and feet hacked off by poachers. Ian says: “Two days later that’s how I found him. When Sir David arrived, we were angry and grieving.” Six months after he left, a male and female were shot dead, and their baby, Kweli, who also appeared in the documentary, was left an orphan. He later died. Ian says: “He lost the will to live.” Chief warden Prosper Uwingeli says the authorities needed to recognise the gorillas as a treasure in order to protect them. After Sir David finished filming, he and the crew were shot at and strip-searched as they made their way down the mountain, the army suspicious they were trying to highlight poaching.  When they realised they had simply highlighted the beauty of these incredible creatures, their attitude changed. Prosper says: “Attenborough’s message changed minds. We feel grateful to him.” Later that year, the first habituated gorilla group for structured tourist visits was created. In , full-time veterinary care was shyestablished and today Gorilla Doctors operate in the forest, which also spans neighbouring Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo, checking for le-threatening wounds and diseases. Prosper says: “Some don’t see tourism as a form of conservation, but it is low-intensity, kept to one visit a day, for an hour only. It is working.” Despite their familiarity with human faces, there is no doubt that the gorillas are wild. We encounter Poppy’s daughter feeding her baby and the surprise elicits a hissing roar which forces us all to crouch into submissive poses.  Direct poaching has ceased in Rwanda and Uganda. But in the politically unstable DRC, gorillas are harder to protect and apes are still poached. The latest positive phase in the gorilla’s protection is the Rwandan government’s decision last year to expand the forest, adding almost , hectares to its current ,. I’m assured residents farming there will be re-homed, and given new means to earn a better living. This must happen but, ultimately, forest expansion is for everyone’s sake. The huge amount of carbon dioxide which forests absorb is crucial to battling climate change. Just before we crawl back through the undergrowth, the trackers spy a newborn baby almost hidden in its mother’s arms, its umbilical cord still attached, fur still wet. We are advised not to approach, but silently celebrate. Ian says: “David has never been back, but he would be blown away to see what we have seen.”To learn more and to help protect the gorillas, visit Ape Alliance: Action for Apes at apes."},{"url":null,"title":"north sentinel tribe not face","story":"NewsNorth Sentinel tribe will NOT face murder charges for killing US missionaryJohn Allen Chau was  when he ventured onto North Sentinel Island in a bid to spread his faith among the Sentinelese - the worlds last pre-Neolithic untouched communityShareCommentsByLucy Clarke-BillingsDeputy News Editor:,  FEB Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror incoming video who-are-the-mysterious-sentinelese-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, combinedPrompt :true, subsets :[,,,,,],bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, combinedPrompt :true, subsets :[,,,,,],bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAn isolated Indian tribe that killed an American missionary trying to convert them will not face murder charges. John Allen Chau was  when he ventured onto North Sentinel Island last year in a bid to spread his faith among the Sentinelese - the worlds last untouched community. Illegally taken there by fishermen, he was killed in a bow and arrow attack soon after arriving on the island, and buried in the sand the morning after. In his final message to his family, the Christian missionary wrote: You guys might think I am crazy in all this but I think its worth it to declare Jesus to these people. This is not a pointless thing - the eternal lives of this tribe is at hand and I cant wait to see them around the throne of God worshipping in their own language as Revelation :- states.Now Faithwire reports the Ambassador-at-Large for Religious Freedom Sam Brownback has confirmed the US will not be taking the case further. On February , he told a press conference: The US government has not asked or pursued any sort of sanctions that the Indian government would take against the tribal people in this case. Thats not been something that we have requested or have put forward. Its a tragic situation and a tragic case of whats happened, but thats not something thats been asked. Last week, Mr Chaus dad spoke out, blaming extreme Christianity for his sons death. If you havepositive to say about religion, l wish not to see or hear, Dr Patrick Chau told . Indian authorities said days after the November  killing that they had no plans to retrieve the -year-olds body. It was feared their presence could antagonise the tribe further, with the Sentinielese having always resisted the presence of outsiders.  On November , Mr Chau attempted his first visit to the island by a boat that took him around – metres from the shore. Fishermen warned him not to go any further, but he continued alone in a canoe with a Bible to the shore. As he approached the island, he saw the islanders and attempted to communicate with them, shouting: My name is John, I love you and Jesus loves you. He later recorded in his journal that he had greeted them and attempted to offer gts, but they continued to approach him and he hurriedly retreated in his canoe. On further visits, Mr Chau recorded the islanders reacted to him with a mixture of amusement, bewilderment and hostility. He attempted to sing worship songs to them, and spoke to them in Xhosa, after which they often fell silent, while other attempts to communicate ended with them bursting into laughter. He recorded that they communicated with lots of high pitched sounds and gestures.  Eventually, when he tried to hand over fish and gts, a boy shot a metal-headed arrow that pierced the Bible Mr Chau was holding in front of his chest, and he left the island. On his final visit, on November , Mr Chau instructed the fishermen to leave without him. The fishermen later saw the islanders dragging Mr Chaus body, and the next day they saw his body on the shore. The Washington Post obtained Mr Chaus journal, which stated that he had a clear desire to convert the tribe and was aware of the risk of death he faced and of the illegality of his visits to the island. He wrote: Lord, is this island Satans last stronghold where none have heard or even had the chance to hear your name   Police subsequently arrested seven fishermen for assisting Mr Chau to get close to the restricted island. Human rights group Survival International said it was possible the American had infected the tribe with pathogens to which they have no immunity, with the potential to wipe out the entire tribe. Indian officials made several attempts to recover Mr Chaus body, but on November  decided to abandon those efforts. An anthropologist involved in the case toldthat the risk of a dangerous clash between investigators and the islanders was too great to justy any further attempts.

The damage is so bad medics said there were over  holes appearing on her cornea and her eyes looked liked they had been baked in a microwave. The -year-old woman, called Chen, lives in the city of Kaohsiung in southern Taiwan and works as a secretary. Reports state Chen turned her phone up to maximum screen brightness to allow her to see her phone when she was outside and she did not turn it down for two years. After two years of writing messages and watching videos with her phone at full brightness, Chen is said to have begun experiencing pain in her eyes which had become bloodshot.   The secretary went to the hospital to try and relieve the discomfort and doctors found her left cornea was congested with blood and her eyesight had been permanently damaged. The vision in her right eye was reportedly worse and doctors found over  holes on her cornea. Chen was given steroid treatment to try and fix the problem which reportedly showed signs of improvement after three days. One of the doctors who treated Chen said the patients phone had been emitting light at  Lumens, over double the recommended level of  Lumens. The doctor said exposing the eye to light of  Lumens for just two hours will have the same effect as being baked in a microwave.   Doctors recommended phone users not to switch off the light in the roomthey are using their phone at night. The make and model of her phone are currently unclear.

Reading from his electrical device, he adds:  years ago she showed off her boobs and again now. Carlos walks over to the presenter and says: It is the only thing she knows how to do. Gerardo agrees: It is the only thing she knows how to do. At one point he also says: Tart. Meanwhile, Carlos replies: She is married and she posts this picture, it is unbelievable.  The video was widely shared on social media and Patty responded on Twitter .She said: Being insulted for sharing photos of me in abikinireminds me of the classic  she gets raped it will be her own fault for the way she dressed.

Now it’s a question of getting settled in as quick as I can and just playing football,” he said.“I had obviously spoken to Derek McInnes and he said to speak to Jim McIntyre before making any decision.“The gaffer at Aberdeen left it up to me.“He told me he’d love to have me still up there butI wanted to go and get games he understood.“So I spoke to the gaffer here on the phone and I loved everything he had to say. I jumped at the chance to come down here.”And the -year-old sees the draws against Hamilton and Kilmarnock since he arrived as proof this is a squad that can pull away from the relegation zone between now and the end of the season.“The only frustrating thing for me so far is that we’ve not taken six points out of six from the two games I’ve been involved in but I think all the fans and us as a team can feel from those performances that we are building momentum.“In the Hamilton game it was a case of everyone trying to get used to each other. A lot of us had only come in right before the deadline and we only really had one training session together.“It was about trying to get to know everyone’s games, their personalities. I think we are all starting to gel now and you can see that on the pitch.“Not having a game last weekend because we’re out of the cup has given us a bit more time to work on that. That gives us a better picture going into the game against Livingston this weekend.”Today’s trip to the Tony Macaroni Arena to face Livingston is a meeting with a team who have taken the Premiership by storm this term but have been struggling for a win of late.Since thumping Hearts - in mid-December, Gary Holt’s team have not won in eight outings. Wright does not see that as a sign this could be an easy  minutes for Dundee.“We have to treat it that every game from now on is going to be a big game for us and this will be.“We know how Livi will be and they will work hard but all we can do is just prepare the way we want to and work on how we can play. Hopefully, that will be enough.“They haven’t won in a few games but it’s a testimony to Livi how many points they have. They started the season so well.”Today, of course, will see Dundee asked to play on Livi’s much-criticised plastic pitch.The debate over their use has surfaced again this week via the PFA canvassing their members for views on them. While Wright is very much in the camp that prefers grass surfaces, the articial surface is not something he’s going to gripe about.“All we can do is get on with it and we are not going to use the pitch as an excuse,” he added.“Playing in Scotland, you get used to them.“However, I think having everyone playing on grass is something that would benefit the top league.“You prepare for a team each week but, for these games, you also have to prepare for the pitch as well.“All we can do as players is give our opinion about them.”"},{"url":null,"title":"gomis set to take over as dundee united target hat trick of wins down at queen of the south","story":"Veteran Morgaro Gomis is set to take over in midfield when Dundee United try to make it three wins on the bounce as they head for Queen of the South today.The -year-old is expected to replace Calum Butcher, who will serve the first game of a two-match ban after his red card in the Scottish Cup win at St Mirren last weekend.His second game on the sidelines will be the cup quarter-final against Ross County or Inverness Caley Thistle which has been confirmed for Sunday, March  at pm.The game is also being televised live on BBC Scotland.As well as continuing their recent winning run, the Tangerines will be looking for their third success of the campaign over Queens.To do that, though, manager Robbie Neilson is well aware they will have to keep in-form home striker Stephen Dobbie quiet.His spectacular strike in the cup at Aberdeen on Sunday was the -year-old’s th goal in just  appearances this term.“He has been on fire lately and someone we will have to get to grips with,” said Robbie.“He has a lot of quality, he knows how to score goals.“He’s just a very good player and I think he has the freedom of Dumfries these days.

They have some very good players,” he said.“The first thing we have to do is try to win our battles but don’t forget they have scored some quality goals, some good team goals.“We have to try to make sure inidually we get the better of them and try to go and create opportunities to win the game.”Dundee go into the clash with controversy over plastic pitches like Livi’s rekindled by a PFA survey showing top-flight players are unied in opposition to them.The manager is also in that camp but hasn’t forgotten that defeat at the Tony Macaroni in his first game in charge was down to what happened in the air and not the surface.That day back in October his team conceded four goals from set pieces.“We didn’t deal with set plays and that killed us. It was an eye-opener that day in terms of what we had to work with,” he said.“There’s no doubt, though, the surface is an advantage. I was the manager of a team, Queen of the South, who had an articial surface andyou train on it every day it’s a definite help.“At the same time I’m not trying to detract from how well Livingston have done because they’ve done exceptionally well.”Dundee are still nursing a few niggling injuries from that Killie draw, but it’s hoped everyone who was on duty then will be available.

First performed in , Within This Dust has gone on to be staged all over the UK and internationally, including at the   memorial and museum.Especially inspired by Richard Drew#s unforgettable photograph, The Falling Man, Within This Dust details the experience of witness, Lisa Hood, and victim, Vince Virr, of the   attacks.The witness finds herself surrounded in dust, made of crumpled paper, and begins a grieving process of hunting through the papers, finding meaning in the words, as someone tries to tidy around her. The second act features the victim joining the witness, creating a connection that will inevitably be broken, when finally, in the third act, the victim is alone, caught between a choice of the smoke and fire within the collapsing building or the  metre drop to freedom.It was a very poignant performance, tenderly expressing the horror of the incident, perhaps now weakened due to overindulgence. When the lights came up everyone stayed where they were, perhaps a little too stunned to move. Chatter was in whispers, for respect to people who could not hear them.As the narrator of the show captured and pieced together from coverage of the attacks said, the dust has not settled, and never will. The losses of the people in the planes and buildings is still felt, and the wider western world is still wary, still learning, still recovering.Within This Dust manages to depict the horror of that day beautully, and more importantly, delicately. No easy task for a grieving world.PIC:Craignish Village Hall was full. _aWithinThisDustLisa Hood amongst the #dust#. _aWithinThisDustDancer, Lisa Hood. _aWithinThisDustLisa Hood collecting dust. _aWithinThisDustLisa Hood and Vince Virr. _aWithinThisDustDancer, Vince Virr. _aWithinThisDustVince Virr facing the smoke, or the window. _aWithinThisDust"},{"url":null,"title":"mid argyll rugby fans form scotlands honour guard","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThree Mid Argyll-based girls were among those given the honour of forming the honour guard at Friday February #s Scotland v Italy women#s rugby game.Amber Russell, Drew Buckley and Anya Gritten travelled to Scotstoun stadium on Friday night with their Oban U teammates to form the honour guard for the Scotland women#s team as they took on Italy in the first game of this year’s six nations tournament.The girls formed a tunnel of Saltire flags for the teams to run through as they took to the field.

This area of Argyll is the most fragile in the region. The people of Argyll, businesses and visitors deserve no less.Forget the squandering of £m on unreliable, mitigation measures trying to justy a flawed decision made many years ago to use the Old Military Road as a ersion which has failed on many occasions and now has a landslip between the two roads. Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less. In  at Dawlish .km of double tracked railway and .km of sturdy seawall was built at a cost of £m in eight weeks.

Transport Minister Michael Matheson, Transport Scotland and our Government must abandon their obsession with mitigation measures and fund a permanent solution.

The bunds will help reduce the risk of debris reaching the A in the event of a landslide.This project allows BEAR Scotland to maximise the benefit of recycling the material being excavated from the Rest and Be Thankful while minimising the overall cost of these works.To keep roadworkers and motorists safe throughout the works, temporary traffic lights will be in place on the A at each location. This next phase of the works is expected to last approximately  weeks.Commenting on the works, Eddie Ross, BEAR Scotland’s North West Representative said: #The installation of the next stages of the mitigation measures will provide more protection and resilience against any future landslips blocking this key route at both the Rest and Be Thankful and Glen Kinglas.#The temporary traffic lights are necessary to keep our teams as well as users of the route safe during the works, and the teams will do all they can to complete the project as quickly and safely as possible.#We encourage road users to plan their journeys in advance by checking the Traffic Scotland website for up to date travel information.#"},{"url":null,"title":"third sector interface launches new approach to service delivery","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Third Sector Interfaceis changing the way it supports all types of third sector organisations, including charities, social enterprises and community groups.Due to many people now finding information through digital means and the need for information and assistance to be accessible and consistent across the whole of Argyll and Bute, not just in the main towns, the organisation has launched a new website, argylltsi.org.The website, reflecting the TSI’s new corporate identity, contains a self-serve area allowing third sector organisations to find links to a whole iety of locally-based and more national resources that can support their development needs, as well as useful templates to use to run their organisations.The TSI will be growing and developing self-service over the coming months, with the site becoming a ‘one-stop shop’ for information that third sector organisations need to set up, govern and manage organisations – everything from how to start a social enterprise to raising funding from major donors.The TSI can also now be contacted through a central freephone number #   , available between the hours of am-pm, Monday-Friday.

Her conclusions drawn from experience was that when the monitors were around, there may have been unpleasant situations, but no tragedies. When there was no monitor around – clearly defined by their unorms – people died.Philippa had only been home for eight weeks when she spoke to the Justice and Peace Group, and she admitted that she was still processing the often brutal and violent scenes she had witnessed. And though she wryly joked that it had not exactly been a picnic, she encouraged her audience to become involved in the work of EAPPI – through prayer, support, even by volunteering to be a monitor .For more information, visit eappi.org en or visit the EAPPI Facebook page @EAPPI.WCCPIC:Her stories of the hardships in Israel kept visitors engaged. no_aholylandPhillipa Bonella speaking at the MS Centre. no_aholyland"},{"url":null,"title":"councils deputy leader rapped","story":"Andrew GallowayUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe depute leader of Argyll and Bute Council has been censured for contravening two elements of the code of conduct for councillors.Helensburgh councillor Gary Mulvaney was subject to a hearing last month in relation to the introduction of new parking restrictions near a sheltered housing development run by Dunbritton Housing Association in Cardross.The Standards Commission for Scotland found that Councillor Mulvaney – who is still a member of Dunbritton’s board – had failed to declare an interest when the parking limits issue was discussed by the council’s Helensburgh and Lomond area committee in December .A report by the Commissioner for Ethical Standards in Public Le in Scotlandprompted a hearing held in Helensburgh on January .The hearing  decided to censure Councillor Mulvaney, although the  also noted his long service to public le as a councillor and were satisfied he had made no personal gain.The ’s report will be put before a full council meeting on Thursday, February .Councillor Mulvaney said: #In practical terms, this was an issue whether the council put double yellow lines in a layby, which is adjacent to a small number of Dunbritton homes.#The hearing  accepted that the matter was clearly one of road safety and that I was trying to act in the overall public interest.

Arthur Street Kitchen applied for permission to host live al fresco entertainment in the town centre. But councillors worried about noise want to carry out a site visit before making a decision. The venue’s manager Andy McPherson said: “We would like to have entertainment for customers in the garden this summer.” He said the music would not be too loud as the business is aware of residents living in the Arthur Street area of the town. Appearing before the South Ayrshire Council licensing board, he added: “We are hoping to reinvigorate Arthur Street. It is starting to come to le again.” Board chair Craig Mackay said: “Noise is the main issue here. “We would be looking for a noise report.” Mr McPherson said it would be background music featuring a musician playing acoustic guitar, for example. Ayr manager John Neil told the meeting no noise complaints were made last summer. The restaurant and pub also want to have a large screen to show sport and films. Arthur Street Kitchen is based in the former West of the Moon premises and beside the Vinyl night club. Councillor Mackay said: “The West of the Moon was a family space. What you are proposing is quite dferent.” Mr Neil said Arthur Street Kitchen still caters for children. He said: “We want to cater for as many dferent people as we can.” The decision will be made at a later meeting following a visit to the venue.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilGardens and flowersAyrAyr News"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13471434.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_emp_ayp_080918AyrCurrie_09JPG.jpg","title":"ayr rugby club near move","story":"NewsAyr Rugby Club near move to new town centre base at Dam Park as they prepare to sell Millbrae homeThe Millbrae men, who top the Tennents Premiership, are in advanced talks to sell their Millbrae home and move to Dam Park in Ayr town centre.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  OCT NewsDam Park could play host to Ayr Rugby Club as soon as  \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailBooming Ayr Rugby Club are nearing a deal to sell their Millbrae home and move to the town centre. Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as .

Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13926204.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_18355078.jpg","title":"ayr united 2 inverness 3","story":"NewsAyr United  Inverness : John Roberston hails Somerset Park among best grounds in worldThe Inverness gaffer was full of praise for the old fashioned surroundings as his side clung on in the face of a stirring fightback.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN NewsNathan Austin puts Caley - up \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailJohn Robertson hailed Somerset Park as one of the best grounds in the WORLD after Caley held off a storming Ayr fightback. Inverness were three up and on easy street after a crazy opening  minutes which saw United gt-wrap the game. But a Lawrence Shankland inspired comeback almost grabbed a share of the spoils for Ian McCalls title contenders. A relieved Robertson said: Had it finished - you wouldnt have been surprised. Somerset Park is one of these grounds that sucks you inyou give them a snf. Its a good throwback and their fans make it intimidating and a good atmosphere for teams when you lose a goal. Its brilliant...one of the best grounds in the world to come and play your football. In the past we might have lost a game like this so Im delighted.  Ayr knew a win here would take them top of the Championship and started well with Robbie Crawford missing a good chance in the first minute. But they soon hit the self destruct button as their defence went AWOL to allow Nathan Austin in for a double before Liam Polworth rammed home a third. The game looked over with barely  minutes on the clock and shellshocked Ayr took time to regroup. Coventry-bound Michael Rose rocked the post with a header before Michael Moffat drew a fingertip save from Cammy Mackay. McCall turned to the bench at half time and introduced top gun Shankland who immediately turned the tide. He set up Declan McDaid to haul Ayr back into the contest with a close range finish eight minutes after the restart. And a resurgent Ayr thought they had a penalty when Carl Tremarco appeared to handle in the box but ref Nick Walsh waved away loud protests. United continued to pour forward as the clock ticked down and Shankland set up a grandstand finish when slamming home a  yard free kick with five minutes left.  But their comeback proved too little too late as Inverness clung on. Ayr boss McCall said: Im just gutted. Weve conceded three goals and at least two of them were gted with just crazy defending.

His death revealed he had left his entire fortune in his will to his native town of Troon. His legacy would provide education awards and grants for the people of the town along with a new public school. As Marr’s train travelled north he decided to break his journey, to pay a visit to his sister in Girvan. He was close to his sister Helen and visited her often after her marriage to ColonelABGrant, owner of Killochan Castle estate at Girvan, who was also a senior partner in the firm of Grant Somerville  Co in London and was later ordained as Revd. Grant in the Church of Scotland. Marr had intended to spend part of his fortnight at Girvan but extended his stay to a month. Perhaps his change of heart was due to the widespread unrest taking place in Glasgow at that time. The January of  saw the so-called ‘Harbour Riots’, where racial confrontations were breaking out between black and white merchant seamen on the town’s quayside and spreading into the town. A four day General Strike was called for on January  and four days later George Square was crammed with tens of thousands of angry workmen. Crowds of unemployed men joined in the fracas for a  hour working week. As tempers flared the army was deployed, troops brought in tanks and armored vehicles to control the crowds. As tensions heightened it was not an environment travellers would want to find themselves caught up in. Eventually CK Marr left Girvan on Saturday February  for his onward journey north to his annual shooting and fishing break in Perthshire. As the train made its way towards the city he took ill with acute appendicitis. When taken off the train at the Central Station he was rushed to the Glasgow Nursing Home, but it was already too late as he tragically died in the operating theatre. There is little known of Charles Kerr Marr, despite having a successful career in the coal exporting business. Born on October , , at  Welbeck Crescent, Troon, he was the third son of Captain John Marr, master of the merchant ship ‘Reciprocity’, sailing between Troon and Canada. John Marr and his we Amelia had five children, sons William, John and Charles, along with two daughters, Helen and Amelia. Up to the age of ten, Charles attended the Parish School in Academy Street at Troon, going on to join his two brothers at Irvine Royal Academy to complete his education. On finishing his schooling, Marr was apprenticed at A  J Guthrie, Coal Agents at Troon Harbour. Unlike his brother John, who followed in his father’s footsteps to become a sea captain, Marr left home as soon as his apprenticeship ended, to work as a Commercial Clerk with Kitstons, Iron Merchants in Glasgow. Moving later to take up the position of cashier at Clyde Ironworks, only to leave a short time later to be manager of the firm of GrantSomerville  Co in London. The move may have been influenced by A B Grant, who was a senior partner in the company and married to his sister Helen. By the time he met his future we, some years later, there is no evidence as to when he moved back to Glasgow, or indeed any explanation found as to his change of occupation. Marr is recorded in the Scotland census of  as residing in Renfrew Street in Glasgow and again on his marriage certicate a year later, where he is also recorded as being employed as a Soft Goods Warehouseman.  Little is known as to why he left coal exporting to go into the Drapery business, or where he met and fell in love with his we Agnes Murray Kinghorn. However, Agnes’s father was a General Merchant, so it would seem likely he met her in his line of work. Charles and Agnes married on March ,  and set up home at Sutherland Terrace in Glasgow’s Hillhead. Unfortunately, after only  months of married le, Agnes tragically died of Phthisis Pulmonalis . She was just  years of age. Her death was a severe blow to Marr, leaving him brokenhearted and distraught, which had a profound effect on him. Shortly after he laid his we to rest, he had thought of going abroad to work, but instead accepted an appointment with Hull Blyth  Company of London. Within a year he was made a partner in the company when he developed the firm’s export trade. His work of establishing depots in numerous ports in the world gave him an opportunity to travel abroad, especially to China and Japan, where he found an interest in collecting oriental treasures. During his time with Hull Blyth the firm went on to become one of the largest shipping charterers in the UK. Charles Kerr Marr played a signicant part in the company’s worldwide success. Charles Marr moved to London after his we’s death, he never again owned a house. All his years in London, he alternated between two clubs, the Athenaeum and the Constitutional. The nearest he came to having a home was in his later years, when he rented two rooms in Camden House at Chislehurst in Kent, which was originally built for Napoleon the rd. Just being there helped him to relax and take up golf. He was reputed to be good company with a great sense of humour and well known to be very generous. Marr was a lover of the arts and music and in all that time he rarely spoke of his we, or of her death and he never remarried, even his closest friends assumed he was a bachelor. When he retired in  he spent a good part of each year fishing and shooting in Scotland. Two years before his untimely death, Charles Marr carefully drafted out his will in , leaving his entire fortune to the people of Troon and setting out the way it was to be carried out. Marr’s coal fortune legacy has given the town a magnicent architectural school building with playing fields the envy of the country. Marr College on its own is a fitting tribute to this man of extraordinary vision. By the time Marr College opened in  the school had attracted the most renowned academics to come and teach. It was the only grant aided school in Scotland that didn’t charge fees. A public school for every child of the town, had oak led class rooms, inlaid parquet flooring, Italian tiled corridorsa copper domed library, purple velvet drapes and teachers attired in flowing cloaks with mortar boards on their heads, this was seen by all to be a stunning,not magnicent, comprehensive school, deemed to be the best school in Scotland and envied by it. The CK Marr Educational Trust, the only one of its kind in Scotland, has provided awards or grants to hundreds of Troon students, of all ages each year. The addition of the MarrEducation Resource Centre in Troon Library, the only one then in Ayrshire, is a valuable educational resource for all who use it. Marr College and the CK Marr Educational Trust are a testimony to the wishes of Charles Kerr Marr and a fitting memorial to this great benefactor. He was buried beside his beloved we in CathcartCemetery in Glasgow. Over the past century the people of Troon owe a huge debt to custodians of Marr’s vision, the Marr Trustees, past and present. Over the decades the many Trustees, Boards of Governors and ious Clerks, Treasurers and Accountants, who have and still do today and for many decades to come, have successfully upheld the wishes of the town’s greatest ever benefactor and extraordinary visionary, Charles Kerr Marr.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnChurch of ScotlandUniversities and CollegesGlasgowEducationFishingArmed forcesLove and romanceSchoolsRenfrewTroonPerthshireGirvanAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"cinema set return prestwick after","story":"NewsCinema set forto Prestwick after  year gapReturn to the golden age of screen in PrestwickShareByStephen Houston:,  FEB NewsFriends of Broadway - they want cinema open again \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailCinema made a boldto Prestwick for the first time in more than  years.

Cycling Without Age Prestwick is transforming lives of those with limited mobility in the area with their specially designed trishaw, a light three -wheeled vehcile with pedal used in Asian countries . The three-wheeled rickshaw is a little more than a ‘sofa on wheels’ as it is engineered to accommodate two passengers in the front and driven by a pilot in the rear. Those with mobility restrictions - old and young- can take a trip to the seafront, enjoy the Prestwick promenade views and have a good old natter. Now the community project, who’s base has been kindly gted by St Ninian’s Episcopal Church, are eager to find more volunteer pilots and those keen to get out on the trishaw. Chris Cheales, of Cycling Without Age Prestwick, said: “We now have two trishaws and we are in the middle of a training programme to help - people become qualied before starting the operation in spring. We offer two-hour sessions to two passengers and there is the opportunity to go for a drink, stop to chat, pet a dog or just enjoy the views. “We are looking for people with limited mobility who may or may not also struggle with loneliness and isolation and who would benefit from the freedom of feeling ‘the wind in their hair’. “Time is a wonderful gt to give anyone. The group hope to expand as the project grows and take their trishaws on tour to visit care homes in the area. Chris added: “We envisage days allocated to ‘user groups’, to include care homes, those recommended by Dementia Friendly Prestwick, retirement housing and local churches. “Trishaws are not cheap so we need ongoing help to keep all this on the road. “We are looking forward to another sunny summer and sharing the project with others.” The Prestwick Peoples Project has also benefitted those involved, helping volunteers flourish and gain confidence. Zara Crumlish has been a Young Ambassador for Cycling Without Age for six months. Zara, , said: “I’ve always wanted to ride a bike when I was younger but I didn’t have the balance. “The trishaw has helped me get my confidence up. “It gets me out and about with the community. “And I’m excited because I really can’t wait to take elderly people out and show them the Prom.” •Would you like to be trained as a Trishaw Pilot  Or a willing volunteer to be a co-pilot to accompany trips  .

The shocking evidence makes a mockery of the new flagship South Ayrshire Council recycling policy, which has cost a fortune in public cash. The bin team were filmed as they uplted four giant refuse containers and put them all in the same wagon. The pair of hi-vis clad refusemen did not appear to care who was watching as all the waste was dumped into the back of their lorry, driven by a third council staffer. They were recorded on video for four minutes after they arrived at the bin corral in Ayr’s Newmarket Street. The binmen first lted the purple-lidded container for paper, card and cardboard then a green one for general waste, a blue for metal and plastic cartons before a fourth, which looks like another purple bin.

group.Upper Tweed Community Enterprisehas received the cash from the Scottish Land Fund.Christopher Lambton, chair of UTCE, told us: ldquoIt is almost a year since the village shop in Broughton closed abruptly, leaving the village and Upper Tweed area without a key community resource.\"Since then, Upper Tweed Community Enterprise, has been working hard to secure funds to buy and run the shop as a community enterprise.\"It is not just the board of UTCE but the entire local community that will rejoice to know that we have secured such a generous grant award from the Scottish Land Fund.ldquoThe sum awarded includes a substantial contribution towards the purchase of the shop and includes ringfenced funding for a staff position and essential repairs.The original village shop closed last March, resulting in the loss of five jobs and forcing villagers into a  mile round trip for basic provisions.Previous owner Rani Jolly sold up due to a ldquodesire to retire.The move prompted the community body, now UTCE, being set up to fill the gap.They put in an application to the Scottish land fund at the end of last year and are delighted to hear it has been successful.Upper Tweed Community Enterprise is one of seven groups across Scotland sharing in pound, of Scottish Land Fund cash.Minister, Cabinet Secretary for Land Reform Roseanna Cunningham said: ldquoToday marks an important milestone for the seven projects that have had funding approved by the Scottish Land Fund, enabling local residents to push on with their plans to acquire and develop vital local assets.A total of pound, of the Scottish Land Fund cash can be used towards the purchase price of the store, which has been agreed at pound,.And the remaining money will be used to assist with repairs to the building and the appointment of a professional shop development manager.The UTCE is currently raising the balance to meet the purchase price through a community share issue and a further funding application.Over  supporters of the village shop campaign have between them pledged almost pound,.It is understood thateveryone who has pledged buys their shares the UTCE will have sufficient funds to complete repairs to the building, buy new equipment, and then stock the shop.Previously named the Broughton Shop Development Group, the UTCE is authorised to raise money for the project locally through a Community share offer.Shares are set to to be launched on Monday, March  at an event in the Village Hall - and a pledge form can be found on www.broughtonvillagestoreThe position of shop

Yet incredibly we now know that the Scottish Government hasnrsquot even spent the money it has been given to prepare for Brexit.ldquoIn England, councils have received nearly pound million, yet the SNP have provided no financial support for our own councils.ldquoThe fact that the SNP are now demanding more money just goes to show they are more interested in manufacturing a grievance than being a responsible Government.ldquoScottish Borders Council are quite rightly making plans to ensure that as we leave the EU there is minimal disruption for services and for businesses. And they are doing this without any support from the Scottish Government.However, the SNP said that ldquoBrexit is the Toriesrsquo mess, with MSP George Adam commenting: ldquoIt takes a real brass neck for the Tories to demand the SNP do more to clean up their Brexit mess while Westminster cuts deeper into Scotlandrsquos annual resource budget.ldquoThis shameless stunt by John Lamont to try pin the fallout of catastrophic Tory Brexit on the SNP is nothing short of embarrassing.ldquoEven before we have even left the EU, Brexit has already left households pound, worse off ndash with the economy at its weakest since .ldquoBrexit is the Toriesrsquo mess.

In fact, on average, Borderers are forking out pound less than their Northumbrian opposite numbers.Since First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced the end of the freeze in , Scottish Borders Council has taken full advantage of the ability to raise council tax by % each year, and this year is no dferent, as the council agreed to a three per cent increase in December .However, the deal agreed by the SNP and Scottish Greens allows councils to raise tax by up to . per cent for  .Council leader Shona Haslam, who represents Tweeddale East, has been adamant that Scottish Borders Council will not take advantage of the increased limit, and will not raise an extra . per cent on Borderersrsquo council tax, instead sticking to an increase of three per cent.Council will not introduce workplace parking levy:Scottish Conservatives in the Borders have been very vocal about their opposition to the Scottish Government plans to introduce a workplace parking levy, where employers will be charged an annual tax based on how many parking spaces they provide for their employees.The aim is to persuade more commuters to use public transport in a bid to reduce pollution, but the charge could lead to employers passing the bill onto their employees.Both councillor Haslam and Scottish Borders Councilrsquos SNP opposition leader Stuart Bell, who both represent the rural ward of Tweeddale East, have signalled their opposition to the plans, so it is extremely unlikely this will feature in the councilrsquos budget proposals.Borderers who travel to Edinburgh for work could possibly be affected by the levy though, as Edinburgh City Council is considering implementing the charges.A move to three-weekly bin collections:Rumours have been circulating amongst councillors that Scottish Borders Councilrsquos waste refuse collection service will move to three-weekly bin collections, from the current once-a-fortnight collectionThe local authority is currently reviewing its waste collection service, which is expected to feed into the new budget for  .In fact, at a meeting of the council in October , Selkirkshire councillor Gordon Edgar, the authorityrsquos executive member for roads and infrastructure, refused to rule out the possibility when questioned by Hawick and Denholm councillor David Paterson.,params: .pushThe veteran Hawick councillor said: ldquoIf they go to a three-weekly collection it would cause some very serious problems for many of the people that we represent and I am sure it would increase the incidents of fly tipping.No tourism tax:Another controversial aspect of the SNP Scottish Greens budget proposals is the introduction of a tourism tax on nightly accommodation.Much like the workplace parking levy, local authorities have discretion over whether to implement it or not, and again Scottish Borders Tories have ruled out introducing it here.Changes to grass cutting services:Grass cutting, or the lack of it, has been a constant thorn in the side of the council over the past year.As an issue which caused a large furore, Scottish Borders Council could well announce further changes to the grass cutting regime, particularly around the maintenance of cemeteries.Changing the frequency of grass cutting from a -day cycle to a -day cycle was widely criticised by communities, with residents reporting overgrown public spaces and ankle-high grass in the regionrsquos cemeteries.Many opposition councillors have called for a rethink on the councilrsquos grass cutting policy, and due to the large number of complaints from Borders resident it is expected to be addressed in Thursdayrsquos budget announcement."},{"url":null,"title":"theresa-may-heads-to-brussels-after-key-brexiteers-say-they-may-back-her-deal","story":"Theresa May is ing to Brussels to

the Government has accepted the EU will not agree to replace the backstop arrangements for the Irish border with technological alternatives in time for the scheduled date of Brexit on March .But he said he hopes the technological solution contained in the so-called Malthouse Compromise will form part of negotiations over the following  months on the UKrsquos future relationship with the EU.After being briefed on developments in private talks with the PM,leading Brexiteers Jacob Rees-Mogg and Steve Baker appeared happy with this arrangement, declaring that the Malthouse proposals were

tomorrow but I donrsquot expect a breakthrough.Mr Hammond said that legally-binding changes to ensure the backstop does not become permanent ldquowould deliver the core of a majority for a deal in the House of Commons.He told the MakeUK dinner: ldquoOur priority remains avoiding a No Deal outcome, and that will be my unwavering focus.ldquoIt is clear that leaving the EU without a deal would deliver a damaging short-term shock and would undermine our future prosperity and security ndash and in my view that would represent a betrayal of the promises about Brexit that were made during the referendum campaign.ldquoSo the solution lies in getting the PMrsquos deal through Parliament.Speaking in Stuttgart, Jean-Claude Juncker said he did not knowWednesdayrsquos meeting with Theresa May would be lsquoproductiversquo A senior adviser to EU negotiator Michel Barnier said there was ldquozero appetite in the capitals of the  remaining members to renegotiate the agreement reached with the

the circumstances, Stefaan de Rynck told the UK in a Changing Europe think tank in London.ldquoIf you have a time limit or a unilateral exit clause, you no longer have a genuine backstop.So there is zero appetite in the EU to reopen that Withdrawal Agreement.The backstop arrangements would see the whole UK remain in a customs union with the EU and Northern Ireland following some single market rules until a wider trade deal is agreed, in order to prevent the need for checkpoints on the Irish border.The Malthouse plan would replace these arrangements with technological methods for tracking cross-border movements, along with a free trade agreement-lite for Northern Ireland.If this was not acceptable to Brussels, a Plan B would see the UK leave without a deal but with a transition period

Now, with less regulation in place, there are thousands.’True to the name, Viola FC is a family-run agency # his son Johnny joined its ranks in early  # with their main work both in representing players coming to the UK, and ‘brokering’.John explained: ‘We mostly represent footballers transferring to the UK, while brokering involves working with clubs, players and other agents to help bring those players here.‘That said, we have done a lot of work in countries such as Brazil and China in recent years, where there is a huge appetite for football. You make valuable contacts and get to see some exciting players.’However, for John the image of the football agent thrashing out a lucrative deal for himself as well as for the player, fails to tell the whole story.He explained: ‘Of course working in football can be financially rewarding, but it’s a hard job. People think you’re just walking around in a suit with a laptop and phone, but so much goes into being a player representative.‘You need to travel a lot, and that means lots of airport lounges and hotel rooms.‘You’re working long days and doing lots behind the scenes, and all year round,  because that’s what it takes.‘The public see the excitement of the transfer windows on TV and then think that’s all agents do.‘If an agent does their job properly, they are available day and night, looking after the whole package for the player, like houses and children’s schooling.‘We’re more than a ‘necessary evil’, we do an important service for both the club, and the player.’Thinking about Campbeltown visits again, John brings up a memorable trip to the Wee Toon, where his son Johnnybecame an unofficial pool champ.John said: ‘My uncle John took us to the Commercial Inn to watch a game of football on the TV. Johnny was only young but he ‘won’ a pool competition in the pub.‘Of course, the adults had let him win, but he believed for about ten years he was the pool champion of Campbeltown!‘That’s just one but I have lots of good memories of visiting Campbeltown, and the surrounding areas, such as Machrihanish.#For me Kintyre is a special part of Scotland.’Reflecting on a career in football of more than  years, including representing many Celtic and Rangers players, his hunger as an agent remains.John, whose recent travels include talent-scouting missions to Portugal and Ghana, added: ‘I am blessed to do this job. I have made some great personal connections and am even godfather to some players’ children.I grew up in Easterhouse, and now I get to work with top players and managers, visiting great stadiums. It’s not bad to be able to say that.‘At the same time, I know I have worked hard for those opportunities and I don’t take them for granted.’John Viola with his son Johnny centre and former client, and now colleague, Craig Moore in Ghana."},{"url":null,"title":"young footballers saddled up for funds","story":"Last Saturday, in the Co-op foyer, players took half hour shts, on two bikes, to raise more than £, towards funds to compete in the three-day Edinburgh International Youth Cup in August.A Campbeltown and District Juvenile Football Association spokesperson said: #A massive thank you to Campbeltown Co-op for allowing us to use their foyer to spin our way to a massive £,..#Thank you to each and everyone of you who supported us and also the words of encouragement, which meant a lot.#CDJFA, supported by quiz queen Helen Gilchrist, will hold a Big Quiz Night, at Stronvaar Bowling Club on Saturday March  with a £ top prize.The evening#s entertainment will include a quiz, raffles and television show games.The young spinners from left are: Josh MacDonald, , John McTaggart, , Jack MacNab,  and Daniel McEachran,._cfootballfunds_CDJFA"},{"url":null,"title":"letter district news disappoints","story":"I note that for the second week running the Islay section of the Courier#sIs this now Courier policy Are we to have a regular feature on the wonderful works and world of the all-conquering Alastair to sit alongside his weekly SNP bad letter It was said of Alan Reid in his days as MP that he would attend the opening of an envelope Alistair Redman could give him lessons.A Google search for our beloved councillor produces Alastair Redman archives # Campbeltown Courier as the th result, after two for ArgyllThere seems to me to be an uncomfortably close association between our local paper and a local politician.Tony WilliamsGrumpy Old ManMuasdale"},{"url":null,"title":"letter maintain tarberts social housing","story":"The issue that I hear about the most, from ward members in Tarbert, is the need for new social housing and the importance of maintaining and improving the existing housing stock.While the four new houses that are planned are welcome many residents have quite rightly said that many more are needed.Both externally and internally, housing must be improved including repairing and repainting the hallways that link many housing association flats.There have also been calls to rollout external wall insulation across all of the social housing in Tarbert, and while there has been a start on this clearly more needs to be done.As a social housing tenant myself I know all to well the dficulties in getting housing associations to act on concerns raised by tenants.I continue to press for more and better social housing across the Kintyre and Islands ward.Councillor Alastair Redman,Portnahaven,Islay."},{"url":null,"title":"all welcome as road safety event revs up","story":"It will have its free Campbeltown debut at .pm on Tuesday March  in the Grammar School atrium.Youth engagement officer, PC Karen Cairns said: #This initiative is aimed at all drivers, young and old and particularly those in a hurry.#The play aims to show the effects of careless driving, the consequences on the victim and families and surrounding communities.#This initiative is also to raise awareness of health implications that can impact on ones ability to drive for instance eyesight, hearing and mobility issues.#The police traffic department will have a discussion , with the audience, after the show and highlight ious risks with dferent issues.The free event is expected to last an hour.Campbeltown traffic police checking vehicle speeds on the A in November last year. _ctrafficpolice"},{"url":null,"title":"down memory lane february 15 2019","story":"Maths and science teacher and latterly computer programmer, Roger Breckenridge, from Minnesota, USA told the Courier: #As far as I am aware the last Breckenridge to live in Campbeltown, was James Breakenridge who died in .#I have finished my own Breckenridge genealogy and have traced my Breckenridge lineage back to Glencraigs, just a couple of miles north of Campbeltown, along the Tarbert Road.#My ancestors were tenant farmers at Glencraigs, then called Craigs in the early to mid s.#Some of his ancestors are buried at Kilkerran cemetery and he specically knows there are graves for Andrew Breckenridge and his we Janet Finlay.In one posting, on the Courier#s Facebook page, Mr Breckenridge has askedany readers know where the Breckenridge#s rest and whether it would be possible to have photographs emailed.He is also looking for a very old place-name, possibly Glenreavoll,  concerning a Breckenridge family.Mr Breckenridge said: #All I know is that Glenreavoll must have been located somewhere in Scotland but not necessarily in Argyll or Kintyre.#A Breckenridge family lived at Glenreavoll in the year .#I have no idea what Glenreavoll was or where it was located.

But spring still feels like a long way off.I crave it, not just because it makes the evening walks in the woods possible once more, but because of the beauty it s to the landscape.The land is still dormant, with nature seemingly sleeping. Itrsquos at this time of year that the ugly results of peoplersquos disregard for the land can be most clearly seen. Litter of all kinds lsquodecoratesrsquo the roadsides. In summer it is partly hidden as hedges, roadside bushes and grasses grow. But in winter nature retreats and exposes the extent of peoplersquos uncaring behaviour.I canrsquot understand it, I really canrsquot. Our country is so beautul, yet so many people just throw rubbish from their car window. Do they not see the results and feel a sense of shame and horror  In a country where we have the facilities to dispose of our rubbish, there is simply no excuse to trash our landscape like this.And in a time when there are cuts to vital services, councils having to pay money to pick up peoplersquos rubbish from the sides of roads is just another unseen effect. Itrsquos not just that itrsquos ugly to look at, itrsquos polluting our environment, killing wildle and leaving an appalling legacy for our children.And so as we set off last Sunday for a walk, the sight of litter strewn everywhere along the roadside was quite depressing. And my children noticed its ugliness too. ldquoWhy do people litter like this  I was asked by my five-year-old Skye, and to be honest I struggled for an answer.ldquoI really donrsquot know, but it must be because they donrsquot care.My daughter seemed forlorn at this reply as we drove past a mass of discarded fast food remains, plastic bottles, beer bottles, plastic bags and yet more fast food rubbish.But I wanted to lt her spirits and so told her we were going on a hunt for something beautul. We were on a snowdrop hunt! And so as we drove to our destination, I reminded them of my version of the old story:lsquoMany years ago, Snow had no colour. It felt ashamed and left out to be colourless, especially when the land was so beautully covered in flowers of all dferent colours.And so Snow asked the flowersthey would be willing to share just a little of their colour. First Snow asked the daffodils, who were a beautul yellow. But they said no, they needed all their colour for themselves.Then Snow asked the bluebells, who were a wonderful blue. But they said they were too small to share any of their colour.Then Snow asked the whin bushesthey could share some of their vivid yellow, and they said no because they needed the colour.Snow even asked the roses of summer, but got the same answer: no.Then Snow heard a small voice and looked down. It was a small white flower. We can share some of our colour, with you it said.ldquoBut you are so small and you need your colour for yourself, said Snow. ldquoYes, the flower replied, ldquowe are small and we need our colour, but there are many of us andeach one of us gives a little then we can give you enough colour.ldquoThat is very kind of you but I donrsquot want to ruin your beautul appearance, said Snow.ldquoDonrsquot worry, said the wee white flower, ldquowe can all take a little colour from the inside of our petals, so it will not be noticed that any white is missing.rsquoAnd so that is how Snow became white. And because of the kindness shown by this little flower, Snow agreed to share its name with it, and so they became known as snowdrops.Snow also shared its space with the wee flower, so snowdrops and snow are often seen on the ground together. Andyou look carefully inside the snowdrop, you will see the hidden part where the white has been scraped off to give to Snow.With the storyrsquos end we arrived at Smeaton Lake, near East Linton, our destination for the snowdrop hunt. Itrsquos such a beautul place where a planted wood stands guard by a lake created  years ago. The woodland here is possibly unsurpassed in East Lothian for the canopy of snowdrops it displays.Excited screams at small patches of the flower soon gave way to ldquowow, look as we reached the end of the waterside and a wood carpeted by the wee flowers.My spirits were lted as I watched my daughter carefully examine flowers for evidence they had shared their colour. She showed her wee brother the green strips inside, explaining that is where the white was shared from. Both were careful not to damage or pick the flowers, despite their desire to do so.ldquoWersquoll find some growing in a less happy place and take those ones home, I assured them.And so we eventually headed back, a delicious bowl of ice cream at The Goth in Prestonpans, accompanied by traditional music, the reward for a good dayrsquos hunting.That night my daughter was reflective. ldquoI wish people wouldnrsquot spoil nature, she said. I felt guilty shersquos only five, I thought to myself, and shouldnrsquot have to be concerned about such things at that age. Perhaps I should have kept my thoughts to myself.ldquoBut I wonrsquot, and Irsquoll tell my friends not to as well. Can you tell me the snowdrop story again  So I told her the story once more.She had one wee snowdrop in a bowl by her bed. We had found it growing precariously at the verge of the road, surrounded by litter, and she wanted to lsquosaversquo it. So we did, hopefully with roots intact.ldquoWell we will plant the snowdrop in the garden and perhaps we will have our own snowdrops next year! I said to her, and she was happy at this.I went downstairs as she slept. My thoughts and emotions flooded me. My anger and depression at the ignorant mess we are making of our planet was superseded by my daughterrsquos determination to make a small dference, just like the snowdrop in the story.And perhaps therein lies the true message of that old tale: a dference can be made,we all do a little, but do it together.The children are the future, but letrsquos not leave all our ugly mess and destruction to our children to deal with. Let us all do something small, as many already are, to change the way we behave and how we appreciate what we have been gted.For our childrenrsquos sake, I really hope itrsquos not too late."},{"url":null,"title":"county-team-conquer-kilimanjaro-in-memory-of-vera-cameron","story":"Dougie Cameron and daughter Laura-Jane were joined by seven other men and women in climbing Mount Kilimanjaro last week.The trek was the latest fundraiser in memory of Vera Cameron and in aid of Cancer Research UK.Laura-Jane said that her mum would have thought the fundraisers were ldquooff our heads but would be ldquoreally proud of their achievement, which takes the fundraising total to about pound,.She said: ldquoIt was a really tough challenge but the fact we were doing it for charity kept us going.ldquoAt the end of the day, it was for such a good cause and we wanted to get to the top and keep the sponsorship going.ldquoThe whole experience was totally dferent to what I expected.ldquoBeing over seven days, we have never done anything like that before and it was tough mentally and physically.ldquoWe had one goal ndash to get to the summit ndash and we ended up making lots of new friends and spent a lot of time with other groups.ldquoIt was a really good experience overall.Vera, of Macmerry, worked for East Lothian Council as a senior administrator in transportation.Dougie, who is site attendant at Kinwegar Recycling Centre in Wallyford, was joined by seven colleagues from the council on the memorable trip.Laura-Jane, , and her dad set off from Scotland on January  alongside Ray Montgomery , Paul Ritchie , Lorraine Faulds , William Kelley , Stuart Baxter , Rachael Cormackand Vanessa Sanal .The group began the trip up the near-,-metre-high mountain on the Saturday and reached the summit last Thursday.Then it was back down before flying home on Sunday and back to work on Monday.Laura-Jane, who works as a PR officer, said it was ldquosurreal to think that just a few days earlier she had been standing at the top of Kilimanjaro.Already, more than pound, has been donated to the good cause, with that figure set to rise to pound, when all the money has been donated and counted.Previously, fundraisers have completed a number of other challenges ndash although nothing on the scale of the latest achievement ndash in memory of Vera, who was  when she passed away from cancer in .The West Highland Way, which stretches from Milngavie to Fort William , and the Three Peaks Challenge, which sees the highest peaks in Scotland, England and Wales ndash Ben Nevis, Scafell Pike and Snowdon respectively ndash climbed have been completed.Laura-Jane, who lives in Tranent, said: ldquoI think my mum would think we were off our heads for doing what we have done but really proud of us.

Irsquom not sure who exactly has been preventing transgender women using public conveniences. So far as I know, you donrsquot have to show a birth certicate, or undergo a medical exam to have a pee. But what do I know as a pale, stale male.What I do know is that ldquocis-gender is an ugly neologism which many women find offensive. They are content with their present sexual terminology. ldquoCis is in the same linguistic ballpark as ldquoTERF ndash trans exclusionary radical feminist, which is a term of abuse used against women who believe persons with penises are, er, male. I should be careful here because a number of TERFS have been banned from social media for saying that a person with a penis is a man. So I wonrsquot say that.Instead, letrsquos just take it as read that in future we are going to have to accept that the concept of sexual dferentiation with which we have been living for thousands of years is finally being exposed as a malign transphobic hood. At any rate, the Scottish Government appears determined to press ahead with reform of the Gender Recognition Act, which will allow trans people to assign themselves legally and biologically female. Hitherto, trans people have had to undergo medical examination and get a diagnosis of ldquogender dysphoria. No more. From now on, anyone can change their birth certicate to whatever they wish.Earlier this month, Holyroodrsquos culture committee warned that ending binary ldquoMale or Female questions in the Scottish census will render much of the results meaningless and, willy nilly, import an unscientic definition of sex into the law. But the Scottish Government is not listening. Nicola Sturgeon told a UN equalities conference last week that the concerns of feminists about the GRA are ldquomisplaced.Women ndash sorry, ldquomenstruators ndash who say that self-ID erases their sexual identity will be told: just get over it. They can complain that ldquosex is a protected characteristic under the  Equalities Act, and that women therefore have a right to their own unique spaces. But now that men can actually become women under the law, this right will be impossible to articulate. Trans women with male anatomy will be entitled to enter womenrsquos changing rooms, girl guide troops or womenrsquos prisons. Women who complain will be guilty of transphobia, and are likely to be visited by the police recording a ldquohate incident.Now, I have nothing against adults changing their gender, or identying as women, queer, non-binary, intersex or whatever.

Not only would this drive a coach and horses through the anti-doping protocols, it surely poses problem for transgender athletes who, of course, also take drugs like testosterone to help them transition to their ldquocorrect male sex.

Irsquom not sure who exactly has been preventing transgender women using public conveniences. So far as I know, you donrsquot have to show a birth certicate, or undergo a medical exam to have a pee. But what do I know as a pale, stale male.What I do know is that ldquocis-gender is an ugly neologism which many women find offensive. They are content with their present sexual terminology. ldquoCis is in the same linguistic ballpark as ldquoTERF ndash trans exclusionary radical feminist, which is a term of abuse used against women who believe persons with penises are, er, male. I should be careful here because a number of TERFS have been banned from social media for saying that a person with a penis is a man. So I wonrsquot say that.Instead, letrsquos just take it as read that in future we are going to have to accept that the concept of sexual dferentiation with which we have been living for thousands of years is finally being exposed as a malign transphobic hood. At any rate, the Scottish Government appears determined to press ahead with reform of the Gender Recognition Act, which will allow trans people to assign themselves legally and biologically female. Hitherto, trans people have had to undergo medical examination and get a diagnosis of ldquogender dysphoria. No more. From now on, anyone can change their birth certicate to whatever they wish.Earlier this month, Holyroodrsquos culture committee warned that ending binary ldquoMale or Female questions in the Scottish census will render much of the results meaningless and, willy nilly, import an unscientic definition of sex into the law. But the Scottish Government is not listening. Nicola Sturgeon told a UN equalities conference last week that the concerns of feminists about the GRA are ldquomisplaced.Women ndash sorry, ldquomenstruators ndash who say that self-ID erases their sexual identity will be told: just get over it. They can complain that ldquosex is a protected characteristic under the  Equalities Act, and that women therefore have a right to their own unique spaces. But now that men can actually become women under the law, this right will be impossible to articulate. Trans women with male anatomy will be entitled to enter womenrsquos changing rooms, girl guide troops or womenrsquos prisons. Women who complain will be guilty of transphobia, and are likely to be visited by the police recording a ldquohate incident.Now, I have nothing against adults changing their gender, or identying as women, queer, non-binary, intersex or whatever.

Good riddance.To say This Week is past its sell-by date is an understatement. Launched in , it seemed fresh and quirky back then to have heavyweight Neil cosy up with a coterie of pals after dark to chat about political developments. Over the years, Michael Portillo and DianeAbbott,party rivals who had known each other since school, became the Richard and Judy of the show, giggling away with cheeky chappy Neil about the issues of the day under New Labour. It was all very self-congratulatory, a bit like the times themselves.Marianne Taylor: Onus is on men to stop abusing workplace powerSixteen years later, itrsquos not only the governing party that has changed. Over the years, as the issues being became more downbeat ndash the  financial crisis, austerity and now the Brexit crisis ndash the format looked ill-equipped to deal with the big questions. Most cringeworthy of all, however, was Paisley-born Neil himself.Donrsquot get me wrong, the aggressive, belligerent interviewing style he is known for had its place, certainly back in the alpha-male s and s when he was king of the jungle . But, as is the case with Humphrys, the increasingly arrogant behaviour on air and in public debate reveals a comically self-important figure who makes Alan Partridge look in touch with the times.Take his embarrassingly pompous monologue about the greatness of Winston Churchill on last weekrsquos show, following weeks of hysterical and pointless national debate about whether the wartime PM should be judged hero or villain. Casting himself as a cross between Margaret Thatcher and a s grammar school headmaster, Neil imperiously instructed us with a severe wag of the finger that Churchill was indeed the most heroic Briton that ever lived. Talk about condescending. And also plain bizarre.Why any BBC journalist would be allowed to showboat like this on live television is quite beyond me. But it just goes to show how unwieldy Neil has become. A couple of weeks earlier he had an equally cringeworthy on-air spat with left-wing columnist Owen Jones, who took him to task over his affiliations with the right-wing press. Surprise, surprise Neil did not take kindly to being put on the spot.Marianne Taylor: Onus is on men to stop abusing workplace powerAs to why he thought it was acceptable to take to Twitter and call respected Observer journalist Carole Cadwalladr, whose excellent work helped expose the Cambridge Analytica scandal a ldquomad cat woman, one can only surmise - rightly, it would seem - that he believes he should be held to dferent standards than other BBC journalists. He has refused to properly apologise for this blatant misogyny.Did this catalogue of awful behaviour have anything to do with him leaving This Week  Who knows. The BBCrsquos director of news, Fran Unsworth, says she is looking to ldquodevelop future projects with Neil. Well, wersquoll see.As for Humphrys, I donrsquot doubt that some will miss his Daily Mail-style sneering and harrumphing on Today at any societal development that wasnrsquot around in his day, his astonishing insensitivity when discussing sexual crimes and the unequal pay of his own female colleagues, his terrible condescension when interviewing young peopleand ethnic minorities, but I certainly wonrsquot. The way in which he has approached Brexit, meanwhile ndash suggesting truculently to the Irish foreign minister recently that Ireland should leave the EU and ldquothrow in their lot with the UK was a particular low point ndash has led many people, me included, to switch off.Irsquom not saying for a minute BBC journalists shouldnrsquot be robust in their questioning, and there are plenty, both male and female ndash Kirsty Wark, Gary Robertson, Emily Maitlisand Nick Robinson spring to mind ndash who can incisively demolish the arguments of those in power.But punching down and wearing prejudices on your sleeve is not only editorially questionable, leaving the Beeb open to accusations of bias, but also astonishingly arrogant.And here we come to the crux of the matter: Neil and Humphrys have had their day. They have worn their arrogance and male privilege as a badge of honour for too long, lacking the humility or self-awareness to examine their own behaviour. Put them out to pastureso they can moan away till their hearts content, perhaps even to each other, about how hard done by they are, how it wasnrsquot like this in the old days.As research highlights, the BBC is losing younger viewers and listeners in their droves. Andrew Neil and John Humphrys are part of the problem - and the Beeb is better off without them."},{"url":null,"title":"the-schools-using-pizza-and-cake-to-tackle-the-poverty-gap","story":"A Scottish council has introduced a range of new initiatives to help primary and secondary schools close the attainment gap between rich and poor.These include pizza nights for hundreds of families to encourage them to become involved in their childrsquos education as well as cake and coffee sessions for teachers to plan a smooth transition for pupils between primary and secondary school.Other projects adopted by schools in Renfrewshire include greater use of data to show evidence of what works, leadership training for teachers and specialised literacy and numeracy support for classroom assistants.Parents and teachers have worked together to ensure pupils from all socio-economic backgrounds can afford to take part in school activities and nearly , pupils have benefited from a programme which develops self-control leading to a signicant reduction in anti-social behaviour.New figures show the initiatives are having a signicant impact.The council achieved an  percentage point increase in expected levels of literacy and a five percentage point increase in expected levels of numeracy between  and .Over the same period, the poverty-related attainment gap has reduced by six percentage points in literacy and four percentage points in numeracy.Now the council is the first in Scotland to be rated ldquoexcellent for its progress in closing the attainment gap by school inspectors.Renfrewshire is one of nine councils in the Scottish Governmentrsquos attainment challenge, with more than a quarter of pupils living in some of Scotlandrsquos most deprived postcodes.

socialist said in an email to supporters.\"Our campaign is about transforming our country and creating a government based on the principles of economic, social, racial and environmental justice.\":Democratic Senator Bernie Sanders Congratulates Scotland on fracking banAn enthusiastic progressive who embraces proposals ranging from Medicare for All to free college tuition, Mr Sanders stunned the Democratic establishment in  with his spirited challenge to Hillary Clinton.While she ultimately became the partys nominee, his campaign helped lay the groundwork for the leftward lurch that has dominated Democratic politics in the Trump era.The question now for Mr Sanders is whether he can stand out in a crowded field of Democratic presidential candidates who also embrace many of his policy ideas and are newer to the national political stage.That is far dferent from , when he was Mrs Clintons lone progressive adversary.But there is no question that Mr Sanders will be a formidable contender for the Democratic nomination.He won more than  million votes in  and dozens of primaries and caucuses, and opens his campaign with a nationwide organisation and a proven small-dollar fundraising effort.\"Were gonna win,\" Mr Sanders told CBS.He said he was going to launch \"what I think is unprecedented in modern American history\": a grassroots movement \"to lay the groundwork for transforming the economic and political le of this country\".And he could be well positioned to compete in the nations first primary in neighbouring New Hampshire, which he won by  points in .But he will not have the state to himself.:The rise of Bernie SandersCalornia senator Kamala Harris, another Democratic presidential contender, was in New Hampshire on Monday and said she would compete for the state.She also appeared to take a dig at Mr Sanders.\"The people of New Hampshire will tell me whats required to compete in New Hampshire,\" she told shoppers at a bookshop in Concord.\"But I will tell you Im not a democratic socialist.\"Senator Elizabeth Warren, of nearby Massachusetts, will be in New Hampshire on Friday.One of the biggest questions surrounding Mr Sanderss candidacy is how he will compete against someone like Ms Warren, who shares many of his policy goals.Ms Warren has already launched her campaign and has planned an aggressive swing through the early primary states.Shortly after announcing her exploratory committee, Ms Warren hired Brendan Summers, who managed Mr Sanderss  Iowa campaign.Other staff from Mr Sanderss first bid have also said they would consider working for other candidates in .The crowded field includes a number of other candidates who are likely to make strong appeals to the Democratic base, including Ms Harris and senators Cory Booker, of New Jersey, Amy Klobuchar, of Minnesota, and Kirsten Gillibrand, of New York.The field could also grow, with a number of high-profile Democrats still considering presidential bids, including former vice president Joe Biden and former Texas representative Beto ORourke.While Mr Sanders had been working to lay the groundwork for a second campaign for months, it was unclear whether he will be able to expand his appeal beyond his largely white base of supporters.In , Mr Sanders notably struggled to garner support from black voters, an issue that could become particularly pervasive during a primary race that could include several non-white candidates.Last month, he joined Mr Booker at an event in Columbia, South Carolina, marking the Martin Luther King Jr holiday.In , Mr Sanders lost the South Carolina primary, which features a heavily black electorate, by  points.Mr Sanders also faces dferent pressures in the #MeToo era.Some of his male staff and supporters in  were described as \"Bernie bros\" for their treatment of women.In the run-up to Mr Sanderss  announcement, persistent allegations emerged of sexual harassment of women by male staff during his  campaign.Politico and The New York Times reported several allegations of unwanted sexual advances and pay inequity.In an interview with CNN after the initial allegations surfaced, Mr Sanders apologised but also noted he was \"a little busy running around the country trying to make the case\".As additional allegations emerged, he offered a more unequivocal apology.\"What they experienced was absolutely unacceptable and certainly not what a progressive campaign - or any campaign - should be about,\" Mr Sanders said on January  on Capitol Hill.\"Every woman in this country who goes to work today or tomorrow has the right to make sure that she is working in an environment which is free of harassment, which is safe and is comfortable, and I will do my best to make that

If they say Mary the punk, or Lofty the big drink of water, they are definitely middle- aged.The day of the funeral dawned with curtains being drawn in only one of the houses in the Square. No-one holds with the old conventions now. Over in the market, Martin Fowler, who has had more faces than Ian Beale has had wives, was telling someone that Dr Legg had been a friend of his gran, Lou. Across the country, a lot of people suddenly felt very old.This being EastEnders there had to be some drama over the funeral. Dot, one of Dr Leggrsquos oldest friends, was due to read at the service but she was out of sorts. \"I can barely get a cuppa tea down her\", said Sonia, which in EastEnders is the equivalent of a hospital code blue.Just as Dr Leggrsquos soap le was being brought to a close another was starting, with the arrival of Masoodrsquos sparky nieces. They asked someone what time the restaurant opened. Sorry, havenrsquot been here for years, said a smartly dressed lady with a peroxide pixie crop. Mary!Mary had a grown up daughter with her , as did Sonia. Must have been a BOGOF offer at the Minute Mart.Next old face to turn up was Lofty who now owns  pubs. \"All well away from here,\" he tells Sharon. Well, obviously. Dangerous game running a pub in those parts. He asks after his ex, Michelle, who is off travelling. In reality, Michelle, played by Susan Tully, became a successful director and producer.

Dot reminded Mary that she also told her to steer clear of Pat, who wanted to put Mary on the game. Pat as a madam. It was a reminder of how dark EastEnders once was, albeit in a grim down south, Loachian way. These days it too often plumps for sensationalism, and is much less effective.Cathy lightened the mood by reminding everyone of the hilarious time Dr Legg caught Loursquos bedcover in his bag and walked off, trailing it behind him. Sadly, that is what passes as comedy in EastEnders.The half hour almost up, Lofty gave Martin a cheque for lsquoChellersquos daughter, Vicky, the one he thought was his but was really Dirty Denrsquos .

Connelly has worked in traffic control since  so theres not much he hasnt seen. The Beast from the East brought the worst weather conditions hes encountered during his many years of service. The team is both proactive and reactive in its mission to keep Scotland’s roads moving – planning for issues it can see coming and responding quickly to those that it can’t.Partnerships play an essential role in the day-to-day operations here.For example, we’re sitting in the resilience room where Transport Scotland, the Scottish Government agency which oversees our transport industry, meets during major crises, such as the Beast from the East.It is here, too, where action plans are drawn up to cope with major events on the annual calendar or roadworks on vital routes.A Police Scotland officer is based in the centre at peak times, along with Traffic Scotland’s media officers who Tweet updates throughout the day and INRIX, a radio team which transmits travel updates, both on the website and to most of our radio stations.From September to April, a MET office employee is also based in the centre.But Traffic Scotland has many more partners behind the scenes too.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.fetoday webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"It looks likely that the council will raise the areas Council Tax rates by three per cent\"  Counterfeit cash alert after incidents reported in Fe viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"FFPL | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"FFPL | Article Teaser\"Stein explained: “We work closely with event organisers to ensure people get to the Open or Royal Highland Show with as little disruption as possible, particularly when two major events are on at the same time.“We also work with the road operating companies, Freight Haulage Association and public transport providers, such as Abellio Scotrail. We co-ordinate road and rail works to minimise the impact for commuters and the Scottish economy.”With all of the country’s roadside SOS calls also being answered at the centre, there are few down times.It’s a round-the-clock job and often a tough one, with operators witnessing incidents that take a toll.Even Stein, despite his many years in the job, isn’t immune.He explained: “Operators can take a call from someone saying they’re going to jump off the Erskine Bridge, pan the camera round and see them jumping. That can really stay with someone.“One that sticks in my mind was an accident at Charing Cross in Glasgow.“The car was a mess and as we panned the camera round we saw a child’s car seat, empty, on the road.“The room fell quiet but nothing was said. Later on, the police told us there were no fatalities and no children had been hurt – the sense of relief here was amazing.”Staff have access to counselling, should they need it as a result of anything they’ve witnessed.But you get the sense of a camaraderie among the team too which undoubtedly helps get them through the tough days.Last February and March, the Beast from the East proved a real challenge – some operators didn’t make it home for days, while others couldn’t make it in.Stein was at the helm through it all, steering the ship through the worst road conditions witnessed in Scotland in a generation.He said: “It was pretty bad in  but the Beast from the East is the worst weather I’ve ever experienced.“Usually, we can marshall maintenance teams and gritters from one part of the country to help in other areas hit by severe weather. That just wasn’t possible. “I was camped out here for five days, as was Humza Yousaf, the then transport minister. The operators couldn’t get home either so they just got on with the job, like they always do.“It was the first red weather warning in Scotland – everyone learned from it.”A Hilltip Icestriker from Finland is now being trialled on the M to ensure recovery teams can access incidents and an electric powered spreader has been deployed on the M.As for daily operations, the public also has an important role to play.“We have just over  CCTV cameras on km of roads,” said Stein. “It’s not a lot to cover such a large area.“So the public are often our eyes and ears, alerting us to breakdowns so we can send out a recovery team.“We get a lot of thank you letters as a result.”Those worried about big brother watching need not fear either.Stein added: “We don’t record number plates or incidents, unless the police ask us to.“So while we get a lot of requests, we can’t help solicitors looking for accident recordings – we don’t have them.”Crossing over the Forth is now far more reliableTraffic Scotland’s National Control Centre was opened on April , , by then depute first minister Nicola Sturgeon. Also used as a contact and education centre for pupils to find out more about the £. billion Queensferry Crossing, thousands of children visited to get a bird’s eye view as the project unfolded. At . miles , it is the longest bridge of its type in the world and also the tallest, towering mhigh. But has it eased congestion for those travelling along the east coast artery between Fe and Edinburgh According to Traffic Scotland statistics, the crossing is very much doing the job it was intended for.Since September , there have been  occasions when the Forth Road Bridge would have been closed to high-sided vehicles due to high winds.Wind shielding on the new crossing enabled it to remain open, affording far more reliability for commuters and hauliers who regularly use it.The hard shoulder on the new bridge also means there are no longer lane closuresvehicles breakdown along its span.Stein said: “The crossing’s improved reliability is delivering benefits not only for commuters but for businesses and the wider Scottish economy too.”"},{"url":null,"title":"crossing borders with your dog after brexit","story":"A.

By working with the community, it will help to understand what transport services are needed, and what steps can then be taken to improve existing routes around the town. “The project also hopes to engage the villages around Inverurie.“By using focus groups and asking the local community about their ideas, it will help to shape rural transport to the benefit of those living in the area.”The project also has support from Colin Clark, Scottish Conservative MP for Gordon: “I would urge local residents and businesses in the Inverurie area to take part in this project and make their views known.“Many people depend upon public transport in rural areas – to get to work, to socialise or to keep appointments at local GP and dental surgeries.“We are fortunate in Inverurie to have a train station connecting the town with Aberdeen and Inverness and there has recently been major investment in the line. “However, in more remote parts of Aberdeenshire, public transport is less reliable and frequent.

If these orders get the go-ahead, and I am confident they will, then I hope we will begin to see a dference in peoples behaviour.\"The Caithness civic leader, Councillor Willie Mackay, also backed the plan. \"It is a fantastic idea but it is the enforcement that is the key to the success of this,\" he said. \"If we can get enough staff trained up to act as traffic wardens ndash and I am pretty sure we can ndash then their presence will deter bad parking.\"Parking in the centre of Wick has been a contentious problem for some time and has often been raised by the local community council and others.

This was despite the fact that the name and address of the person they needed to contact — his mother Edna — was engraved on the memorial.#Vandals couldn#t have done a better job,# he said.Following this wave of public concern, OIC convener Harvey Johnston and chief executive Alistair Buchan have now released a statement apologising for the concern and upset that this project has caused.#Following a tragic accident involving a young child at a Glasgow cemetery, the Scottish Government asked councils to carry out detailed inspections in the interests of public safety,# they said.#We therefore engaged in the kirkyard safety programme for all the right reasons, but recognise that the process we have followed needs to be improved. It was never envisaged that the resulting work would leave kirkyards in the condition they are in. We are sorry about the concern and upset this has led to.#As a caring organisation, responsive to public concern, we will restore kirkyards to the condition people would expect. We will also consider how best to contact and discuss the remedial work required with those concerned. People’s safety is an important concern for us and we will continue to carry out headstone inspections. As at Warebeth , we will use blue pegs to mark stones identied as being unsafe and highlight these to local community representatives.#These stones will not be touched until we publicise the inspection results and give relatives the time they need to discuss with us any work they might wish to carry out themselves.#The statement also confirmed that further updates from the council will be provided further updates over the weeks ahead.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Whether it’s our personal information on social media or important financial details, it’s vital that we’re aware of how to keep our safe and secure from cyber criminals.”“By really getting under the skin of these hackers, our Cyber Sense workshops can point out how to understand how these iniduals work. Through the games we’ve designed, attendees will be able to competitively play roles on both sides of a cyber-crime.

Known today as Rae Strait, it was the missing link in what would become the first navigable Northwest Passage.He also reported back on the ill-fated Franklin expedition, reported evidence of cannibalism — findings which were effectively rejected by the then establishment, and which led to Rae#s achievements being almost completely ignored.The modern-day team, who hope to raise further awareness of these achievements, will be led by Scottish-born and Canada-based expedition leader David Reid, with Scotland also represented by Broxburn-based former Royal Marine Richard Smith.The team will also include two Canadians — adventure film-maker Gerry Tutte and adventurer Frank Wolf.Over  years later and supported with modern-day kit from outdoor specialists Tiso, the explorers are hard at work preparing for the physical and mental challenge of hauling kg sledges for nine hours daily and for up to  consecutive days.Their route will cover undulating, windswept tundra, river valleys and sea ice during what can be the coldest time of year.The Arctic expedition will finish once the four explorers have finally reached Gjoa Haven on King William Island.Mr Smith said: #The Arctic Return expedition will be extremely tough but ultimately our aim is to raise awareness fo the exploits of John Rae and to help restore his rightful place as one of the greatest Scottish explorers in history. It is also our hope that this awareness will inspire the public to support fundraising efforts by the John Rae Society, to restore Rae#s birthplace at the Hall of Clestrain in Oprhir.The team have said any addition funds raised are to be used to produce a documentary film and book about the le and exploits of Rae, the expedition and the history communities, culture and wildle of the Arctic.The public will be able to track the team#s progress at their official website and through social media.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

These include:* A possible community buyout of the Black Isle Leisure Centre run by High Le Highland for Highland Council.* Appointing a business consultant to update the  business plan and probe funding applications.* Appoint a design team by competitive tender to revise the building plans and invite tenders.It was noted that the Black Isle remains a growing area with future housing and an expanding population.While a lottery bid for pound million towards the estimated poundm cost of the scheme failed back in , negotiations with the Scottish Land Fund via Highlands and Islands Enterprise to consider developing the project as a community enterprise company have continued.Mr Sinclair said: \"A unanimous positive attitude was evident at the meeting which allows further progress to be made to develop this very important project for the benefit of folk on the Black Isle and beyond.\"A follow-up meeting is planned later this month.Whats your view  Email newsdesk@spp-groupWednesday  Feb  : AMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

So a budget for jobs is really good news for people.ldquoA key element of the feedback we received is that we have many cumbersome, complicated and bureaucratic processes.

We are all ambitious for improvement and what has struck me is the huge buy-in from all staff in challenging circumstances.ldquoThis budget will enable us to be sustainable and I am really confident that we have the necessary knowledge and expertise in our top team to take forward the change programme that is required.Chief executive Donna Manson added: ldquoThis budget process has been about us being connected. Connected to our communities, to our staff, to our partners, to each other ndash building relationships and enabling better conversations and improved understanding.ldquoI really appreciate the input from staff across the organisation during the whole engagement process, and for some really honest feedback. I am equally delighted with the really positive engagement across the political groups.ldquoWe need to manage all our resources, to redesign, to become more resilient, to be more efficient, to invest in our workforce and to plan for the future.

This positioning means that Invergordon receives more cruise passengers than any other port in Scotland, generating over pound million in tourist spend and hundreds of jobs within the wider Highland economy in . This will increase to pound million this year.The expansion was triggered by the successful award of a pound million contract from the Moray East Offshore Windfarm to use the site to assemble its turbines.The exhibition, which will be held at the port offices in Shore Road, will display the construction programme and timings of the expansion project and are welcome.AN experienced solicitor has joined the board of the port.Rhona Harper, who has worked for more than  years as a solicitor, is a procurement law specialist, experienced in developing and implementing innovative public private partnerships.For  years, she was a partner of the Scottish law firm Shepherd and Wedderburn during which team she managed a team of solicitors and support staff and led the firmrsquos Government and Public Sector Group.The board meets regularly to review the PoCFrsquos business and future plans.

It was a beautul thing and I cherished it for years. But I remember one of the strange things about that Christmas was going back to school.It must have been primary  or , and we had a group discussion in class about what Santa had brought us all.At the time, I wondered why so many of my classmates had asked for what I innocently termed “boring” things, like a new coat.Years later however, when Christmas began to bite into my own budget, I realised that my child’s vision of the world had not seen the real signicance of the gts.I do not come from a particularly well-off background.For the first decade and a half of my le we lived in a house rented from the housing association.We didn’t have a lot but I had both a new coat and a bike that year.I’m not sure but I think that memory had a lot to do with my recent determination to be my party’s spokesperson on the Department of Work and Pensions .Oh some witty person – probably one of my sisters – will say it’s more to do with me getting closer to my pension.But as any WASPI woman will tell you, that’s not as close as it used to be, which is an argument for another day.No. Every week constituents come to me who have been given what can best be termed as “the run around” by some section of the DWP.: Amber Rudd: Families on universal credit did have to use food banksIt could be pensions, it could be Universal Credit or it could be the system of Personal Independence Payments for those with a disability which, as assessment systems go, is not fit for purpose.In every one of them, I see someone who deserves to be treated better.In each case I’m reminded that in this, the fth richest nation on earth, there are still people for whom le is a daily economic challenge.And what we often overlook is that the majority of those who find themselves facing an uphill financial struggle are already working for a living – the ‘just about managing’ to whom Theresa May promised so much in her first speech as Prime Minister.In a meeting this week with the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, I was stunned to hear that of the already unacceptable number of children living in poverty in this country, two-thirds are from working households.How are we getting it so wrong in this country I have written in this newspaper before about my frustrations at the problem in our country’s welfare system, of which we were once so proud.I have criticised the management of the changes in state pension age for women.And I have railed at the issues with the well-intentioned but fatally underfunded Universal Credit.Only this week the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, Amber Rudd, admitted that its failings have been responsible for sending so many people to food banks.But the crux of my gripe is that I realise that we have slipped very far from the fair society, backed by a strong economy, we aim to be.: Rudd urged to ditch DWP policies after damning UN reportOne half of that, the former, we have managed to achieve. The other still seems to be tantalisingly out of our reach. And it needn’t be.I am not in Government. ButI were, the first thing I would do in my new post would be to act on that recognition which Amber Rudd is the first in the Cabinet to publicly acknowledge.I would put back the £ billion which George Osborne took out of the budget for Universal Credit.Then I would pause the roll-out and migration from legacy benefits and fix the obvious problems that are leaving families with nothing to live on for more than a month, causing people to fall into rent arrears and adding stress to an already intolerable burden.After that, I would address the issues which still allow situations where the benefits of getting a job are undermined.But, more than anything , I would want to do something about those children in poverty.I thought about them this week and I thought about that Christmas when I was no more than eight or nine years old.At that time, le was simple for me.I had a big loving family and any financial challenges my parents might have faced were well hidden from us.For my younger sisters, it was slightly dferent.When my dad died at the age of , we went overnight from being relatively well off and living in a home we owned to a single-parent family with no income. My mum went back out to work and somehow managed to give my sisters everything I had known.But, at the age of , I realised how easy it is to fall through the cracks.Then, like now, I thought about those kids in my class that Christmas.Most of them had at least as much potential as I did, but not all of them got to fulfill it.Today that thought as much as,not more than, any political principle I have is what drives my daily le. I have been lucky. I have been able to give my daughter the start in le my parents were able to give me.Maybe because of that I want every child to have the opportunity to fulfill their potential, and feel it’s up to those of us who have to make sure it happens.No family should have to choose between Christmas presents and keeping warm.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"brexit nicola sturgeon tells french independence would differ from isolationism","story":"Scottish independence would be dferent from the #isolationism# of Brexit, Nicola Sturgeon last night told the French Parliament.Scottish independence would be dferent from the “isolationism” of Brexit, Nicola Sturgeon last night told the French Parliament.The First Minister claimed leaving the UK would serve to make Scotland more “interdependent” with other European nations.She made the remarks in an address to delegates on the foreign affairs committee of the Assemblée Nationale, the lower house of the French legislature. It was part of a formal trade mission to Paris.The UK’s approach to Brexit came under fire from the SNP leader, who stepped up calls for a change in approach from Theresa May as the prospect of a no-deal exit intensies.Ms Sturgeon says she will seek to hold second referendum on independence in response to Brexit and will set out her approach in coming weeks.She told delegates yesterday: “When we have greater clarity about the terms of Brexit, Scotland must have the option to choose a dferent course by opting to become an independent country.“I will say more about independence at a future date.“One thing I do want to stress, however, is that, for the Scottish Government, independence is not about the isolationism that characterises Brexit. Instead independence would see us recognising and embracing our interdependence with other nations.“We will always seek to be close allies and partners with our neighbours in Europe.“The last two years, to my mind, have underlined the importance of that position.”Ms Sturgeon has indicated recently that a referendum on independence could be several years away and called for “calm consideration” in the face of growing pressure from leading Nationalists to capitalise on the chaos of Brexit currently engulfing Westminster politics.Ex-First Minister Alex Salmond, along with senior SNP MPs Joanna Cherry and Angus MacNeil, are among those who back a more pro-active approach on the issue.A majority of Scotsvoted remain in the EU referendum and an independent Scotland would seek to rejoin the EU.The First Minister said such international institutions have “brought signicant and lasting benefits to Europe and to the world as a whole”. She said: “We are being reminded at the moment that the principles that they exemply – multilateralism, co-operation, a respect for human rights – cannot be taken for granted.“We hear too many voices of intolerance and isolationism around the world today. That should concern all of us.“And so participating in international institutions, and speaking up for internationalist values, is hugely important.” Theresa May’s proposed Brexit deal would be “damaging” to Scotland’s interests, the First Minister said.The Prime Minister must face down her Brexiteer wing, Ms Sturgeon added, and push for a deal that keeps the UK in the customs union and single markets – or agree to a second referendum on EU membership.“There is a strong democratic case for that,” Ms Sturgeon said.“For Parliament, it is a way to break the deadlock.For Scotland, it is an opportunity for our wish to stay in the EU to be respected.“And for all voters, it is a chance to make a decision based on much more detailed information than was ever made available in .”Ms Sturgeon said at the time of the referendum, the EU had served as a scapegoat for wider concerns such as austerity.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"hundreds saved by scotland s new ambulance response system","story":"Hundreds of people have been saved by a new ambulance response system which prioritises le-threatening calls, a study has found.The Scottish Ambulance Service changed the way it responds to the most unwell patients in  with  call handlers giving the highest ­priority to incidents such as cardiac arrests.An evaluation of the changes has found the system has saved the equivalent of  lives.Under the new system, call handlers are taking longer on the phone to despatch paramedics and some lower priority calls are waiting longer for an ambulance.

We would like to thank everybody for the great support locally.”The house was originally built in  for Eilidh#s great grandfather Samuel Campbell, and for many years it operated as a temperance hotel.Fire ravaged the building in the s and, although part of the domestic side was occupied up until around  years ago, it has since lain dormant.Councillors on the review body said the couple deserved sympathy and support in their vision to restore a building which had been in Mrs Mcniven#s family for four generations.The couple#s supporting statement before planners said: “It is important to remember that this is a property that has been in the same family for  years and is about to become a new home for a young local family. The historic value of the property is not lost on them. However without intervention it may very well be lost entirely.”Dingwall councillor Margaret Paterson said she thought it “sad” that obstacles had been placed in the way of a couple who proposed to put so much into a building that was “almost falling down”.Lochalsh councillor Biz Campbell and Raymond Bremner, who represents Wick and East Caithness, also spoke in support of the couple#s plans.Councillor Bremner said he believed the aluminium window frames, as proposed for the development, had changed considerably from previous types which did not stand up well to spray from seawater.He added: “I have a lot of sympathy with the applicants and with the points made in their appeal. I don#t have an issue with the change of use.”Broadford and Strath Community Council had lobbied in support of the couple, while neighbours and local businesses also backed the proposed conversion.Community council chairman Hamish Fraser said: “They are proposing to restore a building that will become an asset to the community. It#s a common-sense decision to support a young couple who want to live and make a business here.”Planning officials had turned down the original application on the grounds that it had breached three policies of the Highland-wide local development plan.In their reason for refusal planners said modern windows and a door with patterns “is not in keeping with the character of a historic building”.In his letter of support of the couple, local historian and broadcaster Professor Norman Macdonald said: “In many years of regularly attending Highland Council planning committee meetings at all levels I do not recall a single application where a big and ambitious idea has come to the brink of jeopardy over such relatively immaterial and tangential matters.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/WINTER-19-TRACTOR-1.jpg","title":"the waterboys set to kick off skye live festival","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineLegendary Scottish-Irish folk-rock band The Waterboys are to kick-off the Skye Live festival’s fth-anniversary celebrations this autumn.The opening concert in Portree on Thursday th September will see the bandto Skye for the first time in nearly  years.

It is a safe bet that there are only three: Robert Somerville, John Keenan, and Bob Fulton.Back in March , when they were union shop stewards at the town#s Rolls Royce plant, the three men # and thousands of their co-workers # were responsible for virtually grounding the air force of Chilean dictator General Augusto Pinochet, who had seized power just a few months before in a savage CIA-backed coup. The documentary #Nae Pasaran#, screened in Portree last weekend, tells the story of how these principled trade unionists came to be awarded the highest honour the Republic of Chile can bestow upon foreigners.With much of the world appalled by the overthrow, in September , of the democratically-elected socialist Government of Salvador Allende, it fell to Bob Fulton # a burly, no-nonsense Christian with wartime experience of fighting fascist dictators # to set the ball rolling in East Kilbride. Arriving for work on the morning of th March  he uncovered a chilling truth about the eight Rolls Royce jet engines that had just been delivered to the plant for servicing: the engines came from the British Hawker Hunter jets used by Pinochet loyalists to bomb, amongst other targets, the presidential palace in Santiago where Allende died on the day the coup began.Now in his mid-s, Bob immediately #blacked# the engines that is, he declared them subject to an industrial dispute. As such, they could not be touched by any worker # or anyone , for that matter # until the dispute was resolved. His colleagues soon followed suit, much to the consternation of management and the UK Government. And so the engines sat, untouched, out in the open air for the next four years, until they became useless lumps of rusting metal. Moreover, the East Kilbride plant was the only place in the world licensed to service the engines. So, aside from the eight now-engineless jets, the rest of Pinochet#s air force could not be kept airworthy while workers thousands of miles away stuck to the principles of international solidarity. How many lives this saved on the ground is a moot point.#Nae Pasaran# is a paean to what can be achieved by collective action, and to what might be described as the golden age of trade unionism. But the documentary # written and directed by Felipe Bustos Sierra, son of an exiled Chilean journalist # also works as an emotionally-charged voyage of discovery.For over  years, Bob, John and Robert, and other former plant workers doubted whether or not their actions had any lasting effect on the lives of persecuted Chileans, many of whom were trade unionists like themselves. #Nae Pasaran# works in a dramatic sense because we watch as this gap in their knowledge is filled. The Scottish refuseniks did make an impact. Their stand mattered.What makes #Nae Pasaran# so moving is that the surviving union men, interviewed atby Sierra in his adopted homeland, are shown interviews he conducted back in Chile with survivors of Pinochet#s brutality. Now old men themselves, the victims recalled how they took solace in smuggled radios tuned to Radio Moscow, which broadcast regular updates on the Scottish union#s boycott. The action # or rather inaction # of the Rolls Royce workers gave many Chileans hope that they would not be forgotten or abandoned by the outside world. It may even have contributed directly to the saving of seven lives.Among the hundreds of Chilean exiles arriving in the UK were seven rumoured to have escaped execution or imprisonment because the air force acquired spare parts from Israel, South Africa, and India. So desperate were the Chilean authorities for this materiel they may have swapped the seven detainees for what they needed. Sierra never proves this conclusively, however, because the UK Home Office refused to release certain files relating to the boycott.And what of the jet engines, left to rust in East Kilbride  They were whisked away early one morning in . To this day no one knows who took them, but the Rolls Royce workers were told they were back in service with the Chilean air force. A year later Margaret Thatcher came to power and relations with the Pinochet regime were quickly normalised. Arms exports resumed in earnest.But the #blacked# engines were never used again. One of them, which Sierra discovered in a derelict yard outside Santiago, was shipped back to Scotland in , the year before #Nae Pasaran# hit the cinemas. It is due to be installed, as a lasting monument to the boycott, in a college campus in East Kilbride in the very near future.#Nae Pasaran# celebrates people power. After the screening, the topic was the subject of a short talk by Councillor Chris McEleny, leader of the SNP Group on Inverclyde Council, who also answered questions from the audience on British involvement in the destruction of Yemen, the desire by Tory Brexiteers to deregulate and deunionise even further, and the situation in Venezuela. Indeed, Mr McEleny drew an #obvious parallel# with Venezuela, where the democratically-elected socialist Government of another resource-rich South American country is being targeted for regime change.He said: #In Chile, before the coup, US corporations had huge commercial interests in copper mining and they sought to undermine and destabilise the Allende Government, and this is pretty much what we are seeing in Venezuela right now. Poverty in Venezuela has been engineered by the US, just as it was in Chile. We are seeing the same media pattern, a capitalist conditioning programmeyou like, drip-feeding propaganda to make intervention look like the right thing to do. We are seeing that right now with Venezuela so we need to see the same solidarity that Bob Fulton and others showed in the s.#Sadly, as Bob and his comrades lamented, in an era of weakened trade unions such a workplace boycott could probably not take place now.

James is  years old and is a professional cookery apprentice at the Galgorm Resort  Spa Hotel and Northern Regional College. James was studying for his A-Levels in Nutrition and Food Science, Le and Health Sciences and Applied ITC at Cambridge House Grammar School when he had the opportunity to take up work experience in Antrim’s Ramble Inn. For James – who had always dreamed of being a chef – his time in the Inn’s kitchens led to the realisation that his passion could be his full-time career. When he found out about the apprenticeships with Northern Regional College and the Galgorm Resort  Spa, he jumped at the chance. He said: “I love the creativity that comes with being a chef, you get to make people happy with your food.“So when I was given the chance to learn more and get hands-on experience in the kitchens of one of the biggest players in Northern Ireland’s hospitality sector I just couldn’t pass up that opportunity. It was a no-brainer for me!”James decided to leave school after his AS-Levels and hasn’t looked back since: “I really enjoyed school and I had thought that afterwards I would maybe go on to catering college. However, this apprenticeship is a chance to get experience in the industry and offers me an immediate route into the career I love – why would I put that off for another year ” What does a typical day at the work look like for James  At the moment, he has an enviable position looking after the restaurant’s delectable range of desserts. This means weighing out and prepping ingredients, plating up panna cotta, sticky toffee pudding and cheesecake and making sure the Galgorm’s fridges never run low of sweet treats. If you’re lucky enough to be on campus on a Wednesday, you might even get to sample some of James’ cooking. He and his colleagues spend their morning whipping up meals and being assessed on their abilities. Their top-class cooking is served up to hungry staff and students in the canteen. The afternoon is spent familiarising themselves with the extensive health and safety rules which every chef must know. When asked why he chose the apprenticeship route James says that for him it was the obvious choice: “With the apprenticeship you get to earn while you learn, and you have no student loans to worry about paying back at the end.”But most importantly, it’s the hands-on experience he has received throughout his training which James claims is most valuable.“You can read in a text-book that a professional kitchen is a high-pressure environment, but unless you’ve been in there at peak dinner-serving time, you can’t truly understand it.” James says he would “most definitely” recommend the apprenticeship scheme to someone : “If you want to go into the hospitality sector, I honestly think it’s the smartest career move you can make.” And his advice to them  “Just go for it! You have nothing to lose and so much to gain!”  "},{"url":null,"title":"spreading the message of hope","story":"The members of Loughbrickland Women#s Institute hosted Jo-Anne Dobson, Kidney Care UK Northern Ireland Ambassador as guest speaker at their President#s Night at the Belmont Hotel, Banbridge.

When we go back and look at the stats, those are the things we will be saying.#It was a slow start to this game with both teams hitting early wides, but the pattern was soon established with James McNaughton and Alan Devine trading frees before Aonghus Clarke fired over from range.Three McNaughton frees gave Antrim the edge as he then traded points with Devine before Nigel Elliott finally shot Antrim#s first from play on  minutes to make it - to -, but this was to be their final score of the opening half.Westmeath drew level thanks to a Devine free and a magnicent sideline cut from Derek McNicholas before Devine gave them the lead.It was to get even better for the visitors on  minutes as Devine got a touch to Robbie Greville#s long delivery to find the net, while McNicholas and Devine added points to make it - to - at the break.With the swirling wind at their backs in the second period, Antrim needed a bright start and they got it with McNaughton clipping over a free and then Nigel Elliott sent Keelan Molloy in to flick to the net.McNaughton and Kevin Rice added points but, crucially, Antrim could never get ahead.The visitors rallied with the next three points and this was a lead they were to hold for the majority of the second period as the teams effectively went score-for-score.Antrim did get to within one with Conor McCann – who had what looked like a good shout for a penalty waved away when hauled back by Tommy Doyle late on – and McNaughton hitting scores. But McNicholas – who earlier clipped over another sideline – landed a monster free.McNaughton had a free that was finally given as a wide deep into added time when it appeared over, but the goal Antrim needed wouldn#t come as Westmeath held on for a crucial win.ANTRIM: R Elliott S Rooney, J Dillon, P Duffin M Donnelly, S McCrory, C McHugh C McCann , N McKeague N Elliott , J McNaughton , K RiceE O#Neill, K Molloy , C Clarke.

After giving the matter some thought, Squinter has been unable to separate two candidates, and so the prize is jointly awarded. First co-winner is Andrea Leadsom, Tory Leader of the House, for her reaction to Donald Tusk’s statement that there’s “a special place in hell” for those who promoted Brexit “without a sketch of a plan”.Andrea’s response was rather more temperate than that of Sammy Wilson, who opined that Mr Tusk was a “devilish, trident wielding, euro maniac”. She remarked, with what would appear at first blush to be commendable restraint: “The man has no manners.”But on hearing Andrea’s mention of the word “manners”, a little bell went off somewhere deep in Squinter’s hippocampus and after a short period of beard-scratching and pencils-sucking, it came to Squinter why the Honourable Member is on rather thin ice when it comes to matters of polite conduct.Come back in time with Squinter to the summer of , just two weeks before Britain voted to leave the EU. Andrea was locked in a battle with Theresa May for leadership of the Conservative Party. In an interview with The Times, when asked why the party should opt for her, she replied that her rival “possibly has nieces, nephews, lots of people. But I have children who are going to have children who will directly be part of what happens next.”So there we have it. Andrea pitched for the top job by saying having children gives her more of a stake in the country. At which point, we should remind ourselves that Theresa May has spoken honestly and movingly about the fact that she and her husband Philip were unable to have children.Manners  Yih pays yer money…Joint winner is British Transport Secretary Chris Grayling who announced on Friday that he was cancelling the £ million contract he had awarded to Seaborne Freight just before Christmas to provide a ferry service from Ramsgate to Ostend to ease the pressure on the port of Dover should the UK crash out with no deal.Mr Grayling’s tenure has been one of the great comedy shows of British politics and it’s widely believed that he remains in office only to direct fire away from more senior colleagues. Not that he could have seen this mess developing. After all, Seaborne Freight was a highly respected company with a long history of professional and responsible conduct in the business of ferries and freight, right  Well, since the company only hit the news in December you probably don’t need Squinter to remind you that Seaborne Freight:• Was a completely new company• Didn’t own a ship• Cut and pasted its website terms and conditions from a pizza delivery firmand an online boutiqueThe high-flying cabinet minister sent out to back Grayling when the contract was scrubbed was Communities Secretary James Brokenshire. You know, the bloke was Secretary of State here for a while and nobody noticed.Chris’ll be gone by the end of the week, then.Fail to prepare#LET’S be honest, Jim Wells isn’t flavour of the month within the DUP. The South Down MLA had the party whip withdrawn last spring after he fell out with the top brass over his claim that they had reneged on a promise to reinstate him as Health Minister after he stepped down in  over an election hustings row.Jimbo claimed then party leader party leader Peter Robinson promised to reinstate him when andthe furious furoreblew over . He further alleged that when Arlene Foster took over as leader she ignored two written requests from him to honour Peter’s pledge. These days Jimbo’s something of a voice in the wilderness, technically still a DUP MLA but shorn of any authority to speak for the party. Which makes him of considerable interest to journalists, since the resentment he clearly still feels makes him a little bit more willing to open up about things than other DUP reps.Jim’s been at it again this week and, given the state we’re in at the moment, you’ll probably not be surprised to hear that it’s Brexit-related. Jim revealed that at the extraordinary meeting at which the party decided to back Leave in the months leading up to the EU referendum in , there was zero discussion of what a Leave vote would mean for the local economy. This would be an awkward revelation for most parties, but after the tsunami of controversies that the DUP has been through in the past couple of years, it seems to have reached the point that its brand is so polluted the tin can’t get any more dented, the label any dirtier. But that’s not the disaster that it would certainly be for any other party because the DUP’s substantial vote clearly consists of people who don’t care what they get up to as long as they’re not Sinn Féin.Lack of planning – it’ll do for ye every time. Fail to prepare, prepare to fail, that’s the old saying and nowhere does it ring more true than in the crazy world of Brexit. Let’s take a look at a few of the most notorious failures of a lack of foresight and seewe can work out where the DUP Brexit calamity fits in…Betamax’Member when video cassettes were the most exciting innovation in the history of technology  You don’t  Well, you must be under , so let’s seewe can explain. Two Japanese giants of the global electronics industry were caught up in the race to win control of the massive new market. JVC produced the eventually successful VHS format, while Sony produced the toploading Betamax system. Although the Betamax system was of a superior picture quality, it was considerably more expensive and had a shorter recording time. At a meeting in , Sony were advised by Matsushita engineers to switch to the VHS format, but declined. It wa a historic mistake, dealing the company a crippling financial blow from which it would take years to recover.Ford EdselFord were inordinately pleased with the Edsel, a new model released in the United States in , the year after the Ford family relinquished control of the company. The Edselwas designed to give Ford the upper-hand in the highly competitive premium intermediate market . The company missed the design boat, though, as the car harked back to an earlier age at a time when families were increasingly turning to compact vehicles. The Edsel was discontinued two years later, with sales signicantly less than half the break-even sales figure. Executives took their eye off the ball and didn’t realise the Edsel was flopping until over .bnhad been spent on design, manufacture and new dealerships. To this day, new models that fail are still referred to in the US automobile market as ‘Edsels’.New CokeIn the mid-s, as other soft drinks were increasingly threatening the dominance of Coca-Cola, the company decided it was going to ditch the original Coke formula and go with an improved ‘New Coke’.The  launch was a disaster and sales were badly hit, particularly in the southern states where Coca-Cola was considered an integral part of American culture. Tens of thousands of complaints flooded into company HQ weekly. The problem was not so much with the taste – the company had disastrously underestimated the hold that the Coca-Cola brand had on the American psyche. Smelling blood, rivals Pepsi began a new ad campaign with the strapline ‘Now I Know Why Coke Did It’ . Fans started booing ads for New Coke at large sports events. Just  days after New Coke was launched, the company announced that it was bringing back the old formula.Has to be a Brexit message in there somewhere, no "},{"url":null,"title":"75m plans to redevelop old belfast telegraph building approved by","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

And that is what we’ve negotiated.“I don’t think that we’ll get to anything very dferent to the agreement that we have now, the agreement that is on the table, eventhat involves a period of uncertainty after  March.“We’ll end up with an agreement not dissimilar to what we have now, which is why we should raty it now.”Mr Varadkar said the UK was seeking to explore alternative arrangements to the backstop but the Irish Government had yet to details.“We’ve explained why the backstop with a time limit isn’t a backstop,” he said.“As the Prime Minister eloquently explained herself when she was advocating for the backstop, an insurance policy that can be cancelled at the time when you most need it is not an insurance policy at all.”"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37812018.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/kill.jpg","title":"ulster woman set alight by candle during mass saved by gaa star","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Mrs Mitchell explained that following her sonrsquos death, his owed back pay from the Army would have settled the debt.The soldierrsquos mother also revealed that he had told her about two incidents in Afghanistan which had upset him.In one of them, he had been due to be the soldier at the front of the patrol but was swapped with a colleague at the last minute. The soldier who replaced him subsequently suffered severe leg injuries in an attack.Mrs Mitchell also told the inquest that towards the end of , her son had become hyper vigilant, confided in her less, was jumpy and struggled to sleep.She described how he had successfully applied for his ldquodream job in the Army as an outdoor instructor, explaining this had involved undertaking courses in the UK, Spain and Germany which left him very tired.The soldierrsquos mother also described how her son had felt isolated after a knee injury held him back from joining his unit in Afghanistan, and instead had to serve with a dferent unit.She said that when he ed to Ballykinlar and the new job, he continued to feel isolated as a number of soldiers were taking redundancy at that time.ldquoEverything hit him at that precise moment. He thought everyone was leaving, he was exhausted, his back pay hadnrsquot come through, he had had a row with Cherand he had just got back after being away for a long time.Mrs Mitchell added that she did not blame the army for her sonrsquos death but felt more could have been done to help him.A statement form Rleman Mitchellrsquos friend, Kendall Gibson, also referred to an incident when the  year-old ran away from fireworks.ldquoHe said the fireworks reminded him too much of Afghanistan, stated Mr Gibson, adding that he was also concerned about his friendrsquos drinking.Three soldiers mdash friends of Rleman Mitchell mdash who had discovered his body were sent twice to another barracks in Lisburn for treatment which included counselling.The inquest also heard that it was common place for soldiers to refer to the local army base as ldquoBally-kill-yourself.Driving instructor William Riley, who had been taking Lance Corporal Ross for HGV lessons in the week before his suspected suicide, told the inquest that the soldier was one of many who used the term.Mr Riley told how the Lance Corporal had cut a ldquofrustratedrsquo figure in the week before his death, displayed an attitude problem and had been involved in a verbal altercation with another instructor two days before his death.The inquest continues..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Art","story":"A HIGHLY acclaimed Downpatrick-based charity has secured a signicant financial boost from the Department of Justice.The Le Change, Changes Lives organisation mdash based in Market Street mdash has secured a slice of a near poundm funding cake made available under the government departmentrsquos assets recovery scheme.Over poundm has been distributed to organisations across the province since the schemersquos launch in , with the Downpatrick charity aiming to use its pound, three-year funding package to provide its clients with basic food hygiene training, alongside cooking participation and demonstration skills.The charity helps and supports people suffering with a range of mental health issues and addiction problems, offering professional and confidential counselling, mental health and addiction support and suicide intervention services.It also works to help minimise social isolation, alongside encouraging wellness and recovery and family support.Since its launch, Le Change Changes Lives has provided opportunities for people with a iety of problems to engage in constructive activities, including giving new le to old furniture through the very successful Pop Up Art initiative.The money secured under the assets recovery scheme, which is managed by the Policing and Community Safety Partnership, will finance the charityrsquos No Lost Cause project.Charity officials say the project is designed to provide an ldquointergenerational ersionary and therapeutic community programme which aims to encourage disadvantaged and disengaged people to find their potential and build upon it, using activities, counselling, advocacy, training and support.A logo is being used to publicise the project inspired by the lsquoNot Waving but Drowningrsquo poem by Stevie Smyth which is often told in Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. It gives an account of a drowned man whose distressed thrashing in the water was mistaken for waving.Charity officials say the No Lost Cause initiative is designed to complement the highly successful Pop Up Art project which is funded by the Big Lottery until this October.Over the le of the No Lost Cause project, charity officials will strive to reduce crime through erting people away from substance abuse and associated links to criminal activity.Le Change, Changes Lives officials have confirmed that the new project also aims to reduce reoffending by providing training and skills development activities and counselling to deal with substance and relationship family issues and provide support to improve the self-esteem of participants to help them re-engage with family and communities.They hope that through the basic food hygiene training, cooking participation and demonstration project that it will help parents revive cooking healthy, affordable family meals, to be eaten together at the kitchen table, helping achieve interaction and involvement in young peoplersquos livesAilish Teague, who helped establish the Downpatrick charity with her husband Manus, is delighted with the Department of Justice funding.She said competition to secure the money for the next three years was competitive, with groups in each of the provincersquos  councils eligible to apply.ldquoThe application was made through the Policing and Community Safety Partnership and the asset recovery is a brilliant resource, with money taken from criminals invested back into community projects, said Ailish.ldquoWe can use this money for the programmes we deliver, working closely with people who have a range of addictions.ldquoOur clients are also delighted that we have secured this funding which will enable is to deliver an NVQ Level One in hospitality services from our Market Street base with the food hygiene aspect of the course designed to give people a taste of employment.While delighted to have secured funding under the Department of Justice scheme, charity officials are conscious that their Lottery funding ends this October.Mrs Teague says officials have met with Lottery representatives and has suggested that the chances of having their funding extended are ldquozero to nil.She added: ldquoIt will be dficult to secure more Lottery funding which could leave us with no money to finance our core costs including rent and other overheads.

They were well prepared.ldquoThey had carried out research which helped them to face questions about migration and environmental issues. There was no doubt, they had been given the short straw as the other countries were ready to attack them for their current position in wanting to leave the EU.ldquoHowever, the students put aside their own views and represented the country they were delegated, in this debate.ldquoBeing the UK is what made it so challenging and also so rewarding as they did a fantastic job.Mrs Orsi said: ldquoNot being able to participate in future debates is only one of the educational detriments to leaving the EU.ldquoI think our students are going to be greatly affected on many levels, both in terms of academic opportunities, funding and employment. It is the very people who were not able to vote who will be impacted upon most.Ciara said studying A-Level politics definitely helped the girls flex some political muscle in their challenge.She added: ldquoWe have been discussing Brexit a great deal in class and we felt secure in our knowledge.ldquoHowever, what we did find challenging was trying to find out the positions of other smaller EU countries in terms of their policies on migration and the environment.ldquoI am very interested in politics and as a language student, I feel it is important we are involved in these debates to ensure we continue to develop our understanding of our European neighbours.ldquoWhat is unfortunate is the fact this might be the last time we will be asked to participate as we will no longer be a member state.The debate was organised by the British Council with the aim of developing studentsrsquo intercultural understanding of other countries while learning more about the political workings of the ious states..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch farming family feature on BBC documentary  ","story":"THE trials of farming will be shown through the eyes of a Ballynahinch family as they are featured tonight in the BBC Two series, This Farming Le.Top beef cattle breeder Geoff Rodgers allowed a film crew to capture him and his family work their -acre farm between Ballynahinch and Dromara for most of last year.Geoff inherited the farm when his father died Martin and runs it with his we, Lizzie, who is a special needs classroom assistant at Spa Primary School, with their three children, Emma , Martin , and  year-old Lucy.He admitted that he had turned down previous offers to take part in other farming shows but finally agreed to take part as he was a real fan of the show.The result is a moving insight into what it takes to care for  animals  hours a day and what happens when it all goes wrong.ldquoI think some viewers will be reduced to tears. Well, thatrsquos what happened when all of the farmers featured watched the programme a few weeks ago, said  year-old Geoff.ldquoIt will show that there is a real connection between the family and the animals and itrsquos not all just about sales or winning competitions.Two months before the crew started filming last January, the family were hit with terrible news mdash Bovine TB was discovered in their pedigree herd and  animals had to be slaughtered.A movement restriction then had to put on the herd which meant that no animals could enter or leave the farm until two consecutive TB tests prove negative.The programme catches up with the family on the day a vet calls to carry to do the next test and to determine whether any more of the herd will have to be slaughtered.ldquoIt just happened that the crew came to us in one of the most challenging times for the farm, said Geoff.ldquoAnd while I wonrsquot gave too much away, what happens not only affects me but also my children as they all get involved, especially the youngest Lucy, to help me get the animals ready for the likes of Balmoral Show.ldquoWe not only lost some of the animals but you also lose years of breeding, particularly with some of the animals my father had bred them, which was hard, and then of course, therersquos a knock-on loss of new calves.ldquoIt was particularly hard as I had buyers waiting to buy bulls and cattle of me but we couldnrsquot do anything until we got the all-clear.The tension builds over the next few episodes of the show as the deadline looms to Balmoral Show mdash the highlight of the farming calendar in Northern Ireland and the major sales day for Geoff.Viewers will see that the Rodgers familyrsquos hopes of further success at Balmoral are pinned on bull Mario, who Geoff described ldquoas a real character and his young half-sister, Nadia.This Farming Le starts tonight at pm on BBC ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"British Irish group on High Street conference  ","story":"THE impact of online sales on the High Street was discussed at a recent meeting in Newcastle.Representatives from the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly were in the resort where they were met by South Down MLA Colin McGrath and Newry, Mourne and Down Council chairman Mark Murnin.Mr McGrath explained the committee has a dferent area of investigation each year and that in  is focusing on the impact of online sales on the High Street and how governments can deliver initiatives and projects to address the problem.The Assemblyman said with the nature of the traditional High Street changing, many people, especially the young, are shopping online with this trend only going to increase.ldquoWe are seeing and hearing that people want experiences and see their shopping trip as much more than simply shopping, wanting to incorporate food and activities as part of their experience, said Mr McGrath.ldquoHaving clean, welcoming public spaces, areas that can facilitate events and having a erse range of experiential shops and boutiques is critical in making the High Street thrive. In Newcastle, the public realm and promenade schemes, in tandem with the shop front improvement scheme, have helped the resort buck the trend and is reporting increasing footfall.Mr McGrath also highlighted the need to continue to develop experiences people can avail of to maximise footfall and is confident ambitious future proposals including a gondola ride into the heart of the Mournes will be critical to enhancing what Newcastle has to offer.He continued: ldquoIn Downpatrick, the former Irish Street police station and car park have the potential to redevelop the town and breathe new live back into its retail centre.ldquoDeveloping a space here which can enhance and deliver a customer experience and product will be critical to developing new shops and products, but also complement existing businesses too.ldquoRates and the entire rating scheme was a major recurring theme from business organisations and this will form part of a report being compiled by the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly following their visit.Mr McGrath said the inadequacies of the rating system were well known, with the British-Irish body, of which he is a member, keen to find other ways of helping businesses thrive.The MLA added: ldquoTimes are changing and local authorities and central governments must reflect this in the work they do. I look forward to the report our committee will deliver which will reflect on time spent in Newcastle, Belfast, Dublin, Newcastle Upon Tyne and Stockton on Tees.Cllr Murnin said he was delighted that representatives of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly view Newcastle as an example of good practice for their research into revitalising the high street.He continued: ldquoWe have worked very hard to make our district a better place to carry out business and as a place to visit. Regenerating the town centre and promenade in Newcastle has played a signicant role in increasing business and footfall to the town. I am pleased to see our work receive this recognition.During the delegation visit, local authority officials gave presentations on the regeneration of Newcastle and the tourism events strategy for the town.In addition, a representative from the Department for Communities spoke about the Main Street Environmental Improvement Scheme in the resort and the departmentrsquos role in the resortrsquos overall regeneration.At the end of the meeting, delegation members said the examples of successful regeneration they witnessed would prove beneficial to their enquiryrsquos conclusions and eventual recommendations..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Castlewellan actor adds her opposition to disposal plans  ","story":"SHE may have left the Mourne Mountains to pursue an acting career on stage and screen but the Mournes have not left Niamh McGrady.The Castlewellan-born actress has spoken of her horror at recent media stories which claim the Government is looking to the Mournes as a possible location to store nuclear waste.An area of granite bedrock running from Slieve Gullion in Newry to the Mourne is being considered mdash amongst other locations mdash as suitable for an underground disposal facility, according to a preliminary report by Radioactive Waste Management , a UK State-owned company.Other locations include an area of rock between Omagh and Cookstown, a location between Belfast and Larne, areas around Coleraine, Co Londonderry, and Ballymoney and Ballycastle, in Co Antrim.Niamh, who has starred in Holby City and The Fall, called for all local people to lend their support as Newry, Mourne and Down District Council passed an emergency motion last week unanimously opposing any future facility.ldquoI am absolutely horried to hear about proposals to host nuclear waste in the Mourne area, said Niamh, who now lives in London.ldquoMourne is an area of outstanding natural beauty, which tourists and local people adore the area alike.ldquoWe do not create nuclear energy here, so why should we be treated as a dumping ground  We will all have to pull together to ensure that this travesty absolutely cannot happen.The Mournes are particularly beloved by the actor, who was born and reared on the Bunkers Hill area of Castlewellan.She married her husband, Dan, close to Spelga Dam just last August and regularly walks in the Mournes when she is home.The  year-old also admitted to often feeling ldquoemotional when it came to Mournes as she was interviewed on the lsquoEamonn Mallie: Face to Face withhelliprsquo series for UTV last night.Apart from giving her viewpoint on her support of the   movement, which calls for equal representation of women in all areas of Hollywood by , Niamh also opened up about her own issues with mental health.She told Mallie: ldquoI have experienced anxiety and depression off and on since my teens. Itrsquos something I have always had to be aware of in my own le. I feel very strongly that there are issues in Northern Ireland that arenrsquot being addressed as far as mental health is concerned.A former pupil of St Malachyrsquos Primary School in Castlewellan, Niamhrsquos dficulties compounded after leaving Assumption Grammar School in Ballynahinch. A talented actor, who shone in the schoolrsquos theatre productions, she applied for and got a place at Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama in Cardf.Niamh was fortunate that while not academically minded, she found that drama, theatre studies and English always came ldquonaturally to her in school.The youngest of five siblings, Niamh says that she had always wanted to leave Castlewellan for ldquoan adventure. But she did not realise that her living in Cardf, away from family and friends, would take such a toll on her.ldquoI was just very, very homesick because our experiences in Northern Ireland were so unique and I didnrsquot have anyone that I could explain that to, she said.ldquoI felt emotionally unsupported. I felt very much like fish out of water as I was surrounded by a lot of very wealthy people and I struggled to connect with them. I was longing for the familiarity and the closeness, and the craic of home. My homesickness lasted for many years, it didnrsquot just go away.ldquoEvery time I went home for Easter or Christmas I was in floods of tears going back to the airport but yet I made myself do it, nothing nor nobody  was forcing me to do it.She went gone to appear alongside actors such as Sir Patrick Stewart of Star Trek fame in an acclaimed production Macbeth which played Londonrsquos West End and New Yorkrsquos Broadway, as well as former X-Files star Gillian Anderson and  Shades heart-throb Jamie Dornan in the psychological murder drama The Fall.Niamh is currently working on two film projects and says that as a newly married woman, her professional and personal le is going great.However, she maintains her mental health by practicing yoga and mediation and feels it is important to be upfront about having had issues.She explained: ldquoI donrsquot see a problem talking about mental health because I donrsquot like that itrsquos still taboo. If it helps one person seek help, then thatrsquos great.ldquoPeople could be sitting with mental problems and they donrsquot know it. Because thatrsquos what anxiety and depression do, they sneak on you and it really starts to alter your view of the world without you noticing.ldquoOver time with mediation you can be in control of your mind.

Hutley was given another chance around  minutes and this time took full advantage after Enniskillen had been deemed to be offside on the back of a break from Down scrum half, Chris Gibson.For the remainder of the first half, and indeed for  minutes in the second half, the score remained at - with both teams trading blows, but neither were able to alter their account on the scoreboard.Down did have their chances to take the lead, but lacked the finesse in handling that they had shown against their rivals from Carrick and Omagh in previous rounds.As the game entered the final quarter, Enniskillen managed to extend their lead, scoring a try by barging over from short range following a well won line-out.With Enniskillen now in possession of a  point lead, Down were left with no alternative but to chase the game. Again, they created some opportunities and applied pressure in Enniskillen territory with some great carries from Josh Hanlon, Conor Moag and Joe Charles, but the dogged defence of the locals held out and with it, Down frustration grew which made putting quality attacking play together even harder.In the closing minutes and with the outcome of the fixture already beyond doubt, Enniskillen added a final unconverted try confirming them as the team who would progress to the quarter-finals.The final whistle brought bitter disappointment to the hard-working Down squad who knew they hadnrsquot been at their best on this occasion.The side now enter the Subsidiary Shield competition and they have drawn Royal School Dungannon at home in a quarter-final game to be played on Saturday, February, , at am.Having been finalists in this competition for four consecutive years and winners in , everyone at Down High knows there is plenty left to play for this season..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C February 13%2C 1979  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH mdash A Ballynahinch horse breeder is a very disappointed man this week mdash and all because of the lsquoflu.

His parents and medical team are constantly working to ensure his lungs remain as clear of mucus as they can be.Jen said: ldquoItrsquos hard to believe when you look at him that anything is wrong as he looks so perfect, but inside him the mucus is causing havoc.ldquoDermot and I never expected to becomes nurses as well as parents to our child. We do his treatment willingly but with heavy hearts.ldquoIf the drugs didnrsquot exist, I think we could just accept things as they are and get on with our lives and make every day count.ldquoBut as it is we canrsquot rest until we have access to Orkambi and the pipeline of drugs for Lorcaacuten and all the others with cystic fibrosishere need.ldquoThis situation makes it dficult to enjoy our son without feeling pain at time passing.The couple, who live off the Vianstown Road, believe that the sooner their son starts on Orkambi the better.ldquoOrkambi not only slows the decline in lungby up to %, it also reduces hospitalisations by up to %, Jen explained.ldquoEvery day people go without access to these drugs is a day in which their body could become more damaged. Since he was  days old, Lorcaacuten has not had a single day without taking some type of antibiotic, as well as  enzymes.ldquoSome people [including young children] with CF have to attend the hospital for two weeks of IVs every three months and thatrsquos considered to be ok when there is a drug that could potentially help Families of CF sufferers believe that Orkambi can lsquostop the clockrsquo on further decline of the patient as they get older.However, the US drug company which developed it has so far failed to agree a price so that it could be introduced by the UK.Jen added: ldquoThe drugs currently in trials are supposed to give sufferers a chance at a near normal le, but this is partly dependent on them being healthy enough when they begin taking them. There is no time to wait.ldquoTwo hundred and twenty six people have died in the UK since Orkambi was licensed over three years ago. We need Orkambi and we need it now.The couple have been lobbying local politicians to get their help at keeping their campaign in spotlight in Government.Strangford MP Jim Shannon raised the plight of Lorcaacuten at Westminster this week.South Down MLAs Jim Wells and Sinead Bradley, along with Lagan Valley MLA Trevor Lunn, are planning to host a meeting in Stormont within weeks with Richard Pengelly, Permanent Secretary at the Department of Health in Northern Ireland.Mr Shannon said: ldquoI was contacted by people throughout Northern Ireland asking me to push government to allow a crown licence for this le-changing drug, as I have been vocal in my belief that this drug should be available on the NHS.ldquoWhat impacted me most was a mother in my area who sent me a picture of her beautul two year-old son with his little mask on, telling me that he was now old enough to get it and it would make such a dference to him.ldquoI supported the calls for the drug and will continue pushing government to find a way to overcome the issue between the drug company and NICE guidelines.While Jen says she has received local cross-party support, she is urging people to sign the petition

technology is to be used to inform peoplethe bathing water at Newcastle beach is safe to swim in.The beach is one of six across the province which features in a new EU-backed initiative to provide people with live updates of the water quality.The resortrsquos beach and surrounding river catchment area has been selected as part of a major new study, with a weather station and river water level recorders already in place to send real time data to a server which the public can access.A new electronic sign is to be erected at the Downs Road car park to provide live updates on the water quality, but the European Unionrsquos so-called SWIM project goes a step further with people able to get information via text messages and internet alerts.News of the new initiative comes just three months after it was revealed that while Kilclief, Ballyhornan, Tyrella and Murlough beaches continue to enjoy some of the best bathing water quality in Europe, it was a case of lsquomust do betterrsquo for Newcastle, with the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs labelling the resortrsquos water quality as ldquosufficient.Details of the SWIM project were outlined at Monday nightrsquos meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos Regulatory and Technical Services Committee.Councillors were told those involved in the scheme are working on developing a real time monitoring system, allowing local people and visitors to the beach to check the water quality via a series of measures.Council officials say the innovative project will enable what they have described as ldquoshort term pollution to be predicted.Funded by the Special EU Programmes Body, those behind the project which includes Newcastle, Castlerock, Portrush, Waterfoot, Ballyholme and Ballywalter beaches in Northern Ireland and Clogherhead, Enniscrone and Ladyrsquos Bay in the Republic, say it will help protect public health.In addition, they are confident that it will signicantly improve communication about water quality and contribute to tourism promotion in the resort.At Monday nightrsquos council meeting, Mournes councillor Willie Clarke said: ldquoThis new programme is good news for the resort and can have a positive impact on tourism.ldquoThe fact that people will have real time access to the quality of the bathing water builds confidence which is positive.ldquoThere is a problem with nitrates finding their way into the water at the beach and it is something that needs to be addressed.ldquoHowever, the fact that we will soon have a scheme which enables people to know the quality of the water before they take a dip is groundbreaking.Rowallane councillor Harry Harvey, said the decision was good news for Newcastle and could boost visitor numbers.ldquoThis is a forward step for a beach where the water quality has improved from what it was a number of years ago, he said.ldquoThe beach has yet to achieve blue flag status which in part recognises the quality of the water and it would be greatthis could be secured in the long term.ldquoWith the focus on the here and now, the provision of the electronic sign and the availability of real time information is indeed a welcome development and a forward step for the

surreal abbey road experience","story":"With his great grandfatherrsquos fiddle in hand, local musician Sean Magee recently recorded a single at the iconic Abbey Road Studios, a place made famous by The Beatles.Calling the experience of recording in the same studio as The Beatles ldquosurreal, Sean explained how the opportunity arose.ldquoIrsquove just recently joined up with a guy called Rory Gallagher, hersquos from Kilcar, Donegal, and his project is called Rory and the Island for he owned the Island Bar over in Lanzarote for five or six years before he came home. He asked me would I come along and join him so we have been out on tour and we were over playing in Camden, in London last week, said Sean.He continued: ldquoHe signed with a record label called Buddy Records and they got it all sorted for us to go in and record with Abbey Road, so we were recording our new single lsquoCall My Name.rsquoWith the new single due to release on Spoty at the end of next week, Sean said: ldquoWersquove got it all nearly ready to go so therersquos just a few mixes that need to be done.Talking about the recording day, Sean said: ldquoWe were in early morning and we were just straight into it, I never really got thinking about it and about midday we took a walk around the building and seen all the big studios.ldquoWe recorded in the Gate House studio and we went into Studio Two and Studio Three to do wee bits of sample and background vocals. That was where The Beatles, Ed Sheerin and Adele all wouldrsquove recorded in as well. So it was just madness, he added.During the recording of the single Sean played his great grandfatherrsquos fiddle, an instrument which has a tale of its own to tell. Sean explained: ldquoMy great grandfather had ordered this fiddle in  before the First World War broke out and hersquod sent the money with the order. Basically then the war broke out and the fiddle didnrsquot turn up so he thought all was lost. As soon as the war was finished in , the fiddle arrived at the door. He couldnrsquot believe it. So I took it with me to Abbey Road and the song we were recording was a slow song, and therersquos a lovely deep tone out of the fiddle so I took it with me.ldquoIt was my grandadrsquos father and my grandad was delighted that I took it with me, he added.When asked how he first met Rory, Sean explained that it was through his dad, Conor Magee. He said: ldquoRory was in a band way back years ago called The Revs and they wouldrsquove been doing sets at the likes of Slane Castle. My dad is a sound engineer, and he done the sound for The Revs about  years ago. We were going over to Lanzarote and I didnrsquot know Rory at all and dad had messaged him to seehe would get me up for a song in the Island Bar.Sean continued: ldquoHe got me up and shortly after that he sent me a message to seeI wanted to do a couple of gigs over in Lanzarote. He asked me thenI wanted to go out on tour with him when he was home. So it came out of nowhere really.Sean has since been touring with Rory and the Island for the last six months, travelling all over Ireland and the UK. Talking about their upcoming gigs, Sean said: ldquoWersquove Germany for St. Patrickrsquos weekend and America then in April, over to New York.He added: ldquoWe also have a local gig in Charliersquos Bar on March .

If there are other ways of doing it that are just as effective that perhaps we haven’t yet explored then we will do that too.”Leading ERG member Steve Baker said only a “treaty-level clause” which gives the UK an unconditional right to exit the backstop would work.In light of these comments, the News Letter asked East Londonderry MP Mr Campbell whether securing changes to the withdrawal text was a red line for the DUP.He replied: “If theyare saying it can be done another way, then we are not going to quibble about what that other way might be.“The bottom line is that the withdrawal agreement is a legally binding document which puts NI at a disadvantage, trading wise, to the rest of the UK.“That has to change. We are not getting into the pedantics of whether that will be a codicil, an addition, or a deletion.“Whatever the change is, we will judge it against the fundamental position of whether it removes the disadvantage that exists for NI under the withdrawal agreement.”Mr Campbell said that, whatever form a change to the backstop takes, it must “override” the current arrangement contained within the withdrawal text. He added that the attorney general should be consulted to ensure this was the case.Heartbreak at sudden passing of -year-old Maddy-Leigh Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“Does it have legal standing and does it put us on the same path as the rest of the UK  That is the pre-eminent and paramount concern that we have,” he stated.But TUV leader and barrister Jim Allister said he was sceptical that any addendum could counteract the withdrawal text.He added: “Article  of the agreement sets out the supremacy of the text of the deal. So unless you get something that overrides that, then in any legal tussle over what has supremacy, Article  would rule the day.“It is imperative that there has to be a binding, irrefutable change to the agreement. Anything outside that is going to labour under the dficulty of being subsidiary. “I am totally with the ERG in arguing that there must be an upfront change within the agreement. Doing so would remove all doubt.”try catch  TrendingIN PICTURES: The  locations across N.I. where speed camera vans operateTwo cases of meningitis confirmed at NI primary schoolMan caught with  lsquopackagesrsquo of cocaine in his body at Belfast City AirportBallymena manager David Jeffrey praised his side after their - defeat to Linfield in the BetMcLean League Cup Final.LIVE BLOG: League Cup final  - Ballymena United v Linfield          ..

Mr McAteer was barred by law from acting as a spad because of a serious criminal conviction. However, Sinn Fein circumvented the law by making him a ‘super spad’, putting him over the party’s team of spads and ministers – something which civil servants agreed to, even though it was against the spirit of the law.Stormont Castle has not acknowledged the existence of minutes of the meeting between Sir Malcolm and the DUP and Sinn Fein spads, suggesting that no minutes of the meeting were taken. The following morning, Sir Malcolm emailed his two senior civil service colleagues with a draft of the letter which he had drawn up and asked them for any comments by lunch time.Three hours later Dr McCormick replied to say that he had discussed the issue with Mr Sterling and they had agreed a series of changes to the text. Mr Sterling felt it contained a section on agriculture which was “too long”, something which “unbalances the overall thrust of the letter”.Five days later the amended letter was sent to the private secretaries of the first minister and the deputy first minister. Not a word of that letter was changed by the ministers or their spads before it was sent to Downing Street the following day.Sinn Fein makes unity pitch to civic unionists Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingIN PICTURES: The  locations across N.I. where speed camera vans operateTwo cases of meningitis confirmed at NI primary schoolMan caught with  lsquopackagesrsquo of cocaine in his body at Belfast City AirportBallymena manager David Jeffrey praised his side after their - defeat to Linfield in the BetMcLean League Cup Final.LIVE BLOG: League Cup final  - Ballymena United v Linfield          ..

Itrsquos an event that is becoming bigger every year for the month of January.The event is where people decide to try veganism out for an entire month after Christmas. This means cutting out both meat, dairy and eggs.But where can you goyoursquore looking to try out veganism in Penarth  There are a lot of dferent places you can eat out and shop in, says Penarth based vegan and fair organiser Sue Thomas.Ms Thomas has been vegan for many years and aims to share her lestyle through her vegan fairs, which feature a wide iety of food stalls and gt stalls.And throughout her many years of veganism, Ms Thomas said she has never struggled in Penarth and recommends people to look locally and ask for options.ldquoI get a lot of my vitamins from Pro Health and Nutrition in Stanwell Road, she said.ldquoItrsquos a great health shop and the owner Juliet is so friendly and helpful. They stock many vegan vitamins and products.ldquoWindsor Fruit Stores in the Windsor Arcade are my favourites for amazing fruit and vegetables, I buy a lot of wonderful organic fruit and vegetables from them.ldquoThe owners Mike and Tricia are so helpful and always suggest things for me. Unusual fruits and veg too from time to time. They also have a great supplier that does not spray their produce.Ms Thomas recommends trying to switch dairy milk for other options, and for those taking part in Veganuary she suggests oat milk.ldquoI personally love oat milk as itrsquos so good in coffee and I love it on my cereal, she said.ldquoI do buy Oatly Barista from Jos Organics in Glebe Street which is yet another great place for vegan goodies or sometimes I do go to Sainsburys and the Co-op.

It was made with willow grown in the grounds of Cogan Primary School.More than  people attended the hill rolling ceremony down Clf Hill towards Penarth Esplanade - with the school pupils from Cogan and pupils and families from Ysgol Pen Y Garth helping to roll it along.The head was accompanied by a wooden frame from the Mabinogion stories called the Window of Sorrows made by Tony Simms, and the artist Ifor Davies undertook the ritual sawing of the Window of Sorrows on the clftops and read the Bendigeidfran story from the Mabinogion tales before the rolling went ahead.The head of Bendigeidfran and the Window of Sorrows was accompanied by Penarths Mari Lwyd which is a symbol of hosting, and negotiating hospitality through song and teasing. Richard Parry led the Mari Lwyd this year, and on arriving at the bottom of the hill the celebration visited local shops and resaurants along the sea front wishing the proprietors and customers a Happy New Year. We sang for Romeo Italian restaurant, The Fig Tree, James Sommerin, The Crazy Cafe and Hamptons seaside shop. After reaching the bottom of the hill the head was carried by the children along with the Mari Lwyd to the shops and cafes along the seafront where dferent New Year songs - called Calenig - were sung in each venue and led by local opera singer Richard Parry.Speaking about the event, artist Haf Weighton said: \"I loved working with Cogan School. Itrsquos a hidden gem in Penarth with very enthusiastic staff who were happy to jump in to get involved in this project at short notice. Richard Parry and the schools deputy head Tom Lewis, ran a assembly to the whole school on the new year traditions. Then children from across the school came to see me working on the piece. \"It was lovely to hear children who donrsquot come from homes where Welsh is spoken enthusing about the mabinogi tales and Welsh traditions.

Dealing with this type of call prevents our staff from dealing with genuine emergencies.ldquoCalling an ambulance when you donrsquot need one wastes time and resources which could have been better spent responding someone genuinely in need of the high level clinical care ambulance crews provide. Ambulances are not a taxi service and arriving at hospital by ambulance does not mean yoursquoll be seen quicker.\"She added: ldquoIf someone is seriously ill or injured and their le is at risk, you should call  immediately.

You canrsquot keep putting everything in the same place.ldquoThe Welsh Government seem hell bent with concreting every last bit of land in the whole of Wales.ldquoWe canrsquot keep swamping the same areas that canrsquot cope with the traffic and lack of services with house after house.ldquoItrsquos sheer madness.Asbri Planning, which is drawing up the plans along with Austin Smith: Lord Architects, has applied to the Vale council for a scoping opinion as to whether the new homes would have a signicant impact on the environment, and therefore need an environmental impact assessment.Councillor Jonathan Bird, Vale of Glamorgan Council cabinet member for regeneration and planning, said:ldquoNo planning application has yet been submitted, rather there have been screening and scoping submissions. These will be considered in accordance with the relevant legislation and guidance, part of which specically relates to the need for an Environmental Impact Assessment.ldquoShould a planning application follow, it will be considered in exactly the same way as any other of its type. In order to gain approval, among other factors, it will need to satisfy national and local policies, including those contained in the LDP, while members of the public will also have the opportunity to express their views before any decision is taken.Welsh Government and the architects have been contacted for comment. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Irsquom very grateful that today we took a big step on that journey by the general acceptance that these arrangements could work.In a joint statement, Mr Baker and ERG chair Mr Rees-Mogg said: ldquoWe look forward to further precision about exactly what we will be asked to vote for.Mr Hammond told the MakeUK dinner in London that the proposals in the Malthouse plan ndash drawn up by MPs from the Leave and Remain wings of the party ndash represented a ldquovaluable effort at finding a way to keep the Irish border open after Brexit without a backstop.But the Chancellor said:ldquoHowever promising as an alternative arrangement to avoid entering a backstop in the future, it is clear that the EU will not consider replacing the backstop with such an alternative arrangement now in order to address our immediate challenge.ldquoThe details of this initiative are still evolving and would require signicant changes to EU legislation and customs practices that would need to be negotiated with the EU member states and others who will be affected by them.He added: ldquoIt should be a major ongoing strand of our work, continuing at pace during the Implementation Period ndash one in which I hope and expect the EU will take an active part..@JunckerEU @Landtag_BW #Brexit #### ldquoI have great respect for @theresa_may, for her courage and her assertiveness.

When he was in his s, Pat McKeever took over the farm after the death of his father Peter, who had run an apple canning business on the site. Pat said: “My daddy was one of three brothers who used to can apples. They’d get the apples from the local orchards, peel them and can them. Daddy then started growing his own apples and supplying the fresh market and the cider markets.”Now Pat’s son, and Peter’s grandson – also called Peter – is the third generation farmer who is set to carry on the business. Pat’s we Catherine and their four daughters also have integral roles to play as the craft cider making end of the agri-business continues to grow.Pat, Catherine and Peter McKeever of Long Meadow FarmLong Meadow started off with two craft cider drinks in  before introducing a mulled cider and a cider aged in oak barrels, some of which had been used in the original apple canning business. Over the past two years the company has branched out into flavoured ciders, apple juice and apple cider vinegar – famed for its health benefits.Catherine said: “I know everything goes through a bit of a fad, but I think the craft ciders are still holding their own. The mindset of cider has changed with craft ciders. “A lot of people would have associated cider in their younger days – maybe when they were at university – as a cheap drink you can buy in big quantities and get a hit off.“But that wasn’t craft cider. People are prepared to pay that little bit extra for the quality that comes with craft cider.“We’re using all our own fruit. We make it in smaller quantities so it can hold all the flavours, that’s the way we want to keep it. We only use hand-picked fruit, not any that has fallen on the ground.”Of the harvesting process, Pat said: “We would have between  to  pickers. They would come the third week in July and do a bit of summer pruning.Resurfacing works on A Portadown Road, ArmaghBrexit and data protection - will firms still have to comply with the new EU GDPR  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"“Once that’s finished, in August they start into the picking of the apples, that goes right through to the end of October, first week in November.“The picking season we call it the nine weeks of hell. It’s your livelihood. You are depending on that fruit.“We harvest approximately , tonne of apples yearly.”Catherine explained how the orchard came to be illuminated: “A man called Walter Holt came to the farm last year to buy some apple cider vinegar. “I got talking to him and he gave me his card and told me what he did – an outdoor lighting artist.“I didn’t think much of it at the time, but I think the seeds had been sewn. I played about with it in my mind for a long time that it could be something we could work with.”Walter Holt and his assistant Orlanda Delaforce spent a total of  hours working on the installation of the lighting scheme.Walter commented: “The challenge on this particular scheme was working with smaller trees in an orchard setting. It’s a compact area and our solution was to develop a one way circular trail. “We tried to have as much creative iety as possible, implementing dferent approaches to dferent trees, with the whole colour scheme carefully thought out.”The light display is accompanied by music composed by Londonderry musician Sharon Graham.Catherine said: “We chose Valentine’s week for the treelumination launch as we felt it was a novel way in terms of adding to the romance of walking in the moonlight, but it’s by no means just for couples, it’s designed very much as a family experience for everyone.“I think we all have a vision of apple orchards complete with apple blossom or an abundance of fruit.“This illuminations event highlights the orchards in a totally dference perspective – a raw natural resting state before the cycle of growth begins.”The light show – designed by Walter Holt of Travelling Treeluminations – is the first of its kind to be held in an orchard environment and will open to the public from today until Saturday, from pm to pm each evening at  Loughgall Road.Entry is £ per adult and £ for children. A family ticket for two adults and two children costs £.Visitors will be given the opportunity to see the pressing and blending facilities on the farm as well as taste some of the products.Artisan food will be on sale as well as some free refreshment including tea, coffee and hot chocolate.

Subject to confirmation by the all-island Single Electricity Market Committee, the auction for electricity generators to be awarded capacity contracts, on an all-island basis, has identied electricity capacityof , MW which will be in place for the year starting October ,  – , MW of that all-island total is attributed to Northern Ireland.This is a critical series of draft decisions which will reassure the large conventional generators about their contracts and will impose the discipline of revenue limits constrained by the capacity auction. The draft decisions also point to the expectations in terms of the capacity earmarked from renewable sources, from inter-connection with the Scottish grid and the capacity adjustments that may follow from demand-side adjustment contracts.SONI has not been as open and transparent as should have been possible. Readers must make the assumption that ties location to where capacity payments are identied in sterling and euro.The SONI statement lists  generator names ,  of which are identied as DSUswhich leaves  others. Eight are shown as part of the AES capacity in Ballylumford and Kilroot: four are small capacity generators, six each have capacity of over MW , and the last capacity source linked to Northern Ireland is the Moyle Interconnector.SONI does not present the capacity awards in a way that allows readers to identy the location of each successful unit.The Utility Regulator has agreed that the available Northern Ireland capacity should include  MW from the Moyle Interconnector which represents over % of locally available capacity. This is a judgement that might be queried. Is the interconnectora guaranteed source of capacity  If, at a time of peak demand in Northern Ireland, demand in the grid in GB had no spare capacity, presumably the capacity might not be available for supply to Northern Ireland. The regulator and SONI are well placed to judge the probability of this outcome and might argue that it is a minimal risk.There are some interesting features stemming from the assumptions made in setting the framework for the capacity auction. First, Northern Ireland has been treated as meriting some contract iations because of locational constraints. This is a reflection of the limited capacity of the electricity grid on the whole island to send electricity to the places where there is demand. Both the Dublin area and Northern Irelanddid not attract auction bids adequately to supply these area locational constraints. For Northern Ireland. the easy explanation lies in the absence of the long awaited north-south grid expansion from to the planned distribution hub in Co Tyrone.The capacity auction allowed for the acceptance of bids with prices which are higher than the main auction prices which would match supply and demand across the whole island. Because of the locational deficit, some Northern Ireland bids now show capacity payment prices above the all-Ireland ceiling of £, per MW which applies to most of the successful bids.In the quotation from AES for the two large fossil fuel burning units, the proposal is that they should attract payment prices of £, and £, per MW. At first sight this appears to allow a premium of nearly % on the payment price for each MW. This seems more than a marginal cost and points to the possible cost savingsthe proposed new north-south link had been operational.This answer for the older high capacity units at Kilroot is a further reflection of the doubt about the continued viability of these units. It will be remembered that a year ago, these same two units were deemed unsuccessful in the auction but, at a late stage when faced with a request for a derogation to be allowed to close these units, the initially agreed settlement was revised.A year ago, the first capacity auction under the rules of the newly instituted I-SEM, was accepted with a capacity supply of near to , MW for all of Northern Ireland. Now, in early , SONI has concluded that for security of supply Northern Ireland should contract for just under , MW. There is no obvious major uplt in demand in Northern Ireland so that, quietly, the suggestion is that the arithmetic in late  may now be thought to have been slightly too risky.The capacity auction is a fundamental building block of electricity supply policy for Northern Ireland. However, on its own, the allocation of capacity and the possible scope for investment in new generating capacity must also be seen in the context of increasing,market forces allow, the proportion of electricity supply that is supplied from renewable sources. The distribution of generating capacity is still dominated by fossil fuels. Northern Ireland’s capacity is nearly % from gas andcoal. However, the statistics showing the proportion of electricity supply from renewables points to average consumption from renewables of nearer to -%. Because of the iability in the contribution of wind based renewables, it would be hazardousgreater security dependence was allocated to renewables.In turn, the caveat about the possible role of renewables points to the possible value of further investment in energy storage for which no major scheme has been launched. If Kilroot power station survives for a further three to four years, then the experimental electricity storage capacity on that site may become an attractive asset.There are several continuing questions about Northern Ireland’s security of electricity supply. Will Kilroot be given further stays of execution after   Will the North South interconnector eventually be built  Will the proposed large natural gas burning power station be built in Belfast  Will the politically unpopular investment in anaerobic digestion plants be tackled  Will the Brexit settlement, or lack of it, damage the continued operation of the all-island single electricity market  But... it seems Kilroot has been given a temporary extension of its role in keeping the lights on.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/pmcg.jpg","title":"ryder cup legend to address belfast leadership conference","story":"Posted on Friday February  by Ulster Business Ryder Cup legend Paul McGinley has been revealed as one of the key speakers at a leadership event taking place in Belfast next month.

Its surveying team are members of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors . Nurturing talent and progression is a core principle that the firms stands for with  of their surveying staff having become qualied throughout the firm’s training program. We sat down with three members of the team.Gail Prentice-Jackson, associate director Over the last  years, Gail has worked right across the business, now within the asset management department.She manages a large mixed-use portfolio of property which includes leading shopping centres and retail parks right across Northern Ireland.Within that her role is ied and includes managing one of Northern Ireland’s most successful retail schemes. Day-to-day this can include everything from managing service charge budgets to maximising rental income through lease renewals and rent reviews. Another key role is to provide regular accounting and financial reports to clients.“One of my key roles is to support my agency department colleagues in their  acquisitions of investment assets and upon completion ensure that a comprehensive management regime is followed to ensure continued growth of our clients assets,” she says.“The role of a ‘property manager’ has evolved signicantly over the course of my career with much of our work now focusing on compliance and risk management. We pride ourselves on making sure our clients are well advised, mitigating any risks that may be involved with their particular property.”Some of those clients include retail sites such as Rushmere Shopping Centre in Craigavon.Gail is also one of just eight female surveyors in Northern Ireland with the designation of FRICS, a Fellow Member of RICS.“While females still only make up % of the surveying profession as a whole there are a signicant number of women working within the commercial property sector in Northern Ireland, it’s no longer a male orientated profession.”As for the business landscape Gail says that whilst there is general economic uncertainty they are seeing an increase in demand for their services as investors seek to maximisefrom their investments.“Interestingly we took on a number of new properties over the course of , often on behalf of investors who were keen to maximise rental s and ensure their property is run as efficiently as possible.”  Marian McFlynn, surveyor Since graduating from Ulster University in  with a degree in property investment and development, Marian’s career began on the other side of the globe – working for multi-billion dollar US-owned LaSalle Investment Management at its offices in Sydney.“In Sydney, as part LaSalle’s centre management team, I was responsible for leasing, marketing, administration and operation of a bulky goods shopping centre, home to over  homemaker and lestyle stores,” she says.“I ed to Northern Ireland, and joined the property and asset management department of Osborne King as a graduate surveyor in June ,” she adds. And following training, Marian became a chartered surveyor in . She’s now responsible for managing a range of commercial assets on behalf of clients. “This involves asset enhancement advice, tenant liaison, building maintenance, health and safety management, rent collection and accounting, service contract tendering and service charge administration,” she says.“I continue to build on my client and property portfolio.”And Marian also says that uncertainty hangs in the air for investors, while the ongoing lack of clarity over a post-Brexit landscape still exists.  Lisa McCaffrey, surveyorLisa has five years at Osborne King under her belt. Having graduated from the property investment and development course at Ulster University’s Jordanstown campus in , she worked at a Belfast estate agents before joining Osborne King in  becoming a chartered surveyor in .She works within the professional services team which sees her carry out valuations for a wide range of clients including private iniduals, large companies and the major lending institutions. As part of this Lisa is a member of the RICS Registered Valuers Scheme.Lisa also provides rent review and lease renewal advice to landlords and tenants throughout Northern Ireland.Additionally, Lisa was involved in the  non-domestic rating revaluation providing advice to a wide range of clients and negotiating the valuations with Land  Property Services on the clients behalf at application and appeal stages.
