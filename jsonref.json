This means that as this generation passes away, the last of headhunters will go with them.A book, named \u0027The Konyak: Last of the Tattooed Headhunters\u0027, tries to tell the story of their lives through the great-granddaughter of prominent tribal member Ahon. Part of it focuses on how the body is treated as a canvas, with inscriptions on the skin representing a rite of passage or, in some cases, every kill they have made. These astonishing images were taken by Polish photographer Wiktor Stadniczenko, who travelled to their homes and even drunk tea with them around the campfire.         Stunning images show the last surviving members of the Konyak tribe that used to behead people and parade their bloodied skulls around as a gruesome rite of passage. (Pictured) The man appears to be singing as he stares into the dying flames         Polish photographer Wiktor Stadniczenko travelled deep into their mountainous homeland in Nagaland, north-east India, to drink tea with them and capture these fascinating images. (Pictured) Bone and goat skin hats, a valuable commodity and symbol of honour, are donned by these tribespeople. They are also shown wearing modern jackets and shirts suggesting this tribe lost its untouched nature long ago         Bodies in Nagaland are regarded as a canvas, and new tattoos are added to mark a great deed or service. The tribe used to hunt heads but abandoned the practice in the 1960s after being converted to Christianity         The crown of bones on this man\u0027s head is said to be from an animal that he hunted and killed. When putting on tattoos, some members of the tribe get a new one for every animal that they kill              Ornate jewellery strung around the neck of this elderly Konyak warrior (left). He also has facial tattoos which may mark out his skill on the battlefield. The second warrior has a necklace of heavy brass skulls (right) which mark him out as a great warrior         Heavy brass heads on the necklace of this man (left) suggest he was a fierce warrior. Tattoos, also sported by his companion, may also suggest bravery on the battlefield in the tribe or could mark out every time they made a kill         Three tribal members sit around the campfire. A touch of modern-life is given away as one is pictured wearing glasses. After a beheading, the Konyak used to give the head pride of place in the village. A book, named \u0027The Konyak: Last of the Tattooed Headhunters\u0027, tries to tell the story of their tribal life through the great-granddaughter of prominent tribal member Ahon         The Konyak still have a rudimentary life with open fire huts made of bamboo available for them to use. Here a camp fire is seen burning as seven elders sit around it. Some also have featheres stuffed into their hats which are decorated on the front with what appear to be boar horns         Photographer Wiktor Stadniczenko, who travelled to meet the tribe, is pictured here with tribal members. The tribal members are seen wearing flip-flops and modern shirts, alongside their traditional attire, while the photographer wears a shirt and ripped jeans         A side profile of several tribal members in a straw hut. Now that they are elderly, the members spend much more time sitting around the open fire and drinking rum and black tea         A man pictured inside the bamboo hut with large wooden objects in his ears. Many members of the tribe have now reached eighty, with some claiming they are already over a hundred years old         The tribal tradition of headhunting continued unti lthe 1960s, although it was stopped with a change of religion. Almost all the community have converted to Christianity and now express remorse about their headhunting past         A group of 11 tribal members sit together on a wooden bench around the fire. Astonishing images in a book about them record the tribe\u0027s body beautification process - a vanishing practice where tribe members adorn their bodies with distinctive facial and body tattoos.

The food and drink offerings are superlative, and continue to raise the bar for chefs around the globe – California’s cities are among the most culturally important and politically progressive on the planet – and road trip opportunities abound, transporting you from challenging hikes to golden stretch-out sands. All in all, there’s a lot to see – so raise your expectations, glug a coffee, and get exploring.Must eat, must quaffOnce the promised land for farmers, California – with its almost supernaturally fertile landscape – now draws food obsessives from around the globe. There’s an embarrassingly varied selection of excellent locally grown produce, all spectacularly showcased in a farm-to-table dining scene that’s the envy of chefs around the globe. But what makes Californian cuisine such an extreme thrill ride is the cultural fusion – some of the best Japanese, Korean and Mexican food you’ve ever tasted can be found in San Francisco, Los Angeles or San Diego.Cooking and baking are competitive sports in California. Pick a winner in the almond croissant wars between cult San Francisco bakeries Tartine and Miette, and let the taco trucks tough it out for your affections in Los Angeles – start with sweet potato and feta at Guerrilla Tacos then try Guisados’ steak pisados.California’s wine country – all rolling hills and russet-hued vineyards – deserves a special mention for its culinary chops as well, and has tasting rooms made for lingering in. Whether you feast your way around Napa and Sonoma, or opt for the less touristy, yet reliably excellent, wineries and restaurants of Paso Robles and Santa Barbara, every sip and bite will be a highlight.Grapes are not California’s only fermented fruit, however. In San Francisco’s buzzy tiki bar scene, all manner of flavoursome cocktails are available – try a Hetchy Hetchy at Last Rites in the hipster Mission district – and distilled plants get a look-in in San Diego’s laidback North Beach neighbourhood grab a punchy mezcal to wash down the fish tacos at Cantina Mayahuel.Road trippingThe road trip originated in California with good reason open highways and dramatically changing landscapes, generously reward freewheeling travellers. The classic Californian coastal road trip – along the Pacific Coast Highway (PCH), from San Francisco south to Los Angeles – should be high on any Californian itinerary. Driving south places you on the right-hand-side of the road for the best coastal views. Big Sur is a highlight of any PCH drive, so take time to linger under canvas in a national park campsite. Alternatively splurge on a luxury lodge like Big Sur’s Post Ranch Inn, where, after a day’s hiking among the redwoods, you can stargaze while you soak your aching muscles. Venture east out of Los Angeles and you’ll be in glamorous Palm Springs in about two hours hit the Kimpton Rowan’s rooftop pool for downtown vibes and mountain views. Explore the quirky desert towns around Joshua Tree, spending a couple of nights at the charmingly old-school Pioneertown Motel. Just a two-minute mosey down the streets of this old western movie is Pappy \u0026amp Harriet’s tavern, serving up exemplary barbecue to a killer soundtrack of live acts.The state’s long-established road-trip culture has spawned a range of homegrown cafes and retro roadhouses that make every Californian pitstop an unexpected treat take a booth at the Sugarloaf Cafe in Pinyon Pines to sample dishes from top-drawer New York chef Wesley Barden.North of LA, a drive through Death Valley national park en route to Yosemite brings spectacular contrasts in scenery: the stark, sun-bleached grandeur of Death Valley dramatically segues into the verdant pines, waterfalls and soaring granite cliffs of Yosemite.The great outdoorsCalifornia is almost unfairly blessed with some of the world’s most awe-inspiring and erse outdoor scenery. Of the cluster of well-run national parks, Yosemite is obviously the big-hitter, attracting around 4 million people a year. Even so, it’s possible to get a slice of paradise to yourself, either by getting up early to beat the crowds, venturing farther on longer trails, or visiting in the winter months, when snowshoeing and cross-country skiing replace hiking and mountain-biking. Less than a mile from the national park’s south entrance, family-friendly Tenaya Lodge is a good option for overnight visitors.For many travellers, however, a relative lack of crowds makes a stay at Sequoia and Kings Canyon national parks the more relaxed option. The two parks nestle side-by-side in the southern Sierra Nevada, east of the San Joaquin Valley, and it’s worth camping for a couple of days to take in the rugged foothills, deep canyons, lush valleys and some of the world’s largest trees. For a desert scenery fix, head to Joshua Tree, where you can hike – the two-hour Ryan Mountain trail is the park’s most rewarding – bike and climb.Beyond the national parks, Californian cities take getting outside seriously. Los Angeles’s Runyon Canyon offers a respite for city-weary Angelenos, and the city’s hip eastern suburbs of Silver Lake, Echo Park and Los Feliz are well-served by Elysian Park. But San Francisco takes the crown as a city that offers the best of both worlds: the cultural heft of a financial powerhouse just a 20-minute bike ride from rolling hills, soaring redwoods and vast beaches. Cycling over the Golden Gate Bridge to Sausalito is one of the most memorable urban bike rides in the world.Culture, art and designLos Angeles and San Francisco possess very different characters, but both lay claim to serious cultural clout – particularly in terms of popular culture.Synonymous with the beat poets, jazz, and alternative rock, San Francisco also possesses a fiercely progressive spirit, having nurtured the 1960s counterculture movement and pushed LGBTQ rights to the fore in the 1970s and 80s. Today, culture lovers will enjoy wandering the murals of the Mission district as much as marvelling at the Louise Bourgeois room at SFMOMA (sfmoma.org). The Cartoon Art Museum near Fisherman’s Wharf, one of the quirkiest art museums in San Francisco, rekindles childhood obsessions daily (except Wednesdays).Los Angeles has hugely upped its cultural and architectural credentials in recent years, with a cluster of Frank Gehry-designed buildings, such as the Walt Disney Concert Hall, and Liz Diller’s Broad museum of contemporary art, that have transformed downtown Los Angeles into a cultural heavyweight.Beyond the big cities, the state still has much to offer in the way of culture, with plenty of independent galleries, and a supportive scene for local designers, artists and makers. Big Sur’s Henry Miller Memorial Library plays host to exhibitions and events, and the modernist mecca of the Architecture Design Center in Palm Springs showcases photography, architecture and design.The state is firmly on every touring musician’s itinerary too, and is a great place to catch emerging bands at revamped golden age theatres and battered-but-beloved beach town e bars – drop in at The Catalyst in Santa Cruz or Harlow’s in Sacramento to catch established acts and emerging talents.Beach vibesThe Californian coast has been rendered in our imagination through the lyrics of the Beach Boys, the novels of John Steinbeck, and films as varied as Point Break and Rebel Without a Cause, but nothing prepares travellers for just how fundamental beach culture is to Californians. Cycle the promenade between Los Angeles’s Santa Monica and Venice Beach and you’ll see all of life here, from wealthy retirees walking their poodles to gymnasts performing tricks on the outdoor bars and hoops, picnicking families, and Venice’s new tech community catching a few waves before heading to work at Google. Staying in a 1920s-styled bungalow at the Fairmont Miramar Santa Monica is the most starry way to do a seaside stopover LA-style.San Diego, a couple of hours south of LA (and easily reached by either rail or car) is a particularly beach-obsessed city, and a great place to linger on the sands, either at chichi La Jolla Cove Beach or at local surfer hangout Pacific Beach.North of Los Angeles, Pismo Beach is spectacularly beautiful and surrounded by wineries, and as you venture farther north, the scenery only gets more rugged and dramatic. Big Sur is a highlight for visitors, a beach community that has become a refuge for bohemians, solace-seeking celebrities, artists and writers since the likes of Jack Kerouac called it home in the 1950s.For many visitors, Santa Cruz is an unexpected delight, a surf- and music-loving town (spookily captured in cult movie The Lost Boys) that’s a great place to linger for a few days. Wipeout on a wave or two, then visit one of the city’s distilleries – head to Venus Spirits to try their award-winning gin – or breweries to dull the pain.Lovers of coastal scenery should also venture north of San Francisco to explore Point Reyes national seashore walk the Chimney Rock trail, eat oysters from roadside shacks, and feast on artisan cheese at the local cult favourite Cowgirl Creamery.California dreaming?

The decision is a major blow to the local community, the British car industry and manufacturing capability in south Wales.Ford blamed the closure on the imminent end to a contract for engine production for Jaguar Land Rover (JLR), as well as a global decline in demand for the Ford engines made in Bridgend.Stuart Rowley, president of Ford in Europe, said the closure was prompted by the carmaker’s global cost-cutting drive – although he added that Bridgend was more expensive than other plants building the same engine.He said: “Changing customer demand and cost disadvantages, plus an absence of additional engine models for Bridgend going forward make the plant economically unsustainable in the years ahead.”Production of Ford’s 1.5 litre Dragon engines will cease in February, followed by the end of production for JLR in September 2020. The closure will cost Ford $650m (£512m) in redundancy and pension payments.Unite, which represents workers at the plant, said Ford had betrayed its workers. The union’s assistant general secretary, Steve Turner, said: “Ford will be taking an economic sledgehammer to the Welsh economy in an act of gross industrial sabotage if it doesn’t urgently reverse these closure plans.”The announcement is the latest blow to the British car industry this year. Honda announced in February that it planned to shut its Swindon plant in 2021 with the loss of 3,500 jobs, and Nissan has reversed its decision to build the new X-Trail vehicle at its Sunderland plant.JLR, owned by India’s Tata Motors, is also cutting thousands of jobs. JLR, which runs the largest British car-making operation, has come under pressure after a slump in sales in China.The Bridgend closure will leave Toyota’s Deeside engine plant and Aston Martin Lagonda’s new St Athan plant as the only major car-making locations in Wales.The Ford plant has manufactured petrol engines since 1980 and supplies the company’s factories across Europe. It had been thought to be particularly at risk, however, because the contract to make engines for JLR will end this year.Ford has three factories in the UK, the others being a diesel engine plant in Dagenham, east London, and a transmissions plant in Halewood, on the outskirts of Liverpool.The company is undergoing a round of steep cost-cutting around the world. It announced widespread job losses across its European operations in January and said it would consider closing plants."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ce8f644edd2bd5cbd32a61fce9fa60d0380d43f4/0_9_1369_822/master/1369.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dd47f52071618032711504601330a3b0","title":"have you been affected by what has happened with the neil woodford fund","story":"We’d like to hear from those who have invested in Neil Woodford’s fund and are affected by his decisionThe UK’s most renowned fund manager, Neil Woodford, has blocked investors from pulling money from his flagship fund.

Yet it has been reported that Mr Woodford is taking in nearly £100,000 in management fees a day,” Morgan said.“The suspension of trading has provided Mr Woodford with some breathing room to fix his fund he should afford his investors the same space and waive the fund’s fees while the fund is suspended.”Carney said banks were now a lot safer as a result of the tightening up of supervision that followed the financial crash of 2008, but said recent years had seen an increase from $50tn to $80tn in assets under management, with most of the growth coming from investment funds.The Bank governor said two-thirds of investment funds with structural mismatches were domiciled in the US and Europe. It was important, he added, to ensure – as with banks – that funds were not taking excessive risks.“System-wide stress simulations are currently being developed, including at the Bank of England, to assess these risks.” The authorities were beginning to consider policy tools to guard against the build-up of systemic risks in financial institutions other than banks.Speaking to the Institute of International Finance, Carney said investment flows to emerging markets – where both returns and risks are higher – had increased over the past decade.“These flows are particularly flighty, reflecting the fact that more than $30tn of global assets are held in investment funds that promise daily liquidity to investors despite investing in potentially illiquid underlying assets, such as emerging market economy (EME) debt.“We have recently seen analogous situations in the UK within some niche managers and smaller markets, such as property Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs). The complications would be much greater if a major asset class like EME debt were to freeze up.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ce169b8dad1d0497e73454c0435deda367914869/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=44b28aed8aa07e672d4da5aeb205a704","title":"what is the future for sir philip green","story":"As Sir Philip Green’s retail empire faces the prospect of entering administration, putting 18,000 jobs at risk, the  business reporter Sarah Butler discusses how we got here.

Or was it Katharine Hepburn?Electric Ladyland wasn’t the only thing Jimi Hendrix released in 1968. One day in that tumultuous year he left his flat on Brook Street, Mayfair, and strolled down nearby Carnaby Street with a birdcage in his hands. I like to think that he was dressed in a tasselled jacket and flares, his favourite Fender Stratocaster slung across his back. Or perhaps he travelled incognito, in a trenchcoat and dark glasses. Either way, somewhere on that street, the heart of Swinging London at the height of peace and love, he opened the door of the cage and unleashed two bright green birds: Adam and Eve, a breeding pair of ring-necked parakeets.As they vanished, a flash of tropical colour against the grey sky, passersby merely shrugged: just more hippy weirdness. Was it a psychedelic stunt? A symbolic gesture of freedom? The result of a week-long drugs bacchanal? No one really knows. What we do know is that this incident is the indisputable origin of London’s population of feral parakeets, which now number in the tens of thousands and have spread from Hounslow to Haringey, Croydon to Crouch End.Unless that story is not true, and actually London’s parakeets arrived in 1951 with Humphrey Bogart and Katharine Hepburn. The Hollywood stars were in town filming The African Queen at Isleworth Studios (or Shepperton Studios, depending on who you ask). A romantic adventure set in the equatorial swamps of east Africa, the film required exotic extras, so a flock of ring-necked parakeets was unwisely brought on set. Whether these resourceful birds escaped before, during or after filming has not been definitively established – they certainly don’t appear in the film, which I have watched frame by frame – but what lies beyond all reasonable doubt is that these cinematic escapees were the progenitors of today’s population.Unless, of course, that is fake news, and the parakeets owe their current success to George Michael in the 1990s. Either burglars broke into the singer’s Hampstead townhouse and wrecked his secret aviary – he never reported the crime, presumably wary of police involvement – or they escaped during a drunken argument involving Michael and Boy George in a flat they are rumoured to have shared in Brockley.Unless they made their bid for freedom during the Great Storm of 1987.Unless they escaped from the livestock transportation area in Heathrow airport.Unless they fled Henry VIII’s menagerie at Hampton Court Palace in the mid-16th century and somehow remained hidden for the next 400 years.If you ask random Londoners how parakeets came to thrive in their city – streaking in squadron-like formations through parks, down roads and along canals, following regular “flyways” as punctually as business commuters – the chances are that one of these theories will be told as fact. No one is ever sure where they heard it. They are classic urban myths, spreading through word of mouth, mutating and evolving a little with every teller. Whatever the truth, or lack of it, these stories are a sign that London’s parakeets, in their short time among us, have become deeply lodged in the city’s collective imagination.Sadly, there is a more prosaic explanation. Small, charismatic and brilliantly coloured – though voiced with a horrendous squawk – parakeets have been popular as pets for hundreds of years. We have no idea how many arrived in Britain through London’s busy docks, or how many seized the first opportunity to escape, but dozens or hundreds of iniduals must have gained freedom over the years, flocking together for protection and enthusiastically breeding.Their success was limited at first. The earliest recorded sightings were in Dulwich in 1893 and Brixton in 1894. A breeding pair were reported in Epping Forest in 1930. It wasn’t until the late 20th century that the first large colony was established, roosting noisily in the trees by the river at Kingston-upon-Thames, where they became such a local feature that many people still know the birds as “Kingston parakeets”. For decades they were an exotic novelty, exclusive to south-west London.Then, perhaps 10 years ago, began the great green expansion.First they spread into Richmond and Kew. Then they crossed the Thames. They established themselves in Kensington Gardens, Hyde Park and Regent’s Park, and moved north into Highgate and Hampstead Heath, west into Holland Park and Notting Hill, and east along the Regent’s Canal into Hackney and Walthamstow Marshes. Almost overnight they appeared in places they’d never been in before, and quickly became almost as ubiquitous as pigeons. In the space of a few short years they spread to every borough and even beyond the M25, following in the path of generations of upwardly mobile Londoners by departing the grimy inner city for the Home Counties.Amazingly, this mass colonisation – an audacious ecological shift – went largely unremarked upon until very recently. Despite the parakeets’ colour, numbers and noise, no one (apart from the urban mythologists and boozy anecdotists in pubs) seemed to consider it worthy of attention.They don’t have a problem with the climate. Although people commonly assume parakeets are tropical birds – at home, say, in the sweltering jungles portrayed in The African Queen – their south Asian native range extends into the foothills of the Himalayas, so they are unperturbed by mild English winters. As temperatures rise year-on-year they will probably fare even better: not so much climate refugees as climate beneficiaries.What does this population boom mean for native British birds? Do the parakeets spell disaster for indigenous species? Are they wreaking ecological havoc? Their detractors condemn them as illegal immigrants, invaders aggressively driving out the local population, and the tabloids periodically clamour for a cull. The government has quietly ruled this out as “no longer cost-effective or viable”, concluding that there are simply too many of the birds. In other words, they are here to stay. Their defenders admire their beauty and celebrate their ersity, holding them up as paragons of successful integration. As with the myths surrounding them, often the facts become secondary to what people want to believe. Parakeets are blank canvases on to which Londoners project their own prejudices, values, beliefs, hopes and fears. They have been weaponised.The general consensus from experts, as always, is a lot more nuanced. Rather than making dire predictions of avian apocalypse, most ecologists agree it is too early to tell. There is some concern that parakeets – smart, fast and sociable – can outmanoeuvre garden birds in the feeding frenzy at bird tables, and their choice of nesting sites brings them into competition with nuthatches and other “secondary cavity nesters” that inhabit old woodpecker holes. But so far there seems to be more than enough food and foliage to go around. In terms of the threats facing native British birdlife, the greatest peril comes not from parakeets, but from native British people.In an age of climate emergency, with mass extinction ripping apart the fabric of the living world, when the dominant narrative of our times is one of loss and disappearance, collapse and diminishment, parakeets tell a different story. These plucky newcomers beat the odds, not only surviving but thriving. In a nature-depleted culture, when city dwellers are supposedly alienated from the environment and anything that is feral or wild, parakeets are the subject of outlandish speculation, the source of mystery, imagination and everyday wonder. They are a reminder to look up. To keep paying attention.In the simplest terms, it’s hard not to find that uplifting.The Parakeeting of London: An Adventure in Gonzo Ornithology, by Nick Hunt and Tim Mitchell, is published by Paradise RoadFollow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f677dc629c88602d27ee43319f2a3d5ae0e0af70/0_106_3543_2125/master/3543.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6f89a4a633c5262563c6f919734394d7","title":"what lies behind the facades of london in pictures","story":"Photographer and trained architect Francisco Ibáñez Hantke sees cities as a spectacle of constant conflict, negotiation and flux.

Carnivores were the better off: those who looked after themselves even if it meant preying on the weak. The herbivores were the gentle ruminants of the middle classes, guilty about their advantages and with eyes full of sorrow for the less fortunate.Although founded to give a political voice to the industrial working class, the Labour party has always had its herbivore wing, and when enough white-collar workers and intellectuals have lined up alongside the party’s blue-collar contingent it has proved a winning formula. Labour’s big election victories – 1945, 1966, 1997 – were all examples of successful coalition-building.But the marriage, never entirely comfortable, has come under increasing strain in recent years and looks like breaking down irrevocably over Brexit. The partners have not really been talking to each other, have taken to sleeping in separate beds and are now heading straight for the orce court.Jeremy Corbyn has been doing his best in the marriage guidance counsellor role, but the limitations of his approach were illustrated in the European elections, where Labour performed poorly. The party’s share of the vote was less than half what it secured in the 2017 general election, with Labour-leaning remainers opting for the Liberal Democrats, the Greens or nationalist parties, while Labour-supporting leavers went with the Brexit party. His tactics will be further tested today in the Peterborough byelection, where Nigel Farage’s startup is expected to emerge victorious.Corbyn has edged closer to backing a second referendum in certain circumstances, but it is clear that he still has reservations about going “full remain”. That’s not a particularly comfortable position, and it is strongly opposed by plenty of Labour members. However, it is still a defensible one.Labour will never form a government if its remainer and leaver wings become permanently estranged. While it is certainly true that the majority of Labour voters back remain, a significant minority voted to leave the EU. It is not enough for Labour to pile up votes in the pro-remain big cities: it needs to win marginals in the north, the Midlands and south-east as well – constituencies that voted leave in June 2016 and for the Brexit party last month. Labour’s remainers believe departure from the EU will make those who voted to leave worse off. Labour’s leavers think the remainers are subverting democracy.In these circumstances, Labour is right to try to move on from the referendum and focus on healing the country. There has been plenty of armchair psephology since the results of the European elections, designed to show that remainers won when all their votes were added together. All that can really be said is that a second referendum would be as close as the one in 2016 and confirm that Britain is deeply riven along age, class and geographic lines. London, in case anyone hasn’t noticed, is a separate country.It’s worth noting that Corbyn’s Euroscepticism – for which he takes a lot of stick – was widespread on the left before the referendum. There was opposition to the pro-banker austerity imposed on Ireland and Greece to the pro-employer and anti-trade union judgments handed down by the European court of justice, and nobody was especially impressed by years of sluggish growth and high unemployment. None of this seems to be relevant any more to Labour’s hardcore remainers. To the extent that they admit to any problems, it is with the euro rather than the EU, and since Britain is not part of the single currency it can have the best of all worlds.Even putting to one side the fact that many of today’s remainers were gung-ho for the euro in 2003, this is still a curious argument. Because if you’ve got doubts about the euro you should have doubts about Europe’s entire direction of travel. The euro is Europe’s single biggest project. It was intended to be a symbol both of progress towards ever-deeper union and the means of achieving still further integration. This is not some add-on extra, it is what Europe is all about.Yet the design flaws that were obvious from the outset have become ever more apparent, and there’s no immediate prospect of fixing them. French president Emmanuel Macron thinks more integration – a banking union and a European finance minister – is what’s needed to make the euro work. This would mean German taxpayers writing cheques for the rest of Europe, and there is not the slightest possibility of that happening.The reality is that Europe has a currency that doesn’t work, an economy that doesn’t work and a political process that doesn’t work. Corbyn is often accused of being starry-eyed about the possibility of creating a socialist utopia in Britain and forever harking back to his formative years in the 1970s. But he is not nearly as starry-eyed as some of his critics, who seem to think either that an earthly paradise already exists on the other side of the Channel, or that with a few judicious tweaks there will soon be one.On most issues, Corbyn is clear about what he supports: renationalisation, extra borrowing for public investment, higher taxes for companies and the better off. On Brexit it is different. Labour is now more a party of the gentle ruminants than a party of the industrial working class, and over Brexit the gentle ruminants are proving anything but gentle. They should, however, cut Corbyn some slack. From the Maastricht treaty onwards he has got the European Union a lot more right than they have.• Larry Elliott is the ’s economics editor"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf5d8550a1f7c04972293a6ff5c6807cc59cae26/0_0_6028_3617/master/6028.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7532f8178e50e89c96648ecbb50f8bd2","title":"gay man deported kenya home office mercy","story":"After making my home in England for 10 years, I have received a notice to leave everything I love behind On Monday, I opened the letter I never wanted to receive. After 10 years living in the UK I was told that I am no longer welcome and should make arrangements to leave the country “without delay” or risk being deported in the middle of the night. As a gay man, whose country of birth, Kenya, persecutes homosexuals, I felt my whole world collapse around me as I read the matter-of-fact words on the Home Office headed paper.Perhaps I was naive, but I wasn’t expecting this letter. I’ve been in a battle with the Home Office since 2016, and was locked in detention just last year, but somehow I still thought that they would see sense. This is the government department that this month is decorating its Twitter page with the rainbow flag, and whose own policies should, in theory, preclude them from sending gay people to countries where their safety is at risk. But it was a rejection that I read on Monday – and it’s left me reeling. After two years of legal arguments, in a chaotic and dysfunctional system that has left me in a constant state of uncertainty and anxiety, they simply stated that I do “not qualify for leave on any basis”. It was a crushing blow. I don’t like to think about what it would mean to be removed to Kenya, but in the last few days I have been forced to contemplate it. For a start, it would mean living in a country where expressions of sexual intimacy are outlawed for gay people. Only last month the high court upheld a law which criminalised gay sex – and hangs a 14-year jail sentence over the heads of those who dare to have a relationship with someone they love.It’s not just the law that would threaten me. With my case being so public I would be at risk of extreme homophobia everywhere I went. I know all too well that LGBT people in Kenya struggle to get housing and jobs, and I’d be at serious risk of destitution if I was forced to go there. Imagine being scared everywhere you went, being jobless, homeless and away from the place you know call home – that would be my life in Kenya.The idea of being forced to leave the UK doesn’t just fill me with fear, it also puts into sharp focus all that I would miss from my life here. My mum lives in Bristol and being deported would mean leaving her behind, unsure if or when I might see her again. Bristol is my home, and my rugby team and other LGBT friends are my family. After almost 10 years here I feel safe and happy and I want to keep building my life in my adopted city and use the skills I have to return to work and contribute to society.Ultimately, this isn’t just about me. This behaviour from the Home Office is part of a consistent pattern of ill-treatment towards me and other people seeking asylum. I’ve known so many others to have had their rights and humanity denied. We’ve seen people ejected from the UK who had a legal right to stay here. There have been cases of extreme mistreatment in detention. And there have been countless other cases of LGBT people removed from the UK to countries where their lives are at risk. And a number of people who were recently removed to Jamaica by the Home Office have lost their lives.It doesn’t have to be like this, for me or anyone else. I am simply asking that the Home Office follow its own rules by protecting me from persecution. Rather than patting themselves on the back with their LGBT-friendly Twitter picture they need to wake up to the fact that they are putting my life, and the lives of many others, at risk. This isn’t some sort of game, I’m not a number, I’m a real person with a life in this country who is simply demanding to be protected from extreme danger.While the Home Office is acting with cruelty, the people around me are being nothing but kind. Today I will walk into the police station, facing possible immediate detention, surrounded by my rugby teammates and many others who say they will be there for me at that most terrifying moment. More than 100,000 have already signed a petition calling for the Home Office to reverse its decision – and many more have written to Sajid Javid to demand that he acts with humanity. I’m not giving up hope. I know that even the most callous of government departments has human beings working in it – people who recognise that being able to express your love is a basic human right. Whatever happens today I am determined that this is not the end of my fight, and that a culture of cruelty towards people like me can, and must, be overturned for good.• Ken Macharia is a gay man who came to the UK as a student in 2009 and is based in Shepton Mallet.

But we’re somewhat less accustomed to speaking about them as business etiquette and workplace obligation – even though, to many women, that’s exactly what they represent.While many wear high heels for fun and self expression, countless others wear them because of industry standards, or even because their boss says they have to. But why?High heels have long been seen as a female equivalent to the businessman’s necktie. They’re a sartorial accessory that, when worn in a business setting, send a message of formality and professionalism. Nowhere has this been more true than in the highly gendered corporate culture of Japan, but the association is global. From Sheryl Sandberg to Theresa May, high heels have been a key component of female power-dressing for decades. John T Molloy’s bestselling Dress for Success books of the 1970s cautioned American women never to go without their precious high-heeled pumps if they wanted to be taken seriously in the workplace.Some may not see why this would be a problem. After all, plenty of women not only choose to wear high heels, but passionately defend that choice. The word “empowerment” may even make an appearance. And besides, if men are often required to wear a jacket and tie, what’s wrong with a female equivalent?But no item of men’s clothing causes such hampered movement or physical pain. Indeed, high heels fit into a long history of women’s physical repression and mandated suffering.High heels have changed dramatically since they made their debut, on the feet of 16th-century Persian cavalrymen, before migrating west to the European armies and royal courts. While high-heeled shoes were standard fare for both men and women in Europe throughout the 18th century, they took a tumble with the arrival of the French revolution. After Marie Antoinette was guillotined in a pair of high heels, the style fell out of fashion. Shoes went flat, and silhouettes slimmed down. When high heels returned to the feet of the fashionable, a curious gender ide began to widen: by the 20th century, as women gained more freedom, high heels were thought of as “women’s shoes” exclusively (with a brief glam rock interlude in the 1970s). They also became higher, thinner and harder to walk in than ever before.If wearing high heels in the workplace was just about increasing height, more people would wear platforms. Men, who also experience professional benefits from seeming taller, would wear them too. But they do not, because high heels are a way to communicate femininity. They were considered such a vital part of women’s professional dress in the 1970s and 1980s precisely because the very act of working, having a job and seeking success and power was seen as inherently masculine. The high heels were a necessary counterpoint to the manly notions of ambition and wanting to control your own financial destiny.Rather than reconfiguring the workplace to welcome women, societies across the globe have consistently focused on reconfiguring women to fit into a workplace that wasn’t built for them. Magazine articles and advertising still focus on what women should do, say, wear and buy to be worthy of professional respect. Even terms such as “women’s empowerment” and “lean in” place the emphasis on women needing to find, do or become something rather than the need to restructure a system that routinely hurts them.It’s appropriate that #KuToo alludes to #MeToo, because both causes revolve around choice and consent. Both movements are about a new generation of women taking a hard look at the suffering they’ve long taken for granted, and saying: maybe it doesn’t have to be like this.• Summer Brennan is a journalist and author of High Heel"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/164d109bbb1e5726f3aa12f250a6c8e4b069d340/0_175_5961_3576/master/5961.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=92801480c0802f63065689cd3287b462","title":"labour peterborough byelection brexit party remain","story":"Byelections can change history, glorious victories and notorious defeats marking constituencies forever in the annals of political nerdery. Some results are freaks – the Liberals’ surprise win in Orpington in 1962 did not herald a great revival for the party, nor was Shirley Williams’s spectacular Crosby win in 1981 a harbinger of SDP mould-breaking. But sometimes byelections do signal seismic change.Today Peterborough bids to crack open the old two-party hegemony, with the new Brexit party favourite to win. Labour may yet hang on, its campaign benefiting from an experienced get-out-our-vote local team. But even if Nigel Farage just misses, he can still claim an extraordinary result, rattling the Tories deeper into no-deal extremism. Glumly resigned to their coming humiliation, the party’s large foolish tendency will persuade themselves that Boris Johnson can magic them out of the slough of despond.Labour is the party standing to lose most if Peterborough slips its grasp. Though its former MP’s prison sentence has some effect, the real struggle is to push Jeremy Corbyn off the fence of Labour’s failed Brexit policy. Win or lose today, watch both sides in Labour leap out to claim victoryloss was due to their favoured policy. The battle is on to reshape Labour policy not just for a referendum but to commit to campaigning vigorously for remain. Another Europe is Possible, Hope not Hate, Best for Britain and others are hitting the phone banks, calling round local parties to back a strong referendum-and-remain motion for the party conference.Labour can’t afford to wait for its party conference in late September – and all but the knot of Lexiters surrounding Corbyn know it. The shock of the disastrous European election results is turning MPs towards the only direction that can rescue the party. Jenny Chapman, shadow minister for exiting the EU and MP for leave-voting Darlington, is a bellwether. Once an adamant anti-referendumite, on Wednesday she strongly backed another public vote on the BBC’s Politics Live. “Take the bull by the horns now” she said. “I don’t see any other way than a referendum.”Other MPs equally conflicted by their constituents’ Brexit stance include Karl Turner, whose Hull East was a strong leave-voting seat. But he too has now switched to remain. “Yes, I would lose a few thousand votes but not enough to lose the seat. This policy is a disaster and I need to do what’s best for my constituents: I’m not their delegate.” He sees other Labour MPs now realising that even in leave seats, the loss of remain votes will do far more damage, and the very real prospect of a Tory no deal is terrifying. John McDonnell, on Wednesday night’s Peston programme, was even clearer than before: “Any deal has to be put to a public vote.”How long can Labour resist coming out unequivocally for remain? After a week of Trump and D-day, next week Corbyn speaks to the PLP and the shadow cabinet meets, where there will be an urgent push to topple Corbyn off the fence, in order to summon back voters lost by obstinately pursuing a policy the great majority reject. Shadow cabinet members warn that Labour needs a strong clear pro-remain policy now, before the Tories select their new leader next month. September is far too late, but the membership will force the policy change: better by far Corbyn is seen to make that leap himself.Here’s the curiosity in Labour’s position: all his life Corbyn followed the Bennite belief in the supremacy of party members to determine policy, yet now he defies them. Doubly odd is that he owes the security of his tenure entirely to that same membership who keep him there, despite his refusal to listen to them. Local parties report his perversely inert stance on Brexit is driving members away those not tearing up their cards will show up as non-renewers. Michael Chessum, national organiser of the motion to conference, says: “It is time for Labour to make a final and complete shift towards backing a public vote and opposing Brexit. The alternative is that the electoral coalition behind Corbyn’s Labour falls apart.”The Corbyn coterie tries to dismiss all critics as phantom “Blairites”, but this is the party’s left rebelling. They rightly see this as a fundamental culture war with the Trumpite alt-right, and demand “an agenda of internationalism, defending free movement and fighting for radical change rather than pandering to the nationalist right”. They see the CorbynLen McCluskey stand aligning with the right, clinging to an imaginary ideal of the perfect Labour voter as “old, white, male, with a regional accent” as if every other working Labour supporter doesn’t count. But they do, as poll after poll shows. Win or lose in Peterborough today, this is the battle not just for the heart of Labour but for its very survival. As one leader in the charge for the referendum-and-remain motion says: “Jeremy is MIA.”When the Tories select a no-dealer, the country needs a powerful opposition to mobilise every vote against a reckless new prime minister willing to drag the country out of Europe without public consent."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ed1394985785e321ef1059c52c271df7f0f27948/0_101_4796_2878/master/4796.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d50b33eb0183d82a8a21e66dc714c329","title":"hen harrier chicks to be reared in captivity to placate grouse moor owners","story":"‘Brood management’ trial criticised for failing to tackle persecution of bird of preyHen harrier chicks will be removed from their parents and reared in captivity this summer in a controversial “brood management” scheme to placate grouse moor owners.Removing young hen harriers from nests on grouse moors is designed to prevent concentrations of the bird of prey on grouse shooting estates. Stopping hen harriers from feeding on young grouse is designed to reduce the illegal killing of the species, which is on the brink of extinction as a breeding bird in England.Last summer was the bird’s most successful breeding season for more than a decade with 34 chicks fledged from nine nests across northern England.Natural England, the government’s conservation watchdog, announced its brood management scheme would begin this summer with “active” hen harrier nests meeting the criteria for chick removal and landowners willing to be part of the trial.The chicks would be raised in captivity and then released into suitable habitat away from grouse moors. The hen harrier tends to nest in clusters and proponents of the scheme argued that brood management provided reassurance to grouse moor owners that concentrations of hen harriers would not build up on their moors, predating grouse populations. This, it has been argued, would stop gamekeepers and others illegally killing the bird.Tony Juniper, the chair of Natural England, said: “Conservation and protection of the hen harrier is at the heart of what we are doing in licensing this trial of brood management. This decision takes forward but one element in a far broader recovery strategy for the species.“Natural England is ready to take the next careful step, aware that the licensed activity and the research will rightly come under close scrutiny from the scientists on the advisory group, from ourselves as the licensing authority and by those both supportive of and opposed to this trial.“We, as an organisation, must pursue all options for an important bird such as the hen harrier, so that our children may enjoy this majestic species in the wild.”Critics said the trial was appeasing the grouse shooting industry rather than tackling the illegal persecution of the bird.Mark Avery, a wildlife campaigner who launched an unsuccessful crowdfunded legal challenge against the trial, said: “This is a daft idea invented by grouse moor owners and of no use at all to hen harriers.”Avery said he is currently appealing against the high court decision that found the trial to be legal.Chris Corrigan, director of RSPB England, said: “This is disappointing to hear. As we’ve said all along, brood management is the wrong tool to help restore hen harriers to their rightful place across the English landscape. The RSPB believes the first step in hen harrier recovery should be the ending of illegal persecution. The evidence is now clear that this is the main reason driving the decline of this iconic bird.”Natural England’s director of operations, James Diamond, said a scientific advisory group would monitor and evaluate the trial to “ensure we learn as much as possible from this trial about the potential for brood management to be used as a conservation technique”.Brood management is part of the  Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs’ hen harrier recovery plan, supported by conservation groups including the International Centre for Birds of Prey and the Hawk \u0026amp Owl Trust. Other conservation charities, such as the RSPB, have pulled out of the plan in objection to brood management.A similar scheme to remove the eggs of threatened curlew and to rear young in captivity is under way in partnership with the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust.Eggs – which would otherwise have to be destroyed to ensure aircraft safety – are being rescued from curlew nests close to runways on Ministry of Defence land, with the chicks later released into other suitable habitat in England."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6140ac779971d22cb7a24b15fb3deb9fe1f4bc3a/0_163_5039_3025/master/5039.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4644963ef55b8cfcdd8a9858545ff5ac","title":"uk near bottom of european bathing waters league table","story":"The UK has one of the lowest proportions of top quality bathing waters in Europe, according to research by the European Environment Agency.The three countries with the highest number of poor quality sites, where levels of bacteria from sewage and livestock runoff are at their highest, were Italy, France and Spain.Some of the beaches rated as poor or only sufficient quality include beaches along the Solway Firth, Eyemouth near Edinburgh, Ladram Bay near Sidmouth in Devon, Worthing, Bexhill and Bognor Regis Aldwick beach."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3803f9c1924fafaa9dc7c43a73e7f03190c9960d/0_59_2578_1547/master/2578.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5fea0b342291f618486509c9d817aae4","title":"70s bond girl caroline munro i loved roger moore his knitwear was really classy","story":"She spent her career being chased by vampires, 007 and David Hasselhoff. And she also found time to sing with Cream and Gary Numan. Was it all as much fun as it looked?One day, 50 years ago, a solicitor walking to work through Waterloo station in London noticed a 30ft-tall woman. She was dressed in an unzipped scuba top and was brandishing a knife drawn from a scabbard strapped to her bare thigh. It was his daughter. “Dad knew I was going to be the Lamb’s Navy Rum girl, but not that I would be on a billboard,” says Caroline Munro. “He said it was a bit of a shock.”Over the next decade, Munro’s parents got used to seeing their daughter writ large and wearing smalls. There she was on the cover of the Music for Pleasure Hot Hits 11 album, practising archery in a bikini and knee-high suede boots. There she was with Peter Cushing, exploring the underworld, in minimal clothes but lots of eyeliner, in At the Earth’s Core (1976). And there she was opposite David Hasselhoff in the 1978 movie Starcrash, her limbs swathed, but only in cellophane.For a decade, she remained the face of Lamb’s Navy Rum. “Join the Lamb’s Navy,” went the slogan. “It’s where the action is.” The Office for National Statistics holds no data on whether naval recruitment rose during the 1970s, but intuitively it seems likely that squads of would-be sailors signed up after seeing Munro wearing a naval jacket with epaulettes and little else.“I loved the job,” she says. “We had shoots in all kinds of exotic places.” And Cornwall. “I remember being in the sea in the winter. Not a good day.”Didn’t her religious parents object to their only child getting into the scanty end of modelling? “I think they were pleased that I found a career that I enjoyed. I had dyslexia which, for a long time, really undermined my confidence. I think my mother hoped I would become a window dresser.”The unexpected path first opened up in the mid-60s when a photo a friend took of her when she was 16 won the Evening News’s Face of the Year competition, which was judged by David Bailey. She doesn’t remember the snap, other than that she was freckly. Modelling gigs came quickly, including a shoot for American Vogue in which, she says, she had to sit in the sea off Malta modelling knitwear.I am agog at the news: Roger Moore – her co-star in The Spy Who Loved Me – also started off as a knitwear model. “Oh that’s right! I knew there was something about him I liked. His knitwear was very classic, really.”In 1967, Munro, who had sung in her church choir, released her first single, a breathy ditty called Tar and Cement, recorded at Abbey Road. Her backing band was Eric Clapton, Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker, better known as Cream, alongside the future Yes guitarist Steve Howe. She remembers Baker driving her up the Mall in an open-topped Jaguar to the photoshoot an image in keeping with the Austin Powers-ish tang of her life at this time. But it’s the B-side, This Sporting Life, the 70-year-old Munro sings to me today over coffee. “‘I’m getting tired of hanging around  Think I will marry and settle down  Because this old night life  This old sport life  Is killing me.’ I was only 16, just out of convent school when I sang that. It was ridiculous, really. I didn’t know anything about living a sporting life.”Earlier that year, her dad had dropped her off at Elstree studios to play one of Woody Allen’s gun-toting guards in the James Bond spoof Casino Royale. “We all wore chain mail dresses and gladiator boots. My mum was thrilled. She loved Woody Allen’s work.”Her first speaking role came in the 1969 comedy western A Talent for Loving. “They wanted someone who looked Mexican. I had to speak with an accent.” What was the story? “My father has to marry me off because of the family curse – we love too much.” Essentially, the plot demanded that Munro’s character be cured of her ancestral nymphomania. “My love interest in the film was Derek Nimmo.” You mean Just a Minute’s Derek Nimmo? “That’s him. Lovely Derek!”But Munro’s big acting break, in 1972, was thanks not to such screen work but her continuing efforts for booze and seamen. James Carreras, head of Hammer horror, had also been transfixed by a Lamb’s Navy Rum billboard. As a result, she became – like Ingrid Pitt, Joanna Lumley, Kate O’Mara – fated to spend aeons being nibbled by gaunt men with false teeth.She signed a contract at the studio and starred with Christopher Lee in Dracula AD 1972. “That was when I realised I wanted to be an actor. It made me get serious and study for it.” In Captain Kronos – Vampire Hunter, she played the barefoot Gypsy girl Carla whom the eponymous captain saves from bloodsuckers. It has some fabulous dialogue. “What he doesn’t know about vampirism,” says the captain of his hunchbacked assistant, “wouldn’t fill a fly’s codpiece.”“They were planning a sequel, but it never happened,” says Munro, sadly.Despite a recent flip-flop-related fall that wrenched two fingers and left some nasty bruising on her face, Munro remains glamorous. Presumably she has been the victim of endless unwanted sexual advances? Again, her story is one of confounding sunniness. “I wasn’t! Everybody behaved very well to me. I didn’t expect anything else. I think it’s terrible what these women have had to deal with. I was treated with great courtesy throughout my career, though.”There was one near-incident, in fact, involving a Hollywood producer who had rented the whole top floor of Claridge’s hotel in London. “I walked in, and I ran out.” Why? “He was with his girlfriend, but there was something wrong. Something I didn’t care for. I just made my excuses and ran. It was an instinctive thing.” She declines to elaborate, but mentions the film she was there to discuss: Two for the Road, the Stanley Donen-directed romcom starring Audrey Hepburn and Albert Finney.In 1977, the producer of the Bond films, Cubby Broccoli, cast her as Bond villainess Naomi in The Spy Who Loved Me. In one scene, Roger Moore’s Bond arrives in Sardinia, posing as a marine biologist. Naomi, sporting a bikini and diaphanous peignoir, sashays to her boat, as Bond comments: “What a handsome craft – such lovely lines.”Later, Naomi is tasked with killing Bond and his accomplice, which she attempts to do from her helicopter, shooting at the Lotus Esprit while Bond negotiates Sardinian corniches. Then 007 turns the tables: his car, pimped up by Q, becomes a submarine, which fires a deadly rocket at Naomi’s chopper. What do you remember of the shoot? “Well, I didn’t fly the helicopter. That was a lovely stunt man in a black wig.” She filmed her scenes sitting in a helicopter in London.No matter. Munro became a Bond girl. She talks enthusiastically about sharing memories with fellow members of that elite club on the festival circuit. “The roles are getting better for women. When you think about it, the most iconic Bond girl is Judi Dench.”But after romping with Hasselhoff in space in Starcrash, whose spin-off merchandise includes a collectible Caroline Munro ray-gun-waving action figure (do leather bikini bottoms feature holsters as standard? Sure, why not?), she changed course. In the slasher film Maniac she played a photographer romanced by a New York serial killer who scalps his victims. It remains something of a cult favourite, although at the time it attracted some interest from some British police forces as a putative video nasty.Munro’s musical endeavours also continued: in 1985, she recorded a single, Pump Me Up, with Gary Numan, a piece of electropop very much of its time. “It was a big hit in Italy,” she says. She would still like to make more records – country rock, would be her preference, she says, before cautioning: “You haven’t heard how out of tune I sound on some of my records. I’m not exactly Aretha Franklin.”Her career could have taken a different turn had she moved to the US. “I went there to audition for some daytime soap in the 80s: Young and Restless or The Bold and the Beautiful – I forget which. But my parents were ageing by then and I didn’t want to leave them.” Her loyalty to them also meant she turned down the role of comic book heroine Vampirella, for whom she would have to shed her clothes entirely.Instead, she became a hostess on Ted Rogers’ Yorkshire TV gameshow 3-2-1 and had two daughters, Georgina and Iona, with her second husband, the writer-director George Dugdale who directed her in Slaughter High.The journalist and broadcaster Samira Ahmed once wrote an article about how being Munro’s neighbour made her re-evaluate her loathing of 70s objectification. “I saw her almost every day those unmistakeable exotic eyes on a middle-aged mum: in the supermarket, walking her daughter to school, signing autographs on the street for bedazzled men. Perhaps she serves to remind us to be wary of sweeping judgments about decades and attitudes. For all the horrors that lurked within the 70s, many who were there did, after all, make their peace with it and grow up just fine.”Ahmed is right: Munro made her peace and grew up fine. She is still wedded to 1970s horror, last year appearing in The House of the Gorgon, a crowdfunded Hammer homage movie directed by and starring a 23-year-old Texan, which was shot in six days. And she is also, with no apparent clash, “all for female empowerment” and recently went on the Women’s March in London. “I love the fact that women speak out now,” she says, even if she – remarkably – never needed to. “I never expected to become an actor. I’ve loved every minute of it and I’ve been very lucky.”The Spy Who Loved me is screened at the Regent Street Cinema, London, on 16 June, followed by a Q\u0026ampA with Munro"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ed6829874e3f626866c819176e7180441ef592d2/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5445db17d57839328116589fbe9fa587","title":"best films of 2019 so far","story":"Charlize Theron flips into funny with Seth Rogen, Mel Gibson picks Vince Vaughn as his accomplice and Avengers reach their Endgame – the finest movies yet this year released in the UKby  Catherine Shoard and  Andrew PulverA New Year’s Day release date in the UK for Yorgos Lanthimos’s period romp kicked the year off in fine style Olivia Colman’s Oscar win two months later was the crowning glory.What we said: “A reminder that the idea of royalty as polite and picturesquely sentimental is something that came in with Queen Victoria: The Favourite is more punk than that.

What’s pleasantly surprising is how well he’s matched by Theron.” Read the full reviewRobert Pattinson’s astronaut on an odyssey to a distant black hole faces parenting challenges – and existential panic – in Claire Denis’s space drama.What we said: “As with so many of Denis’s films, the point is to contrive an overwhelmingly powerful mood and moment, an almost physiological sensation, this one incubated in the vast, cold reaches of space. It throbbed and itched with me long after the film was over.” Read the full reviewMolly Parker plays a theatre director throwing the spotlight on her young star’s mental-health issues in this intense drama.What we said: “The movie’s tone and its narrative arc are intriguingly elusive.

It’s an immersive and exotic experience.” Read the full reviewLong-suppressed Aretha Franklin documentary, shot by Sydney Pollack during recording sessions in a Los Angeles church.What we said: “I felt wrung out at the end of this film.

Are these ceremonies accurately reported? I don’t know. But the film shows cultural expressions being intensified and warped by the new energies of the drug trade.” Read the full reviewA horror-style western about a Brazilian outback town under siege from a mysterious threat.What we said: “It is a really strange film, beginning in a kind of ethno-anthropology and documentary style, becoming a poisoned-herd parable or fever dream and then a Jacobean-style bloodbath. It is an utterly distinctive film-making, executed with ruthless clarity and force.” Read the full reviewGuy Ritchie’s adaptation was widely anticipated to be awful in fact it came out lively, colourful and funny, with only judicious tweaks to the original.What we said: “It has felt like Will Smith’s mojo really is trapped inside a lamp, after what seems like a decade of miserable and self-important ‘serious’ roles which reached their nadir with After Earth and Collateral Beauty. Smith seizes his chance to let it out again and do what he does best. His Genie is less cartoonishly manic than Williams’s more human, you could say. But he’s still the life of the party: part-Queer Eye makeover guru, part-Siri in human form, part-romcom best buddy – with perhaps a touch of Hitch, the professional matchmaker Smith played in 2005.” Read the full reviewOlivia Wilde’s directorial debut is a funny, filthy, female-fronted competitor to Superbad that boasts its own distinctive style.What we said: “Booksmart is inclusive and progressive without feeling forced and announces Wilde, an actor who hasn’t always found her groove on screen, as a major director. Her film reaches the audience-friendly highs of a studio comedy while retaining an indie sensibility, both in its visuals and its tone, and coupled with the script’s rooted awareness of the moment we’re now in, it feels fresh, a film that will be rewatched and quoted, held on a pedestal by those who understand its necessity.” Read the full reviewThe tempestuous tennis star wages war against the world in documentary-maker Julien Faraut’s philosophical portrait.What we said: “McEnroe makes a fascinating focal point. Faraut seeks to elevate him as a singularly tortured creative, an auteur in sports socks. His face set in that teenage De Niro scowl, he offers no celebration, not even a fist pump coaches will recoil at his tendency to stop after each shot, as if anticipating the worst. There are electrifying moments where he stares down the lens mid-match with that signature mix of aggression and derision.” Read the full reviewSon of Saul director László Nemes deftly conjures the death throes of the Austro-Hungarian empire in an atmospheric mystery drama.What we said: “It’s a very mysterious and even bizarre film in many ways, shot in what is becoming Nemes’ signature style: long takes, a persistent closeup on the lead character’s face, and a shallow focus that allows the surrounding reality to intrude only intermittently. The dialogue is often spoken in a subdued murmur, as if each speaker is in possession of a secret.” Read the full reviewNaziha Arebi’s visually arresting documentary focuses on the courage of the country’s fledgling national women’s football team.What we said: “Where Hollywood opted for facile gender-flipping in its recent Ocean’s 11 remake, it could have been more adventurous in search of meaningful Time’s Up-era material. This superbly made, stirring documentary introduces us to what you might call Fadwa’s XI – the fledgling Libyan women’s football team. And there’s something of the heist about the clandestine training sessions they are forced to organise in the face of Islamists trying to brandish the red card.” Read the full review"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/843457421f7d520fc7afc0189b70ec627644fd1a/0_0_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a0a41b18279de7d485c3a526fe784f95","title":"womens world cup 2019 hopes expectations","story":"The most anticipated Women’s World Cup in history is just days away.

The afterglow of a cross-country victory tour rapidly gave way to an abrupt quarter-final loss to Sweden at the 2016 Olympics and a controversial split with longtime goalkeeper Hope Solo, followed by an extended period of experimentation which saw Jill Ellis call up 61 different players in two and a half years. The choppiest waters came in 2017, when the team briefly ceded their world No 1 ranking to Germany after suffering three defeats on home soil: to England and Germany during a last-place finish at the SheBelieves Cup and the team’s first ever loss to Australia in the Tournament of Nations. (And that’s not even including the wage discrimination complaints and contentious collective bargaining agreement negotiations that have often overshadowed the results on the field.)But Ellis finally settled on a 4-3-3 formation constructed around a number of mainstays: goalkeeper Alyssa Naeher (who held off Ashlyn Harris for the starting job), the central defence pairing of Abby Dahlkemper and Becky Sauerbrunn, Lindsey Horan and Julie Ertz in the midfield and Megan Rapinoe and Alex Morgan up front. The result? A 28-game unbeaten run that ended only in January.A swashbuckling attack-first style marshalled by Rapinoe, Morgan, Tobin Heath, Mallory Pugh, Christen Press and old warhorse Carli Lloyd suggests the Americans will have no problem scoring goals in France. Whether they can keep their opponents from returning the favour often enough is the far more pressing issue. They opened the calendar year with a patchy record of two wins, two draws and one loss, including back-to-back games with multiple goals conceded for the first time since 2011. Naeher, always somewhat inconsistent for her country, has been done no favours by a back line thin on depth and experience: starting left-back Kelley O’Hara has been troubled by injury and right-back Crystal Dunn is playing out of position.That’s not to say Ellis’s side doesn’t enter the tournament as favourites on merit, but matching the 540 minutes without conceding a goal they managed in the 2015 World Cup feels highly unlikely.In the end Jill Ellis’s roster for France drew overwhelmingly from the core group that emerged during the team’s unbeaten 2018. The Portsmouth-born coach has taken a bit of criticism in the final runup to France for tinkering with formations and trying players in new roles when consistency should be the focus, but this is an experienced team – more than half of the 2015 squad is back for the title defence – that should be ready for what is afoot when the games start in earnest. The biggest tactical question is whether the US will be able to break down inferior teams with the ability to counter: they struggled to crack the code for a long stretch in the friendly win over South Africa, same as against Sweden in the Rio Olympics.Take your pick from the United States’ embarrassment of attacking riches. No fewer than a half-dozen of the forwards in Ellis’s squad would play a feature role for any team in the tournament, including Morgan, Heath and Pugh. But 33-year-old Megan Rapinoe, whose creative verve at the Rio Olympics was stunted as she recovered from a third ACL injury, remains the straw that stirs the drink for the United States up top.Right-back Ali Krieger and back-up keeper Ashlyn Harris, who confirmed in March they are engaged to be married later this year, are thought to be the first publicly out engaged or married couple to play on the same national team for the United States. Married field hockey players Kate and Helen Richardson-Walsh represented Great Britain together at the Rio Olympics.The 1972 passage of the federal legislation known as Title IX – the law that makes it illegal to discriminate on the basis of sex in any federally funded activity – created opportunities for girls and women to play sports that gave the United States a head start on the international scene.The US women’s national team didn’t play their first game until 1985 – a 1-0 defeat to Italy in the Mundialito tournament after coming together with less than a week’s notice – but a Michelle Akers and Carin Jennings-inspired squad captured their first World Cup in 1991. The second in 1999 – famously capped by Brandi Chastain’s shootout-clinching penalty against China in front of more than 90,000 fans at the Rose Bowl – was an epochal moment in American sports, driving youth participation in girls’ soccer to untold heights and inspiring a new generation of athletes that have endowed the United States with one of the world’s deepest talent pools.The results speak for themselves: the United States have won three World Cups and never finished worse than third in the tournament, adding four Olympic gold medals along the way.Rose Lavelle. Hamstring injuries have limited her involvement over the last two years, but Ellis will be counting on the stylish 24-year-old playmaker and World Cup debutant to provide thrust to the midfield and break open opponents’ back lines with her creativity, vision and technical skill.Given the athleticism, depth and experience of the United States make them no worse than joint favourites with the hosts, anything short of a fourth World Cup would be a disappointment. That said, a showdown with Les Bleues will take place in the quarter-finals – at Parc des Princes in Paris on 28 June – if both sides win their groups as expected.According to last year’s audited financial statements, US Soccer’s annual spend on the women’s national team was $17.1m out of a $71.9m annual budget, not including the $1.7m allocated for the National Women’s Soccer League.US Soccer frustratingly does not offer gender breakdowns for their 4.18m registered players and 9,000 affiliated club teams.

Writer Sarah Pyper shares some handy tips and the best apps to help you stay on top of everythingLike 4.2m others in the UK – and a further 1.8m who’d like to – I often work from home. Once a euphemism for staying in bed and watching hours of daytime TV, working from home is now an everyday occurrence for those developing businesses, working flexible hours around the care of loved ones, or just avoiding spending time jammed into the armpits of their fellow commuters. All you need is a laptop, a reliable wifi connection and you’re set.But if you don’t have reliable wifi, it doesn’t matter how organised you are, how snazzy your tech is, or which shiny new game you’ve got to occupy your kids with, it will all fall apart. Thick walls, mirrors and even windows can create wifi blackspots that turn your home-working dream into a nightmare. However, Virgin Media’s new Intelligent WiFi with Hub 3, WiFi boosters and Connect app can be relied on to save the day. While the Intelligent WiFi system is designed to deliver the best wifi signal across your home, the Connect app also allows you to pause specific devices – which comes in particularly handy when you need to put the kids to bed.As someone who juggles writing and editing with social media side projects and caring for two children, my home isn’t just my castle, it’s my office, my gym, my laundry and my sanctuary – so I rely on home tech and some key apps to get it all done.Digital helpWith digital assistants such as Amazon’s Alexa, Google’s Assistant or Apple’s Siri, you can delegate domestic tasks while you work. They can turn up your heating, adjust the lighting using smart bulbs, feed your pet with devices such as Feed and go Smart Pet Feeder, or control a video doorbell such as Nest Hello so you don’t have to get up to see who’s interrupting you. If it’s time for a break, your smart kettle can start making a cuppa, while your smart toaster warms a slice. Even better, you can link your assistant to a robot vacuum cleaner such as Roomba to clean your carpet, or iRobot Braava, which will mop your floor, meaning you can ace your deadlines and complete your chores at the same time.Keep the kids occupiedA bored child trying to join in your conference call, especially at a tricky moment, has the potential to shatter that illusion of professionalism you’ve been carefully cultivating– just ask Prof Robert Kelly, whose four-year-old daughter interrupted a live TV interview with BBC News. My deadlines and reputation have often been saved by a well-timed gaming app for the kids. Minecraft is a long-time family favourite where you can build entire worlds, and Roblox sees the kids connecting with their friends in a bid to run a pizza parlour, adopt a baby or take care of a pet kitten. If emergency strikes, relinquish your phone and let them take selfies with special effects filters until you’re done. Works every single time.Seek inspirationWhen I need to feel more productive, I listen to the How I Built This podcast’s interviews with successful business owners such as Bobbi Brown for inspiration. Or, for a quick energy boost, the 7 Minute Workout app gets you moving with a set of 30-second exercises. If all else fails, ask Siri to play an upbeat playlist on Spotify at top volume, and thank your lucky stars you’re not in a communal office.Beat the working-from-home bluesThe downsides of working at home can be the domestic distractions (the kettle needs descaling) and feeling isolated (there are only so many conversations you can have with the cat). If things get a little quiet, I switch on Coffitivity or Noisli, which provide background noise so you can pretend you’re strolling through woodland or a Parisian street while you sort out your accounts. To avoid procrastination, I turn to Forest or Tomato Timer. Plant a virtual tree on Forest and it will grow – but only as long as you focus on your work and don’t check any other apps. Tomato Timer helps you follow the Pomodoro Technique where you work intensely for 25 minutes then take a five-minute break when you’ve finished your task.Looking for faster connectivity?

Last week, it emerged that five members of the charity’s senior leadership team, all of whom offered their resignations following the damning review, will be made redundant by October.In April, the  reported scores of jobs would go after management admitted to a hole in its budget of up to £17m to the end of 2020.Unite, the UK’s biggest trade union, said the redundancies were a direct result of “overspending by the organisation’s senior leadership team” and have occurred “despite an increase in income”.Alan Scott, Unite’s regional co-ordinating officer, said Amnesty’s union members will meet this week to decide how to respond to the “devastating announcement”.“All options are firmly on the table,” said Scott, who accused the organisation’s senior management of a “dangerous habit of irresponsible overspending and over-scoping, leaving staff to suffer the costs, first with their wellbeing and now with their jobs”.He said: “The problems of wellbeing and the financial crisis are symptoms of a leadership that continuously made decisions that it could not afford, in terms of budget, workload and responsibility of care.”The cuts, which will be finalised in September, come during a change of direction at the organisation that has led some staff to express concern that in-depth research on key issues such as the death penalty, torture and the arms trade could be compromised.Kumi Naidoo, Amnesty’s recently appointed secretary general and a former head of Greenpeace International, will make the climate crisis and economic rights a central focus of the organisation’s work.One insider told the  of concerns that vital areas of Amnesty’s work such as research, law and policy may be disproportionately affected by the cuts.“Amnesty is known for its good and credible and focused research,” the source said. “The focus on campaigning rather than research and law and policy, to make sure the research is sound, is worrisome.”The crisis at Amnesty became public last year when Gaetan Mootoo, 65, a researcher of three decades, killed himself at his Paris office, leaving a note blaming work pressures and a lack of support from management. A review found his pleas for help had been ignored.A few weeks later, in July last year, Rosalind McGregor, 28, an intern in Geneva, killed herself at her home in the UK.An independent review into workplace culture following the deaths found the charity operating in a “state of emergency” after a restructuring process to decentralise and move staff closer to the ground in places of civil unrest and conflict. The review was based on interviews with 475 staff.The organisation said in a statement: “Amnesty International is facing a serious budget deficit which must be urgently addressed. Even though membership of Amnesty is increasing worldwide, funding for the international secretariat has reduced. Unfortunately, it will have to cut its expenditure, while at the same time ensuring future priorities. We can confirm that there will be up to 93 redundancies.“This is a painful and difficult decision. We will now work closely with staff and the union over a formal three-month consultation period to look at the restructuring proposals. Every effort will be made to minimise job losses and we will do everything in our power to support impacted staff. The final decisions will be announced on 9 September 2019.”The organisation remained “committed to the core work of campaigning and advocacy on evidence-based research into human rights issues”, it said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6b991baff2114ec03fa3b41d5897c6af474ec0de/0_0_6720_4480/master/6720.jpg?width=300\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9e3041af9d36deac9132384c88bb3fb6","title":"adults uk cashless contactless payments","story":"More contactless payments mean one in six young people barely use notes and coinsOne in 10 adults in the UK are now choosing to live a largely cashless life as contactless and mobile payments explode in popularity, official data reveals.Asked about this, UK Finance said the north-west was sometimes slower than other areas when it came to adopting new technology. It said this might be connected to older populations in some parts of the region – Blackpool was last year named as having the oldest population of any UK city – plus the fact that the north-west included some more deprived areas, as well as large rural areas such as the Lake District.The banking body said cash remained the second most frequently used payment method in the UK – it was overtaken by debit cards in late 2017. However, UK Finance has forecast that credit cards and charge cards will overtake notes and coins in around 2027.In March this year, a review concluded that more than 8 million UK adults would struggle to cope in a cashless society. Meanwhile the government confirmed last month that 1p and 2p coins and £50 notes were no longer under threat after a proposal to consider scrapping them prompted a backlash.UK Finance’s chief executive, Stephen Jones, said: “Technology is not for everyone, and cash remains a payment method that is valued and preferred by many, so maintaining access to cash will be vital to ensure no customer is left behind.”The new data shows there were 1.9 million consumers who mainly used cash in 2018, and that these were often people on lower incomes.By contrast, the number of people who “almost never used cash at all” jumped by 2 million in a year – from 3.4 million to 5.4 million."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6dba2ea77c0348a2cc3ee9f5ac0c6ede9e703308/0_877_4200_2519/master/4200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=835bcd802ad59e89963e020f7a62ec73","title":"bruce springsteen western stars review","story":"(Columbia Records)Trailed as a break with tradition, the lush orchestrations and swooning vocals of this finely wrought album, in fact, chime beautifully with Springsteen’s historyThe 19th Bruce Springsteen album has been heralded as a dramatic break from tradition. So dramatic, in fact, that in the interviews accompanying its release, Western Stars’ author has felt impelled to reassure fans that he’ll be back recording and touring with the E Street Band later this year. It’s hard to miss the hint of “normal service will be resumed as soon as possible” about that announcement, balm for Boss fans horrified by how far Western Stars takes their hero from either of his standard musical styles.There’s not a hint of the E Street Band’s booming Sturm und Drang, nor the stripped-back earthiness of his previous solo albums here: they’re replaced by luscious orchestrations, heavy on the strings and French horn, cooing female backing vocals, guitars that shimmer and quiver with tremolo effects, mournful pedal steel. It’s not founded in country music so much as a distinctive musical hybrid that flowed out of Hollywood’s recording studios in the late 1960s and early 70s, which stirred Nashville with west coast folk-pop and ambitious, sophisticated arrangements: the grownup American pop of Glen Campbell’s collaborations with Jimmy Webb or Harry Nilsson’s covers of Everybody’s Talkin’ and I Guess the Lord Must Be in New York City.This is clearly a departure, although there’s a sense in which it’s entirely in keeping with Springsteen’s approach. His sound is almost invariably based in burnished nostalgia. The E Street Band and The Ghost of Tom Joad alike are rooted in the music that flourished in the US when Springsteen was about 12 years old: the former an amplification of pre-Beatles American pop – both the echoing drama of Phil Spector and the blare and honk of Dion and the Belmonts – the latter a take on the early 60s folk revival, with particular reference to Bob Dylan in young, keeper-of-the-Woody-Guthrie-flame mode. Western Stars simply shifts its backwards gaze on a few years, to the stuff that would have dominated mainstream taste during Springsteen’s late teens, at a time when it might have been hipper to dig Jefferson Airplane – but what budding young artist could fail to have his head turned by such consummate examples of the songwriter’s craft?Certainly, there’s a real and rather affecting love evident in the way Springsteen channels the sound on Western Stars. There are moments of transcendent loveliness – not least the shivering instrumental coda of Drive Fast – but he’s also unafraid of its occasional tendency towards schmaltz. Quite the opposite. Listening to There Goes My Miracle or Sundown, on which he slathers on the high-camp strings and transforms his voice into a croon, denuded of the usual Springsteen grit, you get the feeling he’s having a whale of a time: an artist always held up as the apotheosis of honest, blue-collar heartland rock revelling in artifice, in much the same way as he audibly delighted in telling audiences at his Broadway residency that the character of Bruce Springsteen was a Ziggy Stardust-ish construct who had never done anything. It helps that the songs are strong enough to withstand the treatment, seldom slipping into pastiche. The only real misfire is Sleepy Joe’s Café, which feels a little round-edged for its own good, not aided by an ingratiatingly perky accordion: the E Street Band could have turned it into something more driving and potent.“It’s the same sad story, going round and round,” Springsteen sings on The Wayfarer and listening to the rest of the album’s lyrics, you take his point. If the sound of Western Stars sets it apart from Springsteen’s earlier solo albums, the words pull it closer. Like Nebraska or The Ghost of Tom Joad, it offers a selection of bleak narratives and lingering pen-portraits, and, like Nebraska and The Ghost of Tom Joad, it seems a product of its era. The former album’s cast of conflicted cops and desperate criminals undercut the gung-ho triumphalism of Reagan’s America, while Tom Joad’s illegal immigrants and drug runners did the same for an era of record highs on the Dow Jones index. Western Stars, meanwhile, is populated by characters past their best – the title track’s fading actor, reduced to hawking Viagra on TV and retelling his stories for anyone who’ll buy him a drink Drive Fast’s injured stuntman recalling his youthful recklessness, the failed songwriter of Somewhere North of Nashville and the guy glumly surveying the boarded-up site of an old tryst on Moonlight Motel – all of them ruminating on how things have changed, not just for the worse, but in ways none of them anticipated.It adds up to an album that manages to be both unexpected and of a piece with its author’s back catalogue. Normal service may well be resumed in due course, but Western Stars is powerful enough to make you wish Bruce Springsteen would take more stylistic detours in the future.• Western Stars is released on 14 June.Bill Callahan: What Comes After CertaintyThe closer and standout from Callahan’s Shepherd in a Sheepskin Vest, a song that feels like an intimate, slightly rambling late-night conversation."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f02a5e7ab9d334db1c87dcce1c32ac2aadc75452/0_314_580_348/master/580.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2be06ce000280ee98e7d7ed6eee22660","title":"madonna harvey weinstein","story":"Singer recalls mogul being ‘incredibly sexually flirtatious’ when they worked together for 1991 documentaryMadonna has said that the disgraced film mogul Harvey Weinstein “crossed lines and boundaries” when they worked together on her 1991 tour documentary Madonna: Truth or Dare, which was distributed by Weinstein’s former company, Miramax.In an interview with the New York Times, the singer described Weinstein as “incredibly sexually flirtatious and forward with me when we were working together. He was married at the time, and I certainly wasn’t interested.”She said she was aware he had acted similarly with her female peers. “We were all, ‘Harvey gets to do that because he’s got so much power and he’s so successful and his movies do so well and everybody wants to work with him, so you have to put up with it.’ So that was it.”When allegations that Weinstein had raped and assaulted women were reported in October 2017, Madonna said she wasn’t “cheering from the rafters because I’m never going to cheer for someone’s demise. I don’t think that’s good karma. But it was good that somebody who had been abusing his power for so many years was called out and held accountable.”In the interview, Madonna also denied the rumour that she had once asked Donald Trump on a date. She recalled that while she shot a Versace campaign with Steven Meisel at the photographer’s Palm Beach home, Trump repeatedly called to talk to her. “He kept going: ‘Hey, is everything OK? Finding yourself comfortable? Are the beds comfortable? Is everything good? Are you happy?’”She said Trump had a weak character: “A man who is secure with himself, a human who is secure with themselves, doesn’t have to go around bullying people all the time,” she said.Madonna releases Madame X, her 14th studio album, on 14 June."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ace827823da61c96ca61870b635f98b24878b76/0_203_2997_1798/master/2997.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7463a82175d32e112443e075a757a2d9","title":"china other tiananmens podcast","story":"Hundreds of Chinese cities were involved in the student-led demos in 1989. ’s Lily Kuo discusses the uprisings outside of Beijing.

A key reason why people move around for work is the lure of a bigger salary. But increasingly those pay gains are being swallowed up by high housing costs.”Hannah Wilde, 30, from Sunderland, said she scrapped a plan to move to London to pursue a career in publishing when she looked at rents in the capital.“Some rooms in London were the same price as my full monthly wage from my first job in digital marketing in Sunderland,” she said. “Initially I was frustrated because I felt like I was missing out on some fantastic opportunities in the bigger cities due to rising rent. However, I have had some brilliant opportunities with companies in the north-east and have just recently secured a social media manager role for a rapidly growing skincare company in Durham.”Milo, 25, a video producer from Totnes in Devon, said he decided to move to London anyway, but recognises the financial risks.“The big cities don’t give you that safety net,” he said. “If you’re short on rent it’s by quite a lot. A hard living forces you to be vigilant and consistently reassess your place there so you’d better be making the most of it.”The phenomenon is not just affecting the young. Someone working in a school in Cornwall, for example, would be considerably poorer moving to a similar job in Bristol.John Healey, the shadow housing secretary, seized on the findings, which  both Labour and Conservative administrations, as proof that Tory policies have “failed private renters”.He said Labour was “committed to giving renters the rights they deserve” on issues such as efficiency, design and safety, “including control on rents, indefinite tenancies and new legal minimum standards”. Landlords blamed the government for failing to sufficiently increase the supply of new homes. The Residential Landlords Association (RLA) also criticised measures which appear to be encouraging landlords to sell up, including reduction in mortgage interest relief for landlords and an increase in stamp duty.“The biggest threat to rent levels are the policies being pursued by the government which are choking off the supply of homes for private rent as demand is increasing,” said the RLA policy director, David Smith.

DERBY NEED 236 TO WIN.Lancashire 449 v Leicestershire 288 and 26-1Yorkshire lose an early wicket. Fraine caught by cook off Porter for a duck. And whatever Peter Moores said to Notts last night did the trick. 201-1.Batting? Piece of cake. We\u0027re taking an early lunch at Aigburth where something heavier than a light shower just emptied over the ground. 22 points for Somerset, four for Surrey who remain winless and can’t seem to coordinate their batting and bowling to function at the same time.! This feels like a crucial result, from memory Surrey’s win over Somerset at Guildford last year was the moment they became unstoppable. Pitter-patter off they go. To Guildford where Somerset have Won! That’s a finger-clicking marvellous performance from Somerset, Craig Overton removing the last two Surrey batsmen. Back to the top of the table you go! Give Alex Lees a glass of something sparkly, carrying his bat for 107 not out , leaving Derby 268 to win, incidentally the exact tally of their first-innings total. At Aigburth, Tom Bailey takes the ball for the first time. My dad just sent me an update from Guildford where he’s got there to see the eighth wicket fall! Say Hi if you see him, thick grey hair, skinny legs, a spartan picnic and a smile, probably heading to the beer tent right now. We are back out again at Aigburth. Apologies for the slow updates, technical problems(or my ineptitude with a tablet) to blame. Was Peter Siddle making a point? Let’s see when he gets the ball. Eventually out for 60, Essex 81 behind on first-innings, a fine fightback. Finbar Anslow who you might remember wrote in with the lyrics to his song Taunton Town, has sent the YouTube Link. Somerset fans, I think you’ll rather like it. The rain has stopped and a tractor sits on the pitch, impotent. Surrey and Australia are five and six down respectively. Two new batsmen at the crease at Guildford - but it is Patel and Jacks so it’s not all over:136 needed. The billowing covers suggest a 15 minute break here, round the country batting is tricky only at Guildford. For now. NOTTS in a parallel universe are 149 for one - Ben Duckett a merry 89 not out. ESSEX269-9 have reduced the deficit to less than 100.DURHAM have a lead of 252 with five wickets in hand. Surrey 122 for Five. Jack Brooks, oh headband warrior, oh ciderborg, 5-29.And the rain falls in Liverpool. AN ENORMOUS cloud is approaching from the Mersey. Horton has played and missed a few times but not much else to report. Windies! AUSTRALIA 40-4.

What was in front of us, and, indeed all around us swiftly became evident at dawn with what seemed like thousands of craft of all shapes and sizes heading towards the French coast Hello from Aigburth, where the sun is out and the players are pottering onto the pitch.Two quick question apropos of nothing :1 Why are balloons banned at Liverpool Lime St?2 Has any transport minister ever spent a few hours at Manchester Victoria ? The smell of diesel trains is eye -wateringly unpleasant.As I write this early on Thursday morning, the sun is shining in Manchester as it is in Normandy and it looks like we’ll get a full day’s play around the country – save a thunder storm or two stalking the unaware. What a thriller late yesterday afternoon at Lord’s, when Sussex managed to break through the Middlesex defences at the last – with Ollie Robinson returning his best bowling figures for the season with 7-48. And Glamorgan, gloriously bowling out Northants, to sit, for now, at the top of the Championship table, with their first innings victory since 2014. Round the country, we have five games still going. Intrigue at Guildford – have Somerset got the wherewithal, and the runs, to chisel away at the Surrey batting? Surrey, just two down, must have the upper hand – they need just another 168 to win. At Edgbaston where the Notts batting line up suffered a complete malfunction, they are doing rather better in the second innings. But Jeetan Patel stalks the day. At Aigburth, Leicestershire got so close to the follow on target, I’m not sure they have the strength to try and resist Lancashire again. Much depends on the tired legs of Onions, Bailey and Gleeson. Essex v Yorkshire seems to be drifting to a draw at Headingley, Durham v Derby is anyone’s guess as both sides have fragility built into their DNA. In the World Cup, Australia get off the sofa today in a big beasts clash with West Indies at Trent Bridge. Follow every over at the .

But Djokovic can breathe a little easier when he holds to 15 for 6-5.Beware a wounded Djokovic. He somehow gets his return back at 30-all and goes on to win the point, getting a chance to break back at the first opportunity. 30-40. Zverev’s shot loops way beyond the baseline and Djokovic has muscled his way back into this first set. It’s 5-5. And you wouldn’t bet against the world No 1 going for the jugular from here. The crowd sound slightly deflated they wanted the underdog to serve it out. Has he missed his chance?Given the amount Djokovic is already bouncing the ball before serving, he knows he’s in a real contest. Zverev is again probing, at 0-15, 15-30 and then 30-40. This is Zverev’s fourth break point Djokovic hasn’t had any. The pair embark on a tentative exchange, neither appear prepared to concede though neither appear ready to pull the trigger, and Djokovic eventually makes the error! There’s the first break of the quarter-final, and it’s no less than Zverev deserves. The German leads 5-4 and will serve for the first set!What of Djokovic and Zverev, you say? Zverev holds. 3-3. Djokovic enjoys his easiest hold. 4-3. Zverev holds. 4-4. Given the way Zverev is playing, he’ll be crushed if he doesn’t take this first set. You feel it’s far more important for him to win than Djokovic.Zverev had already lost 10 matches this year coming into Roland Garros and did not appear to be in the form to go deep in the tournament. But he’s oozing confidence here, with a comfortable hold for 3-3. Thiem meanwhile is running away with the first set against Khachanov. He’s serving for it at 5-2, leading 30-15. Thiem brings up two set points in style with a fizzing winner – he’s more than matching Khachanov’s feared forehand right now. The first set point comes and goes but Thiem somehow pings away another forehand winner – the apology suggests he didn’t quite mean it – but I’m sure he’s not too sorry he’s got the first set on the board, 6-2.Djokovic was 0-30 down in his first service game, 15-40 down in his second and he’s 0-30 down here. But again Zverev can’t seem to take advantage. A deft drop-shot from Djokovic and it’s 30-all. But look, it’s 30-40 when Zverev sets up the point and settles it with the smash. A third break point of the match for the challenger. He goes for the backhand winner and misses. Deuce. Djokovic is having to work so hard to win the points, he’s already grunting so loudly as he grinds his way through the longest rally of the match, more than 20 shots. Advantage Djokovic. Jeu Djokovic. 3-2.Thiem’s taking little time on Suzanne Lenglen. He’s broken Khachanov for 2-1 and is serving at 30-15, which three points later becomes game. The fourth seed has made an assured start to lead the 10th seed 3-1.Zverev has a spring in his step after unleashing a winner for 15-40, two break points. He’s clearly enjoying his status as the underdog there’s little pressure on him this afternoon. Despite his supreme talent he’s not expected to beat the 15-times slam champion in only his second major quarter-final. Under pressure from Djokovic, an attempted drop-shot from Zverev bounces before even reaching his own side of the net. 30-40. Zverev spots his chance down the line but it misses by a few grains of clay. The umpire, James Keothavong, is out of his chair to check – of course controversially there’s no Hawk-Eye at the French Open – and confirms the call. Deuce. And from there Djokovic does what Djokovic does, dismissing any danger to hold for 2-1.Djokovic is bounce, bounce, bouncing the ball so that can only mean one thing: mesdames et messieurs, play is under way and Monsieur Djokovic will serve first. A good hold for the world No 1 and 2016 champion from 0-30 down. He’s 30-0 behind on Zverev’s serve too, before scrambling to 30-all. But two zipping Zverev first serves and that’s the game. It’s 1-1. Khachanov meanwhile is taken to three deuces by Thiem but holds for 1-0.As for Thiem v Khachanov, Thiem is the best-placed player behind Djokovic and Rafa Nadal to win here. There’s so much to like about the Austrian, who reached the final last year having made the semis in 2016 and 2017, but it’s fair to say that Whoopi Goldberg isn’t one of his greatest fans. Thiem will need to be on his guard against Khachanov, the 23-year-old Russian, who can knock opponents’ heads off with his serve and forehand.Djokovic, who’s looking to complete his second Novak slam having also held all four majors in 2015-16, has been beating up his opponents so far, and hasn’t come close to losing a set. Zverev has encountered more resistance, and needed two five-setters to survive the first week, but the fifth seed did have a good win over the dangerous Fabio Fognini on Monday in the last 16. Of course Djokovic is the favourite for this quarter-final but Zverev could give him a match.I’m back. And here’s Alex Zverev, the 6ft 6in German doing his best not to hit his head as he weaves and winds his way through the corridors before being announced to the Philippe Chatrier crowd, moments before Novak Djokovic makes his entrance. After Wednesday’s washout they step on to a court bathed in brilliant sunshine. Meanwhile over on Suzanne Lenglen it’s Dominic Thiem v Karen Khachanov.I’m off to get some lunch before the men’s quarter-finals in 40 minutes or so. I’ll leave you with Kevin Mitchell’s report. See you in a bit ...“It’s been such an amazing tournament but I’m calling it now: Anisimova v Vondrousova in the final!” emails the not-very-patriotic Sam Rajasingham. “I know I should be cheering for Konta but gosh, these are two very poised tennis teenagers. So exciting.”Confirmation of tomorrow’s semi-final schedule:Djokovic or Zverev v Thiem or KhachanovThoughts: it’s good the women’s semi-finals are being played at the same, considering the quick turnaround before the final on Saturday. However it’s a shame they’re not getting their moment on Chatrier, which will host only the men’s matches.Anisimova now knows she’ll face Ashleigh Barty tomorrow. They’ll both be playing in their first grand slam semi-final, and Halep’s defeat means we’re guaranteed another first-time women’s major winner on Saturday. It’s been a while two whole slams since we’ve had one ... And you’d have to say Johanna Konta, who plays Marketa Vondrousova in the bottom half tomorrow, will never have a better chance to win one of the game’s biggest prizes. She’s the only semi-finalist to have reached the last four at a slam before.As for Barty, she recovered from the disappointment of being broken when she was serving for the match at 5-4, breaking Keys for 6-5 and holding to love to settle matters emphatically. “She’s been playing some amazing tennis, an amazing match today,” Barty says of Anisimova. “It’s an exciting match for both of us.” Whoever reaches the final it’ll be quite some story. The multi-talented Barty spent a couple of years playing cricket before returning to tennis in 2016.Anisimova speaks. She sounds so mature for a 17-year-old. Chris Evert likens the American to Maria Sharapova when she broke through at Wimbledon in 2004. “I’ve been working very hard but I never thought it would pay off like this,” Anisimova says. “This is more than I could ask for. This is one of the best matches I’ve ever played.”You’d think Anisimova’s racket would be feeling as if it weighs 100kg right now as she ponders the magnitude of reaching the French Open semi-finals, but the teenager shows the lightest of touches with a cute drop-shot to immediately put Halep on the back foot. At 30-all, Halep double faults! Match point. And Anisimova attacks the defending champion once again – sealing a sensational win with yet another backhand winner! Halep’s reign at Roland Garros is over.Halep holds for 4-4. That’s three consecutive games now. She’s doing a better job of moving the big-hitting Anisimova around and using the angles. Halep is probing again on Anisimova’s serve and has a break point for 5-4. But it’s not to be four games in a row. Anisimova frees herself from Halep’s grip and steadies herself for 5-4. Halep must hold serve to stay in this quarter-final.Let’s cross over to Suzanne Lenglen though, where Barty is close to quietly sealing a no-nonsense victory – as is the likeable Australian’s style. She leads 6-3, 5-3 – make that 5-4 as Keys holds to force Barty to serve this out. The nerves are jangling for Barty at 15-all when she throws in her first double fault of the day. But she settles them by prevailing in a game of cat and mouse for 30-all. Keys has Barty on the backfoot on the fifth point with a fizzing return, Barty stays in the point before eventually prodding long. 30-40, break point. And Keys breaks! They’re back on serve at 5-5.As Chris Evert, the seven-times French Open champion and the best clay-court player in the history of the women’s game, points out on Eurosport, it’s one thing forging a lead such as this against a player of Halep’s stature, but it’s quite another closing it out. Let’s see what Anisimova is made of. Halep holds and Anisimova is left shrugging her shoulders as Halep gets herself two break points at 15-40. A quick flick of the wrists from Anisimova and a wonderful angled backhand cross-court winner saves the first. Halep’s only two out of six on break points. But make that three out of seven. Halep strikes back. They’re back on serve, with Halep 6-2, 4-3 down but very much holding the momentum. Halep bludgeons a backhand winner – only her second of the day – to get to break point on Anisimova’s serve. That’ll have felt good. But advantage Halep becomes deuce. From there Anisimova should really get to her advantage but makes the error. The American lets out a high-pitched squeal in frustration finally we’re given a reminder that this player who’s bossing the defending champion is only 17 years of age. Again, advantage Halep turns into deuce. Then it’s Anisimova’s advantage she sends Halep one way and t’other, forward and back, and eventually Halep’s defence breaks down! Anisimova remains in the ascendancy, leading 6-2, 4-1. Meanwhile it’s all-square between Barty and Keys in the second, with Barty leading 6-3, 3-3.Apologies. Technical issues here. No such problems for Anisimova though, who has taken her seventh - yes, seventh - game in a row for 6-2, 3-0 after only 37 minutes. The Philippe Chatrier spectators are sitting in stunned silence. You wouldn’t blame Halep for doing so as well, but she finally rouses herself to hold and stop the rot for 3-1. Barty, having blown those two set points and another at her advantage, finally settles matters on her fourth. So it’s Barty and Anisimova currently on course to meet in the semi-finals.No such problems for Anisimova though, who’s decided she doesn’t really want to wait to serve out the first set against Halep. Instead she hurtles to 0-40 on Halep’s serve ... and takes the set on a draining third set point! Wow. What a statement from the 17-year-old, who’s showing her more esteemed opponent absolutely no respect.Over on Suzanne Lenglen, meanwhile, Barty is serving for the first set at 5-3 against Keys, who clunks a backhand into the net to give the Australian two set points at 40-15. A serve out wide from Barty ... she then sends Keys to the other side of the court ... but goes on to make the error. 40-30. On the second set point Barty balloons a backhand wide! She’s hit a third of her unforced errors in the past two points.A big game for Anisimova. Will she consolidate the break for 5-2, or will she let Halep back into the set? She looks set fair at 40-15 but Halep chips, chips, chips away for 40-30, deuce and then advantage ... before undoing her good work with a tight return. Deuce. Advantage Anisimova. Game Anisimova for 5-2, having survived the break point. The fearlessness of youth, eh?Anisimova’s backhand is a real weapon and it sets up the third point for her. 15-30. A first double fault from Halep and it’s 15-40. The first break points of the match. Halep lets out a huge UGGGGGH before unleashing a forehand down the line ... but it’s long! Anisimova, the world No 51, has the first break of the match against the defending champion! It’s 4-2.You have to admire Anisimova’s assured approach here you’d think she was older than her 17 years the way she’s dealing with the occasion. She’s conceded very few unforced errors so far – but then as I type that two on the spin allow Halep to hold. The commentator’s curser strikes early. But Anisimova regroups immediately, charging through her serve to 15. It’s 3-2 Anisimova and 3-2 Barty.There’s nothing giving on serve yet. Anisimova holds for 2-1, as does Barty. Meanwhile a French lesson from Owen Dakin: “Yesterday ‘il a plu’ or ‘il plut’. The imperfect ‘il pleuvait’ is used as in ‘it was raining when...’ or ‘as it was raining...’” Gah. Damn Google Translate. Maybe I’ll stick to Anglais from now on. Halep is looking to assert her authority from the start. The Romanian gets to deuce on Anisimova’s serve – she’s won 16 CONSECUTIVE return games coming into the match – but two slaps into the net mean the run will not be extended. Anisimova, by the way, is the first player born in the 2000s, male or female, to be playing in a slam quarter-final. The 17-year-old American’s also the youngest player in the women’s top 100. She’s chasing shadows as Halep holds serve for 1-1, which is also the score in Keys v Barty.It’s tough to know which match to focus on here. Halep is, of course, the defending champion and highest-profile player left in the women’s draw, while Keys v Barty could prove to be the better contest. It’s an intriguing match-up between last year’s semi-finalist who goes for all-out power and the popular Australian Barty, whose bag of tricks means she can mix the play up so well. I think I need four hands and 16 fingers to cover these quarter-finals.Here they come, Simona Halep and Amanda Anisimova on Philippe Chatrier, and Madison Keys and Ashleigh Barty on Suzanne Lenglen. The Parisian patrons don’t seem too impressed with the early start there’s only a smattering of spectators in the stands. There’s been a very brief rain shower but the forecast for the rest of the day is pretty good.While we wait for the players to step on to court:Kevin KRAWIETZ and Andreas MIES (GER) v Guido PELLA and Diego SCHWARTZMAN (ARG)Yesterday il pleuvait. Beaucoup. So today is a rollover of the four remaining quarter-finals: Simona Halep v Amanda Anisimova, Madison Keys v Ashleigh Barty, Novak Djokovic v Alex Zverev and Dominic Thiem v Karen Khachanov. The women’s semi-finals, including Johanna Konta’s match with Marketa Vondrousova, have been pushed back until tomorrow, when they’ll share a packed schedule with the men’s last four, including Rafa v Roger XXXIX.If the weather holds for the rest of the week, the woman emerging from the top half of the draw faces three matches in three days to win the title, which is perhaps not a significant disadvantage given they’re used to playing best-of-three-set matches in consecutive days on the WTA Tour. But on the men’s side it means three best-of-five matches in four days, which is not something that happens too often. Advantage Monsieur Nadal over Monsieur Djokovic? Peut-être.

You can preserve the original setting, as was successfully done at the Sam Wanamaker Playhouse in 2014. Alternatively you can update it, as Declan Donnellan does in this intermittently funny Russian-language version (with English surtitles) for Moscow Pushkin Theatre and Cheek By Jowl.Donnellan starts well by sending up internationalist theatrical chic: the actors somnolently drag chairs on stage and adopt archly stylised poses. There is even a videoed prologue spoken by a director with a Bertolt Brecht haircut who delivers much talk of a “concept”. Into this rarified world burst a couple of spectators, George and Nell, who’ve only come to the Barbican because they couldn’t get in to The Lion King. They not only thrust their nephew into the drama but constantly intervene: Nell wants a selfie with an actor she recognises from TV even though he proves to be a “cupcake”. It’s a nice idea but, even in a cut-down version running 100 minutes, it is hard to sustain.The play within the play loses much of its initial Euro-theatrical modishness and Rafe, rather than a surrogate Quixote burning for chivalric romance, simply becomes a bumptious amateur whose head is stuffed full of Shakespeare quotations. The best scenes are those involving George and Nell – excellently played by Alexander Feklistov and Agrippina Steklova – with the latter finally leading the ensemble in the kind of song and dance she came to see. In the inserted play there are also striking contributions from Anna Vardevanian as the fiercely fought-over heroine and from Anna Karmakova as the neglected wife of a drunken rocker. It is all very jolly but, good as it is to see the fashionable devices of today’s art-theatre being spoofed, my laughter was spasmodic rather than continuous."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/31591b7d76d77c642e96d9dc65aeeffb18379d11/0_129_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fd769f912636690af52413590a564c5d","title":"chinas huawei signs deal to develop 5g network in russia","story":"Huawei welcomes agreement in area ‘of strategic importance’ after meeting between Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin Huawei, the Chinese technology company considered a security threat by the US, has signed a deal with Russian telecoms company MTS to develop a 5G network in the country over the next year.The agreement was signed on the sidelines of a meeting between Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Russian president Vladimir Putin in Moscow.The deal will see “the development of 5G technologies and the pilot launch of fifth-generation networks in 2019-2020”, MTS said in a statement on Wednesday.Quoted in the statement, Huawei’s Guo Ping, one of the company’s chairmen on rotation, said he was “very happy” with the agreement “in an area of strategic importance like 5G”.At a Moscow meeting between Putin and Xi, the Chinese leader called his Russian counterpart his “close friend”, noting that they had met nearly 30 times over the past six years. The trip is Xi’s eighth to Russia since 2012.“We will strengthen our mutual support on key issues,” Xi said, sitting next to Putin in an ornate Kremlin hall.Moscow’s ties with the US have declined sharply over the Ukrainian crisis, the war in Syria and the allegations of Kremlin meddling in the US 2016 presidential elections, while China is engaged in a spiralling trade war with Washington.“Protectionism and unilateral approaches are on the rise, and a policy of force and hegemonism is increasingly taking hold,” Xi said.Huawei has been in turmoil since May, when the Trump administration banned US companies from selling high-tech equipment to Huawei over suspicions it was spying for Beijing.Experts say the US decision, which is to come into force within three months, threatens the survival of the company, which is highly dependent on US chips for its phones.Several companies have already distanced themselves from Huawei, including Google, whose Android system equips the vast majority of smartphones in the world.Huawei’s reported potential involvement in Britain’s 5G network has proved politically sensitive and Theresa May’s government insists no decision has been made on the issue.Agence France-Presse and Associated Press contributed to this report"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6ead18d1b23b6cdaa33f6731c0c417a8f0576552/539_452_3726_2236/master/3726.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=548aaa2cbb4ce837508d757542e646f5","title":"samsung galaxy s10 review the sweet spot","story":"Top-end smartphone balances a big screen with smaller body, good performance and triple cameraThe Galaxy S10 is Samsung’s middle-of-the-road top-end phone, featuring a large screen in a pretty compact body for those who don’t like the current breed of massive flagship superphones.The regular, non-plus versions of Samsung’s Galaxy S line have always been the sweet spot between size, price and performance. They offer big, beautiful screens in bodies that are practically tiny by today’s giant-phone standards.The Galaxy S10 isn’t all that small, of course, measuring 70.4mm wide and 149.9mm tall with a stunning 6.1in QHD+ AMOLED screen. It’s about the same size as Apple’s iPhone XS, and considerably smaller than the Galaxy S10+, Huawei P30 Pro and OnePlus 7 Pro. It’s also one of the lightest top-end smartphones on the market at just 157g: 18g lighter than the S10+ and a full 49g lighter than the OnePlus 7 Pro.Its size and weight make it one of easiest top-end phones to handle and pocket. Not once did the Galaxy S10 feel liable to being dropped, even when using it one-handed in packed trains.The design of the Galaxy S10 is attractive, particularly in its pearlescent white, but doesn’t rock the boat. The front is glass so is the back. They both curve at the edges to a thin polished metal band. The screen has a small circular cutout through which the selfie camera pokes.The display also hides Samsung’s ultrasonic fingerprint scanner for unlocking the phone with your thumb on the screen. Arguably the most unusual aspect of the Galaxy S10 is the existence of a headphone socket in the bottom – a rare sight for a top-end smartphone in 2019.The phone is water resistant to IP68 standards, or depths of up to 1.5 metres in fresh water for 30 minutes. Drop the S10 in the loo and you’ll be able to rinse it afterwards.The Galaxy S10 has the same processor, memory and storage as the larger Galaxy S10+ and therefore performs similarly. In this US this means Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 855 processor, but outside in the UK, Europe and many other regions it means Samsung’s own Exynos 9820, as tested here.Generally the S10 is as snappy as most of the competition, with no noticeable lag. It won’t match the very fastest phones, such as the OnePlus 7 Pro, but it keeps up with the competition and is a big leap over the two-year-old Galaxy S8.Battery life on the S10 was a disappointing 25 hours between charges. With the screen set to FHD+ and the always-on display (AOD) setting off, the phone would last from 7am on day one until 8am on day two, dying on the train into work. That was while browsing and using apps for five hours with plenty of push messages and emails, watching 60 minutes of offline video, shooting about five photos a day and listening to about five hours of Spotify using Bluetooth headphones.The Galaxy S10 runs Samsung’s new One UI version of Android 9 Pie.One UI is a big upgrade over previous versions of Samsung’s software, refocused around making phones with large screens more usable. While more beneficial for the larger Galaxy S10+, the S10 still benefits from generally having the top half of the phone for viewing information and the bottom half for touch-based interactions.That puts menus, buttons and other touch-interaction points in easier reach of your thumb. Others are doing similar with Android, including Google, but Samsung is the most successful to date – something Apple and its back button in the top left of the screen should take note of.One weak point compared with competitors is Samsung’s gesture navigation system, which simply replaces the standard back, home and overview buttons with swipe pads that do the same thing in the same place on the screen. It’s less ergonomic and fluid than rival systems such as that used by OnePlus, Huawei or even Google’s upcoming Android Q.Samsung’s Bixby voice assistant is serviceable, but not as good as Google Assistant, often failing to understand what is said, so is safe to just avoid.The fingerprint reader is embedded under the screen, using ultrasound to read your ridges through the display. Most other in-display fingerprint readers are optical, which is less secure than ultrasonic sensors, but both can still be fooled like most biometric systems with the right equipment.Overall, the fingerprint scanner is more convenient built right into the screen, but isn’t as fast as traditional capacitive sensors or the fastest of new optical sensors such as that fitted to the OnePlus 7 Pro.The Galaxy S10’s triple rear camera is one of the better systems on the market and is the same as that fitted to the larger Galaxy S10+. It’s main 12-megapixel camera, 12-megapixel telephoto camera and a 16-megapixel ultrawide-angle camera work together for easy and flexible shooting modes zooming from 0.5 to 2x, and on to a 10x hybrid zoom.In good light the camera produces some really good photos, with great detail, colour and fast autofocus. In low light the S10 is solid but far behind the very best on the market, even with Samsung’s dedicated night mode.The ultrawide-angle camera is a lot of fun, as is the live focus mode, which records depth information so you can blur the background in portraits or perform colour isolation. You can also post shots straight to Instagram using a dedicated camera mode, while video capture is also excellent.Overall, the rear camera on the S10 matches rivals from Apple, but falls short of the best from Huawei. The S10 also has an excellent single selfie camera poking through the screen.The Samsung Galaxy S10 is an all-round great phone that thankfully keeps things at a manageable size. It still has a big, beautiful screen that’s great for watching videos, but it doesn’t make your hand hurt holding it.Performance is good, the camera’s good and the software is the start of a rethink of how we use big phones. The ultrasonic fingerprint scanner works well enough too and there’s even a headphone socket.My only real complaint is battery life is only just acceptable. You will have to charge the Galaxy S10 before a night out to make sure it will get you home, or at least activate some of the power saving modes.If you’re looking for a great phone that’s on the smaller side of the gigantic-phone revolution, there aren’t many better than the Galaxy S10.Pros: stunning screen, ultrasonic in-display fingerprint scanner, hole-punch notch, wireless charging and powershare, great camera, good performance, good software, good haptics, headphone socket, microSD card slot, dual-simCons: battery life could be better, relatively slow charging, low-light performance not as good as rivals This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

What are her options? I now have a Lenovo laptop which has Windows 10 installed, but to be honest with you, I preferred Windows 7, which was on my last two computers. What would you suggest? ElizabethAs most Windows 7 users know – and if they don’t yet, Microsoft will nag them about it soon – Windows 7’s support stops in January 2020. After that, there will be no more security updates, except for companies that pay an annual fee that doubles every year. This is a powerful incentive to migrate from Windows 7 to Windows 10.My best suggestion is just to get used to Windows 10. Some people cling to obsolete versions of Windows but eventually most of them recognise they would have been better off if they had moved earlier. New versions of Windows always provide more stability and better security, even if they get other things wrong. (Full screen apps in Windows 8 is a classic example but Microsoft fixed that in Windows 10.)I shared your love of Windows 7: I recommended people to move to it as soon as possible and stick with it for as long as possible. I kept it on my desktop PC, which doesn’t have a touchscreen, instead of moving to Windows 8. I changed my mind after using Windows 10 for some time, because it did more and worked better. That persuaded me to stick with the free upgrade.Try using Windows 10 for six months before having a play with an earlier version. Hindsight often makes the old stuff look clunky and out of date.Do you miss any features from Windows 7? Microsoft dumped several things in the transition via Windows 8. The main ones were the Windows Media Centre, the bundled games, the desktop gadgets and the built-in DVD compatibility. The separate Windows Live Essentials suite, including Windows Live Mail and Movie Maker, was terminated with extreme prejudice.Windows Media Centre was the home theatre software launched with XP and not many people used it. (It is not to be confused with the Windows Media Player, which continues.) The desktop gadgets introduced with Windows Vista also perished but most people only used the nice clock.For some Windows 7 users the games were the biggest loss. Happily, there are free clones of Solitaire, Spider Solitaire, Hearts, FreeCell (the best!) and Minesweeper. Microsoft also has some free but ad-supported versions in the Microsoft Store. Chess Titans, developed by the now-defunct Oberon Games, is harder to replace but Chess Giants (€9.90) is pitching for that market. Otherwise, Windows XP games run in Windows 10 and (so far) Windows updates do not remove them.Games, Live Mail and some other programs were casualties of Microsoft’s shift from traditional desktop programs (which use the Win32 applications programming interface) to packaged Microsoft Store apps (which use the new WinRT or Windows Runtime API). Store apps are easier to install, update and remove because they don’t use the Windows Registry. They are also touch-friendly, more secure, and can be suspended in the background to save resources.However, not all the old Win32 utilities are dead. Microsoft Paint and Internet Explorer still ship with Windows 10, despite being replaced by Paint 3D and Edge. The Control Panel lives on because not everything has been transferred to the Settings app. Windows Live Mail mostly works despite being replaced by the Mail app.If you desperately miss an old Windows 7 program, you may be able to get it back via Sergey Tkachenko’s Winaero Tweaker. This includes Windows Photo Viewer and old versions of Calculator, Sticky Notes and Task Manager.Users have always been able to change Windows’ appearance, and you can easily make Windows 10 look more like Windows 7. The simplest option is to change your current background wallpaper to whatever you used in Windows 7. The standard offering was a wavy Windows logo in the middle of a blue sky but you probably changed that to something prettier.Microsoft also changed the Taskbar. This used to be a semi-transparent blue with an orb at the left end and no search box. Windows 10 has a black Taskbar with a tiny white flag at the left end, plus a search box.You can make the search box disappear by right-clicking on the Taskbar, selecting Cortana and then Hidden on the drop-down menu. After that, if you click the white Windows icon and start typing something, the search box will reappear. Frankly, I think usability is improved by having a search box that you can see.You can change the colour of the Taskbar by right-clicking on the desktop and selecting Personalise. This brings up the Personalisation page in the Settings (cogwheel) app. Select Colors then scroll down to the More Options section. Tick the two boxes there to show accent colours on the Taskbar and in title bars and windows borders, then select a colour from the array provided. I think it’s worth ticking only the second box, to add an accent colour (eg navy blue) to title bars but the Taskbar looks better in black.The Settings app also has separate pages for the Start menu and Taskbar. Use these to choose which programs to show.Some people seem desperate to get their Windows 7 Start menu back, or an earlier “classic” menu, though I don’t understand why. Today, all your most used programs should be on the Taskbar, where you can run them with one click, or by hitting WinKey-6 or whatever (that will run whichever program is sixth in line). You can run less-used programs by double-clicking their desktop icons, or by clicking the Start menu and then the program’s Live Tile. That’s still only two clicks.Live Tiles are big, so they are easy to hit, even with a blunt finger. You can make them bigger or smaller, position them in groups and remove all the ones you don’t want. (Right-click, select “Unpin from Start”.) There’s no rational reason for wanting to scroll through extended menus of tiny text. You should switch to Windows 10’s simpler, faster approach.However, menu masochists will be pleased to learn that the two most popular Start menu replacements from the Windows 8 era are still available. Classic Shell is no longer being developed but you can still download it from the original site. Alternatively, try the Open Shell version that is being developed by volunteers. Meanwhile, Stardock has developed Start8 into Start10, which costs $4.99 after a free trial period.Classic Shell takes over the otherwise useful right-click on the Start menu to access its settings. For a fuller Windows 7 effect, use these settings to change the white icon to an orb and change the Skin entry from  to Windows Aero.You may be happier if Windows 10 looks and works more like Windows 7 but don’t go mad and start crippling its functionality. It’s foolish to remove the Notifications panel, rather than just using the Settings to remove any links you don’t need. It’s even more foolish to use Internet Explorer today unless a website won’t work in anything else. It’s a waste of time to remove apps you don’t think you want because it won’t save any space or increase performance. You can hide or remove their icons and forget about them but you’ll still be able to run them from the search box if you need them. In particular, don’t mess with the Microsoft Store.Windows 10 runs an SIHClient – for Server-Initiated Healing – which tries to repair any damage to the operating system. I sometimes wonder if it spends more time protecting the OS from users than from external threats. Unless your name is Mark Russinovich, the less you mess around with Windows 10’s internals, the better it will work.Have you got a question?

We’d like your help in documenting their recoveryEngland and Wales have about 140,000 miles of footpaths, but it is estimated more than 10,000 have been lost from current maps. Volunteers have been working tirelessly to rediscover them and put in legal applications for the recovery of lost paths before a government deadline in 2026 after which claims will no longer be accepted.If you have already found a lost footpath, how did you find and identify it? If you put in an application for a path to be recovered we’d also like to hear about it.Below are some tips on how to rediscover a lost footpath:1. The first port of call is the Ramblers, whose website gives clear advice on how to identify a lost path and make an application. The method involves comparing new and old maps, plus examination of historical sources. Walking and exploration is involved, but don’t forget that a lost path has to be proven before you can use it, otherwise you are trespassing.2. It is also important to be sure you are not replicating work already underway. This government website can give you information on current applications.3. You may also know of paths that are used regularly, but are not on the definitive map (you can ask your local council to see that map). Any footpath walked by the public for 20 years without any attempt by the landowner to prevent access can be made a right of way. Check your local walking groups for people actively walking along unmapped routes to help establish this right.You can share your tips and stories with us in the encrypted form below.

Young men’s faces set in a mixture of determination and trepidation. The beach before them a morass of tank traps and barbed wire. “As our boat touched sand and the ramp went down, I became a visitor to hell,” US private Harry Parley later recalled.The horror and the heroism of the D-day landings came home to me once more as I watched a film at the Musée du Débarquement (D-Day Landings Museum) in Arromanches-les-Bains. Seventy-five years ago, on 6 June 1944, this small town was at the western end of Gold Beach – code name for one of the five stretches of the Normandy coast chosen for the allied invasion of German-occupied France.The museum’s panoramic windows look out over a wide strand where the vestiges of those landings are still clearly visible: mighty fragments of the portable Mulberry harbours – shipped across the Channel in sections to form a huge makeshift port – still resist the waves out at sea, or sprawl on the sand like mighty beached whales.In stark contrast to the hardships faced by the troops in 1944, I stayed in comfortable hotels, with my luggage transported ahead. So I was unencumbered as I explored Normandy’s Calvados départment on an electric bicycle that was something of an indulgence – the flat terrain here is hardly taxing.I bowled along quiet country lanes, riverbank paths, rutted farm tracks and the occasional outbreak of cobbles. Indeed, I often found myself turning my electrical helpmeet off so that I could slow down and savour the little stone villages, blossoming apple orchards and seemingly endless fields of deep green flax and bright yellow rapeseed that gave the scenery the look of a vast inland sea.The first of my self-guided tours took me on a 12-mile loop from the village of Crépon (a church, a bar-tabac, a bespoke umbrella factory) to Courseulles-sur-Mer on Juno and Ver-sur-Mer on Gold Beach, where David Williams-Ellis D-day sculpture, the centrepiece for the new British Normandy Memorial, was unveiled on the 6 June, the 75th anniversary of the landings.It was at the former that I first encountered what would soon become a familiar sight: banners attached to the lampposts, each bearing a photograph of an allied soldier, sailor or airman, with his name and the words “WWII Heroes”. These served as a constant reminder that the largest amphibious landing in history was composed of hundreds of thousands of personal stories, many of which ended in tragedy.One soldier who survived to tell the tale was Canadian sergeant Garth Webb, who co-founded the Juno Beach Centre museum with two fellow veterans to mark the contribution made by his fellow countrymen. It’s a worthy tribute to the 14,000 Canadians who fought in the Battle of Normandy, 359 of whom perished on D-day itself. “Every single man under Webb’s command had been killed in the first hour,” my guide, Louis, told me.Rather than give a blow-by-blow account of the landings, the museum attempts to explain the reasons why Canadians volunteered to fight here, with combatants telling their own stories to camera. To remind visitors just how young they all were, the museum deliberately employs youthful Canadians as guides. A new exhibition also tells a largely unheard story: that of women whose active service contributed to the allied victory.“It’s also the only museum to offer tours of bunkers,” Louis informed me proudly. Dug out by volunteers from the sand that had engulfed them for decades, the two bunkers he took me into had been built in 1941 and 1944 and demonstrated how the course of the war had changed between those years. The first is a comparatively flimsy affair, thrown up by a conquering German army with little to fear. The later bunker has concrete walls two metres thick and openings at the sides from which guns could strafe the beach.My hotel in the village of Crépon was a fortification from a far more distant era. La Ferme de la Rançonnière is a 13th-century semi-fortified farm rebuilt in the 17th century and reputedly equipped with a tunnel connecting it with the Château de Creully two miles away. It offers guests a welcome tot of calvados, the cockle-warming apple brandy. It’s one of a trio of local apple-based alcoholic drinks (there are no vineyards hereabouts) and takes its name from the départment. The others are pommeau – partly fermented farm-produced apple juice mixed with calvados, which has a reputation for undoing the unwary – and cidre in many forms.Each night, with a clear-ish head, I studied the copious trip notes supplied by tour operator Inntravel. These included instructions for marking up the next day’s trails on the map provided. Much of the time I was following véloroutes, the well-signposted cycleways that crisscross France. There were also detailed instructions of the “take the first left after the red barn” variety. You would really have to make an effort to go wrong: I only managed it once when, with my boundless capacity for self-sabotage, I heeded neither map nor instructions.I did make it without mishap to Arromanches-les-Bains, where I slipped into the Arromanches 360 Circular Cinema to watch the film, Normandy’s 100 Days. Projected on to a 360-degree screen, the film uses actual footage from the campaign. With half a dozen clips all playing at once around me, and a soundtrack of battle noise that I felt in my stomach as much as my ears, it induced a powerful sense of disorientation. I could only guess what it must have felt like for those who were there. It was impossible not to feel both awed by their courage and audacity, and also aghast at the sheer insanity of war.The following day, at the small harbour town of Port-en-Bessin, I climbed the hillside to watch the revolving bridge below me swing open, admitting a string of little trawlers into port, their catch soon to be sold at the market on the pier. On the summit of the hill above me, one Captain Terry Cousins gave his life leading a final, desperate but ultimately successful assault on what had seemed an impregnable German position. The taking of Port-en-Bessin meant that Operation Pluto (Pipe Lines Under the Ocean) could make landfall, supplying the allies with much-needed fuel.From there it is just a few miles to the low dunes on Omaha Beach. Swallows darted about the waves as I gazed out to sea, while a lone wheatear, tail bobbing furiously, hunted for lunch in the sand at my feet.Omaha was taken by the Americans, and it was with a brine-laden breeze filling my lungs that I pedalled to the immaculately maintained Normandy American Cemetery in Colleville-sur-Mer. Herds of schoolchildren crowded into a gargantuan memorial to inspect enormous murals showing how the beach-head was established and how its creation would eventually lead to VE Day.Part of the price for that victory lay behind them: the graves of 9,388 soldiers, their identical white crosses standing stiffly in ranks of military straightness above the five miles of beach where many of them had fallen.Two days after D-day, Bayeux, which had been largely spared by the war, became the first town in France to be liberated. I enjoyed a leisurely stroll around its cornucopia of medieval buildings, including the magnificent cathedral. My hotel, the Lion d’Or, an 18th-century coaching house, was relatively modern in comparison. It also served up an unusual dessert for a region so obsessed with la pomme – a carrot mousse cake confection with orange chantilly cream and tarragon ice-cream that sent my dining companion into raptures. I discovered that the hotel had played its own part in the war – Generals Montgomery, Eisenhower and de Gaulle had all slept here.But, of course, Bayeux is best known for its tapestry (or, more correctly, embroidery). The cloth tells the story of another successful invasion – that of England in 1066. I confess I hadn’t expected to be quite so bowled over by seeing it in the flesh (or rather the flax) but it was a remarkable experience.The details are extraordinary – right down to the mace flourished in battle by Bishop Odo (soon to become the Earl of Kent), William the Conqueror’s half-brother. According to the excellent audioguide, he had chosen this club-like weapon to finesse one of the stickier points of medieval theology: “A prelate wasn’t allowed to draw blood but he could knock people out.”• The trip was provided by Inntravel, whose self-guided Bayeux \u0026amp Beaches of Normandy tour includes six nights’ B\u0026ampB, four dinners, cycle hire, maps and luggage transfer and costs from £945pp excluding transport (or from £1,175pp with train travel from London to Bayeux from £1,020pp self-drive, including Dover-Calais ferry electric bike £80 extra).

Leave the car at the first (free) car park on the AS261 (near the N625 junction) and take your bike anti-clockwise right around the park. The scenery is breathtaking, initially following the Ponga river, and passing through villages as you climb up to get a better view of the mountains. We had a delicious Asturian lunch at Fonda Ponga (no website) near San Juan de Beleño, where we could prop our bikes by picnic benches. Don’t eat too much as the biggest climb is still to come and the most dramatic views. Then it’s downhill all the way. Rejoin the N625 at San Ignacio for a quick spin back to the car.

Setting off north-west along the well-signposted route, you’ll want to stop after only 4km to visit Chassepierre, one of the “most beautiful Wallonian villages”. Then ride on through the quiet valley to explore the medieval town of Bouillon with its fortified castle. • walloniabelgiumtourismF ChaillierThe Lac d’Hourtin-Carcans area is full of cycle routes through pristine sand dunes covered in pine forests. There are many places to stay in the area that have direct access to the routes, but my favourite is Camping de la Dune Bleue (from €14 a night) in the forest with access to the lake. My favourite route is to Lacanau-Océan further down the coast, as you can take a circular route and rarely encounter any roads or any other people apart from cyclists. Stay at the campsite, leave your car in the car park and cycle everywhere. Awesome!SallyLast stop before the Swiss border in Lombardy is this valley where a family-friendly cycle route follows the river Adda for 114km from the mountain town of Bormio to Lake Como. Weaving through meadows, villages, vines and orchards, almost the entire route is traffic free. It’s clearly waymarked, the map is detailed and one-way bike hire works well with seven rental points. We took the train to Tirano, hired bikes and cycled gently downhill to Colico, a full day’s pedalling. As well as regular picnic spots, there are plenty of dining and sleeping options en route - our favourite was La Fiorida agriturismo (doubles from €102 B\u0026ampB) with a fab farm shop and an air of rustic luxury.• sentiero.valtellina.itMarthaThe Bay of Kotor is a huge fjord-like inlet on the coast of Montenegro. Cruising the road that hugs the shoreline by bike is a perfect way to see it from all angles. This is definitely a route for leisurely cycling: you’ll pass plenty of tempting waterside bars and cafes, and perfect spots for a dip in the clear blue water. The route is around 26 miles including a short ferry crossing at the narrowest part of the bay. There are plenty of places to hire bikes in Kotor town. HeatherMallorca is renowned for its beautiful mountains and beaches, but the Via Verde is a gorgeous cycle ride: 30km of railway converted to a rural path through the island’s flatter eastern side. Ramshackle windmills, the Llevante hills, fields of oranges and olives, and ancient castles. The smells alone will inspire you. Conclude the ride in Artà and delight in a late paella lunch at unpretentious Bar S’Estacio, or ice-cold sangria and tapas at La Casita Arta. Windswept Cala Mesquida close by is exquisite.• theothermallorcaAntony TFor an exhilarating downhill ride with breathtaking scenery, this sublime 80km mountain-to-fjords road route runs alongside the Bergensbanen and Flåmsbanen railway lines, so is easily accessible by train from Bergen or Oslo. One day adventurers alight at Finse, Norway’s highest railway station, at 1222 metres, and hire a bike from a shop right on the platform (finse1222.co.no, £68 a day). From the stunning Hallingskarvet mountain backdrop to the picturesque Aurlandsfjord, navigating steep hairpin bends to freewheeling past traditional farms, this 57km descent to Flåm does not disappoint. For refreshment try rallarvafler (waffles) from the Fagernut railway cottage and refill your bottle in a pristine stream.Su OinnCycle route 46 on the 200km Tour du Leman (around Lake Geneva, straddling France and Switzerland) is great for families: mostly along flat, quiet country roads and agricultural paved paths, with great views of the Alps and Jura mountains. It can be adapted for all levels of ability: you can climb higher on some stretches, or take the frequent train and ferry services between, say, Geneva, Lausanne and the delightful spa town of Evian, to complete shorter legs. Flower-bedecked towns and villages to visit along the way include Yvoires and Montreux. Cycling clockwise will keep you closest to the lake. • lake-geneva-switzerlandClareThe Inn cycle path follows the River Inn for over 500km from its source above St- Moritz in Switzerland all the way to Germany where it meets the Danube. We hired from Crazy Bikez in Innsbruck and spent five days cycling the path’s Austrian section, which was well-signed, predominantly traffic-free, and though the vistas were massive snow-capped peaks, the ride itself was free of any great ascents. The trip took us past medieval castles and fortresses, churches and monasteries. While in Tyrol make sure you visit one or two of their schnapps distilleries. • tyrolTimLooking for a holiday with a difference?

Here’s its 23 episodes so far, from worst to bestAn hour of television so relentlessly dour that it leaves nothing for anyone to cling to. Andrea Riseborough plays a surly murderer forced to cover her tracks as she goes on another surly murder spree. The scene where she murders a blind baby with a hammer that’s still dripping with gore from his father’s skull remains the epitome of Black Mirror’s off-putting tendency to be nasty for the sake of it.A compilation of half-thought-out, sub-Saw morality tales that tread so much worn ground (a woman’s consciousness is transferred into an abandoned toy, a murderer is turned into a hologram that can be repeatedly electrocuted) that it teeters on the edge of self-parody. Plus, and this is rare for Black Mirror, it’s so pleased with itself that you just want to punch it.The end of this episode – in which hackers blackmail a boy for masturbating to porn – is the television equivalent of being beaten over the head with an especially stupid rock. The boy murders a man. The hackers release the masturbation footage anyway. There’s a montage of people crying and screaming to Radiohead’s most overblown song, and then it turns out that the boy was watching child porn all along. A conveyor belt of Charlie Brooker’s worst excesses, this is an episode that feels as if it was made by a broken Black Mirror algorithm.Miley Cyrus plays Britney Spears, had Britney inexplicably decided to download her entire personality into a Furby. It’s hard to see what the message of this episode is – Fame is hard? Managers are evil? Pop music is bad? – and even harder to care.Black Museum, but festive. Every idea here – what if you could download someone’s personality into a thing? What if you could block someone, but with your brain? – appears in other Black Mirror episodes in a more satisfying form.Points scored for preempting the rise in populist non-politicians – here, a wiseacre cartoon bear becomes an unlikely political figurehead – but points lost for execution. Especially the climax, where the man who controlled the bear suddenly finds himself homeless and truncheoned in a dystopian police state, which is a little bit of a leap.A soldier stalks the earth, murdering a number of grotesque mutant monsters. But wait, what if those monsters were just normal people disguised by an augmented reality chip in the soldier’s head? Bet you didn’t see that coming, did you? Except you did, right from the very first frame.Black Mirror isn’t exactly a series that shies away from a heavy-handed metaphor, but the climax of this Jodie Foster-directed story – where a girl literally beats her mother to death with an iPad – is so hilariously on the nose that it has to be self-satire. Because, if it isn’t, hoo boy.Black Mirror is often written off as: “What if phones, but too much?” However, in Smithereens, Andrew Scott updates this to: “What if acting, but too much?” There are moments of scenery chewing in Smithereens that would put locust plagues to shame, but underneath that is a very simple and fairly effective hostage thriller that works right up until you realise that its larger message is literally just: “Wow, people look at their phones a lot.”Another episode about an augmented reality chip, although this fares much better than Men Against Fire because it forgoes any Important Message About the World in favour of flat-out genre silliness. This is a horror story, plain and simple, and Brooker clearly has fun splashing around with all its campy conventions.Your tolerance for White Bear will largely depend on your tolerance for unexplained screaming, because that’s what most of this episode consists of. There is crying, and then there’s screaming and then there’s more crying. The late-stage twist – our protagonist is a murderer who had her memory wiped so that the public can punish her anew every day – is just about clever enough to justify all the preceding noise.In a dystopian future, the only way out of poverty is to debase yourself on television. The protagonist, when given his shot on TV, breaks down and embarks on a Howard Beale rant about how vapid and awful television is. The rant connects with audiences, and he’s rewarded with a sanitised television show of his own. Brooker and his co-writer wife Konnie Huq call this ‘The Screenwipe story’, for good reason.Black Mirror’s first feature-length episode is about a swarm of robot bees that murder people who unknowingly use certain hashtags. However, hokey premise aside, this is a smart and well-executed police procedural that is much more gripping than you’d expect.The robot dog one. Shot in black and white and just 41 minutes long, Metalhead is a model of gleaming propulsion. All you need to know – and all you’re told – is that the dogs are out to kill the humans. The rest of the episode is taut and dread-filled and benefits hugely from any lack of real explanation. Metalhead is the Terminator version of White Bear, and all the better for it.The episode that started it all is still a very good beginner’s guide to Black Mirror. There’s an outlandish premise (the prime minster must have sex with a pig on TV) with an overcooked message (it’s a stunt masterminded to draw attention to society’s obsession with the media) that has moments of true transcendence (the waves of glee and horror and pity that pass through the audience in real time). A high watermark.Easily the best of the newest Black Mirror batch, Striking Vipers uses its cast of Marvel stars to tell a sweetly unexpected story. Two old friends discover that a VR videogame allows them to explore their feelings for one another in a new and interesting way. Despite its tendency to go dark, Black Mirror’s best episodes have a core of pure humanity. This is one of the most human stories yet.And this is another. At its worst (see the ending of The Waldo Moment), Black Mirror suffers from a berserk desire for catastrophe. Here, though, the opposite is true. We’re introduced to a hellish dating app, which tells the daters exactly how long their relationship will last as soon as they meet. Our heroes try to escape their fate, but find themselves trapped in a miserable labyrinth of stern authoritarianism. Then, just when all hope is lost, the episode pulls out and reveals that rarest of things: a happy Black Mirror ending. Wonders may never cease.Black Mirror’s fourth season introduced itself in a Technicolor blast a big-budget, all-star reimagining of Star Trek that quickly descends into a very necessary deconstruction of toxic fandom. It’s not only one of the best arguments for Black Mirror upping and leaving for Netflix – honestly, try to imagine this on a Channel 4 budget – but one of the best episodes altogether. It’s gripping and timely, but it’s also very funny and doesn’t end on an abject bummer. Amazing.Written by Peep Show’s Jesse Armstrong, this is possibly the most agonising Black Mirror yet. Set in a world where everyone is basically fitted with a cerebral dashcam, it revolves around a single suspicion of infidelity that balloons into all-consuming terror. By the conclusion, when years of secrets and betrayals have been permanently smashed to pieces in unsparing detail, you feel as if you’ve been beaten to a pulp.Even if you hated this episode – I didn’t, but others did – you cannot fault its ambition. A Choose Your Own Adventure-style interactive story about the creation of a video game, the simple existence of Bandersnatch is the result of herculean toil from a team as big as an army. Credit must go to Brooker for deploying it with such verve, too. Not many writers could get away with debuting a new type of storytelling by direct critiquing its limitations as brazenly as he did. The moment where “Netflix” appears as an interactive option, for example, is just sublime.Everyone loves San Junipero. It’s won Baftas and Emmys and GLAAD awards, and appeared at the top of several lists like this. And for good reason, too. It’s absolutely beautiful. It’s futuristic and nostalgic. It’s bleak and hopeful. It features characters who aren’t just empty cyphers for techno-misery. San Junipero was arguably the episode that pushed Black Mirror over the top for many viewers. It’s a triumph.However, I still prefer Nosee. A critique of Uber-style ratings, where your socioeconomic status hangs upon the scores you receive from other people, Nosee plays out like an episode of Fawlty Towers. Bryce Dallas Howard’s transformation from careful perfectionist to furious prisoner is beautifully weighted. Even better, since it was co-written by Mike Schur, it’s hard not to retrospectively see this as a direct precursor to The Good Place.But then there’s Be Right Back. A near-perfect demonstration of all that Black Mirror can be, Be Right Back transcends its slightly overused premise – let’s put someone’s personality into a thing – to create something that’s tender and funny and intimate and sad. Hayley Atwell and Domhnall Gleeson are perfect as two lovers separated by death. This was the first time that Black Mirror proved it could be something other than unstoppably harrowing, and it has yet to be bettered."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7eac5a984e00881f3f81a5b39750bf93cf02eab0/0_330_4951_2971/master/4951.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=22cc8c4c4603bab2f8da4d4493dc25f1","title":"washington urges riyadh to end military crackdown in sudan","story":"Washington takes unusual step of calling on kingdom to bring about end to military crackdownThe thorny question of Saudi Arabian political influence across the Middle East and Africa is back in the spotlight again with Washington taking the unusual step of effectively telling Riyadh to end Sudan’s military crackdown.In an unusual public statement the US state department revealed that its undersecretary for political affairs, the diplomat David Hale, had phoned the Saudi deputy defence minister, Khaled bin Salman, to ask him to use the country’s influence to end the brutal repression against peaceful protesters by the Sudanese Transitional Military Council (TMC) in Sudan.It has hardly been a secret that Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have gained influence in Sudan following the overthrow of the dictator Omar al-Bashir in April. Critics of Saudi Arabia will see a pattern of behaviour, evident in Libya and Yemen, in which Saudi Arabia moves to marginalise rivals Iran and Qatar, as well as to install autocratic regimes built on repression.But it is rare for the Americans, normally so close to Saudi Arabia on regional issues, to make so public their representations to Riyadh on the need for civilian rule and for democracy to run its course.Saudi Arabia may claim the Sudanese crackdown was an independent judgment by the interim leader, Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, but the army general has in recent weeks paid visits to Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Egypt.More importantly the deputy president of the council, Mohamed Hamdan Dagolo, the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) militia leader known as Hemedti, met the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, in Jeddah on 24 May, and pledged to stand with the kingdom against all threats, including Iran. He vowed Sudanese troops would continue fighting alongside Saudi Arabia against the Houthi rebels in Yemen.Dagolo is widely seen as the true decision-maker in Khartoum, and the figure behind moves to stall negotiations about the transition to democracy and resist protesters’ demands that they be included in the transitional body.That Dagolo chose Riyadh for his first overseas trip since the fall of Bashir was hardly surprising. In April Saudi Arabia pledged to provide $3bn in funds to Khartoum, a move designed to stabilise the exchange rate and strengthen the military.Until recently there was no sign that the US disapproved of its great ally gaining influence in Sudan. The US made no complaint when, on 30 May, Sudanese security officers notified al-Jazeera’s office in Khartoum saying the military council had decided to withdraw the Qatari state-owned TV network’s work permits without providing an official reason. The shutdown came as the authorities began a clampdown against a protest camp in the capital.But the scale of the bloody assault on the Khartoum protesters this week led to a change in tone in Washington, and an irritation if not exasperation with Saudi foreign policy.The US national security adviser, John Bolton, tweeted: “The unprovoked violence of Sudan’s security forces against peaceful demonstrators in Khartoum is abhorrent. The TMC must respect the right to peaceful demonstration and speed transition to a civilian-led government, which the Sudanese people have rightfully demanded.” The tweet was followed by the publicised call between Hale and bin Salman.Yet the involvement of Saudi and the UAE, the leading Sunni “counter revolutionary” states, is part of a wider pattern of jostling for influence across the mainly Muslim Horn of Africa. Between 2000 and 2017, Gulf states invested $13bn in the region, mainly in Sudan and Ethiopia, according to a study by the Clingendael Institute, a thinktank in the Netherlands.Broadly, on one side lies Qatar and Turkey, and on the other the counter-revolutionary states opposed to Islamism. At stake is the capture of strategic ports, improved maritime security, and privileged access to the rapidly emerging economies.Saudi has been particularly active across the Horn of Africa and instrumental last autumn in negotiating a peace treaty between Ethiopia and Eritrea. Abiy Ahmed, Ethiopia’s prime minister, was given $3bn in aid and investments from the UAE upon taking office in April 2018, including a $1bn deposit in the country’s central bank. In Yemen again it is the UAE and Saudi Arabia that head a coalition that has led to a four-year civil war aimed at reinstalling Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, as leader. Hadi spends most of his time in Riyadh and is no poster boy for democracy but Saudi will not abandon the war, regardless of the casualties, because it regards Iranian-backed Houthis as a permanent security threat.Equally in Libya, where a bloody military stalemate persists in Tripoli, Marshall Khalifa Haftar by most accounts would not have tried to seize the capital in defiance of a UN peace plan without UAE military hardware, and Saudi political backing.The question now is whether in Sudan, unlike Libya and Yemen, the US government is prepared to do more than simply dial Riyadh once."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3bb3196fffb3a5abaea563be223329e92ba1c496/637_423_3309_1984/master/3309.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ab0fae64d0406cd48e14f6cac738af33","title":"aung san suu kyi finds common ground with viktor orban over islam","story":"On a rare trip to Europe, Myanmar leader and Hungary PM discuss issue of ‘growing Muslim populations’From her failure to speak out against ethnic cleansing to imprisoning journalists, the reputation of Aung San Suu Kyi in the west has taken a battering in recent months.But the leader of Myanmar has found a new ally in far-right, staunchly anti-immigrant Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orbán.In a rare trip to Europe, state counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi, the Nobel peace prize laureate who was once the figurehead of the fight for democracy in Myanmar, met Orbán in Budapest. There, the two leaders found common ground on the subject of immigration and Islam .“The two leaders highlighted that one of the greatest challenges at present for both countries and their respective regions – south-east Asia and Europe – is migration,” read a statement released after their meeting.“They noted that both regions have seen the emergence of the issue of co-existence with continuously growing Muslim populations.”Once lauded as the great democratic hope for Myanmar, Aung San Suu Kyi, who was elected as civilian leader in 2015 after living under house arrest by the military for 15 years, has proved a marked disappointment to most western governments who were her champions.Her failure to condemn the military’s violent crackdown on the Muslim Rohingya minority in 2017 – which saw thousands of Rohingya raped and killed in what the UN described as an exercise in ethnic cleansing – and her defence of the military’s brutal actions against Myanmar’s Muslims have proved particularly contentious.Aung San Suu Kyi’s government has since repeatedly failed to offer assurances to the million Rohingya now living in refugee camps in Bangladesh, where they fled over the border for safety, that if they return their security and pathway to citizenship would be guaranteed.Orban, meanwhile, has an equally bad track record. His government declared a “a crisis situation due to mass immigration” in 2015, stirring up fear in Hungary over an alleged threat of migrants. The Council of Europe’s commissioner for human rights released a recent report accusing Orbán’s government of using anti-migrant rhetoric that fuels “xenophobic attitudes, fear and hatred”.Aung San Suu Kyi has increasingly spoken out against the imposition of western ideas and principles in Myanmar, a view which was reflected by Orbán in the statement released after their meeting, where he emphasised his rejection of the “export of democracy” from other western countries.“Aung San Suu Kyi has fallen so astonishingly far from being the darling of the EU that she now counts a meeting with Orban, the pariah of Europe, as an important accomplishment,” said Phil Roberton, deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch. “After shamefully helping the Myanmar military cover up their genocide against Rohingya Muslims, now she’s glad-handing and making friends with Europe’s most xenophobic, anti-democratic leader.”Robertson added: “The message of this meeting to Brussels should be clear: Myanmar is not listening to your quiet diplomatic niceties.”A spokesperson for the Myanmar government could not be reached for comment.Aung San Suu Kyi’s trip to central Europe was with the aim to strengthen economic ties in the region. Prior to Hungary, she visted the Czech Republic where she met with Prime Minister Andrej Babiš."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c22121892f447a89a97fc8e37ae2e0524605a7aa/0_226_5007_3005/master/5007.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2a3d0cbf09de75abbd0e2ac0acdba09b","title":"germany food minister accused of promoting nestle pr on twitter","story":"Julia Klöckner video posted on ministry channels branded ‘PR event’ by criticsGermany’s minister for food and agriculture has been accused of allowing her office’s social media channels to be used as a springboard for a “PR event” for Nestlé.A video in which Julia Klöckner talks to the head of Nestlé Germany about her government’s “innovation and reduction strategy” and his company’s “philosophy” was sent out via the ministry for food and agriculture’s official Twitter channel earlier this week.In the video, Klöckner, a member of Angela Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union (CDU), thanks Marc-Aurel Boersch for his support for the government campaign, which she says translates into “less sugar, less fat” in products “that citizens enjoy”.The video was immediately picked up by Rezo, a German YouTuber who is fast gaining a reputation as the CDU’s nemesis on social media.“Fun fact”, tweeted the 26-year-old music producer, whose one-hour “demolition” of the conservative governing party’s policies has been viewed more than 14m times since it was uploaded on 18 May, “if I had posted the exact same tweet with such a video, I would have had to mark it as advertising”.The clip also drew criticism from opposition politicians. The leader of the German Green party’s parliamentary group, Katrin Göring-Eckardt, accused the minister of having produced an “ad” for the Swiss multinational food and drink company,which has in the past been accused of questionable business practices and complicity in environmental damage.Karl Lauterbach, a health policy specialist for the Social Democratic party, the CDU’s junior coalition partner, said the video was “embarrassing, bitter even”. “First Klöckner let lobbyists argue away the sugar tax and the food rating system, and then she participates in a Nestlé PR event,” the politician said.Klöckner dismissed her critics as “hate speakers” and told them to check their own party’s policies on sugar reduction. “First you complain that nothing is happening. Then you flip out when we achieve something,” she tweeted."},{"url":null,"title":"a baby born today the climate and their future","story":"Life-support systems that nature provides – an intertwined web that sustains humans, plants and animals – are at risk of unravelling in a matter of decades.Deforestation, intensive agriculture, overfishing, development and other human activities are breaking the bonds that combine to make a healthy planet. Their destruction, fuelled by rampant consumption and obsession with economic growth, is accelerating.“The evidence is crystal clear: nature is in trouble. Therefore we are in trouble,” declared Sandra Díaz, who co-chaired the completion of a global assessment of bioersity published this week.There is a dual threat to life on Earth: species loss and climate change. The Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Bioersity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) ranked the main factors causing species loss: changes in land and sea use exploitation of organisms climate change pollution and invasive alien species.These are “eroding the foundations of our economies, livelihoods, food security, health and quality of life worldwide”, and climate breakdown could soon become the main driver.Nature is being destroyed at such a rate that a million species are at risk. On the day the IPBES report made headlines, Dr Allan Mee of the Golden Eagle Trust checked for sightings of the Ring Ouzel in the MacGillycuddy’s Reeks in Co Kerry, one of just two of its remaining habitats in Ireland. “No birds located. Sad but likely witnessing local extinction of the species, once found in 28 Irish counties,” he tweeted. Pádraic Fogarty of the Irish Wildlife Trust replied: “This is mass extinction unfolding before our eyes.”How is the potentially lethal cocktail of bioersity loss and climate disruption going to impact on coming generations in contrasting parts of the globe? Equally, what does it mean for an animal that dominates the Irish landscape (the cow), and the majestic lion, not critically endangered yet rapidly disappearing?The baby born in IrelandConscious of what the next generation is facing, Australian Jim Scheer helped set up the FridaysForFuture climate action movement in Ireland, which is driven by young people. As for the babies of today, “their freedom is limited”, he believes. As a child, “the most I had to worry about was, ‘is there air in the tyres of my bike?’” he says.They are facing a whole different world of realities, a place where the First World problem of “where will I go on my holidays?” may be replaced by “where is my next meal coming from?”The issues weigh heavily on the current generation of young people, he believes, which is why “coming together to grieve” – a feature of recent protests – matters, and is part of telling the truth. There is much frustration too at the inaction of elders.“Uncertain” is the future of that child, says climate activist Dr Lorna Gold. Hope is emerging through the climate movement but, looking at the timelines required for transformational shift, there is “more and more uncertainty”.Children growing up in Ireland will be relatively protected, by location, wealth and assets they will have access to, “but even in the best-case scenario, it will be a diminished world.”This will be due to loss of species and a more complicated world, disrupted by climate and associated conflict, where Dr Gold fears the freedom to explore and travel in relative peace is undermined. It’s a place of learning from the internet rather than real life. The pluses will be better local connectedness with “their own earth” and nearby food production.That Irish child will never hear the corncrake or the curlew, says climatologist Prof John Sweeney, and, as they grow, they will be confronted with hard choices on lifestyle and mobility. The fossil fuel-driven car will be forced out by regulation, he says, but different ways of getting off the island, for example, will be needed if aviation does not overcome its emissions issues.By mid-century, most will live in green cities with an almost total absence of the private car. The transport revolution will be in urban areas but slower to come to the countryside until battery technology improves, Sweeney notes.A near zero-carbon world will mean less air pollution. Clean energy in their home and workplace will mainly come from offshore wind.A downside will be more extreme weather events attributable to climate change more intense storms and rainfall, increased flooding with sea level rises – and yet water shortages in summer.The child born today in Ireland – and the adult they become – will cope far better than their counterpart elsewhere.The developing world babyA baby born today in a developing country, on the other hand, will be at the frontline of climate disruption, says Christian Aid Ireland policy and advocacy adviser Jennifer Higgins. They will have to contend with stronger cyclones, warmer days and nights, more unpredictable rains and longer heatwaves.“Here in Ireland we will have the resources and ability to adapt and deal with these unprecedented weather events, but in many parts of the world, going to Tesco to stock up on sliced pan won’t be a possibility.”They will be the ones who will suffer the worst consequences of our inaction on climate change. “Sustained periods of unseasonably heavy rain can have a damaging impact on agriculture, causing the loss of topsoil and serious nutrient leaching,” says Higgins.In Ireland, save for the odd hosepipe ban, water is always on tap for domestic, industrial and agricultural use. “But in the developing world, where most people depend on agriculture to earn a living or just stay alive, it’s a scarce and precious resource.”Those living in coastal regions will suffer a loss of coral reefs, which half a billion people rely on for fish. For those born among indigenous communities in tropical rainforests, not only will they lose their homeland – already being eroded by increasing industrialisation – but there will be loss of habitat that acts as the lungs of the earth and regulates rainfall.Children will be most susceptible to the increasing diseases that a changing climate will leave in its wake, she adds. Their education may be disrupted when schools are used as shelters when disaster hits their communities.If temperatures increase in already hot areas, it will diminish scarce resources to sustain life and will force many to become refugees.But this may “dwarf numbers caused by conflict or political and economic necessity. When their land becomes uninhabitable because of drought, flood or sea-level rise, they will have to seek a safer place to live,” Higgins predicts.It may be a world where techniques such as conservation agriculture transform crop production and smartphone technology helps drive rural economies backed by deployment of cheap solar PV. But extreme weather events will continue to threaten food production, as seen with recent cyclones in southern Africa.Gold fears a business-as-usual approach means such circumstances can become an intractable problem very quickly, and says solutions are beyond most communities on cost grounds. Therefore the child is facing increased malnutrition, chronic hunger, dependency on external aid, and political instability – an existence marked by inequality and injustice.The IPBES report starkly outlines how indigenous peoples and the poorest are most reliant on land and sea for survival. The combination of land grabs by multinationals facilitated by corrupt governments, extreme climate events and bioersity loss add up to a very bleak future for their offspring, Gold concludes.The future of the cow Humans are not the only beings whose lives will change. The IPBES report emphasises that the effects will be felt first among animals and other living things.In Ireland, there are currently more cattle than people, and they are the most common large animal. For many, the cow (for beef and milk) is the bellwether of Irish agriculture and rural life. For others, it’s the problem because of associated carbon emissions.Teagasc’s head of communications, Eric Donald, says cattle numbers are currently a matter for inidual farmers. With no quotas, no policy instruments are in place. In future we are likely to have fewer beef and more dairy cattle.On emissions, Donald says there is wide acceptance of the need to implement mitigation measures – a process is already in train.Having a grass-based system to feed those cattle will be critical to sustainable farms from an environmental, economic and social perspective, Donald adds. Ireland will need to find export markets for 80 to 90 per cent of its product. Meat consumption may decrease on an inidual basis and there may be a shift to plant-based diets, but increased population growth will mean “demand won’t drop significantly”.But cattle will have to compete for space due to a more erse range of crops, land being used for bioenergy and afforestation (increasingly native woodlands and not just on marginal land) that will act as important carbon sinks, and hedgerows ensuring better bioersity and pollinator capacity.To question beef consumption may currently be an Irish “no-no”, but the reality is the consumers of tomorrow will be confronted by a wide range of new plant and synthetic proteins that will taste surprisingly good and be cheaper, which is likely to mean less red meat is consumed – in line with health guidelines.Eric Donald defends the pursuit of higher genetic quality as a means of increasing efficiency and lowering emissions, especially “because lifetime productivity is better”. With extending grazing seasons, it’s the key measure in improving farm sustainability guidelines. It also complements changes in fertiliser use and slurry management.But John Sweeney says the Irish cow is “reaching limits in terms of genetics”. Like pedigree dogs, they are less able to cope with change and stress compared with native species.Unquestionably, there will be fewer of them, he believes, “if we want to maintain bioersity for future generations”.Expansion in the cattle population has coincided with deterioration in water quality, with widespread glyphosate contamination (one study has found 20 per cent of Irish adults have traces of the herbicide in their urine), nitrates pollution and an emerging ammonia problem.“Continued expansion of the national herd is not compatible with this report. That’s where the crux comes.”The future of the lionJennifer Higgins joins in a lament for so many endangered mammals.Of all species threatened, IWT campaign officer Pádraic Fogarty is shocked by the latest indicators for hippos, giraffes and lions. In particular, “it would be an absolutely travesty if lions were to go extinct . . . The magnificent animal has permeated our culture and imagination, from children’s stories to the pillars on Trafalgar Square.”But maps don’t lie. In 1950 there were 400,000 lions in the wild. Today there are 23,000-39,000 lions in all of Africa, which is “extremely low” in global terms, when once they lived in Ancient Greece and North Africa, and became extinct in Greece only around 100BC.Outside of southern Africa, numbers of lions in 23 unfenced reserves in 11 countries are estimated to have dropped by 62 per cent between 1993 and 2014. Asia is home to a small subpopulation in the Indian state of Gujarat, where numbers are growing, but it’s just a pin on the globe.“There is no data to say that lions are about to disappear, but their populations are shrinking fast,” he explains. The species is classified as vulnerable but the slide into the “endangered” and then “critically endangered” categories looms, while “threatened with extinction” is applied to its current status.For Fogarty, the same pressures apply to other mammals, but the lion’s wellbeing is further undermined by gametrophy hunting and false western-world notions that it is somehow good for population numbers. All told, we are facing a scenario where lions will “shrink to a few corners of the planet”.What to doThis is not going to be sorted by putting bird tables in back gardens. The Ipbes report shows nature-based solutions can help bring “transformative change”, but there is a greater systemic problem.In the past 50 years, the human population has doubled, the global economy has grown nearly four-fold, and global trade has grown tenfold, together driving up the demands for energy, food and materials.Thinking that endless economic growth is possible and not valuing the essential services provided by nature is a delusion leading to catastrophe, Sweeney believes.“Until we get away from euros and cents and GDP, we will be in a cul-de-sac . . . Unless we rethink how we value the services provided by the natural world and include them explicitly in a wellbeing measure, we delude ourselves that a sustainable future is possible.”That was the core message in a submission this week to EU leaders meeting on the future of Europe by the European Environmental Bureau (EEB) and more than 200 academics, including John Sweeney, policy experts and civil society groups.There is an onus too on iniduals to act, according to EEB vice president Attracta Uí Bhroin. “It’s not enough for us to sit on the sofa and watch David Attenborough’s latest breathtaking and terrifying documentary and shake our heads. Every politician coming near your front door needs to know environmental sustainability is your priority, and must be Europe’s priority.”Fogarty hopes people now see the connections between climate breakdown and mass extinction, that they are two sides of the same coin. “We have all of the solutions to hand, but what we’ve been lacking is any sense of urgency to get on with it.”He senses momentum moving in the right direction, though the lack of a response from the Taoiseach or any Government minister “makes me feel that they are still hoping it’s an issue that will go away.

File photograph: Matt KavanaghMore than 750,000 foreign troops, the vast majority from the US, have been given permission by the Government to pass through Irish airports or airspace in the past five years.Most of these flights have also carried weapons, though some changes introduced by the Minister for Transport Shane Ross when he took office in 2016 have seen certain types of munitions prohibited from flights passing through Ireland. These are explosives classed as “dangerous goods” under aviation law.However, Mr Ross permitted more than 1,000 overflights and landings last year, and the figures show that numbers are increasing. In the first four months of this year, permission was granted for 212 flights carrying weapons to fly through Irish airspace (one application was refused) and 190 flights were granted permission to land (one was refused).Typically, the flights are civilian aircraft that have been chartered by foreign militaries, usually the United States Air Force.The carriage of weapons is prohibited by air transport regulations, but the Minister for Transport is empowered to issue exemptions which were done at a rate of about 20 a week last year.The troops are usually en route to US bases in a variety of destinations, in Europe, the Middle East and Asia, including Afghanistan, or returning to the US.Military transportsMilitary transports are authorised under a separate system, where the Department of Foreign Affairs has the authority to grant permission to foreign military aircraft to land here or fly through Irish airspace.These are granted on the basis the aircraft is “unarmed, carries no arms, ammunition or explosives, is not engaged in intelligence gathering, and that the flight in question does not form any part of military exercises or operations”, the department says. However, the State does not carry out any inspections to ensure these conditions are being met. Most flights granted landing or overflight rights are from the US.Figures compiled by the Department of Foreign Affairs last year showed that, in addition to the civilian flights, there were more than 2,000 landings or overflights by military aircraft in 2017, the vast majority from the US.The facilitation of US use of Shannon and Irish airspace for military transports and flights has been routinely criticised by anti-war campaigners but has been continued by all governments."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3916069.1559769449!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"rising number of foreign troops passing through ireland","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tUS troops at Shannon Airport in 2006. File photograph: Matt KavanaghThe number of foreign troops, the majority from the US, who have passed through Ireland or its airspace in civilian aircraft almost doubled between 2014 and last year, figures from the Department of Transport reveal.The number has increased from 101,029 in 2014 to 191,216 in the 10½ months to mid-November last.The figures show that more than 760,000 foreign troops travelled through Irish airports or airspace in the past five years in civilian aircraft chartered by foreign military.A total of 280,669 foreign troops landed at Irish airports while a further 486,256 flew overhead through Irish airspace in the period.More than 86,000 foreign troops landed at Irish airports in the first 10½ months of last year, the highest number in any of the five years for which figures were provided.Overall, more than 1,000 aircraft carrying troops andor munitions were granted permission to land in or overfly Ireland last year.Under Irish law, civilian flights carrying weapons must be given prior permission to overfly or land by the Minister for Transport.Some of the chartered planes that passed through Irish airspace since the start of 2014 included 25 flights carrying explosives from the US to Afghanistan, SA80 rifles going from the UK to Canada, semi-automatic rifles from the US to the UK, explosives and detonating fuses from the US to Qatar, bombs with bursting charge from the US to Germany, and 9mm Jericho pistols from the US to Ethiopia.When he became Minister for Transport in 2016, Shane Ross stopped granting permission for a small number of flights carrying explosives, his spokeswoman confirmed. However, this is a small fraction of the overall numbers of flights for which permission is granted. His spokeswoman confirmed that the policy change concerned only explosives, classed as “dangerous goods” under the regulations, while other weapons continue to travel through Ireland.In June 2016, a month after Mr Ross took office, airlines that routinely transported certain types of weapons were contacted by Department of Transport officials notifying them that the Minister would not be allowing “dangerous goods” to continue overfly Ireland or pass through airports here.A spokeswoman for the department said Mr Ross had used his discretion on about 10 occasions since taking office. Two of these decisions were taken on June 10th, 2016 when, despite officials in his own department and the Department of Foreign Affairs recommending the passage of Class 1 explosives, a rocket, small arms and cartridges through Irish airspace from the US to Afghanistan and of Class 1 explosives from the US to Germany, Mr Ross said no.Under international aviation rules, goods such as explosives, detonating fuses and smoke ammunition fall within the dangerous goods category but heavy machine guns, grenade launchers and other firearms are not considered as such once they are not loaded.There were 41 applications to transport these kinds of goods over the State in 2014 (26 granted) and 74 such applications in 2015 (46 granted). In the first four months of 2016, while Paschal Donohoe was minister for transport, nine of 14 applications were granted. However, in the latter part of the year, under Mr Ross, just five of 34 were approved.One of the 17 applications received in 2017 was approved, this was for an Irish Defence Forces plane leaving to participate in a UN mission in Lebanon, and none of the four applications received last year was sanctioned.DiscretionIn replies to parliamentary questions since, Mr Ross said he had used his discretion to refuse several applications, something which he noted had “rarely, if ever” been done in the past.“These applications related to the transport of munitions of war, categorised as dangerous goods, ie munitions of war that contain material that is explosive, corrosive, flammable, toxic,” he told the Dáil.However, a review of the administration of the law governing overflights and landings commissioned in 2017 has not been completed.The US military accounted for at least 93 per cent of all flights that passed through Irish airports or airspace, with the American troops going to 39 different countries. Most of these were either returning to the US (385,353) from a variety of locations around the world or travelling to Germany (184,435) where the US has its military headquarters in Europe.A large number of US troops also travelled to Kuwait (133,762), Jordan (2,212), the UAE (2,786) and Bahrain (2,186) – all of which are part of the US-backed and Saudi-led coalition involved in the war in Yemen. The US has also flown 1,798 troops to its military base in Djibouti, which is separated from Yemen by the Red Sea and is seen as a significant location on the route to the Suez Canal.Surprising destinationsThe flights that transited through Irish airports and airspace  four continents, with the US sending troops to some surprising destinations.For example, the US has sent 2,459 troops to Kyrgyzstan and a further 124 to neighbouring Tajikistan, both of which border the rival superpower China.Four flights carrying troops, their personal weapons and armoured vehicles all landed in Ireland en route to Iraq. Two flights carried 10 troops each while the other two, unusually, did not specify how many troops were on board. There were no flights to Iraq in any of the other years examined.Three flights carrying 790 US troops travelled to Russia. The first flight in 2014 was an overflight carrying 350 troops while the other two flights landed in Ireland on March 21st and 24th, 2017 before carrying the combined 440 troops on to Russia.These flights are in addition to the 2,759 requests made to the Department of Foreign Affairs between January 2014 and June 2018 for permission for military planes (as distinct from civilian flights chartered by foreign military) to land in Ireland. The US accounted for 2,350 (85 per cent) of these. The department declined when asked to provide more details surrounding these flights.“Arrangements under which permission is granted for foreign military aircraft to land at Irish airports are governed by strict conditions,” a spokesman said. “These routinely include stipulations that the aircraft must be unarmed, carry no arms, ammunition or explosives and must not engage in intelligence gathering, and that the flights in question must not form part of any military exercise or operation.”Longstanding agreementA tranche of diplomatic cables previously released by Wikileaks give an insight into the longstanding agreement between Ireland and the US to allow US military personal or munitions of war to fly over Ireland or land at Irish airports.“Shannon remains a key transit point for US troops and material bound for theatres in the global war on terror, while yielding diplomatic benefits for the Irish Government and significant revenues for the airport and regional economy,” says one cable sent by the then US ambassador to Ireland James Kenny, which was dated September 5th, 2006 and marked confidential.Foreign troops transiting Irish airports or passing through Irish airspace are permitted only on the basis that their personal weapons are not loaded and that the ammunition is secured to a point where it is inaccessible.However, questions have previously been raised by anti-war campaigners about the level of scrutiny placed by Irish authorities on flights chartered by foreign militaries. The Irish position is that the civilian aircraft are permitted to carry arms – as the above figures show – but that the military aircraft are granted permission on the basis that they are not carrying arms. However, there are no security checks on their contents of the planes that pass through Ireland."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3915847.1559753606!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"troops and munitions passing through ireland what is happening","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tProtestors march to Shannon Airport to protest about US military equipment and troops passing through the airport. Photograph: Alan BetsonHas Ireland always allowed munitions of war to pass through or over the State? No. The initial legislation governing munitions of war passing through Ireland dates back to the early years of the Free State. Article 26 of the Air Navigation (General) regulations 1930 explicitly prohibits the transportation of munitions of war, other than those of the Saorstát Éireann (Irish Free State).It was not until 1964 that the minister for transport was given discretion to decide if munitions of war could pass through or over Ireland.Where is this weaponry and equipment being transported to, and by whom? Civilian planes chartered by the US military going between the US and Afghanistan flew over Ireland most frequently between 2014 and last November. These were civilian aircraft chartered by the US military carrying weapons and other military equipment. While no troops bound for Afghanistan passed through Irish airports or airspace during that period, there were 65 overflights from the US that carried munitions of war. Fifty-seven of these flights were carrying what was classified as “dangerous goods” such as explosives, while others carried small arms, weapons cartridges and other materials. Weapons and equipment that passed through Irish airports or airspace were transported to 21 different countries around the world.What happens with actual military planes? The Department of Foreign Affairs is responsible for granting permission to military planes (as distinct from civilian flights chartered by foreign military) seeking to land in Ireland. The only available data for these planes shows the number of requests by country. Some 2,759 requests were made to the department between the start of 2014 and last June, with the US accounting for 2,350 (85 per cent) of these. When asked to provide more detail surrounding these flights, the department declined.“Arrangements under which permission is granted for foreign military aircraft to land at Irish airports are governed by strict conditions,” it said. “These routinely include stipulations that the aircraft must be unarmed, carry no arms, ammunition or explosives and must not engage in intelligence gathering, and that the flights in question must not form part of any military exercise or operation.”Has the State effectively banned such flights? There is no official protocol in place but the last flight to receive permission to overfly Ireland with “dangerous goods” on board was on July 17th, 2016 when Mr Ross approved the carriage of weapons cartridges and inert projectiles. Since then no other flight has transited through Ireland en route to Afghanistan, with Mr Ross refusing three subsequent requests for flights to Afghanistan. A month later he refused a seemingly identical flight carrying weapons cartridges and inert projectiles. In May 4th of last year he refused a flight carrying two igniters and cartridges, which are classed as “dangerous goods” and on October 2nd last he refused a flight carrying two helicopters.Why is nobody complaining? The amount of flights that it has affected by the banning of “dangerous goods” through Ireland is small enough to not make a significant difference, especially in relation to overflights. However, if this policy was to be extended to troops, there would be serious diplomatic connotations. The US government has consistently stressed the importance of Shannon Airport for the transport of American troops to “theatres of war” around the world.Does anyone in Dublin officialdom mind that this has happened? Officials at the Department of Transport said there was no opposition to the move and they passed on the message to airlines that routinely carried “dangerous goods” through Irish airports or airspace that they would no longer receive permission to do so."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3915844.1559752326!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"janan ganesh the big chinese elephant in the uk us honeymoon suite","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tUS President Donald Trump and Britain’s prime minister Theresa May during a dinner at Winfield House on Tuesday. The question of the tech giant Huawei came up during Trump’s state visit to the UK. Photograph: Chris JacksonAFPGetty ImagesA populist is someone who abhors the metropolis and demands its respect. According to the cultural right, big cities are teetering Babels, lawless and ghettoised, but also wealth-hoarding success stories that look down at the conservative provinces. “You crammed and besieged losers,” this Tom Wolfe-ish attitude to urbanites seems to say, “we are just as good as you.”All of which helps to explain why some British populists back a foreign president over the mayor of their own liberal capital. The running tiff between Donald Trump and Sadiq Khan is modern politics – closed versus open – in miniature.But there is more behind the courtship of the visiting president than that. There is foreign policy at work. The British right sees the US as a natural companion in a post-Brexit world. If a no-deal Brexit puts the UK out in the European cold, it hopes to warm its hands on the fire of a fast-growing America.That hope should be checked. British conservatives have been misreading American ones since Dwight Eisenhower declined to look away as the Suez Canal was summarily invaded. Yes, there is a promising bonhomie between Trump and Boris Johnson, the former UK foreign secretary. And the US right cherishes the nation state, not the EU, as the last word in human organisation. Both countries also talk an excellent game about a bilateral trade deal.Divergent interestsThey just happen to have ergent interests on the largest question of the century, that’s all. Even before Brexit, the UK viewed China as a commercial opportunity. Its disposition will have to become even warmer once it loses full membership of its own continental trading bloc. It is not in a position to pick and choose its economic friends.All the while, the US is moving in the opposite direction twice as fast. It is actually more suspicious of China than it was when it began its tariff campaign a year ago. What could then have been explained away as one quixotic president’s attempt to secure better trading terms has become a wider confrontation.Trump’s views have caught on in formerly laissez-faire boardrooms and in once-orthodox Washington symposia. To call it a consensus is a leap. Some eminent Americans hope to rattle China a bit and leave it at that. Others aspire to nothing less than the eventual decoupling of the two economies. But the general direction of US thought, and its incompatibility with the UK’s Chinese interests, is unmistakable. And possibly intractable.Odd partnershipIf this seems a more theoretical than actual problem, then look to the recent past for a case study. In 2015, when London signed up to the Beijing-led Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, Washington chafed at this “constant accommodation” of China. And that was under the Barack Obama administration. Imagine a replay under Trump or another populist.Because Britain has long been out of the superpower business, the rise of China has no implications for its own status. Its economic interests and its foreign policy can be almost the same thing. The US is in a very different predicament. It is a ruling power facing demotion by (in its mind) a revisionist one. Its foreign policy has to go beyond entrepreneurial nimbleness.No doubt, close partners can bicker over one thing while remaining in broad concert. But it is an odd partnership that contains such opposing views on quite so important a third party. As time wears on, this strategic tension cannot be glossed over with the usual grammar of UK-US meetings: the one-sided flattery, the talk of “cousins” that belies the non-British ancestry of even most white Americans.This week’s state visit had its stresses. The question of the tech giant Huawei, which the two countries view with differing levels of suspicion, came up. Such wedge questions are likelier to multiply than to recede over the years.Ultra-intimateSingapore, Germany, Australia, Brazil: lots of countries hope not to have to choose between the US and China. But the UK plan – to be ultra-intimate with the one while profiting from the other – is another order of ambition.That British conservatives put so much hope in Trump, and found Obama’s anglophilia so wanting, only defeats their own argument. The “special” relationship, it seems, is a transcendent fact of the world, as immutable as force equals mass times acceleration, and yet entirely dependent on whoever is in the White House at any given moment.Well, for now, that occupant is Donald Trump. Sympathy for Brexit is certainly one part of his worldview. But mistrust of China is much the larger. It is not a mistrust all countries can afford."},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/05/17/TELEMMGLPICT000147339863_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"judges given new expenses policy telegraph discovers judiciary","story":"The Ministry of Justice approved expenses including shampoo and crockery.  Lord Chief Justice, Lord Ian Burnett, pictured, claimed for multiple journeys to and from his homeMinistry of JusticeThe judiciary are to be given a new expenses policy after The Daily  found that Britain\u0027s most senior judges have claimed for crockery, shampoo and a taxi to transport ceremonial robes on taxpayer-funded expenses.Expenses data released under the Freedom of Information Act shows how some of the most high-profile members of the judiciary in England and Wales have had claims for everyday items as well first-class trains approved, even though they receive a salary of at least £180,000.At present, judges are encouraged to follow the expenses policy for Ministry of Justice (MOJ) civil servants, and the judiciary has also set out specific guidance relating to travel, accommodation and relocation....To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletMinistry of JusticeTrooping the Colour 2019: How cold November weather brought about the Queen\u0026#39s summer birthday celebrationsComment: D-Day still stands as one of our nation\u0026#39s greatest triumphsD-Day commemorations: Prince Charles says today is \u0026#39probably last chance to pay everlasting respect\u0026#39 to veterans - latest updatesTrooping the Colour 2019: How the November weather brought about the Queen\u0026#39s summer birthday celebrationsSenior detective dies hours after being interviewed by colleagues over alleged fraudBrexit latest news: John Bercow rules out Dominic Raab\u0026#39s plan to force through no-deal by proroguing ParliamentComment: Michael Gove is too good to be our next Prime Minister Putin to meet Pope in move that could pave way for historic Russia tripFormer SNP MP Natalie McGarry jailed for embezzling thousands from pro-independence groupsSainsbury\u0026#39s becomes first supermarket to get rid of plastic bags for fruit and veg and bakery items Speedboat killer Jack Shepherd jailed for further four years for assaulting barman with glass bottleKilling Eve accused of ‘queerbaiting’ after Sandra Oh denies on-screen lesbian relationship\u0026#39It\u0026#39s a memory so clear, it\u0026#39s as if it were yesterday\u0026#39 - D-Day as told by  readersCentre-Left in Denmark rewarded with election victory for anti-immigrant stance Peterborough by-election offers Brexit Party a chance for its first MP as Tories in hidingUK veterans complete tandem parachute jumps to mark D-day memorialHow the D-Day landings forged the Special RelationshipComment: We must never forget the sacrifice of D-Day, or the cooperation that made it a triumph We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"expenses podcast lone campaigner took whole parliament","story":"Journalist and freedom of information campaigner, Heather BrookeTucked away in the back of New Labour’s 1997 manifesto is a promise.

Being at the cemeteries and being at the commemorations. They always remember their comrades and their friends and the people they had to leave behind. This country lost countless special people and we owe it to them and their families to go on commemorating this.Asked whether this 75th anniversary would be particularly poignant, he added: It\u0027s probably the last chance to pay everlasting respect to these remarkable people who wanted above all to do their duty.Earlier, Theresa May addressed the D-Day veterans at a commemoration ceremony in Ver-sur-Mer, and closing her emotionally-charged speech said: Here in Normandy, the names of those British men and women who lost their lives will forever sit across The Channel from their homeland.  We\u0027ll always remember their courage and conviction. And to the veterans that are here today - I want to say the only two words I can: Thank you.World War II reenactors stand on Omaha Beach, in Normandy, France, at dawn The British Normandy Memorial, funded by the Normandy Memorial Trust, is being built on a hillside in Ver-sur-Mer, overlooking Gold Beach, one of the key sites for British troops during the Normandy Landings.A sculpture created by David Williams-Ellis was unveiled marking the beginning of construction for the memorial.After the memorial inauguration, Mrs May, in one of her final official engagements as Conservative leader, joined veterans and the Prince of Wales at a cathedral service in Bayeux.The moving service saw veterans and religious leaders deliver speeches to honour those who made the ultimate sacrifice during the Second World War.D-Day 75th anniversary: The Portsmouth and Normandy celebrations, in picturesMeanwhile, many veterans have flock to the town of Arromanches for a series of events.Activities on Thursday will mark key events in the operation. The day began with a lone piper playing a lament on Port Winston signalling the minute the invasion began and the moment the first British soldier landed on Gold beach.Veterans will then descend on the town square as part of a parade with Tobias Ellwood, the minister for Defence People and Veterans, and chief of Ministry of Defence general staff Mark Carleton-Smith will be among crowds before a Red Arrows flypast and a firework display.Crowds of visitors have gathered in the square at Arromanches overlooking the beach for a service of remembrance.During the commemoration, wreaths will be laid by British veterans.The veterans were applauded by the crowd as they arrived.An MP has called for a giant new forest to be expanded across the United Kingdom as a tribute to people who fought and died for the freedom of this country.As the world marks the 75th anniversary of the D Day landings, Labour\u0027s Barry Sheerman (Huddersfield) said MPs should think profoundly about the young men and women who fought and lost their lives in the Second World War.He said a planned new forest in the North of England should be extended across the entire country.Speaking in the House of Commons, Mr Sheerman said: As a fitting tribute, can we actually seriously look at something that I am passionate about, and that is the growth of trees to remember people, to remember their contribution?There is going to be a new Northern Forest stretching all the way from Hull to Liverpool, 50 million trees.Could we expand that across the United Kingdom as a real tribute to those people who fought for us in the war, many of whom died fighting for the freedom of this country?Commons Leader Mel Stride replied: We should seek whatever means we can to pay tribute to those who fought on our behalf in the Second World War.You have referenced the planting of trees and I remember, as a young boy actually, Plant A Tree In \u002773, I think is what we were urged to do way back then.I assume there are forests of these giant trees here today as a consequence of that particular initiative.You referred to the great Northern Forest, which I think is an excellent and an imaginative approach.Mr Stride advised Mr Sheerman to bring the matter up at environment questions, which he said would be an excellent opportunity to bring up the idea with ministers.The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have posted their own tribute to the D-Day veterans. On their official Instagram account, they took an excerpt from Prince Harry\u0027s speech to the Chelsea pensioners earlier today. It said: Don’t ever underestimate the joy that you bring to everyone you meet. You represent something really quite special, you are special, and society will always recognise that.That is an important part of your legacy....It’s a community that focuses on supporting each other with kindness, respect and compassion, as well as reaching out to serve the wider community....On this 75th Anniversary of D-Day, I can comfortably speak for everyone when I say we are honoured to be in the presence of six Normandy Landing veterans.Phoebe Southworth is in Arromanches for The . This afternoon it will host a commemorative ceremony overlooking Gold Beach. It will feature music from the Central Band of the Royal Air Forces. There has been activity in the Normandy commune all day, and as the tide came in, so did an amphibious US military vehicle called The Flying Duckman, which parked up in the harbour with its  Stars and Stripes flag swaying in the the breeze.The Somme Battlefield Pipe Band also filed through the centre of Arromanches wearing kilts playing traditional Scottish and Irish airs.Formed in 1989, the band aims to promote the music and history of the Scottish soldiers and their Regiments during their time in Northern France and the Somme Area in 19141918 and during the second World War.D-Day veteran Len Cox, of the 56th Brigade, 2nd Battalion Gloucestershire Regiment, is one of the poster boys of the D-Day anniversary and his war-time portrait appears on WWII heroes posters around Arromanches.Visitors walk in a street of Arromanches in NormandyA fanatical singer and dancer, he gave an impromptu performance of some of his favourite songs to crowds vying for their pictures of him to be signed with his autograph following a military ceremony.He told The : In the early days I used to jitterbug. Have you ever heard of the move \u0027necking the chicken\u0027? It\u0027s when the girl straddles the man with both legs and you bob your heads on either side of each other.Nowadays I couldn\u0027t get down on my knees like I used to or I\u0027d probably never get up!He added: Today is important because it\u0027s the 75th anniversary, which is very special. If it hasn\u0027t been for those men then we wouldn\u0027t be standing here today.This is Harry Billinge. He won\u0027t accept it, but he is a D-Day war hero. He told BBC Breakfast his story. Disclaimer: It might make you cry. Second World War veteran Jimmy Ockendon wept as he remembered those who lost their lives on D-Day during an emotional memorial service in Portsmouth.The 97-year-old wiped away tears during the commemoration at the Southsea D-Day Stone, which was attended by thousands of members of the public who paid their respects during a minute\u0027s silence.Royal British Legion standard bearers along with the Band of Her Majesty\u0027s Royal Marines and a platoon of Royal Marines Cadets escorted veterans as they marched along the seafront to reach the memorial stone.The service was conducted by Canon Bob White and featured the Portsmouth Cathedral Choir.Mr Ockendon said: It was very emotional, the main person I was thinking of was my uncle who went on the Hood, his wife had died just beforehand and he left two young children and my father and mother adopted them.I was also thinking of my father.As well as wearing his own service medals, Mr Ockendon, from Portsmouth, donned those of his father, Sergeant James Ockendon, who was awarded the Belgian Croix de Guerre and the Victoria Cross for his role in the First World War.Mr Ockendon, who was serving at the time of D-Day but not directly involved in the operation, said: We were just off France and I heard on the Tannoy what was happening.We didn\u0027t worry much in those days, we just got on with the job.Jimmy Ockendon lays a wreath at the D-Day stone in SouthseaMr Ockendon, who attended with his wife Joyce, 84, attended the service after earlier this week naming a train The D-Day Story Portsmouth for South Western Railway in recognition of the 75th anniversary.The service was also attended by Portsmouth South Labour MP Stephen Morgan, whose grandfather James Kaminski landed on Juno Beach as part of the Normandy operation at the age of 17 while serving in the Royal Army Service Corps.Mr Morgan said: He lied about his age and joined the Army four months early and his first major operation was landing on the beach.One of my biggest regrets is not asking him enough about his story but he was quite reluctant because it was such a traumatic experience.He added: Yesterday we saw Portsmouth can do these events brilliantly at an international level, with Her Majesty the Queen and 15 heads of state in our city, and today, yet again, we have demonstrated we can do these events locally.This shows to me Portsmouth is a place for reflection, recollection and remembrance.The Duke of Cambridge this morning paid tribute to the fallen at the National Memorial Arboretum in Staffordshire, spending time with veterans after pledging to remember all those who have made the ultimate sacrifice, writes our Royal Correspondent Hannah Furness. As the Duke bent down on one knee to better hear elderly servicemen, Royal Navy veteran Victor Brunt, 94, joked: I thought it was us who had to go on bended knee to you. Duke of Cambridge talks to veteransPrince William told him: Not you guys. It’s not a problem. John Jack Cannane, 95, of the Royal Electrical Engineers, told the Prince that he was under constant fire as he and his team tried to clear the stranded vehicles and landing craft so that the each wave could land.It was carnage. But I was a young man, only 20 and at that age you don’t really have any fear. Except of course the shock of seeing the bodies of young men on the beaches or floating in the water.But you just keep thinking to yourself that it isn’t going to be you. That’s the only way you survive I think, he said.Earlier this morning, a solemn Duke paid tribute to the D-Day fallen by reading aloud the words of his great grandfather King George VI.  His reading said: Four years ago our nation and empire stood alone against an overwhelming enemy, with our backs to the wall. Now once more a supreme test has to be faced. This time the challenge is not to fight to survive but to fight to win the final victory for the good cause. At this historic moment surely not one of us is too busy, too young, or too old to play a part in a nation-wide, perchance a world-wide vigil of prayer as the great crusade sets forth.Prince William lays a wreath in the pouring rainThe Duke, a former serving Army captain and RAF helicopter pilot, joined more than 20 D-Day veterans, and members of the public, at the service in Heroes’ Square then laid a wreath at the Normandy Campaign Memorial. The service of Remembrance has been organised as part of The Royal British Legion’s commemorative programme for D-Day 75, and will be led by the Honorary Arboretum Chaplains.Laying a wreath of poppies in the pouring rain, he left a message reading: In memory of all those who have made the ultimate sacrifice. We will remember them. William.Prince Harry, who is spending the morning with six D-Day veterans at the Royal Chelsea Hospital has delivered a speech in which he pays tributes both to their service and their everlasting sense of fun, Royal Correspondent Hannah Furness writes.Sharing his amusement at their late night cricket in the hallways and synchronised buggy drills, he said: I stand here before you to not only acknowledge the incredible contribution you have made to this nation but to acknowledge that you, my friends, are also seriously good fun to be around!You will always stand out in your scarlet coats and white gloves, but to me, whether I see you at Westminster Abbey, the Chelsea Flower Show, Twickenham Stadium, or the pub, I notice that you are always smiling.Don’t ever underestimate the joy that you bring to everyone you meet. You represent something really quite special, you are special, and society will always recognise that. That is an important part of your legacy.Here, I see a community that continues to value the importance of teamwork which military service in particular can teach you.It’s a community that focuses on supporting each other with kindness, respect and compassion, as well as reaching out to serve the wider community.The Duke of Sussex salutes the Chelsea pensionersMarking the significance of today\u0027s anniversary, he said: On this 75th Anniversary of D-Day, I can comfortably speak for everyone when I say we are honoured to be in the presence of six Normandy Landing veterans.To all who are on parade today, I can only say that you are a constant reminder of the great debt we owe those who have served this nation.You embody the fitting home that awaits them in the peace and tranquillity of the Royal Hospital, should they want it.But more widely, wherever you are, your presence is a symbol of the sacrifices that have been made by all veterans to sustain the freedoms and democracy we value so deeply today.Ladies and Gentleman, could I ask that those who are able to, please stand in recognition of our veterans. We stand together and remember those who have sacrificed their lives for our freedom.And for you here today, who have served us so greatly and with such honour, I congratulate you on the smartness of your turnout and the steadiness of your bearing. I thank you for inviting me here today and I wish you all the health and happiness you so richly deserve.A number of events are continuing in Britain away from the poignancy of northern France. Veterans are still milling around at Bayeux cemetery, paying their respects to those fellow comrades who were killed in battle. In London, the six inch guns aboard HMS Belfast were fired on the Thames to mark the 75th anniversary of the D-Day landings. The six inch guns on board HMS Belfast in London are fired to mark the 75th anniversary of the D-Day landingsThe Prince of Wales and his wife the Duchess of Cornwall are walking around the cemetery in Bayeux, observing the graves of those who lost their lives during the Second World War. Prince Charles and Camilla walk amongst the gravesGod Save The Queen is blasted out at the cemetery as D-Day veterans salute the memorial of their fallen comrades. This is followed by La Marseillaise. War heroes, immortalised with their gallantry medals glinting in the sunshine, then watch as the procession leaves.Theresa May is among those to lay a wreath in honour of those who lost their lives in Normandy. The Lord Is My Shepherd is then played out as the Normandy veterans are invited forward to lay wreaths for their fallen comrades. Normandy veterans lay their wreathsUnder blue skies, distinguished guests and veterans alike stood as the last post was played. They then observed a two-minute silence. Some D-Day heroes could be seen welling up as they looked out at the sea of graves that belong to their comrades. The Last Post was played by the Band and Bugles of The Rifles, followed by a two minutes silence.D-Day veteran Alan Harris then read: When you go home, tell of us and say, for your tomorrow, we gave our today.The Prime Minister is on stage giving a reading. Wearing a commemorative poppy on her blazer, she addresses the crowd with a section of the Book of Micah.As she does so, war aircraft pass overhead. Joe Shute, who is at the ceremony for The , believes the flypast was mistimed: Theresa May\u0027s address to the service was interrupted by what appeared to be a mistimed flypast overhead.Before the Prime Minister reached the and of Micah 4:1-5 a spitfire and bomber in D Day black and white livery roared overhead momentarily drowning out the Prime Minister delivering perhaps the final speech of her official term. This is followed by the singing of the hymn Abide With Me before D-Day veteran Ray Lord then read: They shall grow not old, as we that are left grow old.Age shall not weary them, nor the years condemn.At the going down of the sun, and in the morning, we will remember them.War hero Frank Baugh, who trained at HMS Collingwood in Portsmouth, is delivering his speech at the cemetery in Bayeux. Our Senior Features Writer Joe Shute is watching the ceremony. Read his account below. During the ceremony at Bayeux Royal Navy signalman Frank Baugh addressed the crowd with his own painful memories of D Day.The 95-year-old was tasked with transporting 200 troops from 2nd Batallion King\u0027s Shropshire Light Infantry from Newhaven to Sword Beach.On the way they received a direct hit meaning the men had to bail out into four feet of water.We were talking moments before but they were cut down by machine guns, he said.They fell into the water floating face down and we couldn\u0027t get them out. That is my abiding memory and I cant forget it.The Prince of Wales is among the guests at the cemetery in Bayeux where there are almost 400 unidentified graves. The Duchess of Cornwall and Prime Minister are also attending the cemetery service.The Royal Yeomanry and its band are providing a Guard of Honour and Royal Salute at the Bayeux Cemetery Service, with the Band of The Rifles in support.The road alongside the cemetery is Boulevard Fabian Ware, named after the founder of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission. Bayeux War Cemetery is the largest Commonwealth war cemetery of the Second World War in France.Both the cemetery and the memorial were designed by Philip Hepworth.The Latin inscription on the memorial recalls the Norman invasion of Britain in 1066 and reads: We, once conquered by William, have now set free the Conqueror’s native land.Our Royal Correspondent Hannah Furness has been keeping an eye on the royals at the D-Day events. Here are the thoughts of the Prince of Wales.In an interview with the BBC, the Prince of Wales has spoken of the deep significance of the 75th anniversary D-Day commemorations, saying it is probably the last chance to pay everlasting respect to these remarkable people who wanted above all to do their duty. I always think of people all around this country whose relations took part in D-Day and will be thinking so much about their grandfathers, fathers or great-grandfathers, he said. I\u0027ve been lucky enough to know so many of these veterans over my lifetime.  After the 70th anniversary, the Prince commissioned a series of 12 portraits of veterans to capture their spirit for centuries to come. I\u0027ve always felt that it\u0027s absolutely key to try and have a record of people who have given so much to this country in one way or another, he said. We looked at some of my old regiments, of which I\u0027m colonel-in-chief and very proud to be, and those veterans were sitting for different artists.They are very evocative. There were some wonderful figures in that who were chosen. I met them all and I\u0027m thrilled that we have something that will mean their memory is immortalised along with so many others who died with them.Of the importance of the Normandy services, the Prince said: I remember the last time we were there, I will never forget the determination that they still exude by being there. Being at the cemeteries and being at the commemorations. They always remember their comrades and their friends and the people they had to leave behind.This country lost countless special people and we owe it to them and their families to go on commemorating this.Asked whether this 75th anniversary would be particularly poignant, he added: It\u0027s probably the last chance to pay everlasting respect to these remarkable people who wanted above all to do their duty.The US president paid tribute to the greatest Americans that have ever lived and the pride of the nation. Midway through his speech, he turned around and applauded the veterans sat behind him at Omaha Beach. The US veterans, in turn applauded their president. Mr Trump delivered a long address, recalling D-Day through the viewpoint of a number of veterans present.  The \u0027s France Correspondent Henry Samuel is at Omaha beach. Here is his take from the sandy beaches. Under brilliant blue skies, thousands have gathered for this morning’s tribute to the fallen at Omaha beach. The sun and calm seas could not be more different than the atrocious conditions that faced Allied troops that day.It’s pristine now. It was so bad and pitiful that day. Now it’s so beautiful, said American D-Day veteran Jack Ewald, 94, from Suffolk Virginia, in full of the beach he scaled under German machine gun fire 75 years ago.Mr Ewald came back in 2010 and he said he wouldn’t have missed the 75th for the world. “It’s given me more energy than I’ve had in a decade,” he said.Some 4,400 Allied troops on the first day of the landings, more than half at Omaha beach. Mr Ewald was in company K, 115th infantry, 29th ision.I’m no hero, just a plain old guy like most of us, he said beside his granddaughter Megan Forbes, 34.We didn’t do anything special. We all protected each other. We knew we had to do it and we did it. There weren’t no hero business about it.Our Senior Features Writer Joe Shute is in Bayeux, where hundreds of people have lined the streets to clap and cheer D-Day veterans as they parade from the cathedral service to the Commonwealth War  Graves cemetery ahead of a memorial there later today. Veterans are waiting in Bayeux cemetery for the annual commemorative service to begin.Veterans at Bayeux cemetery Afterwards the Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall as well as Prime Minister Theresa May will mingle with the war heroes.The Duke of Sussex has arrived at the Royal Hospital Chelsea in London to review the Chelsea pensioners at the annual Founder\u0027s Day Parade.The parade commemorates King Charles II\u0027s founding of the institution in 1681.Founder\u0027s Day is also known as Oak Apple Day referring to the oak tree that Charles hid in to avoid being captured by Parliamentary forces after the Battle of Worcester in 1651.Harry, a former Army officer, arrived wearing his Blues and Royals frock coat and like all the pensioners and guests wore a sprig of oak leaves in honour of Charles.At a commemoration service at the National Memorial Arboretum, the Duke of Cambridge delivered the D-Day address made by his great-grandfather King George VI in 1944.He said: Four years ago our nation and empire stood alone against an overwhelming enemy, with our backs to the wall.Now once more a supreme test has to be faced.This time the challenge is not to fight to survive but to fight to win the final victory for the good cause.At this historic moment surely not one of us is too busy, too young, or too old to play a part in a nationwide, perchance a world-wide vigil of prayer as the great crusade sets forth.In a lovely moment during yesterday\u0027s coverage, Simon McCoy was interviewing Eric Chardin in Portsmouth. He was just 19 when he landed in Normandy 75 years ago. In a poignant interview, he refused to call himself a hero or even brave, saying: you have to admit, one was scared. Wrapping up the interview, McCoy asks Mr Chardin if anybody has recently said thank you to him for his service. When the war hero says no, the BBC presenter responds: Well can I, on behalf of everybody watching, just say thank you.Mr Chardin appears taken aback, and replies: Well, thank you. Thank you for your courtesy.McCoy then thanks him again for the interview before beginning to turn to the camera when Mr Chardin interrupts, saying: Have you finished?He continues: What will you do with it? Take a bit of it?McCoy has to tell the veteran: Well, we\u0027ve just been live. I should have warned you about that.Cracking a smile, Mr Chardin says: Oh, now you tell me!Watch the video in full here:Our news reporter Phoebe Southworth is in Arromanches where the commemorations continue. Here is her take from the scene:Allan Ede, the president of the Invicta Military-Vehicle Preservation Society (IMPS), drove an army green open-top 1944 Ford Jeep in today\u0027s parade around the beach in Arromanches with his wife Sue.He told The : We have brought over 1,944 marked vehicles and 500 people to operate them on the ferry from Portsmouth and Dover ports.Jeeps like the one I\u0027m driving are off-road patrol and reconnaissance vehicles which were used for running senior officers around. They were essentially the car of the army.He added: It is important to remember the sacrifices that everyone who fought here made.In the same way we remember those who died fighting for their country in the First World War, we must also remember those who died in the Second World War.Jeeps driven on the beachWe are aware that there are so few veterans left, just a handful now, and they love seeing our vehicles.They say things like \u0027oh yes, I drove one of those from Normandy to Berlin\u0027.Seven local police officers from the gendarmerie in Arromanches directed the Jeeps, tanks and amphibious military vehicles as they snaked their way around the shore, the drivers showcasing them to crowds of onlookers.Many took the opportunity to snap selfies behind the wheel of unmanned vehicles parked up on the beach.A harmonica player with a whistle around his neck, flanked by two guitarists and a man with a tambourine, set up camp at the entrance to the harbour.Crowds of music-lovers quickly formed a semi-circle around the band, called Herbie Blues, and clapped along to their country-style American songs.Theresa May has paid tribute to those who made the ultimate sacrifice at an inauguration ceremony of a new British Normandy Memorial in France, 75 years on from D-Day.She joined French President Emmanuel Macron at the event in Ver-sur-Mer, Normandy, on one of her final official engagements as Conservative leader.They laid wreaths at the foundation stone for the new memorial, which will list the names of all 22,442 members of the British armed forces who died in the Normandy campaign in summer 1944 and overlooks Gold Beach, where many of the troops arrived on D-Day.Speaking at the service, Mrs May said: It\u0027s incredibly moving to be here today, looking out over the beaches where one of the greatest battles for freedom this world has ever known took place.And it is truly humbling to do so with the men who were there that day.Theresa May standing in front of the sculptureShe continued: Standing here as the waves wash quietly on to the shore below us, it is almost impossible to grasp the raw courage it must have taken that day to leap from the landing craft and into the surf despite the fury of battle.If one day can be said to have determined the fate of generations to come in France, in Britain, in Europe and the world, that day was June 6 1944.The Prime Minister also paid tribute to those who made the ultimate sacrifice, saying: They laid down their lives so that we might have a better life and build a better world.The sculpture was created by David Williams-Ellis to mark the beginning of construction for the memorial, funded by the Normandy Memorial Trust, which is expected to be completed within a year.David Woodrow, 95, from Norwich ahead of the Inauguration of the British Normandy Memorial site in Ver-sur-MerMr Clements was a petty officer in the Royal Navy on board the 900-tonne frigate HMS Mountsea, protecting the convoys approaching the landing beaches on D-Day from Nazi attacks.He helped drop depth charges at U-boats with little success, including targeting one which had earlier sunk an Allied troop ship and was then destroyed by a Canadian vessel.Mr Clements, from Whitstable, said he was not scared at the time, despite heavy shelling.Now 98, he said it is fantastic that the memorial is being built.He said: It should have been done long ago but it\u0027s never too late.As World in Union - the anthem for the Rugby World Cup, which takes place in Japan later this year - plays the guests out, The Prince of Wales and Theresa May leave Bayeux Cathedral. Here is Mrs May greeting Prince Charles - perhaps for the last time - outside the building.Flags of the nations that took part in the struggles are hanging inside Bayeux Cathedral. The procession now leaves the stunning building after a moving service. For the second time today, God Save The Queen and La Marseillaise are sung at the commemorative events. Cardinal Marc Ouellet reads the blessing.The second hymn - Bread of Heaven - is sung by the gathered crowd. If you want to sing along, here are the words: Bread of HeavenThe Venerable (Air Vice-Marshal) John R Ellis reads out the first prayer. Here is the full transcript: The two-minute silence inside the Bayeux Cathedral was, as you\u0027d expect, impeccably observed. Apart from the murmur of a baby at the back of the building, there was not a sound inside the cathedral.  The exhortation is read out by the National Chairman of the British Legion Una Cleminson, followed by the last post and a two-minute silence.Theresa May arrived at Bayeux Cathedral with a new accessory. Wearing the same light jacket as she wore at Ver-sur-Mer, she arrived wearing an elaborate hat. In a speech, he asks us to honour the D-Day veterans and those who had to make the ultimate sacrifice. He says he could not do their story justice. We are now hearing an extract in French from a young person caught up in the Nazi occupation. D-Day veteran Kenneth Hay reads from the poem Normandy, by Cyril Crain, who also took part in the Allied invasion.Mr Hay\u0027s reading began: Come and stand in memory of men who fought and died.They gave their lives in Normandy, remember them with pride.Crain landed at Juno Beach in June 1944, four days before his 21st birthday.He died in 2014, aged 91.The choir from Hereford Cathedral then perform.Although the event takes place every year, this year has added poignancy given it is the 75th anniversary of the D-Day landings. The guests were played in by the Band of the RAF Regiment. Then, welcome speeches were read out by The Venerable (Air Vice-Marshal) John R Ellis, Monseigneur Jean-Claude Boulanger, and Cardinal Marc Ouellet.Defence Secretary Penny Mordaunt, First Minister of Scotland Nicola Sturgeon,  and shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry are also attending the service of  remembrance in Bayeux. At the start of the service, a message on behalf of Pope Francis was read by Cardinal Marc Ouellet.He said D-Day was decisive in the fight against Nazi barbarism and paid tribute to those who joined the Army and gave their lives for freedom and peace.After the welcoming speeches, the guests sang the first hymn.In this first town liberated by the allied forces, The Royal British Legion will hold a cathedral service attended by Their Royal Highnesses The Prince of Wales and The Duchess of Cornwall and the Prime Minister.32 Engineer Regiment will lead a triservice Guard of Honour at the Bayeux Cathedral service which will have musical Events on Thursday 6 June 8 support from the Band of the RAF Regiment.The Catholic Notre-Dame de Bayeux Cathedral is dedicated to Our Lady of the Assumption.Its construction began during the Romanesque period and its dedication was celebrated on 14 July 1077.Our reporter Steve Bird is in Courseulles-sur-Mer. Here is his report.In Courseulles-sur-Mer, hundreds of people attended a special ceremony to mark 75 years since Canadian troops became the first wave of allied forces to land on Juno beach 75 years ago. Houses and shops lining the streets leading to the seafront were adorned with British, Canadian, American and French flags. American World War II-style jeeps and motorbikes were driven into the ceremony to applause from some passers by.Bus loads of schoolchildren were also arriving to attend the event. The Prince of Wales and his wife the Duchess of Cornwall have arrived at Bayeux Cathedral for a service, which is due to start shortly. The Prince of Wales is wearing a number of military medals at the D-Day commemorative service.They include: the Queen\u0027s Service Order, New Zealand, the Canadian Forces decoration, the New Zealand commemorative medal, the long service good conduct medal, and medals marking the Queen\u0027s coronation and jubilees.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has also arrived. Our Defence Correspondent Dominic Nicholls watched the ceremony at Ver-sur-Mer. Here is his take on the commemorations. Theresa May and Emmanuel Macron take a moment to look out to sea in NormandyAs a calm tide lapped against what was Gold Beach on D-Day, Theresa May and Emmanuel Macron spoke at the inauguration of the Normandy Memorial. Theresa May said: “If one day can be said to have determined the fate of generations to come, in France, in Britain, in Europe and the world, that day was the sixth of June 1944”. She paid tribute to “the greatest generation”, saying its “unconquerable spirit shaped our post-war world. “They didn’t boast, they didn’t fuss, they served. They did their duty. And they laid down their lives so that we may have a better life and build a better world”. Speaking in English, President Macron said “We owe our freedom to this. And whatever it takes we will never surrender. And whatever it takes we will always stand together. Because this is our common destiny”. With a nod to Brexit, he continued in French: Nothing can ever break ties that have been bound in bloodshed and shared values. The debates taking place today cannot affect the strength of our joint history and shared future.In a personal message to Theresa May, he said: Leaders May come and go, but their achievements remain. The force of our friendship will outlast current events. I believe that we can be proud of our actions at the bilateral level, and the causes we have defended at the international level.The Normandy Memorial cost £20million and was funded from LIBOR dunes levied against the banking sector. Here is the text of the speech delivered by Prime Minister Theresa May alongside French President Emmanuel Macron at the inauguration of the British Normandy Memorial.She said: Thank you President Macron for your support to ensure a lasting monument to the service and sacrifice of those who fought in the Battle of Normandy - something which means so much to our veteran community and to the whole of the British nation.It is incredibly moving to be here today, looking out across beaches where one of the greatest battles for freedom this world has ever known took place - and it is truly humbling to do so with the men who were there that day.It is an honour for all of us to share this moment with you.Standing here, as the waves wash quietly onto the shore, it\u0027s almost impossible to grasp the raw courage that it must have taken that day to leap out from landing craft and into the surf - despite the fury of battle.No one could be certain what June 6 would bring. No one would know how this - the most ambitious - amphibious and airborne assault in all of human history, would turn out.And, as the sun rose that morning, not one of the troops on the landing craft approaching these shores, not one of the pilots in the skies above, not one of the sailors at sea - knew whether they would still be alive when it set once again.If one day can be said to have determined the fate of generations to come - in France, in Britain, in Europe and the world - that day was June 6, 1944.More than 156,000 men landed on D-Day - of which 83,000 were from Britain and the Commonwealth.Over a quarter million more supported operations from air and sea - while the French Resistance carried out extraordinary acts of bravery behind enemy lines. Many were terribly wounded.And many more made the ultimate sacrifice that day and in the fierce fighting that followed, as together our allied nations sought to release Europe from the grip of fascism.Theresa May delivering her speechMen like Lieutenant Den Brotheridge of the Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry. Twenty-eight years old. Husband. Father-to-be. Thought to be the first Allied soldier to be killed in action after leading the charge over Pegasus Bridge.Marine Commando Robert Casson of 46 Royal Marine Commando, who was killed on the approach to Juno Beach, three weeks before his brother Private Joseph Casson was also killed in Normandy.And twins Robert and Charles Guy, 21, who both served in the RAF and were shot down and buried separately. Their names will now be reunited here.These young men belonged to a very special generation, the greatest generation.A generation whose unconquerable spirit shaped the post-war world. They didn\u0027t boast. They didn\u0027t fuss. They served.And they laid down their lives so that we might have a better life and build a better world.The memorial that will be built here will remind us of this. Of the service and sacrifice of those who fell under British Command in Normandy, of the price paid by French civilians - and of our duty, and our responsibility, to now carry the torch for freedom, for peace and for democracy.Theresa May closing her speechI want to thank all those involved in this memorial. George Batts and the veterans who have campaigned so hard to make it happen. The people of Ver-sur-Mer, and Phillipe Onillon the town\u0027s mayor.Here in Normandy, the names of those British men and women who gave their lives in defence of freedom, will forever sit opposite their homeland across the Channel.Here in Normandy, we will always remember their courage, their commitment, their conviction.And to our veterans, here in Normandy, I want to say the only words we can: thank you.Scotland\u0027s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, who is attending commemorative  events in Bayeux, tweeted: Beautiful morning in Bayeux as we prepare to  remember those who landed on the beaches 75 years ago today to liberate France  and Europe from Nazi occupation. There was a touching moment as Emmanuel Macron handed over to Theresa May between their speeches at Ver-sur-Mer. Prime Minister Theresa May and French President Emmanuel Macron In his speech, the French President said: Leaders may come and go but their achievements remain. The force of our friendship will outlast current events.Talking to Mrs May, he says: It has been a pleasure to work alongside you, before the pair embraced.They didn\u0027t quite burst into a hug - but it was as close as it could be. Veterans and their families are arriving for a service of remembrance at Bayeux Cathedral.They will be joined by Prime Minister Theresa May, and the Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall for the commemoration marking 75 years since D-Day.Joe Shute is there for The . He says: Villages surrounding Bayeux have adorned flagpoles with images of fallen soldiers of the Normandy landings.The flags of all the Allied countries who led the invasion are fluttering while Flanders poppies - that potent symbol of remembrance - are in bloom along the roadside verges. As Theresa May and Emmanuel Macron leave Ver-sur-Mer, the next big event is at Bayeux Cathedral. Joe Shute reports from France. Today the Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall will join veterans at the Royal British Legion service of remembrance at Bayeux Cathedral and neighbouring cemetery.They will be attended by Prime Minister Theresa May and the French President Emmanual Macron alongside150 veterans of the Normandy campaign.On June 7, 1945, Bayeux was the first French city to be liberated following the D Day invasion and the cemetery contains the graves of 4,144 Allied soldiers making it the largest in the region.The city was liberated by the 50th Northumbrian Division who had landed on Gold Beach. The men of the 50th Northumbrian are remembered on a plaque opposite the city cathedral.John Cornwall, 92, was a 17-year-old private with the North Gloucesteshire Regiment on the day and among the troops that helped seize the city.Like many of those to take part in the Normandy Landings he lied about his age in order to sign up.When we arrived people were waving flags cheering and handing us drinks, he recalls. The city was a big army depot for the Germans but they knew we were coming and mostly left it to us apart from a few snipers.Cornwall has numerous comrades buried in Bayeux as well as the surrounding cemeteries. I have come every year for the last 40 years, he says. It is always very emotional.Our news reporter Phoebe Southworth is in Arrmomanches-les-Bains. Here is her report from the morning\u0027s proceedings.At 6.26am UK time this morning, the exact minute the first British troops landed on the beaches of Normandy in 1944, Lone Piper Major Trevor Macey-Lillie performed to crowds from on top of a concrete section on Mulberry Harbour in Arromanches-les-Bains.Spectators have gathered on the shores among hundreds of military vehicles bearing Union flags, which will be paraded across the shores and up through the harbour at 9.30am.Women wearing war-era style dress jived on the beach as live singers entertained the crowds with French and English tracks.The Prime Minister is now talking to D-Day veterans, shaking hands with them and sharing stories. Theresa May meeting the veteransTheresa May and Emmanuel Macron have laid a wreath on the first stone of the Ver-sur-Mer memorial, which sits in front of a new statue of three D-Day soldiers.Laying of the wreathLa Marseillaise then rings out from a brass band, followed by God Save The Queen.Veterans then lay their own wreath and salute the statue. Seven British D-Day veterans were accompanied by four children, including Sir Winston Churchill\u0027s great-great grandson John Churchill, to lay flowers in front of a sculpture at the memorial depicting three British soldiers storming the beaches.It was created by David Williams-Ellis to mark the beginning of construction for the memorial, which is expected to be completed within a year.The ceremony concluded with a piped lament from Trooper Kurtis Rankin of The Royal Dragoon Guards.The Prime Minister has closed her speech in Ver-sur-Mer. She said: Here in Normandy, the names of those British men and women who lost their lives will forever sit across The Channel from their homeland. We\u0027ll always remember their courage and conviction. And to the veterans that are here today - I want to say the only two words I can: Thank you.Prime Minister says it is humbling to be in France today. Says it\u0027s impossible to imagine the raw courage it took for D-Day veterans to land on the beaches. Thank you for your service and your sacrifice, she adds.Mrs May said the Battle of Normandy is Something that means so much to the veterans\u0027 community and the British nation.She adds: It\u0027s incredibly moving to be here today, looking out over the beaches where one of the greatest battles for freedom this world has ever known took place.And it is truly humbling to do so with the men who were there that day.It\u0027s an honour for all of us to share this moment with you.Mrs May continued: Standing here as the waves wash quietly onto the shore below us, it is almost impossible to grasp the raw courage it must have taken that day to leap from the landing craft and into the surf despite the fury of battle...If one day can be said to have determined the fate of generations to come in France, in Britain, in Europe and the world, that day was June 6, 1944.The Normandy Memorial Trust’s statue can be seen behind the speakers at Ver-sur-Mer.Later, the first stone of the future memorial will be laid, in the presence of veterans, British Prime Minister Theresa May and French Prime Minister Emmanuel Macron. Once fully built the British Normandy Memorial will record the names of those under British command who lost their lives in Normandy between the D-Day landings and 31 August 1944. Also honoured will be the tens of thousands of French citizens who lost their lives during the period.The French President is up to talk to the gathered crowd.Addressing the audience, President Macron said: I am honoured to stand alongside Theresa May today to launch construction work for the British memorial at Ver-sur-Mer.The British people have long dreamt of this memorial.He added: This is where, 75 years ago, on June 6, 1944, almost 25,000 British soldiers landed in France to free the country from Nazi control.This is where young men, many of whom had never set foot on French soil, landed at dawn under German fire, risking their lives while fighting their way up the beach, which was littered with obstacles and mines.He added: It is time to remedy the fact that no memorial pays tribute to the United Kingdom\u0027s contribution to the Battle of Normandy.He said the monument would also be a symbol of the ties binding France and the UK.He said: Nothing will break them. Nothing can ever break ties that have been bound in bloodshed and shared values.The debates taking place today cannot affect the strength of our joint history and our shared future.President Macron assured Mrs May of his friendship, adding: Leaders may come and go but their achievements remain.The force of our friendship will outlast current events.Talking to Theresa May, he says: It has been a pleasure to work alongside you, before the pair embrace.Private Liam Dawson is now giving a reading.His father and uncle were both in the Green Howards, a predecessor of the modern-day Yorkshire Regiment.The Green Howards were a key regiment during the D-Day invasion and Stanley Hollis of the Green Howards won the only VC of D-Day a short distance from the memorial site. Liam joined the British Army in 2017 at the age of eighteen.He joined 2nd Battalion the Yorkshire Regiment and has recently served overseas in Kabul, Afghanistan.Several D-Day veterans are at Ver-sur-Mer to drink in the commemorations. The ceremony has begun in France in Ver-sur-Mer.On 6 June 1944 the British 50th Infantry Division landed at Ver-sur-Mer as part of Operation Overlord.The commune of Ver-sur-Mer in Calvados is located along Gold Beach and is currently the town chosen to host the main British monument of the Normandy landings.And just like that - here he is. Emmanuel Macron and Theresa May Theresa May is waiting at Ver-sur-Mer for her French counterpart ahead of today\u0027s D-Day commemorations. Today is the 75th anniversary of the landings. The British Prime Minister is ready and waiting in France. The Prime Minister is waiting for Mr Macron at Ver-sur-Mer.To fully understand just how remarkable the achievement of D-Day and the Normandy campaign that followed was, it is worth casting the net back four years to that darkest hour, June 1940.Britain and France had declared war against Germany, confident that they had the resources, wealth, and global reach to stop Hitler and the tide of Nazism.For all Germany’s grandstanding and military drum-beating, Hitler’s Reich lay at the heart of Europe, with little access to the world’s oceans, with neither a decent navy nor merchant navy and therefore lacked the resources needed to conduct a modern war.Britain’s Royal Navy immediately imposed an economic blockade while France mobilised its vast army of millions. Britain and France, admittedly apprehensive, nonetheless expected to prevail.By June 1940, such hopes had been shattered. German shock and awe had delivered its Blitzkrieg, mighty France had crumbled and the forces of totalitarianism and nationalism were sweeping across.Read the full article.The invasion force was not only the greatest assembled in history but D-Day was an exceptional feat of arms, logistics and leadership that relied upon meticulous planning, phenomenal levels of secrecy and disinformation and the closest possible co-operation between Britain and her Allies, especially those from across the Atlantic.This emphasis on collaboration, without which D-Day could not have happened, has been to the fore once again in recent days with the state visit to the UK of Donald Trump. The US president is seen as an iconoclast when it comes to supporting the post-war global order and its multilateral institutions like the UN and Nato.President of the United States, Donald Trump reads from the 32nd U.S. President President Franklin D. Roosevelt\u0026#39s prayer to the US on stage during the D-Day CommemorationsMany European leaders will hope his presence at the D-Day commemorations will have modified his protectionist instincts, though the best way they can achieve that is to pay a greater share of the cost of their own defence.Read the full editorial. Today\u0027s commemorations have kicked off with the tradition of a lone piper playing a lament on the remaining Mulberry Harbour in the Normandy town called Port Winston.Standing atop the structure, Pipe Major Trevor Macey-Lillie, of 19th Regiment Royal Artillery (The Scottish Gunners) performed Highland Laddie at 7.25am local time,  signalling the minute the invasion began and the moment the first British soldier landed on Gold beach.Crowds gathered on the beach below him and lined the promenade, applauding his performance.Afterwards his performance on Arromanches beach, Pipe Major Macey-Lillie said:  That was nerve wracking to do but I feel very proud and it was a privilege to  do it.Pipe Major Trevor Macey-Lillie of the Scots Royal artillery performs at Mulberry harbour More than 300 veterans will be flocking to the town of Arromanches for a series of events on Wednesday to mark the 75th anniversary of D-Day.Just as in the UK, the D-Day anniversary featured on the front pages of many newspapers in France and Germany on Thursday.Le Figaro: The morning of freedomAalener Nachrichten: Merkel and the \u0026#39gift of the story\u0026#39Allgäuer Anzeigeblatt: A beach in JuneD-Day veterans and other people are marking exactly 75 years since the invasion of Normandy that helped change the course of the Second World War.As the sun rose on  Thursday over Omaha Beach, about 100 people gathered at dawn on the edge of the waters that ran red here on June 6, 1944, the first of five code-named beaches where Allied forces came ashore to push the Nazis out of France.World War II reenactors stand looking out to sea on Omaha Beach, in Normandy, France, at dawnAmerican Richard Clapp said it was sobering to admire the beautiful sunrise where Allied troops came ashore.Norwegian Sigrid Flaata drove from Oslo in a 1942 restored jeep to honour the soldiers who died on D-Day.Belgian Filip Van Hecke called his journey a small effort to pay homage.It\u0027s an early start today as a host of ceremonies and events are due to take place to mark D-Day. 06:25:  A lone piper from 19th Regiment Royal Artillery will play on the Mulberry Harbour in Arromanches-les-Bains to mark 75 years to the minute since the first British soldier landed and the start  of the amphibious invasion of Gold Beach.Lone Piper Major Trevor Macey-Lillie 19th Regiment RA (The Scottish Gunners) rehearses at the Mulberry Harbour07:30:  Normandy Memorial inauguration ceremony at Ver-sur-Mer.

Here\u0027s whyClick to followThe IndependentSir Philip Green plans to continue with efforts to restructure his Arcadia Group over the coming daysThe rule in the City is you don’t hold a vote you can’t win.\u0026nbspThe adjournment of today’s crunch Arcadia creditors’ meeting to discuss the Company Voluntary Arrangement proposed by Sir Philip Green needs to be seen in that context.\u0026nbspReports through the day indicated significant resistance from landlords.\u0026nbspGreen told to fund Arcadia\u0027s \u0027worrying\u0027 pension deficit with own moneySir Philip Green\u0027s Arcadia Group confirms slew of shop closuresIn the past, the big ones have been inclined to back CVAs - a form of insolvency that allows struggling retailers to secure rent reductions and the closure of unprofitable stores.\u0026nbspIn the current climate the reasoning has been that you either accept less or get nothing. Landlords don’t exactly have queues of replacement tenants lining up outside their doors and it’s usually the smaller owners in smaller towns with less clout that end up with nothing through the closure plans.\u0026nbspThe tycoon had secured the support of British Land and Hammerson and (crucially) pensions watchdogs, but Intu, the big shopping centre owner, said no and so did others.\u0026nbspWith the plans requiring 75 per cent support to go through, their\u0026nbspchances looked more and more slim as the day went on.What made this one so different to the other CVAs\u0026nbspand restructurings that have gone through?\u0026nbspLandlords, including big ones, have been getting increasingly fed up\u0026nbspof retailers putting the burden of their difficulties on to their shoulders.\u0026nbspThey also reasoned that if Sir Philip secured the big rental discounts he\u0027s after then other tenants would demand the same, and perhaps threaten to follow him down the CVA route in time.\u0026nbspIt’s fair to question the role he personally played in all this too, with his aggressive, abrasive style of doing business and the demands he’s made of landlords in the past. This could have contributed to the reluctance of some to give any quarter now he needs their help.

With car maker\u0026nbspFord shutting its engine plant down there, at the direct cost of 1,700 jobs, not to mention all the roles that will be lost in the supply chain, the future for the town looks bleak.\u0026nbspAll that talk about the so called special relationship with the US with Donald Trump in town and yet South Wales is losing out to Mexico.\u0026nbspThat’s where the cost advantage lies.\u0026nbspFord to close Bridgend plant in 2020 with loss of 1,700 jobsFears Ford factory could close costing 1,500 jobsFord warns no-deal Brexit will force it to reconsider UK presenceFord is apparently saying it isn’t Brexit. And maybe Bridgend would have been doomed without it. But the company has previously warned that it would have to consider its UK presence in the event of no deal.The problem with Brexit\u0026nbspis that it imposes a cost penalty on every manufacturer in Britain.\u0026nbspThat penalty is theoretical at the moment because we aren\u0027t yet out of the union. But companies like Ford have to look years into the future and without any clear idea about how it will all end up they’re reliant on worst case scenarios, such as the imposition WTO style tariffs on goods going in either direction.\u0026nbspWhere the decision on a plant is a marginal one, and even a not so marginal one, Brexit will inevitably tip things over the edge. There is clear evidence that it is already playing a deeply detrimental a role when it comes to decisions about investment\u0026nbspmanufacturers are making.Earlier this week,\u0026nbspEY’s regular report into foreign direct investment found a\u0026nbsp35 per cent fall in the money coming into UK manufacturing when compared to 2017.

There are Jaguar’s woes, the closure of Honda’s plant in Swindon, the Sword of Damocles hanging over British Steel.\u0026nbspSet against that, the government’s much vaunted industrial strategy would be considered a miserable failure except that, as events have rather served to prove, it doesn’t really have one.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.110 No deal, no tariffsThe government has announced that it would slash almost all tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit.

It is still an important part of the UK economy.

The US car maker confirmed that it had started a consultation on the potential closure of its\u0026nbspWelsh plant on Thursday.\u0026nbspStuart Rowley, president of\u0026nbspFord of Europe said he had had to take difficult decisions in order to make the business sustainable.\u0026nbsp“We are committed to the UK however, changing customer demand and cost disadvantages, plus an absence of additional engine models for Bridgend going forward make the plant economically unsustainable in the years ahead.”He added: We recognise the effects it would have on their families and the communities where they live and, as a responsible employer, we are proposing a plan that would help to ease the impact.”It comes as another severe blow for Britain\u0027s car industry which has seen manufacturers including Nissan, Honda\u0026nbspand Jaguar Land Rover all scale back their operations in the face of Brexit uncertainty and a tough global market.Created with Sketch.

The company provides automotive and and industrial parts worldwide and the Llanelli plant employs over 200 people. Juergen Ziegler, chief executive for Europe, said that while Brexit was not the only factor, it has brought forward the decision to relocateThe number of cars built in the UK in April plummeted by almost half compared with a year ago, with the drop exacerbated by manufacturers bringing forward summer production stoppages in anticipation of a Brexit\u0026nbspthat was ultimately postponed.Unions described the news as a hammer blow for the community in Bridgend and a grotesque act of economic betrayal.The GMB union released analysis on Thursday showing that the UK has lost half a million manufacturing jobs over the past decade.Ford has announced thousands of job cuts globally\u0026nbspthis year, largely affecting white collar workers, as the company\u0026nbspseeks to shed unprofitable parts of its business.Until recently the company\u0027s\u0026nbspUK factories had not been thought to be immediately at risk as part of those plans.However, it is understood Ford did not replace a major contract to build engines for Jaguar Land Rover\u0026nbspat the\u0026nbspBridgend plant. That work comes to an end next year.Ford also operates a diesel engine plant at Dagenham, east London, and another factory making transmissions in Halewood, near\u0026nbspLiverpool.The Bridgend plant has been under threat because of falling demand for the two engines it makes, and lower projections for the Dragon engine it is scheduled to start making this year. It has been manufacturing engines for 40 years.\u0026nbspFord\u0027s European profits plummeted 82 per cent last year, in part because of a fall in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote in June 2016.GMB Union regional organiser Jeff Beck said:\u0026nbsp “Regardless of today’s announcement GMB will continue to work with Ford, our sister unions and the Welsh Government to find a solution to the issue and mitigate the effects of this devastating news.Brexit could mean more robots in UK manufacturingBrexit prompts slowdown in manufacturing as firms shun UK Video reveals how car manufacturing has changed over 50 yearsBrexit causes record rise in stockpiling“What makes it worse is Donald Trump is in this country talking about a possible trade deal between the UK and the US - yet\u0026nbsp when the plant closes the new line is likely to be produced in Mexico by an American company.Len McCluskey, Unite union general secretary, said: Ford’s decision to shut its Bridgend engine plant in 2020 is a grotesque act of economic betrayal.“These workers and this community have stayed faithful to Ford, as have UK customers - this is still Ford’s largest European market - through thick and thin, but have been treated disgracefully in return by this company.“Ford broke promise after promise to the UK. First, it was that it would build 500,000 engines at Bridgend. That fell to a quarter of a million, then fell again and again to now just 80,000. The company has deliberately run down its UK operations so that now not a single Ford vehicle - car or van - is made in the UK.The Prime Minister\u0027s official spokesman said: I am aware of the reports and I understand that they will be very worrying for workers at Bridgend but the reports are unconfirmed by the company so it is not appropriate for me to speculate or comment further at this time.“Former Welsh Government leader Carwyn Jones, currently Assembly Member for Bridgend, told the Press Association: “This has all been very sudden. There was no warning about this at all. It seems to me that any decision, whatever that decision is, would have been taken very recently.“It\u0027s the biggest single employer in the area, I remember it being built in the late 70s. There are relatively few suppliers locally but there are a number of businesses that provide services for the plant itself and they would be severely affected because for a lot of them this is the only contract they have.”Ford announced last month it was cutting 7,000 white collar jobs worldwide, with up to 550 expected in the UK.The US manufacturer said the cuts represented 10 per cent of its global salaried workforce and 20 per cent of its management positions.A spokesperson for Unite said: “Our priority is our members’ jobs, the communities and livelihoods in the supply chain that Ford Bridgend supports.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We believe that with this adjournment, there is a reasonable prospect of reaching an agreement that the majority of landlords will support.”Shopping centre owner Intu told Arcadia\u0026nbspon Wednesday that it will not back proposals to slash rents and close around 50 stores.Created with Sketch.

House of FraserHomebase has recently dropped the Bunnings association from its storesHowever, big landlords including British Land and Hammerson are said to have backed Arcadia\u0027s Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA), with others still wavering.Intu, which owns the Trafford centre in Manchester and Lakeside in Essex, counts Arcadia brands as tenants in 35 of its units.Intu reportedly refused\u0026nbspto back the plans because it would have to justify the rent cuts to other tenants.Landlords are cautious about offering discounts to certain tenants at a time when many retailers under pressure from falling sales, high rents, business rates and increasing wages.\u0026nbspArcadia, which owns brands including Topshop, Miss Selfridge, Evans and Burton had planned to shut 50 UK stores and cut rents on another 194.\u0026nbspJonathan De Mello, a director at retail consultancy Harper Dennis Hobbs, said large landlords feel that Sir Philip has already “played hardball” over rent rises in the past. “The CVA proposal comes in addition to that.\u0026nbsp“Landlords feel that Philip Green wants to get out of certain liabilities but they feel they have reduced rents enough.”If Sir Philip\u0027s Arcadia group\u0026nbspwere to enter administration it would become the most high-profile in a series of retail collapses.Debenhams\u0026nbspand House of Fraser, have called in the administrators in recent months, while Toys R\u0027 Us and Maplin have disappeared completely.Sir Philip Green\u0027s Arcadia Group confirms slew of shop closuresSir Philip, once lauded as the king of the high street, cleared a major hurdle on Tuesday after receiving the backing of the Pensions Regulator (TPR) for his rescue plans.The retail mogul agreed to inject\u0026nbspan additional £25m into Arcadia\u0027s\u0026nbsppension fund, taking the total\u0026nbspamount pledged in cash and security to more than £300m.News of\u0026nbspthe agreement came shortly after the watchdog ordered Sir Philip to pay in an extra £50m\u0026nbspin order to secure its support for\u0026nbspArcadia\u0027s CVA.Arcadia said Lady Green, the group\u0027s ultimate owner, had signed off the additional cash.The Pensions Regulator said: Following extensive discussions with the company, shareholders, the trustees of the pension schemes, the PPF and advisers, we are pleased that additional security has been agreed in support for the pension schemes which brings the total security value to £210m.This is in addition to agreed contributions of £100m to be paid to the schemes by Lady Green.Given this enhanced level of support, we now consider the updated CVA proposals are sufficient because they provide better protection for scheme members in these difficult circumstances.We recognise that the best support for any pension scheme is a trading employer and we feel the CVA proposals now provide the right balance between security for the pension schemes and the chance of sustainability for the company.The Pension Protection Fund (PPF) is due to vote on whether to support the scheme on Wednesday.Arcadia\u0027s brands have struggled to keep up with changing fashion trends and competition from Primark as well as online rivals.Critics have accused Sir Philip of underinvesting in the group\u0027s stores.

The US car maker confirmed that it had started a consultation on the potential closure of its\u0026nbspWelsh plant on Thursday.\u0026nbspStuart Rowley, president of\u0026nbspFord of Europe said he had had to take difficult decisions in order to make the business sustainable.\u0026nbsp“We are committed to the UK however, changing customer demand and cost disadvantages, plus an absence of additional engine models for Bridgend going forward make the plant economically unsustainable in the years ahead.”He added: We recognise the effects it would have on their families and the communities where they live and, as a responsible employer, we are proposing a plan that would help to ease the impact.”It comes as another severe blow for Britain\u0027s car industry which has seen manufacturers including Nissan, Honda\u0026nbspand Jaguar Land Rover all scale back their operations in the face of Brexit uncertainty and a tough global market.Created with Sketch.

Juergen Ziegler, chief executive for Europe, said that while Brexit was not the only factor, it has brought forward the decision to relocateThe number of cars built in the UK in April plummeted by almost half compared with a year ago, with the drop exacerbated by manufacturers bringing forward summer production stoppages in anticipation of a Brexit\u0026nbspthat was ultimately postponed.Unions described the news as a hammer blow for the community in Bridgend and a grotesque act of economic betrayal.The GMB union released analysis on Thursday showing that the UK has lost half a million manufacturing jobs over the past decade.Ford has announced thousands of job cuts globally\u0026nbspthis year, largely affecting white collar workers, as the company\u0026nbspseeks to shed unprofitable parts of its business.Until recently the company\u0027s\u0026nbspUK factories had not been thought to be immediately at risk as part of those plans.However, it is understood Ford did not replace a major contract to build engines for Jaguar Land Rover\u0026nbspat the\u0026nbspBridgend plant. That work comes to an end next year.Ford also operates a diesel engine plant at Dagenham, east London, and another factory making transmissions in Halewood, near\u0026nbspLiverpool.The Bridgend plant has been under threat because of falling demand for the two engines it makes, and lower projections for the Dragon engine it is scheduled to start making this year. It has been manufacturing engines for 40 years.\u0026nbspFord\u0027s European profits plummeted 82 per cent last year, in part because of a fall in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote in June 2016.GMB Union regional organiser Jeff Beck said:\u0026nbsp “Regardless of today’s announcement GMB will continue to work with Ford, our sister unions and the Welsh Government to find a solution to the issue and mitigate the effects of this devastating news.Brexit could mean more robots in UK manufacturingBrexit prompts slowdown in manufacturing as firms shun UK Video reveals how car manufacturing has changed over 50 yearsBrexit causes record rise in stockpiling“What makes it worse is Donald Trump is in this country talking about a possible trade deal between the UK and the US - yet\u0026nbsp when the plant closes the new line is likely to be produced in Mexico by an American company.Len McCluskey, Unite union general secretary, said: Ford’s decision to shut its Bridgend engine plant in 2020 is a grotesque act of economic betrayal.“These workers and this community have stayed faithful to Ford, as have UK customers - this is still Ford’s largest European market - through thick and thin, but have been treated disgracefully in return by this company.“Ford broke promise after promise to the UK. First, it was that it would build 500,000 engines at Bridgend. That fell to a quarter of a million, then fell again and again to now just 80,000. The company has deliberately run down its UK operations so that now not a single Ford vehicle - car or van - is made in the UK.The Prime Minister\u0027s official spokesman said: I am aware of the reports and I understand that they will be very worrying for workers at Bridgend but the reports are unconfirmed by the company so it is not appropriate for me to speculate or comment further at this time.“Former Welsh Government leader Carwyn Jones, currently Assembly Member for Bridgend, told the Press Association: “This has all been very sudden. There was no warning about this at all. It seems to me that any decision, whatever that decision is, would have been taken very recently.“It\u0027s the biggest single employer in the area, I remember it being built in the late 70s. There are relatively few suppliers locally but there are a number of businesses that provide services for the plant itself and they would be severely affected because for a lot of them this is the only contract they have.”Ford announced last month it was cutting 7,000 white collar jobs worldwide, with up to 550 expected in the UK.The US manufacturer said the cuts represented 10 per cent of its global salaried workforce and 20 per cent of its management positions.A spokesperson for Unite said: “Our priority is our members’ jobs, the communities and livelihoods in the supply chain that Ford Bridgend supports.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The researchers, from Karolinska Institute in Sweden and the University of Oxford, found that the patients who had played Tetris reported fewer intrusive memories, commonly known as flashbacks, in the week that followed3644 Vaping backed as healthier nicotine alternative to cigarettes after latest studyVaping has been given an emphatic thumbs up by health experts after the first long-term study of its effects in ex-smokers.3744 Common method of cooking rice can leave traces of arsenic in food, scientists warnMillions of people are putting themselves at risk by cooking their rice incorrectly, scientists have warned.3844 Contraceptive gel that creates ‘reversible vasectomy’ shown to be effective in monkeysAn injectable contraceptive gel that acts as a ‘reversible vasectomy’ is a step closer to being offered to men following successful trials on monkeys.3944 Shift work and heavy lifting may reduce women’s fertility, study findsWomen who work at night or do irregular shifts may experience a decline in fertility, a new study has found.4044 Japanese government tells people to stop overworkingThe Japanese government has announced measures to limit the amount of overtime employees can do – in an attempt to stop people literally working themselves to death.4144 High blood pressure may protect over 80s from dementiaIt is well known that high blood pressure is a risk factor for dementia, so the results of a new study from the University of California, Irvine, are quite surprising. The researchers found that people who developed high blood pressure between the ages of 80-89 are less likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease (the most common form of dementia) over the next three years than people of the same age with normal blood pressure.4244 \u0027Universal cancer vaccine’ breakthrough claimed by expertsScientists have taken a “very positive step” towards creating a universal vaccine against cancer that makes the body’s immune system attack tumours as if they were a virus, experts have said. Writing in Nature, an international team of researchers described how they had taken pieces of cancer’s genetic RNA code, put them into tiny nanoparticles of fat and then injected the mixture into the bloodstreams of three patients in the advanced stages of the disease. The patients\u0027 immune systems responded by producing killer T-cells designed to attack cancer. The vaccine was also found to be effective in fighting “aggressively growing” tumours in mice, according to researchers, who were led by Professor Ugur Sahin from Johannes Gutenberg University in Germany4344 Research shows that diabetes drug can be used to stop first signs of Parkinson’sScientists in a new study show that the first signs of Parkinson’s can be stopped. The UCL study is still in its research period but the team are ‘excited’. Today’s Parkinson’s drugs manage the symptoms of the disease but ultimately do not stop its progression in the brain.4444 Drinking alcohol could reduce risk of diabetesA new study shows that drinking alcohol three to four days a week could reduce the risk of diabetes. Wine was found to be most effective in reducing the risk due to the chemical compounds that balance blood sugar levels. 144 Junk food ads could be banned before watershedJunk food adverts on TV and online could be banned before 9pm as part of Government plans to fight the epidemic of childhood obesity.244 Breeding with neanderthals helped humans fight diseasesOn migrating from Africa around 70,000 years ago, humans bumped into the neanderthals of Eurasia. While humans were weak to the diseases of the new lands, breeding with the resident neanderthals made for a better equipped immune system344 Cancer breath test to be trialled in BritainThe breath biopsy device is designed to detect cancer hallmarks in molecules exhaled by patients444 Average 10 year old has consumed the recommended amount of sugar for an adult By their 10th birthdy, children have on average already eaten more sugar than the recommended amount for an 18 year old. The average 10 year old consumes the equivalent to 13 sugar cubes a day, 8 more than is recommendedWhile there is not enough evidence of harm to recommend UK-wide limits on screen use, the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health have advised that children should avoid screens for an hour before bed time to avoid disrupting their sleep644 Daily aspirin is unnecessary for older people in good health, study findsA study published in the New England Journal of Medicine has found that many elderly people are taking daily aspirin to little or no avail744 Vaping could lead to cancer, US study findsA study by the University of Minnesota\u0027s Masonic Cancer Centre has found that the carcinogenic chemicals formaldehyde, acrolein, and methylglyoxal are present in the saliva of E-cigarette users844 More children are obese and diabetic944 Most child antidepressants are ineffective and can lead to suicidal thoughtsThe majority of antidepressants are ineffective and may be unsafe, for children and teenager with major depression, experts have warned. In what is the most comprehensive comparison of 14 commonly prescribed antidepressant drugs to date, researchers found that only one brand was more effective at relieving symptoms of depression than a placebo. Another popular drug, venlafaxine, was shown increase the risk users engaging in suicidal thoughts and attempts at suicide1044 Gay, lesbian and bisexual adults at higher risk of heart disease, study claimsResearchers at the Baptist Health South Florida Clinic in Miami  focused on seven areas of controllable heart health and found these minority groups were particularly likely to be smokers and to have poorly controlled blood sugar1144 Breakfast cereals targeted at children contain \u0027steadily high\u0027 sugar levels since 1992 despite producer claimsA major pressure group has issued a fresh warning about perilously high amounts of sugar in breakfast cereals, specifically those designed for children, and has said that levels have barely been cut at all in the last two and a half decadesNew guidance by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), the body which determines what treatment the NHS should fund, said lax road repairs and car-dominated streets were contributing to the obesity epidemic by preventing members of the public from keeping active1344 New menopause drugs offer women relief from \u0027debilitating\u0027 hot flushesA new class of treatments for women going through the menopause is able to reduce numbers of debilitating hot flushes by as much as three quarters in a matter of days, a trial has found.1444 Doctors should prescribe more antidepressants for people with mental health problems, study findsResearch from Oxford University found that more than one million extra people suffering from mental health problems would benefit from being prescribed drugs and criticised “ideological” reasons doctors use to avoid doing so.1544 Student dies of flu after NHS advice to stay at home and avoid A\u0026ampEThe family of a teenager who died from flu has urged people not to delay going to A\u0026ampE if they are worried about their symptoms. Melissa Whiteley, an 18-year-old engineering student from Hanford in Stoke-on-Trent, fell ill at Christmas and died in hospital a month later.1644 Government to review thousands of harmful vaginal mesh implantsThe Government has pledged to review tens of thousands of cases where women have been given harmful vaginal mesh implants.1744 Jeremy Hunt announces \u0027zero suicides ambition\u0027 for the NHSThe NHS will be asked to go further to prevent the deaths of patients in its care as part of a “zero suicide ambition” being launched today.1844 Human trials start with cancer treatment that primes immune system to kill off tumoursHuman trials have begun with a new cancer therapy that can prime the immune system to eradicate tumours. The treatment, that works similarly to a vaccine, is a combination of two existing drugs, of which tiny amounts are injected into the solid bulk of a tumour. 1944 Babies\u0027 health suffers from being born near fracking sites, finds major studyMothers living within a kilometre of a fracking site were 25 per cent more likely to have a child born at low birth weight, which increase their chances of asthma, ADHD and other issues2044 NHS reviewing thousands of cervical cancer smear tests after women wrongly given all-clearThousands of cervical cancer screening results are under review after failings at a laboratory meant some women were incorrectly given the all-clear. A number of women have already been told to contact their doctors following the identification of “procedural issues” in the service provided by Pathology First Laboratory.2144 Potential key to halting breast cancer\u0027s spread discovered by scientistsMost breast cancer patients do not die from their initial tumour, but from secondary malignant growths (metastases), where cancer cells are able to enter the blood and survive to invade new sites. Asparagine, a molecule named after asparagus where it was first identified in high quantities, has now been shown to be an essential ingredient for tumour cells to gain these migratory properties.2244 NHS nursing vacancies at record high with more than 34,000 roles advertisedA record number of nursing and midwifery positions are currently being advertised by the NHS, with more than 34,000 positions currently vacant, according to the latest data. Demand for nurses was 19 per cent higher between July and September 2017 than the same period two years ago.2344 Cannabis extract could provide ‘new class of treatment’ for psychosisCBD has a broadly opposite effect to delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main active component  in cannabis and the substance that causes paranoia and anxiety.2444 Over 75,000 sign petition calling for Richard Branson\u0027s Virgin Care to hand settlement money back to NHSMr Branson’s company sued the NHS last year after it lost out on an £82m contract to provide children’s health services across Surrey, citing concerns over “serious flaws” in the way the contract was awarded2544 More than 700 fewer nurses training in England in first year after NHS bursary scrappedThe numbers of people accepted to study nursing in England fell 3 per cent in 2017, while the numbers accepted in Wales and Scotland, where the bursaries were kept, increased 8.4 per cent and 8 per cent respectively2644 Landmark study links Tory austerity to 120,000 deathsThe paper found that there were 45,000 more deaths in the first four years of Tory-led efficiencies than would have been expected if funding had stayed at pre-election levels.Hours of commuting may be mind-numbingly dull, but new research shows that it might also be having an adverse effect on both your health and performance at work.  Longer commutes also appear to have a significant impact on mental wellbeing, with those commuting longer 33 per cent more likely to suffer from depression2844 You cannot be fit and fatIt is not possible to be overweight and healthy, a major new study has concluded. The study of 3.5 million Britons found that even “metabolically healthy” obese people are still at a higher risk of heart disease or a stroke than those with a normal weight rangeWhen you feel particularly exhausted, it can definitely feel like you are also lacking in brain capacity. Now, a new study has suggested this could be because chronic sleep deprivation can actually cause the brain to eat itselfDavid Lloyd Gyms have launched a new health and fitness class which is essentially a bunch of people taking a nap for 45 minutes. The fitness group was spurred to launch the ‘napercise’ class after research revealed 86 per cent of parents said they were fatigued. The class is therefore predominantly aimed at parents but you actually do not have to have children to take part3144 \u0027Fundamental right to health\u0027 to be axed after Brexit, lawyers warnTobacco and alcohol companies could win more easily in court cases such as the recent battle over plain cigarette packaging if the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights is abandoned, a barrister and public health professor have said.3244 \u0027Thousands dying\u0027 due to fear over non-existent statin side-effectsA major new study into the side effects of the cholesterol-lowering medicine suggests common symptoms such as muscle pain and weakness are not caused by the drugs themselves3344 Babies born to fathers aged under 25 have higher risk of autismNew research has found that babies born to fathers under the age of 25 or over 51 are at higher risk of developing autism and other social disorders. The study, conducted by the Seaver Autism Center for Research and Treatment at Mount Sinai, found that these children are actually more advanced than their peers as infants, but then fall behind by the time they hit their teenage years.3444 Cycling to work ‘could halve risk of cancer and heart disease’Commuters who swap their car or bus pass for a bike could cut their risk of developing heart disease and cancer by almost half, new research suggests – but campaigners have warned there is still an “urgent need” to improve road conditions for cyclists.3544 Playing Tetris in hospital after a traumatic incident could prevent PTSDScientists conducted the research on 71 car crash victims as they were waiting for treatment at one hospital’s accident and emergency department.

Wine was found to be most effective in reducing the risk due to the chemical compounds that balance blood sugar levels. Urine samples were used to gauge calorie consumption at the start of the race in California, and after 20 weeks of back-to-back marathons nearing Washington DC.They found competitors were burning 600 fewer calories a day than would be predicted by their initial pace.If they had carried on at their original rate of energy expenditure the participants would not have been able to complete more than half the race.Why cardio is better for your metabolism than strength trainingHow to develop willpower according to an ultramarathon runner Man who ran 135 miles says ultramarathons make him hallucinateWhile this was the longest event where metabolic data has been evaluated, researchers\u0026nbspfound cyclists in the summer Tour de France, 100-mile marathon runners and\u0026nbspexplorers crossing Antarctica showed a similar “downshift” in energy expenditure to the 2.5-times base-rate ceiling.There was no apparent temperature effect, and researchers said this was “unexpected” as previous theories had suggested that the body’s maximum energy consumption is set by its ability to dissipate heat.The research also found pregnant mothers’ bodies burnt calories at close to 2.5-times energy-expenditure limit seen in endurance athletes, suggesting\u0026nbspthe endurance threshold applies independent of the muscles or organs involved.“Humans have evolved greater endurance capabilities than other apes, which has typically been ascribed to selection for increased physical activity, particularly long-distance running,” the authors wrote in the journal Science Advances.But raising this endurance threshold might have also had advantages in allowing\u0026nbsplonger pregnancies, or larger – more energy intensive – brains than our primate ancestors.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Yet few are likely to have as much inspiration to draw on as India-born, Zimbabwe-raised and now Peckham-based artist Rina Mushonga.On Deerhunter’s eighth album, frontman Bradford Cox takes on the role of war poet, documenting the things he observes with a cool matter-of-factness, and heart-wrenching detail. Death is everywhere on Why Hasn’t Everything Already Disappeared?, as much as others may refuse to see it.After a period of tumult, Sharon Van Etten’s fifth album is a reinvention. But beneath its hazy synths and electronics are songs of endurance and inner peace, of settling after a flurry of activity. 439 Bring Me the Horizon  – AmoBMTH frontman Oli Sykes wants to assert the fragility of the boundary between love and hate. Amo is a way of exploring that, even down to the title itself.539 Nina Nesbitt – The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will ChangeNesbitt is back with her second LP, switching to a brand of soul and R\u0026ampB-fused pop that feels bang on time, and suits her far better. The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will Change has slick, polished production from Fraser T Smith (Adele), Lostboy (Anne-Marie), Jordan Riley (Zara Larsson), and Nesbitt herself.This self-titled record, a loose but beautifully crafted collection of folk-rock songs, explores the kinds of anxieties intrinsic to the modern age – the longing to be at once noticed and invisible the paralysing effects of limitless information, and the desire to do good versus the desire to be seen doing good.The album is packed with personal confessions for the fans – “Arianators” – to pick over. It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (Helen Brown)The perma-brilliant James Blake has flooded his fourth album – Assume Form – with euphoric sepia soul and loved-up doo-wop. His trademark intelligence, honesty and pin-drop production remain intact. But the detached chorister vocals of a decade in which he battled depression have thawed to reveal a millennial Sam Cooke crooning: “Can’t believe the way we flow, way we flow, way we flow...”While he recognises his roots and includes plenty of nods to grime, AJ Tracey\u0027s magpie’s eye for a good melody or hook extends far beyond that. With the help of stellar producers like Cadenza (Kiko Bun), Swifta Beater (Kano, Giggs), and Nyge (Section Boyz, Yxng Bane), Tracey incorporates electronic music, rock, garage and even country on his most cohesive work to date.The album title of the year gives us an image of Brexit Britain trashed by Old Etonians David Cameron, Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg, but the fifth studio work from the punk duo has more than social commentary to offer. There’s some of that, as vocalist Jason Williamson skewers documentary-makers who take advantage of the poor in “Kebab Spider” – “the skint get used in loo roll shoes” – but elsewhere this is a record that expands the idea of what Sleaford Mods could be.“Do you still have that photograph? Would you use it to hurt me?” asks Australian indie rocker Julia Jacklin, against the menacing throb of “Body”. The tension is stormy: imagine a mid-period Fleetwood Mac song, covered by Cat Power. It’s a masterclass in narrative songwriting.With praise from Kendrick Lamar, five EPs released by the time she was 21, tours with Lauryn Hill, collaborations with Gorillaz and two critically praised albums – including 2017’s excellent concept album Stillness in Wonderland – fans and critics alike wondered what else Little Simz could do to find the kind of mainstream success enjoyed by so many of her male peers.1339 Solange – When I Get HomeSolange Knowles has never been coy about the intent behind her music. Beautiful arrangements and seamless production notwithstanding, you get the sense, each time she drop a project, that it serves a distinct, zeitgeist-shifting purpose.1439 Foals – Everything Not Saved Will be Lost (Part 1)FoalsMerging their asymmetrical early math pop with the deep space atmospherics of Total Life Forever and Holy Fire, plus added innovations – ambient rainforest throbs on “Moonlight”, deadpan EDM on “In Degrees”, Afro-glitch Radiohead on “Café D’Athens” – they’ve created an inspired album of scorched earth new music that, in all likelihood, will only really be challenged for album of the year by Part 2. (Mark Beaumont)Tracks are at once astute and deeply personal in how they capture vignettes of everyday life and spin them into important lessons. “Black”, the most recent single from the record, considers what that word means to different people around the world, as well as to Dave. “Voices” has him singing over an old-school garage beat, fighting off personal demons.At her best, Sigrid throws out precision-tooled high notes like icicle javelins into vast, blue Scandi-produced skies. Then she growls like an Icelandic volcano preparing to disrupt western civilisation until we sort ourselves out.1739 Karen O and Danger Mouse – Lux PrimaLux Prima was born just over a decade ago from a drunken phone call from Karen O to Danger Mouse – real name Brian Joseph Burton – during which the pair vowed they would work on something together. It wasn’t until after O had given birth to her son, though, that recording finally began, and there is a beatific sense of contentment on songs like “Drown”, with its Kamasi Washington-like choirs and stately horns.This is an ambitious creation, meticulously crafted and assembled. For a start, the range of guest performers is a cornucopia of contemporary soul and hip-hop collaborators: vocalists Moses Sumney, Roots Manuva, Heidi Vogel, Grey Reverend and Tawiah strings player Miguel Atwood-Ferguson, and keyboardist Dennis Hamm – both of whom have worked with Flying Lotus and Thundercat.Rose – who found fame in the UK’s indie-folk scene as an unofficial member of Bombay Bicycle Club in 2010, only to walk away amid the band’s growing hype – is darkly compelling on No Words Left. Assisted by producer Tim Bidwell, who worked on Rose’s last record Something’s Changing, she sounds braver than she ever has before. There are moments that recall her Communion labelmate Ben Howard, on his latest album, Noonday Dream, and others that nod to the quiet stoicism of Joni Mitchell and Neil Young. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)The record is loosely conceptual insomuch as it’s punctuated with mock adverts for “WWAY HEALTH, our 247 care programme”. But don’t be put off: Miss Universe is a brilliant collection of songs, an expansive melange of indie, jazz, pop and trip-hop that flits between a lo-fi sparseness and something The Strokes would play. Yanya – who is of Turkish-Irish-Bajan heritage – grew up in London on a mix of Pixies, Nina Simone, The Libertines and Amy Winehouse, and this unlikely combination is certainly reflected in the sound. (Patrick Smith)2139 Jenny Lewis – On the LineHere, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (Elisa Bray)Comprising songs from Segall’s eclectic (that’s putting it lightly) catalogue and performed by him and the Freedom Band (Mikal Cronin, Charles Moothart, Emmett Kelly, and Ben Boye), the album is delightfully short and sweet. It is certainly a drastic switch-up from Freedom’s Goblin (2018), which had 19 tracks and ran for 75 minutes.If you want to know how hard it is to categorise Titanic Rising – the enthralling fourth album from Weyes Blood – look no further than the American musician’s own attempt to do so. It is, she says, “The Kinks meet the Second World War, or Bob Seger meets Enya.”Tension aside, there’s a great sense of fun here. The title track is pure euphoria, as restless synths of a Utah Saints or Orbital rave break into swelling bass and melody. And they create the full club experience with “Got to Keep On”, on which the four-to-the-floor beat, funky rhythm guitar, sweet backing vocals and chiming bells make way for the simple sounds of happy party-goers just as the anticipation builds, so does the instrumentation into a hypnotic crescendo. It’s masterful production. (Elisa Bray)Six months after the release of Oxnard, Anderson .Paak returns with another Dr Dre-produced record, Ventura. Where the former was overflowing with choppy, experimental sounds, guest appearances and clumsy attempts at Gil Scott Heron-esque revolutionary lyrics, the sequel – recorded around the same time – streamlines .Paak’s sound, making for a tightly packaged, melodic and danceable album.Two years after the release of his Mercury Prize-nominated debut Yesterday’s Gone, the south London hip-hop artist unveils its follow-up, Not Waving, But Drowning. And if any two records could portray how quickly someone can grow from a boy to a man, it’s these.2739 Lizzo – Cuz I Love YouNo one could accuse Lizzo of holding back. Not when it comes to her voice – which is raw and rowdy, so laden with personality even the vulnerable moments are a joy to listen to –  and certainly not when it comes to her message of unabashed self-love. That’s the predominant theme of the singer  rapper  flautist-extraordinaire’s hugely likeable third album, Cuz I Love You.It seems as likely as Old Man Steptoe dining with the Rees-Mogg, but this new tactic of burying their confrontational gruesomeness beneath a veneer of alt-rock respectability for album three works well for Fat White Family. Drenched in chamber strings and celestial harmonies, the plush yet sinister “Oh Sebastian” could be Pet Sounds selling its soul to the devil. “Fringe Runner” is so sleek and funksome it could be a New Romantic “White Lines (Don’t Don’t Do It)” “Kim’s Sunsets” is a piece of refined cosmic reggae resembling a blissed-out “Bankrobber”.2939 Cage the Elephant – Social CuesOn Cage the Elephant’s fifth album, Social Cues, frontman Matt Shultz reacts to the breakdown of his marriage and the loss of three close friends. He undergoes a kind of Jekyll and Hyde transition through the 13 tracks, the result of which is the band’s best work to date.SOAK reaches to outsiders once again on her new album. 3139 The Cranberries – In the EndThere’s a cruel irony that the release of The Cranberries’ final album should come just a week after journalist Lyra McKee was shot dead by the New IRA during a riot in Londonderry. “Zombie” was a protest song written by the band’s late frontwoman Dolores O’Riordan after two children were killed by IRA bombs – was released. She was deeply affected by the deaths, and would no doubt have been devastated by recent events in Northern Ireland as well.On her third record, Aldous Harding combines the gothic folk of her self-titled 2014 debut with the dramatically intimate tones of her follow-up album Party.Big Thief’s frontwoman Adrianne Lenker has an uncanny ability to make you feel like you’re in on a secret. Her whispering, spectral delivery and deeply personal lyrics are the key to this. Even on the band’s third album UFOF, with an audience that has grown exponentially in the past few years, the songs are still immensely intimate affairs.On his debut album, the 24-year-old Collard mixes sultry jams that recall the electronic funk of MGMT with nods to the greats: Prince, James Brown, Led Zeppelin and Marvin Gaye. Throughout, Collard exhibits his extraordinary voice, which swoops to a devilishly low murmur or soars to an ecstatic falsetto.   Dedicated covers the full, but generic, spectrum of relationships: dizzying love, lust, and break-ups. But whether she’s pining for the return of a former love in the funky disco banger “Julien”, or singing about masturbating post-break-up in lead single “Party For One” (“I’ll be the one If you don’t care about me Making love to myself Back on my beat”), the vibe remains positively jubilant.Getty Images for Spotify3639 Tyler, the Creator - IGOR“I don’t know where I’m going,” Tyler, the Creator begins on the song “I THINK”. “But I know what I’m showing.” The US artist’s words ring true throughout his fifth studio album, IGOR, where he adopts the dark and twisted mutterings of the Frankenstein character from which the record gets its name. It’s been a long wait for Flying Lotus’s new album. In fact, the LA producer has been masterminding Flamagra for the past five years – snatching moments between collaborating with Kendrick Lamar on To Pimp a Butterfly, directing and writing the comic horror movie Kuso, producing much of Thundercat’s Drunk and growing his Brainfeeder label.A heftier sound is never at the cost of melody, which shines through in Thomson’s vocals, the rest of the band’s backing falsetto, and the searing blues grooves stamped all over Future Dust. Those qualities are captured nowhere more satisfyingly than on “25”. “All Over Town” is their singalong anthem, neatly positioned in the middle to ease the pace.In keeping with the relatively restrained guest spots, it’s heartening just how much Skepta has rejected overloading Ignorance is Bliss with high-profile producers, preferring instead to burrow into his own aesthetic. There’s no attempt to chase someone else’s wave here no token drill, afroswing or trap beats to satisfy playlist algorithms. Instead, his cold grime sonics are rendered down to their no-frills essentials – brutalist blocks of sad angular melodies and hard, spacious drums.It’s not uncommon for an artist to be influenced by the place they grew up in. Yet few are likely to have as much inspiration to draw on as India-born, Zimbabwe-raised and now Peckham-based artist Rina Mushonga.On Deerhunter’s eighth album, frontman Bradford Cox takes on the role of war poet, documenting the things he observes with a cool matter-of-factness, and heart-wrenching detail. Death is everywhere on Why Hasn’t Everything Already Disappeared?, as much as others may refuse to see it.After a period of tumult, Sharon Van Etten’s fifth album is a reinvention. But beneath its hazy synths and electronics are songs of endurance and inner peace, of settling after a flurry of activity. 439 Bring Me the Horizon  – AmoBMTH frontman Oli Sykes wants to assert the fragility of the boundary between love and hate. Amo is a way of exploring that, even down to the title itself.539 Nina Nesbitt – The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will ChangeNesbitt is back with her second LP, switching to a brand of soul and R\u0026ampB-fused pop that feels bang on time, and suits her far better. The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will Change has slick, polished production from Fraser T Smith (Adele), Lostboy (Anne-Marie), Jordan Riley (Zara Larsson), and Nesbitt herself.This self-titled record, a loose but beautifully crafted collection of folk-rock songs, explores the kinds of anxieties intrinsic to the modern age – the longing to be at once noticed and invisible the paralysing effects of limitless information, and the desire to do good versus the desire to be seen doing good.The album is packed with personal confessions for the fans – “Arianators” – to pick over. It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (Helen Brown)The perma-brilliant James Blake has flooded his fourth album – Assume Form – with euphoric sepia soul and loved-up doo-wop. His trademark intelligence, honesty and pin-drop production remain intact. But the detached chorister vocals of a decade in which he battled depression have thawed to reveal a millennial Sam Cooke crooning: “Can’t believe the way we flow, way we flow, way we flow...”While he recognises his roots and includes plenty of nods to grime, AJ Tracey\u0027s magpie’s eye for a good melody or hook extends far beyond that. With the help of stellar producers like Cadenza (Kiko Bun), Swifta Beater (Kano, Giggs), and Nyge (Section Boyz, Yxng Bane), Tracey incorporates electronic music, rock, garage and even country on his most cohesive work to date.The album title of the year gives us an image of Brexit Britain trashed by Old Etonians David Cameron, Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg, but the fifth studio work from the punk duo has more than social commentary to offer. There’s some of that, as vocalist Jason Williamson skewers documentary-makers who take advantage of the poor in “Kebab Spider” – “the skint get used in loo roll shoes” – but elsewhere this is a record that expands the idea of what Sleaford Mods could be.“Do you still have that photograph? Would you use it to hurt me?” asks Australian indie rocker Julia Jacklin, against the menacing throb of “Body”. The tension is stormy: imagine a mid-period Fleetwood Mac song, covered by Cat Power. It’s a masterclass in narrative songwriting.With praise from Kendrick Lamar, five EPs released by the time she was 21, tours with Lauryn Hill, collaborations with Gorillaz and two critically praised albums – including 2017’s excellent concept album Stillness in Wonderland – fans and critics alike wondered what else Little Simz could do to find the kind of mainstream success enjoyed by so many of her male peers.1339 Solange – When I Get HomeSolange Knowles has never been coy about the intent behind her music. Beautiful arrangements and seamless production notwithstanding, you get the sense, each time she drop a project, that it serves a distinct, zeitgeist-shifting purpose.1439 Foals – Everything Not Saved Will be Lost (Part 1)FoalsMerging their asymmetrical early math pop with the deep space atmospherics of Total Life Forever and Holy Fire, plus added innovations – ambient rainforest throbs on “Moonlight”, deadpan EDM on “In Degrees”, Afro-glitch Radiohead on “Café D’Athens” – they’ve created an inspired album of scorched earth new music that, in all likelihood, will only really be challenged for album of the year by Part 2. (Mark Beaumont)Tracks are at once astute and deeply personal in how they capture vignettes of everyday life and spin them into important lessons. “Black”, the most recent single from the record, considers what that word means to different people around the world, as well as to Dave. “Voices” has him singing over an old-school garage beat, fighting off personal demons.At her best, Sigrid throws out precision-tooled high notes like icicle javelins into vast, blue Scandi-produced skies. Then she growls like an Icelandic volcano preparing to disrupt western civilisation until we sort ourselves out.1739 Karen O and Danger Mouse – Lux PrimaLux Prima was born just over a decade ago from a drunken phone call from Karen O to Danger Mouse – real name Brian Joseph Burton – during which the pair vowed they would work on something together. It wasn’t until after O had given birth to her son, though, that recording finally began, and there is a beatific sense of contentment on songs like “Drown”, with its Kamasi Washington-like choirs and stately horns.This is an ambitious creation, meticulously crafted and assembled. For a start, the range of guest performers is a cornucopia of contemporary soul and hip-hop collaborators: vocalists Moses Sumney, Roots Manuva, Heidi Vogel, Grey Reverend and Tawiah strings player Miguel Atwood-Ferguson, and keyboardist Dennis Hamm – both of whom have worked with Flying Lotus and Thundercat.Rose – who found fame in the UK’s indie-folk scene as an unofficial member of Bombay Bicycle Club in 2010, only to walk away amid the band’s growing hype – is darkly compelling on No Words Left. Assisted by producer Tim Bidwell, who worked on Rose’s last record Something’s Changing, she sounds braver than she ever has before. There are moments that recall her Communion labelmate Ben Howard, on his latest album, Noonday Dream, and others that nod to the quiet stoicism of Joni Mitchell and Neil Young. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)The record is loosely conceptual insomuch as it’s punctuated with mock adverts for “WWAY HEALTH, our 247 care programme”. But don’t be put off: Miss Universe is a brilliant collection of songs, an expansive melange of indie, jazz, pop and trip-hop that flits between a lo-fi sparseness and something The Strokes would play. Yanya – who is of Turkish-Irish-Bajan heritage – grew up in London on a mix of Pixies, Nina Simone, The Libertines and Amy Winehouse, and this unlikely combination is certainly reflected in the sound. (Patrick Smith)2139 Jenny Lewis – On the LineHere, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (Elisa Bray)Comprising songs from Segall’s eclectic (that’s putting it lightly) catalogue and performed by him and the Freedom Band (Mikal Cronin, Charles Moothart, Emmett Kelly, and Ben Boye), the album is delightfully short and sweet. It is certainly a drastic switch-up from Freedom’s Goblin (2018), which had 19 tracks and ran for 75 minutes.If you want to know how hard it is to categorise Titanic Rising – the enthralling fourth album from Weyes Blood – look no further than the American musician’s own attempt to do so. It is, she says, “The Kinks meet the Second World War, or Bob Seger meets Enya.”Tension aside, there’s a great sense of fun here. The title track is pure euphoria, as restless synths of a Utah Saints or Orbital rave break into swelling bass and melody. And they create the full club experience with “Got to Keep On”, on which the four-to-the-floor beat, funky rhythm guitar, sweet backing vocals and chiming bells make way for the simple sounds of happy party-goers just as the anticipation builds, so does the instrumentation into a hypnotic crescendo. It’s masterful production. (Elisa Bray)Six months after the release of Oxnard, Anderson .Paak returns with another Dr Dre-produced record, Ventura. Where the former was overflowing with choppy, experimental sounds, guest appearances and clumsy attempts at Gil Scott Heron-esque revolutionary lyrics, the sequel – recorded around the same time – streamlines .Paak’s sound, making for a tightly packaged, melodic and danceable album.Two years after the release of his Mercury Prize-nominated debut Yesterday’s Gone, the south London hip-hop artist unveils its follow-up, Not Waving, But Drowning. And if any two records could portray how quickly someone can grow from a boy to a man, it’s these.2739 Lizzo – Cuz I Love YouNo one could accuse Lizzo of holding back. Not when it comes to her voice – which is raw and rowdy, so laden with personality even the vulnerable moments are a joy to listen to –  and certainly not when it comes to her message of unabashed self-love. That’s the predominant theme of the singer  rapper  flautist-extraordinaire’s hugely likeable third album, Cuz I Love You.It seems as likely as Old Man Steptoe dining with the Rees-Mogg, but this new tactic of burying their confrontational gruesomeness beneath a veneer of alt-rock respectability for album three works well for Fat White Family. Drenched in chamber strings and celestial harmonies, the plush yet sinister “Oh Sebastian” could be Pet Sounds selling its soul to the devil. “Fringe Runner” is so sleek and funksome it could be a New Romantic “White Lines (Don’t Don’t Do It)” “Kim’s Sunsets” is a piece of refined cosmic reggae resembling a blissed-out “Bankrobber”.2939 Cage the Elephant – Social CuesOn Cage the Elephant’s fifth album, Social Cues, frontman Matt Shultz reacts to the breakdown of his marriage and the loss of three close friends. He undergoes a kind of Jekyll and Hyde transition through the 13 tracks, the result of which is the band’s best work to date.SOAK reaches to outsiders once again on her new album. 3139 The Cranberries – In the EndThere’s a cruel irony that the release of The Cranberries’ final album should come just a week after journalist Lyra McKee was shot dead by the New IRA during a riot in Londonderry. “Zombie” was a protest song written by the band’s late frontwoman Dolores O’Riordan after two children were killed by IRA bombs – was released. She was deeply affected by the deaths, and would no doubt have been devastated by recent events in Northern Ireland as well.On her third record, Aldous Harding combines the gothic folk of her self-titled 2014 debut with the dramatically intimate tones of her follow-up album Party.Big Thief’s frontwoman Adrianne Lenker has an uncanny ability to make you feel like you’re in on a secret. Her whispering, spectral delivery and deeply personal lyrics are the key to this. Even on the band’s third album UFOF, with an audience that has grown exponentially in the past few years, the songs are still immensely intimate affairs.On his debut album, the 24-year-old Collard mixes sultry jams that recall the electronic funk of MGMT with nods to the greats: Prince, James Brown, Led Zeppelin and Marvin Gaye. Throughout, Collard exhibits his extraordinary voice, which swoops to a devilishly low murmur or soars to an ecstatic falsetto.   Dedicated covers the full, but generic, spectrum of relationships: dizzying love, lust, and break-ups. But whether she’s pining for the return of a former love in the funky disco banger “Julien”, or singing about masturbating post-break-up in lead single “Party For One” (“I’ll be the one If you don’t care about me Making love to myself Back on my beat”), the vibe remains positively jubilant.Getty Images for Spotify3639 Tyler, the Creator - IGOR“I don’t know where I’m going,” Tyler, the Creator begins on the song “I THINK”. “But I know what I’m showing.” The US artist’s words ring true throughout his fifth studio album, IGOR, where he adopts the dark and twisted mutterings of the Frankenstein character from which the record gets its name.

We believe that with this adjournment, there is a reasonable prospect of reaching an agreement that the majority of landlords will support.”Shopping centre owner Intu told Arcadia\u0026nbspon Wednesday that it will not back proposals to slash rents and close around 50 stores.Created with Sketch.

House of FraserHomebase has recently dropped the Bunnings association from its storesHowever, big landlords including British Land and Hammerson are said to have backed Arcadia\u0027s Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA), with others still wavering.Intu, which owns the Trafford centre in Manchester and Lakeside in Essex, counts Arcadia brands as tenants in 35 of its units.Intu reportedly refused\u0026nbspto back the plans because it would have to justify the rent cuts to other tenants.Landlords are cautious about offering discounts to certain tenants at a time when many retailers under pressure from falling sales, high rents, business rates and increasing wages.\u0026nbspArcadia, which owns brands including Topshop, Miss Selfridge, Evans and Burton had planned to shut 50 UK stores and cut rents on another 194.\u0026nbspJonathan De Mello, a director at retail consultancy Harper Dennis Hobbs, said large landlords feel that Sir Philip has already “played hardball” over rent rises in the past. “The CVA proposal comes in addition to that.\u0026nbsp“Landlords feel that Philip Green wants to get out of certain liabilities but they feel they have reduced rents enough.”If Sir Philip\u0027s Arcadia group\u0026nbspwere to enter administration it would become the most high-profile in a series of retail collapses.Debenhams\u0026nbspand House of Fraser, have called in the administrators in recent months, while Toys R\u0027 Us and Maplin have disappeared completely.Sir Philip Green\u0027s Arcadia Group confirms slew of shop closuresSir Philip, once lauded as the king of the high street, cleared a major hurdle on Tuesday after receiving the backing of the Pensions Regulator (TPR) for his rescue plans.The retail mogul agreed to inject\u0026nbspan additional £25m into Arcadia\u0027s\u0026nbsppension fund, taking the total\u0026nbspamount pledged in cash and security to more than £300m.News of\u0026nbspthe agreement came shortly after the watchdog ordered Sir Philip to pay in an extra £50m\u0026nbspin order to secure its support for\u0026nbspArcadia\u0027s CVA.Arcadia said Lady Green, the group\u0027s ultimate owner, had signed off the additional cash.The Pensions Regulator said: Following extensive discussions with the company, shareholders, the trustees of the pension schemes, the PPF and advisers, we are pleased that additional security has been agreed in support for the pension schemes which brings the total security value to £210m.This is in addition to agreed contributions of £100m to be paid to the schemes by Lady Green.Given this enhanced level of support, we now consider the updated CVA proposals are sufficient because they provide better protection for scheme members in these difficult circumstances.We recognise that the best support for any pension scheme is a trading employer and we feel the CVA proposals now provide the right balance between security for the pension schemes and the chance of sustainability for the company.The Pension Protection Fund (PPF) is due to vote on whether to support the scheme on Wednesday.Arcadia\u0027s brands have struggled to keep up with changing fashion trends and competition from Primark as well as online rivals.Critics have accused Sir Philip of underinvesting in the group\u0027s stores.

This\u0026nbspprevents light being reflected off them, meaning\u0026nbspthey are invisible to potential prey, according to the latest research.\u0026nbsp“They spend most of their time sitting around with their jaws open, waiting for something to come by,” said lead researcher Audrey Velasco-Hogan, a PhD student at the University of California San Diego.\u0026nbsp“Their teeth are always exposed, so it’s important that they are transparent so they don’t reflect or scatter any bioluminescent light from the environment.”Despite measuring just 15 centimetres in length, deep-sea dragonfish (Aristostomias scintillans) are apex predators and feed on fish that are up to half their size. They are so voracious that they even eat each other.\u0026nbspnanocrystals (Audrey Velasco)If their teeth were visible, prey would immediately shy away, researchers say.Scientists analysed the nanostructure of the teeth by using electron microscopy, which is a technique used to obtain high-resolution images of biological specimens.\u0026nbspThey discovered that like humans, dragonfish have an outer enamel-like layer and an inner dentin later.The outer layer was covered in grain-sized nanocrystals arranged to prevent\u0026nbsplight being scattered or reflected off the surface of the teeth, according to the paper published in the journal Matter.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Weird \u0026amp Wonderful: life in the deep sea Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Hidden Ocean 2005 Expedition: NOAA Office of Ocean ExplorationLarva of a European lobsterSixgill shark on Santa Rosa Reef, south of GuamHidden Ocean 2005 Expedition: NOAA Office of Ocean ExplorationLarva of a European lobsterSixgill shark on Santa Rosa Reef, south of GuamThe inner\u0026nbsplayer is also\u0026nbspstructured in a different way, and does not have microscopic channels called dentin tubes which normally give teeth their ivory colour.

By studying why these teeth are transparent, we can better understand deep-sea organisms like the dragonfish and the adaptations they evolved to live in their environments,” Ms Velasco-Hogan said.Highly sensitive colour vision discovered in deep-sea fishDeep sea snailfish has \u0027soft bones and open skull to survive pressure\u0027The findings could provide inspiration for researchers looking to develop transparent ceramics.“Taking advantage of the ultimate adaptation organisms show to specific environments has always been a driver for technological innovation, and the dragonfish is no exception to this,” said Dimitri Deheyn, a marine biologist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at UC San Diego.“There is clearly still broad inspiration to gather from the dragonfish and nature in general, and this intercept between biology and engineering through biomimicry is clearly a lucrative path for sustainable innovations.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It felt cruel and humiliating. It’s 2019 – you can’t have people doing that to you. It’s just wrong.”Mr Byrne said he had arrived at Dublin airport at 6.45pm, leaving plenty of time to tell staff from OCS – the company that operates the lift for disabled passengers – that he required assistance to get on his flight at 8.50pm.He said there had been “a slight delay of around five minutes” getting the lift ready to take him on board before he was told the pilot was refusing to take him on board.After being denied his place on the plane, he had to wait over two-and-a-half hours to board the next one leaving for Birmingham.This government is failing disabled children and their familiesMr Byrne is paraplegic, meaning that he has an impairment in motor or sensory function of the lower extremities.

I could have gone to America in that time.”He added: “I haven’t had a good explanation. The pilot must have seen me waiting on the lift. It takes five minutes to lift me on.”“I’ve been all over the world to represent Team GB and haven’t had anything like this happen before. I certainly want to get apology. More than anything else, I want to make sure it doesn’t happen to anyone else.”Mr Byrne said he had received an email from Ryanair saying the company was now investigating.A\u0026nbspRyanair\u0026nbspspokesperson told The Independent: “While we regret any inconvenience caused, special assistance services at Dublin Airport are operated by OCS – at great expense to the airlines.”A spokesperson for OCS said the company had no comment to make.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Theresa May said she wouldn’t stand down until we had left the EU, and David Cameron said he wouldn’t publish his memoir. Both those events are now going to take place while we are still an EU member, but Adam Hills, presenter of The Last Leg, is still growing his beard and, as far as I know, Jake Berry, the local government minister, is still not drinking.\u0026nbspAnd Liz Truss, the chief secretary to the Treasury, confirmed today that the end of austerity, too, has been postponed until after the Brexit crisis has been resolved. As we report today, she told a House of Lords committee that the public spending review promised for this autumn is now “unlikely to happen”.\u0026nbspTheresa May said at the Conservative Party conference in October (the one where she danced onto the stage): “A decade after the financial crash, people need to know that the austerity it led to is over.”The trouble with relaxing a squeeze on public spending is that it takes a long time for the public to feel it. The Labour government struggled to convince people that things did actually “get better” after it turned on the spending taps in 1999 – having raised expectations in the 1997 election, it kept to stringent Tory spending plans for two years and even after that it took longer than expected for the benefits to be felt in wards and classrooms.\u0026nbspTory turmoil will slam brakes on pledge to end austerity, admits TrussNow the Conservatives seem to have repeated that mistake. The prime minister announced the end of austerity before the new money had started to flow. She has made eye-catching promises of vast extra spending on the NHS, outbidding the Leave campaign’s £350m a week on the side of the bus by promising an extra £394m a week by 2023. But most of this money is some way into the future, and now the spending review, which would have set out spending plans for all departments over the next three years, has been postponed.\u0026nbspThat means that\u0026nbspmost departments face an immediate future in which budgets will only just keep up with inflation. This is better than the year-on-year cuts in real spending (except in the protected budgets for health, defence and aid)\u0026nbspduring the coalition government.\u0026nbspBut Philip Hammond, the chancellor, was forced to announce an emergency top-up to the Home Office’s policing budget in his spring statement in March, and there are still large cuts in the social security budget pencilled in to be made as universal credit is extended.\u0026nbspOf course, the delay to this autumn’s spending review is not directly the result of the postponement of Brexit. It is the change of prime minister – or, as Truss put it, the “goings-on within the Conservative Party” – that means the review has been put off. The new prime minister, expected to take office in the week beginning 22 July, will want to reset the government’s spending priorities.\u0026nbspWhoever it is, they will want to reannounce the “end of austerity”. But it may be several years before most of the British people will feel it.The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

warned that Brexit will threaten peace and friendship in EuropeClick to followIndy PoliticsOn the 75th anniversary of D-Day, more than 120 military veterans have signed a letter warning that peace and friendship in Europe is threatened by Brexit.The 122 veterans, whose service s the period from the Second World War to modern-day conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, said that the peace which has prevailed in Europe since 1945 “should not be taken for granted”.The letter came as D-Day veteran Eric Chardin, who was 19 when he took part in the 1944 landings,\u0026nbspsaid that the prospect of Brexit worried him.“I can’t help feeling that it would be an awful shame if what we’ve gone to so much trouble to do, to collect the European big nations together, to break it all up now would be a crying shame,” said Mr Chardin, 94, from Cambridge, in a BBC\u0026nbspinterview at the 75th anniversary commemorations in Portsmouth.Issuing a call for a Final Say referendum on Brexit, the signatories to the letter - published in The Independent - said that the EU should take credit for helping keep the peace in Europe.Created with Sketch.D-Day 75: Normandy landings in pictures Show all

challenged the invocation of wartime patriotism by the Leave camp, pointing out that it was Sir Winston Churchill who called for the creation of a “European family” to prevent another descent into bloodshed.Churchill’s words helped inspire the creation of the Common Market, which evolved into the European Union with “one main purpose - to create lasting peace by entwining our economies and societies together on a continent once ravaged by war,” they said.“Nato does not keep the peace in Europe – it keeps peace for Europe. It is the EU that keeps peace in Europe, because when you trade, you do not fight.“As former members of the armed forces and veterans of more recent conflicts, we have served alongside soldiers from other European nations, supporting each other while under fire or facing danger.Trump and Brexit are inseparable now – and it will only get worseNigel Farage makes final drive to win Brexit Party\u0027s first MPEven without Brexit delays, austerity’s effects will be felt for yearsCorbyn must commit to referendum \u0027now\u0027, says Brexit spokeswoman“We have learnt that war stinks, that peace is the natural goal for civilisation, and that Europeans are our brothers in arms.“But that peace and friendship is now threatened by Brexit.\u0026nbsp Peace in Europe is not something that should be taken for granted.“We should be proud to lead in Europe, proud that our friends respect us and can rely on us. That’s why we, as former members of the armed forces, all support a People’s Vote on Brexit.”Signatories include veterans of the Royal Navy, RAF and Army, including Brigadier Stephen Goodall, who saw action in Burma during WW2, as well as the co-founders of Veterans for Europe Stuart Thomson, Duncan Hodgkins and Steve Gavin.\u0026nbspGulf War RAF veteran Corporal Thomson, from Worcestershire, said: “On D-Day, 75 ago, our brave forbears went over the Channel to help our friends who had been under oppression for almost five years.We went there to help the French, Belgians, Dutch, Norwegians, Danes, and even Germans who were oppressed by the Nazis. Thirteen nations, including British, Irish, French and Dutch, also Belgians, Poles and Czechs - from all branches of the services - were part of that liberation coalition.“As Europeans, we were stronger together then and should be stronger together now.”He added: “What has happened since 2016 is very disturbing, and it’s clear that the military aspects of Brexit weren’t thought about properly.“Politicians trying to force us out of the EU without going back to the people are cowards, not leaders. They have no mandate and no right to behave this way. Those of us who fought for democracy are demanding a democratic People’s Vote to hold them to account.”Veterans for Europe\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The company is the largest supermarket chain in the world by revenues.Created with Sketch.The Democrat challengers to Trump in 2020 Show all 22Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The Vermont senator has announced that he will be running again in 2020 after losing out to Hilary Clinton in the 2016 Democratic primaries.

He said the ratio of Mr\u0026nbsp​McMillon’s $23.6m pay package last year compared to that of the median associate was 1,076 to 1.“Walmart is the largest private employer in America and is owned by the Walton family, the wealthiest family in the United States, worth approximately $175bn,” Mr Sanders said.\u0026nbspBernie Sanders demands Walmart ‘give workers a seat on the board’Joe Biden’s lead shrinks to zero against Bernie Sanders in IowaBernie Sanders unveils 2020 election plan to reform public educationBernie Sanders’ views should disqualify him from running for presidentBernie Sanders and AOC propose credit card interest rate caps“And yet, despite the incredible wealth of its owners, Walmart pays many of its employees starvation wages.”Last year, Mr Sanders introduced legislation intended to tax big companies the full amount of welfare claimed by their workers because of the low-wages they received.Titled the Stop Bad Employers by Zeroing Out Subsidies (Stop BEZOS) Act, Mr Sanders took direct aim at companies such as Amazon and its owner Jeff Bezos.

Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke). The result is a film without any direction that serves as a Trojan horse set-up for the Avengers.21. When the Thor franchise lost its director Kenneth Branagh between the first and second films, it also had to kiss goodbye to the Shakespearean theatrics that had lent it a sense of goofy charm. Directed by Game of Thrones’s Alan Taylor, The Dark World prioritises its VFX effects above all else. It’s a dull affair: Christopher Eccleston’s Malekith is (by far) Marvel’s worst villain, being a pile of prosthetics with zero personality, while Chris Hemsworth’s Thor completes one of the most unrealistic London Tube journeys in all of cinematic history.20. Edward Norton’s version of the smashing Hulk often gets forgotten by Marvel fans – and for good reason. Whereas Mark Ruffalo’s bumbling interpretation of the character has a gravitational charm, Norton’s moping monster is void of any charisma. With Liv Tyler phoning in her performance as love interest, Betty Ross, the film falls emotionally flat and serves only as a by-the-numbers origins story.422 Avengers: Age of Ultron19. Just in case we’d forgotten that the Disney corporation is an all-consuming titan that owns half of Hollywood, the sequel to 2012’s Avengers decided to sneak in a little corporate synergy: when Iron Man accidentally creates a sentient robot (voiced by James Spader) who decides the earth’s only salvation is through the destruction of humanity, he announces his grim plans with accompaniment of a little citation of the classic “I’ve Got No Strings” from 1940’s Pinocchio. It’s a moment that exemplifies how Ultron feels like a cold, calculated operation from Marvel Studios. It’s merely tick list of obligations to move us on to the next chapter of the MCU.18. Although Kenneth Branagh’s introductory outing for Marvel’s God of Thunder fared perfectly well on release, it’s suffered massively from the MCU’s dramatic sense of progression over the years. Certainly, Tom Hiddleston’s Loki is a strong, well-crafted character right out of the gate, and his plot against his adoptive father (Anthony Hopkins) is delightfully heightened. Yet, it arguably took until Thor: Ragnarok for Chris Hemsworth’s hero to develop much sense of character beyond the initial “fish out of water” trope.17. A self-centred wealthy white man ventures to a distant land and realises his superhero potential – sound familiar? That’s because Doctor Strange and Iron Man are basically the same story, except one uses magic and the other explosives. Benedict Cumberbatch’s Marveldebut impresses with kaleidoscope visuals but lacks the heart of Robert Downey Jr’s hero, leading to a film that wastes the talents of both Tilda Swinton and Mads Mikkelsen. 722 s of the Galaxy Vol 216. The first s of the Galaxy was a risky Star Wars-inspired romp through space, following a bunch of a-holes who form an unlikely familiar bond. For the second film, James Gunn decided to turn everything up to 11, cramming half a dozen interweaving storylines, leading to Chris Pratt’s gaunt Star Lord getting side-lined. The sequel did, however, introduce the now beloved line “I’m Mary Poppins, y’all”, shouted by Yondu as he gracefully falls from the sky. A wonderfully comedic moment in a film that misses on another half-dozen punches.15. Marvel’s first crossover film was an unparalleled cinematic event – one that arguably changed Hollywood filmmaking forever, now that every major studio seems to be attempting the “shared universe” approach to franchises. Although the MCU has refined the template since, The Avengers still established the focus on humour, character, and heart that would come to define the success story of Marvel Studios. It’s a blockbuster that feels large on all fronts, delivering thrills not only in the “Battle of New York” finale, but in the creation of a team of characters that feel perfectly balanced and complementary.14. Despite Captain America: Civil War (AKA Avengers 2.5) featuring Iron Man, Black Widow, and Ant-Man (as well as introducing Black Panther and Spider-Man), the film remains first and foremost about Captain America. And that’s perhaps why the stuffed blockbuster works – were it not for a central focus, Civil War could have fallen into the trappings of other Marvel sequels in being too convoluted. The Russo Brothers also direct one of the best actions scenes in Marvel history so far, the airport scene, which looks as if it leapt straight out of a comic book.1022 Ant-Man and the Wasp13. While the first Ant Man was a mirror image of its star Paul Rudd, essentially delivering a studio comedy dressed in dex, the second found a new trick up its sleeve in the form of Evangeline Lilly’s Hope van Dyne – a smart, capable female hero who didn’t simply exist to serve as a caretaker for the male characters.12. Ant-Man should not have worked as a film. Just look at the title! Ridiculous to think a movie about a man with ant powers should work – let alone be a blockbuster success and part of the biggest cinematic universe going. Yet, despite production problems (Edgar Wright was initially meant to helm the film), Peyton Reed directs this hilarious heist film with aplomb, taking the Marvel world a little less seriously than others. 11. Marvel redefined cinematic narratives once more in 2018, creating a single culmination to a decade’s worth of films. While it plays as total nonsense to anyone who’s a newcomer to the franchise (if that’s possible), it was, for fans, an unmatched emotional release. The Russo brothers faced the monumental task of making each crossover – from the s of the Galaxy to the kingdom of Wakanda – work in a way that feels natural, while also ushering the MCU’s biggest villain, Thanos, into centre stage. Epic both in its sense of scale and stakes, Infinity War also stages one of the most memorable finales in blockbuster history.10. With or without the beard, Steve Rogers aka Captain America has now become the brooding centre of the Avengers, but there was once a time when he was all about the old-fashioned heroics. Director Joe Johnston stayed true to the film’s 1940s setting in a film that embraces that pulpiness of early comic book history, as Steve punches Nazis and romances military officer Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), although her character is thankfully never relegated to the role of damsel in distress.9. Despite centring on a super-powered American nationalist, the Captain America trilogy has the most consistent quality in the MCU. Its crowning moment comes with The Winter Soldier – an adrenaline-fuelled conspiracy thriller that features a spectacular twist and provokes questions regarding modern day surveillance. However, given The Russo Brothers root the rest of the movie in realism, the bombastic CGI-heavy ending is a little ridiculous. 8. Brie Larson gives a superpowered performance as Carol Danvers, the actor playing a hero that\u0027s both relatable and aspirational, strong but vulnerable. While Captain Marvel may not revolutionise the studio’s formula, the superhero\u0027s debut outing provides a platform to show off her Thanos-annihilating powers.  Thanks to a smart script, it also offers some of the very best character development in the MCU.7. While Spider-Man’s miraculous arrival in the MCU came with Captain America: Civil War, it was not until Homecoming that we truly got to know Peter Parker. Tom Holland’s incarnation swings past Andrew Garfield’s version, thanks to the film’s lower-stakes high school story allowing for intimate moments with the character. Along with including some great comic performances (Jacob Batalon as Ned stands out), Michael Keaton’s Vulture makes for a terrifying villain, and the twist is superbly done.6. While isive among Marvel fans, Shane Black’s superhero outing – with the writerdirector’s sharp, stinging dialogue – brings Tony Stark\u0027s story arc to an end (or what should have been its end) with humour and heart aplenty. As Robert Downey Jr’s genius, billionaire philanthropist deals with PTSD and struggles with his robotic creations, we see an actor giving his all. While Civil War and the Avengers films dragged him back into action, fingers are crossed Avengers: Endgame will give the character a similar emotionally satisfying send-off.5. It’s a film that’s hard to place within the MCU canon, simply because the majority of its emotional pay-offs only work due to the groundwork laid by over a decade of filmmaking. Avengers: Endgame is less about inidual storytelling and so much more about the collective experience of cinema itself. This exists to be consumed in the dark, surrounded by loved ones, as  you all cheer, gasp, and cry in unison. The fan service at work may, at times, feel a little outrageous in just how bold it feels, but Endgame earns the right to indulge. This, above all, is a celebration of these movies and their impact on the world. 4. Completely transforming the Thor franchise in a single, effortless move, director Taika Waititi injected new energy into the MCU. Ragnarok is perfectly balanced both as a standard Marvel movie, with all the right heroics and world-building intact, and as a work belonging exclusively to Waititi, filled with the humour and charm he’d previously displayed in What We Do in the Shadows and Hunt for the Wilderpeople. By finding a way to incorporate inidual voices into its massive franchise machine, Marvel found the secret to true long-term success.3. Where it all started. Iron Man subverted expectations by not only reintroducing Robert Downey Jr to the world, but by showing that a relatively unknown B-character could be at the centre of a blockbuster. Other cinematic universes fail because they attempt to introduce too much (a mistake made in Iron Man 2). The first Iron Man, though, had a self-contained story that only hinted at a bigger world – a world that would eventually become a multi-billion-dollar franchise. 2122 s of the Galaxy 2. Blasting the Marvel universe into space for an adventure with a truly ragtag group of heroes, including both a talking racoon and a sentient tree-creature, s of the Galaxy is arguably the biggest risk the franchise ever took. And it paid off in spectacular fashion, with director James Gunn giving the superhero genre a light coat of B-movie glee. It also transformed Parks and Recreation star Chris Pratt into the major box office draw he is today.1. Although Black Panther still dutifully fulfils all the requirements of a Marvel film, providing a bridge to films both past and future plus ending in a cinematic battle filled with CGI trickery, Ryan Coogler’s achievement as a director is to use a familiar framework to tell a radical story within mainstream filmmaking. In the strife between Chadwick Boseman’s T’Challa, the ruler of Wakanda, and Michael B Jordan’s Killmonger, he provided a nuanced, layered commentary on colonialism and black identity. It’s a film that triumphs both within its genre, bringing new perspectives to the superhero story, and outside of it, satisfying purely as a piece of narrative drama.22. Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke).

It’s a film that triumphs both within its genre, bringing new perspectives to the superhero story, and outside of it, satisfying purely as a piece of narrative drama.’s Peter Bradshaw also gave the film two stars, writing that it “offers glimpses of intrigue before regressing into a dull CGI-fest”.“The most interesting aspect of this film is McAvoy’s Xavier,” Bradshaw’s review says. “He is more opaque, more worldly, more secretive – and drinking more heavily. For the first time, we realise that he is not the idealist that we might have imagined. Raven is increasingly angry at Xavier’s recklessness and egotism, risking his pupils’ lives for his own glory – maybe as a result of being too close to the Washington political establishment.”Variety’s review was slightly more positive, with more praise for James McAvoy’s performance that is “driven by a compelling ambiguity”.\u0026nbsp“His Professor X is vain, controlling, and PR-hungry, not to mention a grand deceiver — all the things Jennifer Lawrence’s Raven accuses him of being,” the reviewer comments. “Yet what he says in his own defence is true as well: He’s desperate to protect the status of the X-Men, to not let them slip into being stigmatized, once more, by the world at large. What happened to Jean as a child was cruel, but maybe it was necessary. McAvoy, with his gleam of cunning, plays to both sides of our sympathies, and so does Turner, who gets us to embrace Jean as a superhero, in part, because she’s a destroyer. The pleasure of Dark Phoenix” is watching her emerge from the wreckage.”Digital Spy’s Ian Sandwell said: “In hindsight, Dark Phoenix\u0027s delay from November 2018 hasn\u0027t helped. With it repositioned as the \u0027culmination\u0027 of the X-Men series, it suffers in comparison to Avengers: Endgame and one key third-act beat is a carbon copy of a Captain Marvel moment.New X-Men film Dark Phoenix has nothing fresh to say – reviewNew trailer unveiled for X-Men: Dark Phoenix”It leaves the movie in a tricky position of being a well-made but overly familiar entry in a crowded superhero field. Combine that with the mixed build-up to Dark Phoenix\u0027s release, and the movie just doesn\u0027t do enough, unfortunately.“The Hollywood Reporter also compared the film unfavourably to the Avengers franchise, writing: ”Compared to the conclusions of other major franchises – the most recent being Avengers: Endgame – this one seems distinctly minor-league.\u0026nbsp“The men who have anchored most of the X-Men outings are just spinning their wheels here, and while Jean\u0027s central dilemma is certainly dramatic enough, and is most closely entwined with the actions of two other women, what should have registered as genuinely powerful instead plays out in a pretty low-key way. In no way does this feel like a fulsome, satisfying destination to a journey that started two decades ago and logged about 30 hours in the telling.“”There\u0027s no memorable soundtrack, no thrilling action sequences, not even a detectable sense of humour,” wrote Mashable’s Angie Han. “Dark Phoenix isn\u0027t especially ugly or upsetting, but it\u0027s no pleasure to sit through, either. It\u0027s just there, robotically going through the motions of recounting a story, without stopping to consider why it\u0027s bothering in the first place.“Created with Sketch.A complete list of every Marvel movie coming out Show all 17Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A decade of the MCU comes to a climax with the first of a two-part finale to everything that\u0027s come so far. Uniting all of the MCU\u0027s heroes to fight Josh Brolin\u0027s Thanos, the film is expected to say farewell to some old favourites - expect tears. Josh Brolin pops up again in Fox\u0027s own superhero sequel. This time as Cable, the time-traveller and sometimes ally of Deadpool though it seems here he\u0027s initially (at least) being set up as an antagonist. The film will also see the introduction of the X-Force. 317 Ant-Man and the Wasp (6 July, 2018)Taking place between the events of Civil War and Infinity War, the Peyton Reed-directed sequel will see Evangeline Lily\u0027s Hope suit up as Wasp, becoming the MCU\u0027s first female hero to get her name in the title. With Sony teaming up with Disney for Spider-Man: Homecoming, the character won\u0027t be able to exist outside of the MCU. However, Sony is still keen for their own superhero cinematic universe, looking to the wider Spiderverse for their options. Enter Tom Hardy\u0027s Venom, an antihero infected with an alien parasite. 517 Spider-Man: Into the Spiderverse (14 December, 2018)Sony also has Miles Morales at their disposal: the current Spider-Man in the comics. It may be difficult to transition him into live-action, but the studio is at least releasing an animated rendition of the character, developed by The LEGO Movie directors Phil Lord and Chis Miller. 617 Silver and Black (8 February, 2019)As a follow-up to Venom, Sony has hired Love \u0026amp Basketball\u0027s Gina Prince-Bythewood for a film centred around Silver Sable and Black Cat. Fox\u0027s X-Men franchise continues with another decade-jumping installment, this time re-telling the Dark Phoenix storyline (as seen in X-Men: The Last Stand) during the 1990s. Jennifer Lawrence, Michael Fassbender, and James McAvoy will all return, with Game of Thrones\u0027 Sophie Turner taking the spotlight as Jean Grey.

Tom Holland\u0027s Spider-Man will likely be a prominent figure in the MCU\u0027s future, so no wonder the character already has a sequel confirmed.

How it might be impacted by the events of Infinity War is yet to be seen. Another film yet to be confirmed, but it seems inevitable the character will be getting another outing as part of the MCU\u0027s future. Indeed, director Scott Derrickson and screenwriter C. Robert Cargill revealed there\u0027s already a concept and villain for the second film: with Benedict Cumberbatch\u0027s hero fighting Nightmare, ruler of the Dream Dimension. After Black Panther\u0027s monumental success at the box office, it was only a matter of time before Marvel confirmed a sequel. Marvel Studios head Kevin Feige also said he\u0027s hoping Ryan Coogler will once more direct. Fox is also looking to develop the future of X-23, first introduced as Dafne Keen\u0027s Laura in Logan. A script is currently in the works. It\u0027s been rumoured (and wished for) for years, but Marvel finally made their first concrete move towards a Black Widow solo film in January, hiring Jac Schaeffer to pen a script. The film, however, doesn\u0027t yet have the greenlight. A decade of the MCU comes to a climax with the first of a two-part finale to everything that\u0027s come so far. Uniting all of the MCU\u0027s heroes to fight Josh Brolin\u0027s Thanos, the film is expected to say farewell to some old favourites - expect tears. Josh Brolin pops up again in Fox\u0027s own superhero sequel. This time as Cable, the time-traveller and sometimes ally of Deadpool though it seems here he\u0027s initially (at least) being set up as an antagonist. The film will also see the introduction of the X-Force. 317 Ant-Man and the Wasp (6 July, 2018)Taking place between the events of Civil War and Infinity War, the Peyton Reed-directed sequel will see Evangeline Lily\u0027s Hope suit up as Wasp, becoming the MCU\u0027s first female hero to get her name in the title. With Sony teaming up with Disney for Spider-Man: Homecoming, the character won\u0027t be able to exist outside of the MCU. However, Sony is still keen for their own superhero cinematic universe, looking to the wider Spiderverse for their options. Enter Tom Hardy\u0027s Venom, an antihero infected with an alien parasite. 517 Spider-Man: Into the Spiderverse (14 December, 2018)Sony also has Miles Morales at their disposal: the current Spider-Man in the comics. It may be difficult to transition him into live-action, but the studio is at least releasing an animated rendition of the character, developed by The LEGO Movie directors Phil Lord and Chis Miller. 617 Silver and Black (8 February, 2019)As a follow-up to Venom, Sony has hired Love \u0026amp Basketball\u0027s Gina Prince-Bythewood for a film centred around Silver Sable and Black Cat. Fox\u0027s X-Men franchise continues with another decade-jumping installment, this time re-telling the Dark Phoenix storyline (as seen in X-Men: The Last Stand) during the 1990s. Jennifer Lawrence, Michael Fassbender, and James McAvoy will all return, with Game of Thrones\u0027 Sophie Turner taking the spotlight as Jean Grey. Brie Larson will step into Captain Marvel\u0027s shoes for another \u002790s set adventure, with Samuel L. Jackson\u0027s Nicky Fury also along for the ride.

Entertainment Weekly said: ”It’s true that X-Men have never exactly been the party clowns of the Marvel Universe their hero status has always been conditional to fearful humans, and the chosen family of mutants they’ve landed in is less choice than necessity. Why should they have to banter for us, too? Still, for what is being called a final instalment, it all tends to feel both anticlimactic and a little grim in the end.““Better than Last Stand or Apocalypse but never hitting the heights of X2, Dark Phoenix thrives when its heroes are front and centre.

While it has always banned hate content in general, the site has allowed some specific kinds of harmful videos – such as those promoting Nazi ideology or claiming 911 did not happen – to continue being hosted on the site.Those videos, as well as other kinds of supremacist content, will now be officially banned.Today, we\u0027re taking another step in our hate speech policy by specifically prohibiting videos alleging that a group is superior in order to justify discrimination, segregation or exclusion based on qualities like age, gender, race, caste, religion, sexual orientation or veteran status, it wrote in a blog post.That is expected to lead to the removal of thousands of accounts as it goes into place, though that could take some time. We will begin enforcing this updated policy today however, it will take time for our systems to fully ramp up and we’ll be gradually expanding coverage over the next several months, its announcement read.Created with Sketch.Youtube\u0027s top 15 most subscribed channels in 2019 Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The YouTube channel homepage for Indian record label T-Series, which overtook controversial Swedish vlogger PewDiePie in 2019PewDiePie has been the most popular YouTuber since 20135-Minute Crafts, which offers quick and quirky DIY tips to viewers, didn\u0027t even feature in the top 15 YouTube channels in July 2018Brazilian music video producer and director KondZilla began his career after buying a camera with life insurance money left to him after his mother died when he was 18Sony Entertainment Televesion (SET) launched in 1995 and has recently seen huge growth of its Hindi-language YouTube channelCanadian musician Justin Bieber held the number-two spot in 2018 before T-Series took over World Wrestling Entertainment has managed to gain a huge following on YouTube by sharing clips of fights and interviews with its starsThis YouTube channel specialises in 3D animation videos of nursery rhymes, as well as its own original songs.

It will also encourage more authoritative videos to try and discourage people from being tricked by those stories.It has already trialled the system to do this in the US, and said it has found success. It will bring it to more countries by the end of the year, it said, as well as tuning the algorithm so that it is more efficient and can spot more content, it said.YouTube says it will not remove videos filled with anti-gay insultsIt also said it would work harder to stop YouTube users promoting harmful content from receiving ad money. Channels that repeatedly brush up\u0026nbspagainst its hate speech policies will be suspended from the company\u0027s partner programme.The openness of YouTube’s platform has helped creativity and access to information thrive, its blog post concluded.\u0026nbspIt’s our responsibility to protect that, and prevent our platform from being used to incite hatred, harassment, discrimination and violence.We are committed to taking the steps needed to live up to this responsibility today, tomorrow and in the years to come.The change comes on the same day as the company said it would not remove videos in which one of its stars attacked another user over his sexuality, using a series of anti-gay slurs. Strangely, the company now explicitly\u0026nbspbans videos that encourage\u0026nbspdiscrimination or segregation based on sexuality, but made no reference to that high-profile case in its blog post, and did not say that it would change its position.YouTube has been repeatedly criticised for its relatively lax approach towards various kinds of harmful content, including those on the far-right. That criticism became even more prominent in the wake of the Christchurch shooting, when it and other video sites failed to quickly remove videos of the mass murder.As such, the site has been repeatedly accused of not only permitting but also encouraging extremism, by playing host to often violent and niche accounts.But right-wing channels also make up a significant part of YouTube\u0027s channels and their viewers. Earlier this year, Bloomberg reported that far-right videos were one of the site\u0027s most popular categories.The decision also comes amid increasing scrutiny from conservative politicians about whether YouTube has a bias against right-wing creators. As with Twitter and Facebook, the company has been criticised for undermining free speech and being unfair towards its conservative users, despite the fact there is no evidence of those accounts being discriminated against.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

You’ve had your le. But he won’t have children with you.”But the woman who was to eventually become France’s next First Lady told Macron’s parents: “I cannot promise you anything,” when she was told to stay away from the teen, reports Reuters.Brigitte last year confirmed to Paris Match magazine that Macron vowed to marry her when he was just -years-old.In Fulda’s book, she is quoted as saying: “Nobody will ever know at what moment our story became a love story.That belongs to us. That is our secret.”In November Brigitte and Emmanuel Macron attended a memorial to mark two years since the Paris attacks.Brigitte and Emmanuel stood side by side with families of victims.Some  people were killed and hundreds injured when terrorists targeted the Stade de France arena, restaurants and the Bataclan concert hall where Eagles of Death Metal was playing.Macron married his we in  after Brigitte’s previous marriage ended in orce.The former economics minister is step-father to his we’s three adult children, including son Sebastien who is two years older than Macron.Daughter Tiphaine, , is a lawyer who works on her step-dad’s campaign.She reportedly described Macron as having an “exceptional personality” and being an “intelligent man.”Macron does not have any biological children with his we, although he is also the step-grandfather of Brigitte’s seven grandchildren.  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But the family does not get the support it needs.Thousands of kind-hearted Sun readers have already signed Vickey’s letter to Chancellor Philip Hammond demanding he properly funds services — such as respite and overnight support — for parents with disabled children.We hope more of you will show your backing by signing the letter today, because the Kowal family are not an isolated case.Mums and dads up and down the country feel unable to look after their disabled children adequately because they are so exhausted — and they are frustrated at being let down by a system that is meant to help them.When we surveyed parents, just four per cent said they felt they had the support to safely care for their child.More than half have been treated by a GP for depression, anxiety or stress.Ollies grandad Dave helps out when he can, but the family are far from an isolated case - they need your helpIndependent Provider of Special Education Advice- for specialist legal adviceNewle - a charity that provides help with equipmentGOV.UK - to understand your childs entitlementsNational Autistic Society And a huge  per cent of children have gone without therapies, such as physio and speech and language help, meant to improve their lives.This lack of support starts right from diagnosis — with parents being left alone to come to terms with devastating news.They are then left to care for children with complex needs — often through the night — for months or years without any help or respite.This care is often emotional and stressful, and sometimes physical and back-breaking, too.At my charity, Contact — which works with families of disabled children — we hear all the time from those who have to fight for even the most basic provision.Disabled children and their families are desperately struggling because of a lack of support.We want the Government to reinstate the £m of funding it has cut from early intervention services - such as respite care and vital equipment.It is time for the Government to Give It Back.The number of disabled children in the UK has risen to nearly  million over the past  years - up by a third.But funding and support has been cut.Families with some of the most vulnerable children in the country are struggling to cope.That’s why we’re working with the Disabled Children’s Partnership to help them.Together we can make a real dference and hugely improve the lives of disabled children and their families.We want you to share your stories, email us on giveitback@the-sunPlease sign Ollie’s letter to put pressure on the Government to act now.These families are morally — and legally — entitled to help from local authorities, but it is just not forthcoming.It does not need to be like this. All the families want is a little amount of support to enable them to care safely for their child at home.They want a chance to go shopping, a moment to catch up on sleep or have a bath, or time to spend with their other children.This is not about pity or sympathy for disabled children.The families we work with cherish every day spent with their children, who bring real joy and have so much to offer. Instead, we are calling on the Government to help tackle the problem of the lack of support they are given.I have worked in the field of disability for  years, so I know that services have never been perfect.But cuts to budgets, combined with a  per cent increase in the number of children classed as disabled over the past decade, means we have reached a critical point — one where we need to decide what kind of country we want to be.We are talking about some of the most vulnerable children in society, and also children who have the potential to contribute a lot.This is not a campaign based purely on emotion, compassion or wanting to do the right thing, although those are all important.There is a hard-headed economic case here, too. Without putting funding back into services for disabled children, we can guarantee the taxpayer will be faced with a bigger bill in the long-term.That is because when families break down, children can end up in care or needing expensive crisis intervention from local councils or the NHS.Our families are amazing. When the chips are down, people can be remarkable.But most do not want to be amazing, or superhuman — they want an ordinary le.As Sun readers, you can give families up and down the country a real shot at that.Sign Vickey’s letter using this link, and ask which of our potential leaders will be first to agree to Give It Back.Amanda Batten is chair of the Disabled Children’s Partnership, a coalition of  leading charities, and CEO of Contact.Jane Harris, Director of External Affairs at the National Autistic SocietyWe want as many people as possible to sign the open letter calling on the Government to give back the millions that have been cut from support for disabled children. Thanks to The Sun and The Sun readers for getting behind this important campaign.”Dr Hilary Cass OBE, Chair of BACDEvery professional working in the field of childhood disability will be grateful to The Sun for launching the Give it Back campaign.Naseem Waker, mum of Leila, sevenThe Give It Back campaign shows the stark reality of a very complex situation. I am delighted a paper with the clout of The Sun has taken up the cause. Dan White, writer and broadcaster, dad of Emily, It’s  and parents and children in our community are like ghosts to society. We live amongst you, breathe your air, look at the same stars, but you do not know us. Today, you must finally make the country aware.Tracy Williams, mum of HarryThis campaign can transform the lives of nearly a million families with disabled children.

Legislation in Australia has also led to thousands more having the jab, she said.She added that although “many parents wrongly believe the rhetoric that vaccines are harmful, unnatural and an infringement of civil liberties”, a no jab, no school rule would give parents freedom of choice, while protecting other youngsters from infection.Health secretary Matt Hancock has said that he is “particularly worried” about fake posts on social media and last month refused to rule out mandatory jabs.But other doctors argue that making the jab mandatory could erode trust in the NHS and turn parents against vaccination.While the infectious condition often clears up in under two weeks, it can sometimes lead to le-threatening complications.Public Health England has confirmed the UK has seen a rise in cases in , with  confirmed cases of measles so far this year, compared to just  for the whole of .Health experts have said it is part of a rise in cases across Europe.The illness is highly contagious and is easily spread from person to person.Viruses can be expelled when an infected person coughs or sneezing.These can then be inhaled by someone who comes into contact with droplets, which may remain in the air or settle on a surface.Spending just  minutes with someone who has measles can lead to the disease spreading.What are the symptoms Approximately  days after the illness is contracted, signs become noticeable.The NHS outlines the initial symptoms of measles…A few days after these flu-like symptoms manest, a rash often begins to appear.Distinctive red-brown blotches spring up on the body, typically beginning at the upper neck and spreading downwards.Severe complications can occur, including miscarriage in pregnant women, brain swelling and the risk of death from pneumonia.Dr David Elliman, of London’s Great Ormond Street Hospital, told the BMJ that the UK should concentrate on making it easier for children to get immunised.This could be by putting on vaccination sessions at family-friendly times and giving the jab to kids in AE.He said: “Only when these components are in place should we consider mandatory vaccination.”The MMR jab is free for adults and kids on the NHS.Its important to have two doses to have full cover against measles, mumps and rubella. The jabs can be given a month apart."},{"url":null,"title":"labour left working class voters","story":"I didn’t mean to, she was just there when I came in the room and I couldn’t find the remote. She had that very self-satisfied expression on her face.Then to stop the interviewer, Piers Morgan, asking her dficult questions, she started gabbling idiocies at  words per second. Like a maling Chatty Cathy doll. It was hilarious. Jabber The Hutt.She made no sense whatsoever. She appeared deranged.Thornberry is the best Labour has to offer. She is easily the most persuasive and talented member of Magic Grandpa’s frontbench. Yes, sure, that isn’t saying much. But here she was utterly lost.And you could see, as she wittered on, the end in sight for a great political party. One I was proud to be a member of for  years. A party which was once great, but now makes no sense whatsoever. A party suffused with hypocrisy.Thornberry was trying to explain why Jeremy Corbyn and the party were so hostile to Donald Trump. And she had no answer. How could she, when Corbyn is happy to call terrorists his friends — but has no time for the democratically elected leader of the free world When Corbyn and his cronies offer support for Socialist catastrophes such as Venezuela. Or totalitarian dictatorships such as Cuba, where trade unionists and homosexuals are imprisoned.Under Corbyn Labour has become a party of educationally challenged, far-left, perpetual adolescents, hostile not only to all of Britain’s allies but to Britain itself. It no longer represents the working class it was set up to protect. If it represents anyone at all it is the affluent, virtue-signalling, metropolitan middle class. And even they are drting away from Labour, appalled by its rank anti-Semitism.This genuinely could be the end of Labour. Despite the worst Government in living memory, it still struggles to hold a lead in the polls. In the Euro elections it was beaten out of sight by the Lib Dems and lost ten seats. Unheard of for the official opposition party! It’s only a matter of time before the Greens overtake Labour.Labour dumped the working class because it thought it could rely on the host of tribes in the UK, some of whom consider themselves victims. Gays, transgender people, Muslims, feminists, black and ethnic minorities.But the trouble is, those supposed “victims” do not agree with each other, or wish to be portrayed as victims.Some radical feminists don’t like the transgender activists, some Muslims don’t have much time for the gays or the feminists. So the whole thing has fallen apart. And it has fallen apart because it is based on a fallacy.Some Labour MPs have already deserted the party to join the hilarious Change UK.They would have been better off joining the Lib Dems. Other decent Labour MPs — Kate Hoey, Frank Field, Caroline Flint — soldier on in the hope that Magic Grandpa will one day be gone. They’ve been hoping that for four years, but there’s no sign of it happening. The truth is, the party is lost to them.Many commentators have suggested that Brexit may see the end of the Tory Party.So it might. But more surely, it will see the end of the Labour Party. It is ideologically bankrupt. It has outlived its useful purpose.THE Brexit Party looks set to win today’s important by-election in Peterborough.People are rightly furious that the liberal establishment and the major parties have effectively thwarted the people’s will. They want to teach Labour and the Conservatives a lesson.I voted for Nigel Farage’s party in the Euro elections – but I wouldn’t dream of doing so in Peterborough.They have no policies, other than Brexit. And their candidate is making stuff up on the hoof. Champagne for everyone! This is utterly dishonest.The truth Nigel and Co are not telling voters is that the Brexit Party is deeply hostile to the working class.Farage has talked about privatising the NHS. He has no time for nationalising our energy companies, or decreasing the ide between rich and poor in our country.OK, I’m biased – as you can see from the above photo. Butyou are a Leave voter but care about social equality too, there’s only one candidate to vote for in Peterborough – Patrick O’Flynn of the SDP.CONGRATS to Peter Crouch and Abbey Clancy on the birth of their baby boy.Crouchie joked the kid would be called Divock Samrat, after the Liverpool striker Origi and his favourite curry house.Abbey’s not having it, though.So here’s a thought – what about Roderick  Nobody calls their kids Roderick any more.Actually, nobody ever did, apart from my mum and dad. And I was lucky, it was almost Sebastian.THE Conservative Party is dying on its feet. But there are still plenty of munchkins who fancy being its boss.There were a dozen candidates until Tuesday, when one bloke I’ve never heard of pulled out.Several more people nobody has heard of fancy a go. Boris Johnson is favourite, of course – but the Tories are weird people and rarely,ever, choose the front runner.If they’re sensible they’ll go for someone who is actually conservative – someone like Esther McVey. Or Priti Patelshe chucks her hat in the ring.C’mon Priti, everybody  seems to be having a go.LOUIS Farrakhan is a foul piece of work.A vile Muslim rabble rouser from the United States and deeply anti-semitic. He has described Judaism as a “gutter religion”.He has called Jewish people “bloodsuckers”. And he described Adolf Hitler as being a “great man.”So who would defend a piece of crap like this  Who would say of him: “Mr Farrakhan is not anti-Semitic and does not preach a message of racial hatred and antagonism” Step right up – Sadiq Khan, London’s mayor, and the man who has spent the last couple of years flinging insults at Donald Trump.You know where you are with the Labour Party, don’t you Always available to support Jew-haters or anyone who despises our culture and way of le.Always available to be contemptuous of our friends and allies.DID you see the face of that woman protesting about Donald Trump’s visit She is called Siobhan and screamed “Nazi!” at a bloke who was supporting the US President.It was a face contorted with hatred, full of rage and spite. Just because someone disagreed with her. Everyone who disagrees with her is a Nazi. Only she is right.Siobhan has since apologised, kind of. But it cuts no ice with me. Nor was I surprised she worked in the NHS. It’s always nurses and teachers – the public sector – who are out on these fatuous demos, week in, week out.They’re the only people who have time to go on them.THOROUGHLY enjoyed Sky and HBO’s series Chernobyl.It was a great reminder of the sheer grimness, ineptitude and brutality of the old Soviet Union.As we now know, the reactor at Chernobyl had a flawed design. But layers of bureaucracy and Communist Party bullying prevented the experts from doing anything about it.Mind you, it is worth remembering that this was by far and away the worst ever disaster at a nuclear plant, anywhere. And the number of dead Just . When it happened the anti-nuclear lobby predicted hundreds of thousands of later deaths from cancers. This does not seem to have happened at all. The second worst ever nuclear catastrophe  The one in Fukushima, Japan, in . Total number of deaths from radiation  At the very most – just one, and that is disputed.Nuclear power is by far and away the safest means of generating electricity.More people have died building or maintaining wind turbines than have died as the consequence of nuclear powerTHE slightly odd Brexit Party MEP Ann Widdecombe has said that “science might provide an answer” to being gay.I’m not entirely sure what Widders means, or what medication she was on when she said it.Anyway, she was booked to do a one-woman show in Ilfracombe, Devon. But the boss of the company staging the show has sacked her.David Hutchinson, a virtue- signalling idiot who can only tolerate opinions which concur with his own, said he was “disgusted” by Widdecombe’s comments.Well sure, maybe. And that means that people who might have a dferent point of view to yours should not be allowed to talk to the public  This story is about a bigot. And the bigot isn’t Widdecombe.The best way to counteract this sort of fascistic intolerance is to hit them where it hurts. Hutchinson runs a company called Selladoor. So, here’s a suggestion.

Can Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party win this core Middle Britain seat Dficult, but it would be a heck of a result and could do to those insects in Westminster what a dose of Sarson’s does to the winged pests that erupt from house walls on hot days.EvenFarage does not pull off a cup upset in Peterborough, Westminster is starting to get jumpy. About time, too! Theresa May quits the Tory leadership tomorrow and the race to succeed her has begun with almost as many runners as the Grand National.Quite a few of them will end up in the glue factory.Prince Charles’s pro-EU pal Rory Stewart, the little-known International Development Secretary, has made a wonderful fool of himself by standing for the job. Stewart has filmed selfie videos presenting himself as man-of-the-masses, in places such as, er, genteel Kew Gardens.Deluded commentators in the Westminster village have praised his social-media “outreach”. It’s the political elite’s echo chamber at work again.On Tuesday evening Stewart stood on a box at Speaker’s Corner in London’s Hyde Park, to “speak to the people”. What a gumby. The only bystanders at Speaker’s Corner these days are tourists, ice-cream vendors and a few winos.If Stewart really wants to meet the people to see what they think of his plan to soften Brexit to the point of non-existence, he should haul himself off to somewhere like Asda in Walsall, in the West Midlands.Brummies would soon let him know exactly what they thought of his proposal to ignore the  referendum’s .million Leave voters.Meanwhile, the Health Secretary, Matt Hancock , polished his credentials to be Tory leader by releasing a video of himself playing office cricket with a few of his civil servants. I had to watch this stunt twice just to make sure it wasn’t a spoof from Armando Iannucci, one of the sharp comic brains behind Alan Partridge.Not that Hancock is the silliest of the bunch. Sam Gyimah, an obscure former junior minister, was last night persisting with his leadership campaign even though he did not have the declared support of a single MP .This was almost pathetic in the proper sense of the word — ie enough to make you feel sad for the bloke. But in the end I’m afraid my heart remained unmoved. Gyimah simply looked a prat.Labour’s comrades are at each other’s throats, the Lib Dems have their own leadership contestand the Change UK brigade, just a few weeks after their creation, are disintegrating like one of strongman Geoff Capes’s deckchairs. More than half of them quit, leaving a rump that will be led by spluttering Anna Soubry, as shouty as a Jack Russell snapping at a postie’s ankles.All this was happening while Hurricane Trump blew into town and gave half-pint London Mayor Sadiq Khan a few home truths. The President also showed Jeremy Corbyn to be two-faced, revealing that Corbyn — who happily joined a rally where Trump was slandered as a fascist — had begged him for a one-to-one meeting. The crawler.Looking at this turmoil, you might think: “That’s it, I’m emigrating to strong, stable Venezuela.” Don’t book your ticket to Caracas just yet.Call me a crazy optimist, but I think the mayhem in our politics is healthy — a sign that it’s finally sinking into Westminster’s blockheads that they need to start reflecting and stop blocking public opinion.Theresa May first. The PM’s departure was so often predicted that it is hard to believe she and husband Philip are finally emptying their smalls drawers at No.But after her tearful announcement two weeks ago in Downing Street, there is no way back for Madam Glumbucket. A nation mourns  Don’t let’s put it that strongly but nor should we gloat.Allow her a decent adieu. She occupied high office with dignity and seriousness and was not tacky, like some recent PMs. There was no Carole Caplin or Lord Levy in her coterie, thank goodness.If that was an example of politicians learning from their predecessors’ mistakes, might the same be happening with the EU crisis  Tory and Labour MPs have been terried by the rise of Farage’s Brexit Party.Peterborough was a swing seat won by Labour in  by now-disgraced Fiona Onasanya, jailed after trying to cheat a motoring offence.Whatever the result, the Peterborough campaign showed that neither of the two main parties can take Middle Britain for granted.That has made northern Labour MPs wary of seeking a second referendum. And it has caused a big change in the Tory leadership election campaign.Front-runner Boris Johnson and his main rivals Michael Gove, Jeremy Hunt, Dominic Raab and Sajid Javid are all being much more ballsy about a No Deal Brexit.The three Remain candidates — Hancock, Stewart and Gyimah — are trailing badly. It is hard to say who will win but , as likely, it is Boris, Gove or Raab, the next PM should be much more in tune with public opinion.Meanwhile, the determinedly anti-Brexit Tory MP Phillip Lee looks doomed after a row with his activists in Bracknell. The people are revolting!With an opinion poll having now suggested that the Brexit Party may have a national lead, MPs on both sides of the Commons are finally clocking the possibility that they could lose their seats.Ouch. That’s the sting of vinegar in their eyes. It’s the only remedy for their arrogance. Folks, keep squirting. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Thats Satans role.Pope Francis pointed out that Italian bishops followed the example of French bishops in the Catholic Church.The French have modied the prayer to do not let me fall into temptation, because it is me who falls, not the Lord who tempts me to then see how I fall, he said.But German bishops have decided to stick with the traditional wording.The Lords Prayer originates in Matthew :-.The key verse in question is , which, in the NIV translation, reads: And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one.It is a translation from the Latin Vulgate, which was translated from ancient Greek by Saint Jerome in the late fourth century.Some Christians have vented fury over the signicant change to the centuries-old prayer.One person wrote on Twitter: “You don’t change the Lord’s Prayer, only the Lord can do that.”Albert Mohler, president of The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, said the changes are “deeply problematic”.Mr Mohler told the Seattle Times: “I was shocked and appalled.“This is the Lord’s Prayer. It is not, and has never been, the Pope’s prayer, and we have the very words of Jesus in the New Testament.“It is those very words that the pope proposes to change. It is not only deeply problematic, it’s almost breathtaking.”CatholicOur Father who art in heaven,hallowed be thy name.Thy kingdom come.Thy will be done on earth,as it is in heaven.Give us this day our daily bread,and forgive us our trespasses,as we forgive those who trespass against us,and lead us not into temptation,but deliver us from evil.Amen.Church of England TraditionalOur Father, who art in heaven,hallowed be thy namethy kingdom comethy will be doneon earth as it is in heaven.Give us this day our daily bread.And forgive us our trespasses,as we forgive those who trespass against us.And lead us not into temptationbut deliver us from evil.For thine is the kingdom,the power and the glory,for ever and ever.Amen.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Always scared, always on my guard. And to this day my body still feels dirty.My house has been broken into, my body, that can never be undone.If you, or anyone you know, needs help dealing with mental health problems, the following organisations provide support:The day before she died, she posted a message to her followers on Instagram: “I deliberated for quite a while whether or not I should share this, but decided to do it anyway.“Maybe this comes as a surprise to some, given my posts about hospitalisation, but my plan has been there for a long time and is not impulsive.“I will get straight to the point: within a maximum of  days I will die. After years of battling and fighting, I am drained.”“I have quit eating and drinking for a while now, and after many discussions and evaluations, it was decided to let me go because my suffering is unbearable.”“I breathe, but I no longer live.”She then asked her friends not to “convince me that this is not good, this is my decision and it is final.

In another dig at Boris Johnson he said: “It’s not enough just to believe in Brexit, you have to deliver it.“The best way to honour the referendum result is to secure a Canada-style free trade agreement, tailored for our particular needs,” he said.“That is how we will take back control of our laws, borders and money.”Challenged later at a separate London event about the issue of trust after he pulled out of backing Boris Johnson in the  leadership contest, Mr Gove said: “That was then.

The by-election was called after the cityaposs Labour MP Fiona Onasanya was jailed for perverting the course of justice and then removed from office following  a recall petition. In normal times an opposition party looking to form the next government would relish the chance to humiliate the governing party and demonstrate they are on the path to power. Yet Labour approaches today’s poll with trepidation.  This is partly because of the ignominious departure of the former MP who was one of many Labour candidates selected in haste before the  general election. Labour can only curse itself for its failure to do due diligence when it comes to candidate selection.A more signicant question is how Labour positions itself at a time of political volatility and shting loyalties. There are still some who believe the party will manage to hold on to the seat by its fingertips thanks to its well-oiled get-out-the-vote operation.  Others are now resigned to seeing  Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party, formed just a few weeks ago, secure its first MP. Such an outcome, following Labour’s disappointing showing in the local and European elections, poses a challenge to Jeremy Corbyn. His message which helped lt his party’s vote in  is still relevant but is not cutting through at a time when Brexit appears to be the predominant factor in deciding people’s allegiances. If things go badly in Peterborough tonight the Labour leadership needs to start thinking about how they reboot the Corbyn project. There will be renewed pressure to adopt a clearer position on Brexit by officially endorsing a second referendum. This may help shore up seats in urban and university constituencies where the Lib Dems are threatening Labour’s dominance but it could mean sacricing seats in the party’s former industrial heartlands.

All itaposs ever had is a football chant. Sov-rin-TY! Daposmoc-ras-SY! British borders and trading FREE!And those currently vieing to be in charge of the Tories - a team which believes itself in the Champions League, but is in reality languishing somewhere at the bottom of an inter-pub league in Norfolk with a squad consisting mostly of turnips - are attempting to win the manageraposs job by shouting these words louder than their rivals.Perhaps the densest candidate in a narrow field of root vegetables is Dominic Raab, the man who doesnapost know what Dover is for and whose sole qualication for this vital role is a -month stint as caretaker Brexit Secretary. He resigned after not making the least bit of dference, a feat which in many ways makes him the perfect replacement for Theresa May, but not exactly the change candidate. For a man whoaposs graduated from both Oxford and Cambridge, qualied as a lawyer, and worked on the trial of Slobodan Milosevic and the Oslo peace accords, he seems strangely stupid. But perhaps thataposs the result of the  years he spent carrying David Davisapos bags. Either way, his big idea about Brexit is, well, Raabid. It is literally frothing at the mouth, suffering painful contortions, and trying to bite everyone who looks at it while showering them with highly-infectious spit.Our Dominic wants to prorogue Parliament, even though there are plenty of rogues in it already. This does not mean he wishes to make Parliament more rogueish, which sounds sort of charming, or label its detractors as rogue-phobics hating on public schoolboys who believe they are feudal overlords born into the wrong family. It means he wants to shut it down. Close it. End all legislation. Kick out the MPs, and let Brexit happen by default.  This has the benefit of pleasing the Jacob Rees-Moggs of the world, who love a bit of medieval Parliamentary process, as well as the die-hards who believe the bonkers claim that the only reason Brexit hasnapost happened yet is Remainer MPs.the two years of polls showing Remain consistently ahead, and that the fundamental problem is the existence of a Northern Irish border they had previously forgotten. Because itaposs definitely the MPs, and not the fact the whole idea is clearly farked.If you get rid of the MPs, they reason, Brexit will happen by automatic process of the law. The trouble is thatyou get rid of the MPs you will also get tyranny, riots, and a fresh civil war to boot.  If you close Parliament it means there is no legislation, no questions, no scrutiny and a Prime Minister effectively ruling by decree, using the ancient powers once vested in the monarch.Its supporters will say proroguing happens between the -month Parliamentary sessions anyway. But thataposs planned, has a defined end, and happens only with the assent of both the Commons and Lords, who use it for a holiday. It is always followed by a State Opening, the Queenaposs Speech, and a new legislative programme.Raabaposs suggestion is closing a Parliament that has already been running for more than  years, for an indefinite period, without its assent and in order to force the country to exit an international treaty through which it does half a trillion poundsapos worth of business. And it can only happenthe Queen agrees.  Buckingham Palace would in all likelihood tell Downing Street it would be deeply unwise. The Queen cannot refuse what her government wants her to do - but Raab wouldnapost have the government behind him. Heaposd have the support of a handful of lunatics, and heaposd effectively be asking Betty to usher in a period of absolute rule. If it were to happen, he would be nullying the general election of  which had the biggest turnout in  years and replacing it with executive power. That would not be taking back democracy - it would be putting it in a blender. It *would* mean taking back control of the Northern Ireland border, even though nobody wants one. The worst-case scenario World Trade Organisation rules require a defined border between trading blocs, and also simultaneously block all the trade deals we might make. WTO rules arenapost so much the best idea, as the absolute worst one.Youaposd think a trained lawyer had read all these rules before suggesting it - but then, he didnapost read the Good Friday Agreement, his briefing papers on the Channel crossing, or any of the books on his own window sill. What  could we expect, but a big dose of dumb. So thereaposs your tyranny - the closure of Parliament without its assent because youaposre in a mood with it, just like the Tudors did. Thereaposs your riots, between Brexit supporters, Remainers, angry snowflakes, furious gammon-tinted racists, protesting grannies and YouTube crackpots.And hereaposs your civil war. Just like last time, the country split between Royalists and Parliament. The Commons and Lords would not go on holiday but would take to their high horses instead. The Tories wouldnapost know which side to be on, the Queen would probably side with the politicians, and the constitution would be in absolute crisis. Raab would take on the role of Charles I, hunted cross-country while hiding in trees and pretending he had a God-given right to rule.The English civil wars killed , in England alone, , in Scotland and just under half the Irish population. They also established Parliamentary supremacy, but seeing as we have it now it seems eccentric to argue the point again. And thereaposs no need to chop Raabaposs head off either - although it might have the benefit of making him more intelligent. Aside from the fact this walking potato calls feminists obnoxious bigots, says the welfare state is a childish wish list, calls Brits lazy yet allegedly sent his secretary to buy him the same sandwich every lunchtime, Raabaposs leadership manesto is a time machine. If you step inside, it takes you to .He suggests police should be able to search anyone, even without a reasonable suspicion of a crime. He wants more austerity, less National Insurance, and an automatic right to build upwards.But perhaps most bonkers of all is his plan to introduce apprenticeships for those aged  to . Let me say that more clearly - he wants to take children out of school, and put them to work on slave wages.We might need more chimney sweeps after Brexit, but even the retired colonels and village fete organisers who form the Conservative Party membership wonapost vote for child labour.  But then, heaposs not really vying to be PM. Heaposs auditioning for the role of Right-wing poster boy, and a shoo-in as Foreign Secretary - with, hopefully, a map on the office wall showing where the ports are.Raab is no leader. He has never led anything, anywhere, at any time. His career history shows he prefers to follow in a big boyaposs shadow, andheaposs not uttering things heaposs been asked to by someone who wants to move the PM race further to the Right, then Iaposm a banana.   Not only will Raab never be in a position to prorogue Parliament, itaposs just another threat. The same kind of anti-democratic trick employed by Theresa May for two years, who refused to end Parliament until it agreed with her and realised too late thataposs not how it works. No-one has ever beaten democracy. Politics is how we vent our anger, because itaposs more effective than having a ruck. If the Tories crash the country as their puppetmasters suggest, it will be the last thing that party ever does because the next vote is always imminent . Another on Brexit is inevitable, because EVERY vote will be about that until it goes away. Thataposs where those in charge of Brexit have gone wrong. They began a chant, got themselves at the front of a crowd, and are now expected to play like top-flight footballers with the ideas, waistlines and IQs of middle-aged thugs. They forgot theyaposd be expected to actually play football, that there are rules, and people are watching.No chant has ever won a match. Quite a few of them are likely to get you kicked out of the ground, though. And we are far closer to de-rogueing Parliament than the deluded Dominic Raab realises.

And he took aim at Mr Johnsonaposs claim that Theresa Mayaposs Brexit deal would make the UK a vassal state. The Environment Secretary said: I think it demeans language to use words like vassal state. People use words like vassal state and treachery, traitor. You are not a traitoryou disagree with me about Europe. He also said Boris Johnsonaposs refusal to delay Brexit beyond October  could force a general election that thrusts Jeremy Corbyn into  Downing Street.   Dominic Raab sparked fury with an illegal plot to ram through No Deal Brexit - by SHUTTING the House of Commons.A huge row erupted after Dominic Raab refused to rule out proroguing Parliament to prevent MPs voting against No Deal on October . Mr Raab, a hard Brexiteer, said he would be prepared to take the drastic move at a behind-closed-doors hustings last night.But pro-EU Cabinet minister Amber Rudd - whoaposs not standing but is considered a aposkingmakerapos for moderate MPs - raged: Itaposs outrageous to consider proroguing Parliament.We are not Stuart kings.And pro-EU leadership rival Rory Stewart said the move would be illegal adding: It would be unconstitutional. It would be undemocratic. And it wouldnapost work.MPs like Michael Gove have been saying theyaposd be prepared to delay Brexit to get a deal through. And several seem to think they can do better than Theresa May at getting a deal - among them Jeremy Hunt and Matt Hancock. But anti-Brexit rival Sam Gyimah, the only candidate to back a second referendum, hit back.He branded those who thought they were better than Mrs May chest-beating men driven by Trumpian machismo. He told Bloomberg: You’ve got chest-beating men saying they could do what Theresa May failed to do. “They’re saying they could go and renegotiate in a Trump way and get a better deal.”   Dominic Raab came eye-to-eye with Chancellor Philip Hammond in a private hustings last night.A source in the room said the arch-Brexiteer turned to the pro-EU rival and attacked his strategy from just a few feet away. According to the source he was asked what the worst mistake of the previous government was. He turned, cold-eyed, to pro-EU Chancellor Philip Hammond at last nightaposs event and said Brits were sick of Brexit aposProject Fearapos. Brexiteer outrider Esther McVey attacked Michael Gove - who as Education Secretary went to war with teachers - by saying the Tories must listen to school staff.And she blamed that failure to listen for the Tories losing votes. She wrote in The Times: It’s time we started listening to the teaching unions and teachers on the frontline. The Conservative Party has lost the votes of many teachers in recent years, largely because they believed we weren’t listening to them. This must change. If we, as a party, are not prepared to listen to what teachers and their unions are telling us about where the shortfalls are and what our priorities should be, we can’t properly claim to be a party that takes our children’s education seriously. She also vowed yesterday to sack any Remainers in the Cabinet in a purge to ensure Brexit happens on time.  This one isnapost a blue-on-blue attack, but itaposs so shocking we deemed it worthy of inclusion.Tory leadership candidate Matt Hancock was branded “a desparate no-hoper” last night after accusing Jeremy Corbyn of anti-semitism. In a controversial pitch to win over Tory MPs, the health secretary launched a savage personal attack on the Labour leader. He told a Westminster hustings that unless the Tories sorted themselves out on Brexit they would lose to Labour at the next election.In remarks clearly intended to raise his profile among party members, he added: “The Conservative party has got to get this right. “If we don’t, we could end up with the first anti-semitic leader of a Western nation since the Second World War.” Shadow chancellor John McDonnell, a close Corbyn ally, said the Tory minister’s remarks were “a disgrace” as he walked past moments later. Labour chairman Ian Lavery told the Mirror: “It’s desperate remarks from a desperate no-hoper who will say anything to try and achieve power. Hancock should concentrate his efforts on the Tories potential sell off of our cherished NHS to Trump and his cronies.” A Labour source added: “This baseless political attack rings hollow from a minister in a party that has supported governments that actively promote antisemitic policies in Hungary and Poland, and has spent the week wooing Trump”.

But other Tories including Jeremy Hunt, Rory Stewart and Matt Hancock want a renegotiation with the EU.Mr Gove wrote in the Daily Mail: If, finally, it comes to a decision between No Deal and No Brexit , I will choose No Deal.   But he added: If we make the progress I know we can and we are on the cusp of a better deal which works for Britain, would it really be in our best interests to opt for a No Deal exit when just a little more time and effort could make all the dference  I would not give up on the progress made. Also, saying that we would leave come what may when there is still progress to be made runs the risk of Parliament forcing us into a general election before Brexit is secured.That would surely hand Downing Street to a Jeremy Corbyn government propped up by Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP .That would mean Brexit was lost, the future of our Union at risk and the levers of power handed to a Marxist. Speaking at an event in Westminster organised by The Spectator, Mr Gove added: The critical thing to do is to recognise thatweaposre not % out by midnight on October  then we risk making that arbitrary deadline the determinant of what a good deal is. And I thinkweaposre so close to the wire with what is, I believe, a better deal, then it would be right to take those extra few days or weeks in order to land it and to make sure that weaposre out. Mr Gove also launched a thinly-veiled attack on arch-rival Boris Johnson, who he kned out of the last leadership race three years ago.    He took aim at Mr Johnsonaposs claim that Prime Minister Theresa Mayaposs Brexit deal would make the UK a vassal state. The Environment Secretary said: I think it demeans language to use words like vassal state. People use words like vassal state and treachery, traitor. You are not a traitoryou disagree with me about Europe. And in a barb at the gaffe-prone Brexiteer, Mr Gove said MPs need someone who is serious about the job at hand. It came as the Tory leadership contest turned increasingly bitter with the  candidates trading insults.Dominic Raab sparked fury by suggesting he would prorogue Parliament to prevent MPs blocking No Deal on October . Rival Rory Stewart branded it illegal while pro-EU Cabinet minister Amber Rudd raged: We are not Stuart kings. Meanwhile Mr Raab turned, cold-eyed, to pro-EU Chancellor Philip Hammond at last nightaposs hustings and said Brits were sick of Brexit aposProject Fearapos.Others said they could negotiate a better Brexit deal than Theresa May - with Michael Gove saying heaposd be prepared to delay Brexit to get it through.But anti-Brexit rival Sam Gyimah hit back, branding those who thought they were better than Mrs May chest-beating men driven by Trumpian machismo. Brexiteer outrider Esther McVey attacked Mr Gove - a former Education Secretary who went to war with teachers - by saying the Tories must listen to school staff. And yesterday she vowed to sack any Remainers in the Cabinet in a purge to ensure Brexit happens on time.Matt Hancock, the Health Secretary, meanwhile sparked fury within Labour by branding Jeremy Corbyn an anti-Semite. Boris Johnson has been gaining ground from moderate MPs despite vowing to leave the EU aposdeal or no dealapos on October . His allies are understood to be chasing a crucial endorsement from the Brexiteeer European Research Group - whose deputy chairman Steve Baker, a self-described aposBrexit hardmanapos, could yet run himself. Amber Rudd, a key figure in the One Nation group and aposkingmakerapos in the moderate race, is expected to back a candidate before nominations close at pm on Monday. She is understood to be leaning towards Jeremy Hunt, but could also opt for Michael Gove or Matt Hancock.

When he saw a photo of his birth parents, he realised he had found his family.David, who lives in Adelaide, said: “It brought up their Facebook profiles and I thought ‘They look like me’. “I messaged Gary and sent a photo. He thought it was one of his brothers winding him up.    He called me in Australia. I thought he was ringing to give me a dressing down but he said ‘You’re my brother.

The couple, both , allege they fell ill with severe vomiting and diarrhoea, and were told to stay in their cabin. Dawn said: “This was our first time on a cruise and we were very excited. But the whole experience was awful.  “We were unable to enjoy the majority of our holiday, and when we arrived home on May , Colin had to take another two days off his work as a joiner due to being unwell. “It has really made us think twice about booking another cruise in the future.”Linda claims she suffered from diarrhoea and stomach cramps six days after boarding the ship with a friend last month, and also had a sore throat and cold sores. The -year-old retiree, from Blyth, Northumberland, claims she was diagnosed with norovirus when she saw her GP after ing home from her £, holiday. Linda alleges she is still suffering from the effects of the illness has been referred for chest x-ray and blood tests. She said: “After boarding the cruise ship, it became apparent people were ill. Norovirus is a stomach bug that causes vomiting and diarrhoea, with other possible symptoms including nausea, fever, a headache, and aching arms and legs, the NHS says. Also known as the winter vomiting bug, it can be very unpleasant, but it usually goes away in about two days. The symptoms usually start within one to two days of being infected. It can be spread very easily from close contact with someone with norovirus, touching infected surfaces or objects and then touching your mouth, or eating food that has been prepared or handled by someone with the illness. The best way to stop it from spreading is washing your hands frequently with soap and water. Alcohol hand gels do not kill norovirus.   “Things were so bad that I saw staff occasionally spooning out food to people and handling the glasses, as well as asking peoplethey had washed their hands and using tissues to open toilet doors. All the pools were also closed off. “But this clearly wasn’t enough, and I noticed that food was not served hot enough and it was left uncovered for periods of time. “I booked the cruise a few months ago and I was really looking forward to it, but it was completely ruined because I was so unwell and couldn’t enjoy my time on or off the ship.  “This is not something you expect when you go on holiday it was meant to be a memorable break, but now I will remember it for all the wrong reasons.” The Stewarts and Linda have instructed law firm Irwin Mitchell to investigate their claims and allegations of a norovirus outbreak on board the ship just a month after it launched. A spokesman from TUI said: We are very sorry to hear of these customersapos experiences on Explorer . As this is now a legal matter, it would be inappropriate to comment further. Weaposd like to reassure customers that we regularly audit all of our cruise ships in respect of health and safety, including hygiene.

She continued: It was so quick but it was just the most overwhelming, beautul moment ever. My husband was with me. I don’t cry very often but we both sobbed. I just couldn’t believe she was ours.”    With baby Lydia safely born, Annaaposs placenta was sent from Leicester Royal Infirmary for testing.

I remember saying ‘unless I’m Mary, I’m definitely not pregnant. My mother in law was with me and her face was a picture.” After hearing this she was transferred to the Sheffield Hospital, and that was when she was diagnosed with choriocarcinoma, a rare cancer that only occurs in one out of , pregnancies. “I’d never heard of it,” said Anna. “They started talking about chemotherapy and that’s when it started to dawn on me that it might be cancer.” By that point the disease had spread to her brain, lungs, uterus and vagina.    Anna continued: I never thought the outcome was going to be that drastic, but I was actually happy that it was getting looked at because I’d been so poorly. “My mum, dad and my husband were all with me when I was told the extent of the illness. They were devastated but I was very matter of fact because I was told there was a  per cent chance of it being completely curable. “I knew the road was going to be long and hard but I was being treated as curative.

I couldn’t possibly breastfeed her because of the chemotherapy. “I’m really fortunate that I’ve got an amazing husband who became a full-time Dad. I had to revoke my driving license which was hard because my family are from Blackpool. “Then I got severe mouth ulcers – so bad that my tongue was shredding. I couldn’t eat.

The seemingly trivial injury caused Gill Haddingtonaposs right foot to swell to twice its size, develop sore ulcers and turn in to the left, with her toes curling underneath. The pain in her foot was so intense she would go to AE screaming in agony. After two years she begged doctors to amputate her leg. Now she is finally pain free after having her right leg removed below the knee.    Gill was getting ready one morning in September  when she knocked the empty square-shaped bottle off a chest of drawers in her bedroom by accident. She said: When I first did it I cried out in pain, I lted my foot to look at it and it hurt so much I couldnapost put it back down again. Initially I thought I must have broken it - I wish I had. The -year-old, from Morecambe, Lancashire, was sent home from the hospital after X-rays and scans showed no break or injury. However, over time the injury got worse and her own GP advised that the pain condition Fibromyalgia she suffered from must be intensying the sensation.    When her foot swelled and developed ulcers - side effects of auto-immune illness coeliac disease - Gill really started to worry. All the while I was becoming a prisoner in my own home, said Gill. I was in constant excruciating pain. I could not walk at all. Gill had to rely on family, including daughters Natalie, , and Chloe, , to feed her and take her out for walks. I donapost think I slept at all at that time, she added. It hurt too much to be laid up in bed.    Instead I would sleep on the sofa with my foot propped on a box to keep it in position, any movement I made in the night would wake me. Sometimes the pain was so acute Gillaposs partner, construction salesman Pete Nisbet, , would take her to the hospital for help. She was finally diagnosed with chronic regional pain syndrome in May  - a condition with which a person experiences persistent severe and debilitating pain followed by an injury.    Gill said: I had already started talking about wanting my leg removed, but everyone couldnapost believe what I was saying. My leg was already dead to me, it was the cause of so much pain and unhappiness and I just wanted to get on with my le. I wanted to be able to walk again and to go swimming. I love open-air swimming. Gill was eventually referred to a specialist in February  who she begged to remove her leg. She said: The specialist didnapost want to do it at first, but he saw how much pain I was in and he relented. In a way, I am pleased the pain was so bad. He could see there was no turning back from what was happening to me. This was the only way out.    Within four months Gill was in surgery. Surgeons at Royal Preston Hospital removed her leg in May  from under her knee, to ensure that she was left pain free. Gill continued: As soon as I came round my partner said to me, aposI can see Iaposve got my Gill backapos. I felt so happy. After months of being a wheelchair undergoing physio and aftercare, Gill got her first prosthetic leg in September  and was beside herself with joy. As soon as I got it I said to Pete, aposletaposs go for a walkapos, and we walked along the promenade. It was wonderful to be up and about. I hadnapost walked for almost three years. The prosthetic isnapost perfect but I love it so much, having my leg removed was the best thing I ever did. I donapost regret it at all.    Eventually Gill felt well enough toto her swimming. She will swam one mile in the John West Great North Swim, at Brockhole-on-Windermere, in the Lake District, on Saturdayfor charity. She said: I love swimming, I feel free when I swim, nothing hurts.

The teenager was advised to have a full hysterectomy by doctors after the condition left her bed bound and suffering from painful cramps. Samara, a part-time receptionist, was desperate to become a mum and after receiving the £, funds from her family she was able to seek help from a fertility clinic.    And after just one round of IVF, she was over the moon when her two-week scan revealed she was pregnant with her daughter Ailani, now seven-months-old. The stay-at-home mum, Portsmouth, Hampshire, said: I suffered with cramps since I was -years-old and it got progressively worse to the point I couldnapost get out of bed. When I was , I collapsed and was rushed into hospital which is when they discovered I have a cyst the size of an orange, but the pains continued even after it was removed.    The following year, I was bed bound from February until June []. I lost a lot of friends as they didnapost understand why I couldnapost hang out with them, I couldnapost even make it to the local shops. I managed to sit my GCSEs with special arrangements at school but was unable to continue in higher education as my condition worsened. I was told at -years-old that I will need a hysterectomyI want to improve my quality of le and it really hit me. Samara, who was diagnosed with endometriosis in , I have always been maternal since a kid when I used to play with dolls, I knew I wanted to be a mum so finding out I might not be able to have children was heart-breaking.    Although the doctors didnapost give me a timescale, I knew a hysterectomy was vital because even after two surgeries, the pain was still there and it was unbearable. I didnapost want to jump into a relationship then have a baby with someone I had just met, so IVF and a sperm donor was my only option. It was a strange process picking the father of my baby from a list of hair and eye colour, but I just matched the characterises to mine. I always knew I would have a baby one day but I thought perhaps I would have a boyfriend too, but I wouldnapost change it for the world, I couldnapost image my le without Ailani now.  Samara felt the best she had in years whilst pregnant as pregnancy is known to reduce the pain and, in some cases, shrink endometriosis. Since giving birth, Samara, who turned  in January last year, is now able to work part-time as the severe cramps have not ed. She adds: It was never an option for me to have a hysterectomy without a baby and my parents were completely behind me. When I was bed bound, I was wondering aposwhy me apos but now I am grateful because I have my daughter. IVF was really harsh on my body, but it was worth it, I loved being pregnant as the cramps and pain completely stopped. I have taken a dferent route to my other friends who went to college after school but I am a mum now and I donapost plan on missing a second of Alana growing up. I went through so much to get her here so I want to enjoy as much time with her as I can before I start working.

Mason Reese, , and Sarah Russi, , say they are used to getting stares when they go out in public. But the couple claim money has nothing to do with their relationship, which is based around common interests, mutual respect and a similar sense of humour. Mason, from New York, said: “Truth of the matter is I don’t see myself as being in her league, so when I look at a beautul young -years-old adult model I don’t think, ‘oh she is gonna be in love with me’. “When she first expressed interest in actually being in a relationship with me I think I was just shocked as anybody.    “A lot of people have come out and been like, ‘really you are with that dude, like why  Is it for the money  Is it because he is your sugar daddy ’”  Although Sarah has previously worked as a sugar baby, she maintains that her arrangement with Mason, who is a former child actor, is strictly personal. She said: “The idea of being a sugar baby is it can be like fun sometimes, like getting paid  for dinners, but ever since I started talking to Mason I just decided that I don’t want that anymore. I feel like I’m happy to be in a relationship with him. “I am really happy with Mason .

The force was so strong that it ripped her small intestines from her body before anyone had a chance to pull her away. A decade on, now , she still doesn’t have small or large intestines or a gallbladder - and her stomach is an open wound that needs to be dressed daily and constantly leaks.    Salma, who lives in Pittsburgh with her mum and two younger brothers, still chews food at home so she gets the taste of her mum’s home cooking. But she has to discretely wrap her chewed mouthfuls in tissue and throw them away in a plastic bag at her feet. The teenager would give anything to eat properly again.    Salma told Barcroft TV: I am not the kid who goes, ‘Oh my God, ice-cream.’ I love savoury stuff, I like meat, I like seafood. I donapost technically need to eat but yet somehow I get the sensation that Iaposm hungry. Maybe itaposs a brain thing, maybe itaposs a mind thing. I have no idea. It would be awesome to swallow the food again.”  Small for her age, Salma relies on a TPN, total parental nutrition bag, hooked up to her body to get the required nutrients. Itaposs basically a bag full of fluids with all the nutrition you need, such as calcium, sodium, glucose, all the vitamins and everything you need, she explains. I’m hooked up to that for  hours a day. When it first gets hooked up, itaposs about  to  pounds. Iaposm about four foot three, so Iaposm very small. The reason I donapost absorb food is because I donapost have the intestines at all. So thereaposs nowhere for it to goI eat anything.While on holiday with her family in Alexandria, a then five-year-old Salma wanted to play in the baby pool while her pregnant mother kept an eye on her older brother in the adult pool. Her mum Dena Ghaly remembers: She went one time and she came back, she went another one it is very close I can see her it is just the third time she went and she didn’t come back. Salma had sat on the pool’s suction valve and the force was so strong that it ripped her small intestines from her body, before anyone had a chance to pull her away. The youngster told: “I was just swimming all of a sudden, I just sat on it by accident. I know the leguard tried to pull me out and he couldnapost because the suction was so much.  My dad tried to pull me out. And then I know a couple people finally were able to get me out, and when I was taken out, it was so traumatic. Wearing a red swimsuit, at first Dena assumed her daughter’s small intestines were her torn swimming costume.  I found someone carrying her and all her intestines came out from her body, I couldn’t believe that it was intestine I thought at the beginning it was her swimming suit.  Salma added: It was horrible. But the good thing is it was so bad that I basically blacked out after a little while. Given just weeks to live, Salma’s parents travelled with their young family to Pennsylvania, USA for le-saving surgery. Salma was then on a waiting list for a transplant and after a year and a half of waiting - as well as fundraising for the , surgery - she had the operation her family believed would be the start of the rest of her le. Instead the small intestines transplant rejected and after six months it had to be removed along with Salma’s large intestines and gallbladder. Her stomach also had to remain open. She said: My stomach was open so bad, we could literally see my insides. Itaposs healing slowly. But now itaposs not getting healed anymore. It’s filled with tissue, so thankfully you canapost really see insides or anything, but itaposs leaking  seven.  The stomach wound needs to be dressed constantly and limits Salma’s mobility. She home schools, uses a wheelchair to get around and makes regular hospital visits. Dena said: Everything is a cost. Every admission, every visit, every clinic. Her labs is like  every week, her TPN - one dose is like . Because Salma’s family lives in the USA on a visitor’s visa due to her medical condition, she is not eligible for public assistance and no insurance company will cover her. For the same reason Dena, a qualied doctor in her home country, cannot work in the US. Doctors have advised that  Salma were to have a transplant again she would need to have five organs replaced: her small intestines, large intestines, liver, stomach, and pancreas. But there is no guarantee it would be successful and the estimated cost of the five-organ transplant is  million. But that’s not stopping Salma from giving it everything she’s got. The chatty teen has raised , already on her Gofundme page.She now also has , followers on her ’Slay With Salma’ makeup tutorial Facebook page, though she uses this as much for a form of escapism as publicising her condition.Dena said: She still smiles, she’s still [a] fighter, she still challenges with her situation. She’s doing very good things with her condition.To support Salma’s Gofundme, click here."},{"url":null,"title":"boohoo shopper shocked size 14","story":"NewsBoohoo shopper shocked by size  t-shirt dress thats bigger than mans XXL topA woman got a lot more than she bargained for when she received an order from online fashion retailer BoohooShareCommentsByCourtney PochinAudience Writer:,  JUN NewsThis wasnt what she expected to receive \"Get the biggest money stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailOver the last few months, weaposve seen many women order clothes online only to be incredibly disappointed with the garment when it turns up.Some have been sent clothes with gross looking stains on, other items were so small that they barely fit over one leg.And it seems the problems just keep on coming.One woman who recently purchased a Freddie Mercury t-shirt dress from Boohoo had a very dferent issue when it turned up.There were no suspicious marks and the dress wasnapost weirdly sewn but it was ridiculously large.    Ria Martin, , purchased the size  item of clothing for her friend, Natalie.

The cathedral service was held in Bayeux, the first major place to be liberated after the Allied forces invasion which was the largest amphibious invasion in military history and the beginning of the end of the Second World War. The ,-strong congregation declared in unison: We shall remember them, before a two-minute silence as emotional tributes were held in France and the UK. At the start of the service, Cardinal Marc Ouellet read a message on behalf of Pope Francis, who said D-Day was decisive in the fight against Nazi barbarism and paid tribute to those who joined the Army and gave their lives for freedom and peace. D-Day veteran Kenneth Hay, who was just  when he joined the operation, read from the poem Normandy, by Cyril Crain, who also took part in the Allied invasion. Mr Hayaposs reading began: Come and stand in memory of men who fought and died.  They gave their lives in Normandy, remember them with pride. Mr Crain landed at Juno Beach in June , four days before his st birthday. He died in , aged . Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said after the service: It was a beautul and inclusive service in memory of people who died in Normandy and ultimately helped to defeat the scourge of fascism. He also paid tribute to the people of Bayeux who he described as being so welcoming during events also attended by Defence Secretary Penny Mordaunt, Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry, as well as senior staff from the Army, Navy and Royal Air Force. Following the service, hundreds of people queued in the streets of Bayeux to clap and cheer D-Day veterans as they paraded from the cathedral to the Commonwealth War Graves cemetery.    There, dignitaries and veterans laid commemorative wreaths at the Cross of Sacrice at the site where more than , war dead are buried. Mrs May - who resigns as Conservative leader on Friday - gave a reading from the Book of Micah before the hymn Abide With Me was sung.

At the going down of the sun, and in the morning, we will remember them.

They wanted to go with their partners and thataposs what happened, Mr Baugh said. My most abiding memory of that day is seeing our boys we had been talking to the minute before. They got cut down with machine gun fire. They would fall into the water, floating face down and we couldnapost get them out.  We couldnapost help them. That is my most abiding memory and I canapost forget it. Prime Minister Theresa May, the Prince of Wales, Duchess of Cornwall, Defence Secretary Penny Mordaunt and First Minister of Scotland Nicola Sturgeon are among those attending the service. Earlier in the day, a lone piper played an emotional lament at the exact moment British troops landed on Gold Beach in Normandy on June , . Pipe Major Trevor Macey-Lillie, of th Regiment Royal Artillery , performed Highland Laddie as crowds gathered on the beach below him and lined the promenade, applauding his performance. The piper began the lament at .am local timeon the remaining Mulberry Harbour in the town called Port Winston, signalling the minute the invasion began and the moment the first British soldier landed on Gold beach in Nazi-occupied France.

A sculpture created by David Williams-Ellis was unveiled marking the beginning of construction for the memorial depicting three British soldiers storming the beaches. Expected to be completed within a year, it will record the names of , members of the British armed forces who died in the D-Day landings and Battle of Normandy. Mrs May and Mr Macron laid wreaths at the foundation stone of the monument. Seven British D-Day veterans were accompanied by four children, including Sir Winston Churchillaposs great-great grandson John Churchill, to lay flowers in front of the sculpture. Addressing the audience, French President Emmanuel Macron said: I am honoured to stand alongside Theresa May today to launch construction work for the British memorial at Ver-sur-Mer.The British people have long dreamt of this memorial. He added: This is where,  years ago, on June , , almost , British soldiers landed in France to free the country from Nazi control. This is where young men, many of whom had never set foot on French soil, landed at dawn under German fire, risking their lives while fighting their way up the beach, which was littered with obstacles and mines.  He added: It is time to remedy the fact that no memorial pays tribute to the United Kingdomaposs contribution to the Battle of Normandy. He said the monument would also be a symbol of the ties binding France and the UK. He said: Nothing will break them. Nothing can ever break ties that have been bound in bloodshed and shared values. The debates taking place today cannot affect the strength of our joint history and our shared future. President Macron assured Mrs May of his friendship, adding: Leaders may come and go but their achievements remain. The force of our friendship will outlast current events. Speaking at the inauguration service, Mrs May said: Itaposs incredibly moving to be here today, looking out over the beaches where one of the greatest battles for freedom this world has ever known took place. And it is truly humbling to do so with the men who were there that day. Itaposs an honour for all of us to share this moment with you.  She added: Standing here as the waves wash quietly onto the shore below us, it is almost impossible to grasp the raw courage it must have taken that day to leap from the landing craft and into the surf despite the fury of battle... If one day can be said to have determined the fate of generations to come in France, in Britain, in Europe and the world, that day was June , . Paying tribute to those who made the ultimate sacrice, she said: They laid down their lives so that we might have a better le and build a better world. The ceremony concluded with a piped lament from Trooper Kurtis Rankin of The Royal Dragoon Guards, and Mrs May and Mr Macron then spoke to the veterans. Some  plus D-Day veterans gathered in the town of Arromanches for a series of events, including a Red Arrows flypast and a firework display. Members of the public queued up to thank D-Day veterans for their service during the Second World War. Sid Barnes, , from Norfolk, served in the Royal Army Service Corps and landed on beach by Arromanches on June . He s every year to the town and attends commemoration events.  This year visitors were coming up to him to shake his hand, with one man saying: Without you and everything you and the other veterans did, we would not be here. Mr Barnes said: People are coming up to us to say thank you. But I think aposthank you for what apos We just did what we knew we must do. It is nice to know we are valued though. He was enjoying the sunshine on the promenade with other veterans including Charles Burton, , who came over to Normandy as part of a wave of troops on the second day June  with the Royal Ulster Rles. Mr Burton said: Itaposs nice to take part to be here but itaposs very dficult as you remember the others who died. In the UK, a service of remembrance and wreath laying took place at the National Memorial Arboretum in Alrewas, Staffordshire, with dignitaries including the Duke of Cambridge, who joined more than  D-Day veterans at a public service in Heroesapos Square. As a -year-old, Pixie Jenkins, a former Wren, helped drive troops and equipment to Newhaven Docks in East Sussex in the the build-up to D-Day and throughout the Normandy Landings. The -year-old, from Aldridge, near Walsall, West Midlands, was among a handful of veterans who travelled to wreath-laying ceremony. Reflecting on the anniversary, said: I think the men that went over were wonderful and I hope the younger people today realise how fortunate they are to have people like that.  I think so many youngsters today have forgotten about the men. They look at them and think apostheyaposre old men nowapos - to them theyaposre just old men. And theyaposre not, they are wonderful, wonderful men that went over. I salute them all. Prince William laid a wreath with a personal message reading: In memory of all those who have made the ultimate sacrice. We will remember them. William. In Portsmouth - a day after a national service attended by the Queen, Mrs May, US President Donald Trump and other world leaders - a veterans parade was held before a memorial service at the cityaposs D-Day Stone. Veteran Jimmy Ockendon, , wiped away tears during the service attended by thousands of members of the public who paid their respects during a minuteaposs silence. Mr Ockendon told the Press Association: It was very emotional, the main person I was thinking of was my uncle who went on the Hood, his we had died just beforehand and he left two young children and my father and mother adopted them. I was also thinking of my father. As well as wearing his own service medals, Mr Ockendon, from Portsmouth, donned those of his father, Sergeant James Ockendon, who was awarded the Belgian Croix de Guerre and the Victoria Cross for his role in the First World War.  Mr Ockendon, who was serving at the time of D-Day but not directly involved in the operation, said: We were just off France and I heard on the Tannoy what was happening. We didnapost worry much in those days, we just got on with the job. Mr Ockendon, who attended with his we Joyce, , attended the service after earlier this week naming a train The D-Day Story Portsmouth for South Western Railway in recognition of the th anniversary. In south-west London, Prince Harry attended Founderaposs Day at the Royal Hospital Cha where he met the Cha Pensioners and six veterans from the Normandy Landings. President Donald Trump and his we Melania met American veterans at Omaha Beach in Colleville-sur-Mer, where they were joined by Mr Macron. Mr Trump, who flew in from Ireland, told veterans: Our debt to you is everlasting. Today we express our undying gratitude. When you were young - these men enlisted their lives in a great crusade - one of the greatest of all times. Their mission is the story of an epic battle and the ferocious eternal struggle between good and evil.In one of the first events of the day, serving soldiers paid tribute to the heroic efforts of their Second World War brothers in arms at a ceremony marking the first key battle of D-Day.  Shortly after midnight on June , , soldiers landed next to bridges over the river and canal at Benouville. Capturing the two bridges, codenamed Ham and Jam, was a key part of the D-Day operation, as it hampered movement of enemy troops and enable the Allied forces to press forward from the beaches. Dropping on French soil minutes into D-Day, parachutists and gliders from the Oxford and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry and the Glider Pilot Regiment joined the Royal Engineers, who were towed across the Channel in -men Horsa gliders, pulled by bombers, before gliding to their small landing area with pinpoint accuracy from , feet. The bridges were captured after a battle lasting under  minutes in which two soldiers were killed and  wounded, including Herbert Denham aposDenapos Brotheridge, who led the troops across and was the first British soldier killed in action in the Normandy campaign. When mission commander Major John Howard transmitted the Ham and Jam code to signal their success it marked the first British objective to be achieved on D-Day. Three-quarters of a century on,  soldiers from their successor units The Rles and the Army Air Corps gathered at the bridge. The Rles held a ceremony at the Pegasus Bridge memorial to mark the moment the gliders landed, with a speech from Major Howardaposs daughter Penny. French politician Christophe Blanchet told the crowd: This bridge was to allow the liberation of France, and with it the rest of Europe. A recording of Major Howardaposs speech from a ceremony at the site  years ago was played before the Band and Bugles of The Rles led their troops across the bridge.  Rleman Peter Ramsden, of the Rles nd Battalion, spoke of his pride in following in the footsteps of D-Day heroes. The -year-old from Durham, and currently stationed in Lisburn, Northern Ireland, said: Itaposs a massive honour to march across Pegasus Bridge. As one of our regimentaposs most prestigious battle honours, it means a lot not only to the regiment but to the lads in the regiment as well. The officers and soldiers joined Arlette Gondree at for a Champagne toast at the cafe she owns next to the bridge, Cafe Gondree, in a tradition held since D-Day. The cafe, where she lived with her family, was the first home in France to be liberated by the British and Ms Gondreeaposs father dug up champagne he had hidden in the garden from the Nazi occupiers, to toast the British troops who freed them. Ms Gondree said: There were  Germans in the village, fortunately they never found daddyaposs hoard. But when the British soldiers dug out their trenches, my father asked them to dig it up. Thus the reason why the tradition of the Champagne is tied to the Gondree name, to this simple house, and this is what I do tonight to thank them all and to remember what they went through. The great grandson of wartime prime minister Winston Churchill, Randolph Churchill, paid tribute to those who took part in the D-Day landings. Itaposs remarkable to think that  years ago the heroes that gave us our freedom were coming up these shores, he told ITVaposs Good Morning Britain. With the veterans here today - and itaposs wonderful to see so many - itaposs wonderful we can honour them and their comrades that didnapost come back. They really did give their today so we can have a better tomorrow.

Neil Eyre found the remains of the creature on Island View Beach, near his home in Sidney, British Columbia, Canada. The -year-old said: “I wasn’t feeling well so I went on a walk not far from my house,” he said. “As a fairly avid fisherman, I’m pretty familiar with most of the creatures in the ocean around here. “But on the high tide line, right in the kelp, I found the corpse of a creature that was just baffling to me.    “I thought at first maybe it was a dolphin or a baby whale, but right away it was obvious it wasn’t because of the tail. “The tail was thick and long, and it had what looked like teeth coming out of the wholeof it. They were fairly sharp, hooked and pointy, about a centimetre or so long, maybe a little longer.” He continued: “The head was quite literally shaped like a crocodile’s head. “If I would have found the thing down in Florida and not seen its tail, I would have thought for sure it was a crocodile because it had a kind of diamond-shaped head with a large mouth. “It was not like any fish I had ever seen, that’s for sure.” Mr Eyre ed the next day with his fiancée, -year-old April Hollihan, who photographed the curious critter in the hope of finding answers. Now the photos have unleashed a whirlwind of speculation.    Local lore tells of a creature like the Loch Ness Monster called the Cadborosaurus, which is supposed to have survived from the age of the dinosaurs. “There’s a group of people around here that believe there exists some kind of sea monster that lives off the coast and they’ve literally got cameras watching for it,” said Mr Eyre. “So it intrigued a lot of people that way, thinking there was some kind of connection to that.” But the best bet is from a local aquarium, the Shaw Centre for the Salish Sea, who the couple sent their photos to. Nathan said: “They got back to me, and they believe that what it is – and they’re pretty confident – is a large mouthed skate. “I’d never heard of these creatures before but, from what I understand, they’re kind of like a combination of a ray and a shark and I guess they live in the depths of the Pacic. “They didn’t tell me for sure that’s what it was, but the biologist I talked to said she had never seen one washed up on the shore.” Brian Timmer, a student at the nearby University of Victoria, agreed that it was likely a skate. He told the local press that fishermen had been known to harvest cookie-cutter chunks of skates’ wings to create pseudo-scallops. Given that the wings of Nathan’s creature were completely missing, he thinks that might explain what happened.

The huge display offers a rare, yet meticulously choreographed glimpse behind the curtains at the hermit state, which tightly controls access within its borders. Foreign tourists have been allowed to attend the annual spectacle, which features more than , performers and is widely seen as another cog in strongman Kimaposs propaganda machine. It is intended to boost patriotic morale and loyalty to the despotaposs family. The Kim dynasty has ruled North Korea since .    But the epic display is in sharp contrast to North Koreaaposs repression of its own citizensapos freedom of expression. Reports say Kim seriously criticised the games for their wrong spirit of creation and irresponsible work attitude. It comes after conflicting reports suggestion he may have ordered the execution of a diplomat integral to the Hanoi talks with President Donald Trump who failed to secure an agreement with the US commander-in-chief. Reports in recent days suggest he may still be alive. The suspension of North Koreaaposs games was confirmed by tourism agencies with access to the East Asian country.    Koryo Tours, a Beijing travel agency that takes foreign tourists to see the show, tweeted that the mass games was temporarily suspended. From June  there will be a pause for some days weeks while the show is adjusted before being launched again - we wait to see what will change and when it will restart - watch this space!The Sydney Morning Herald reports the regime charges as much as USper person for foreign tourists to attend. The newspaper approached the general manager of Koryo Tours who reportedly said he had no idea what features of the show had upset Kim, with another employee adding the display was similar to the previous yearaposs rendition. The manager also said no one in North Korea could confirm Kim had ordered the suspension as they were not allowed to speak on his behalf. However Young Pioneer Tours tweeted that the games had been temporarily halted due to Kimaposs dissatisfaction with the ongoing performance.    Rare opportunities for outsiders to visit inside the state are heavily chaperoned, and curious visitors are widely cautioned against touring there. North Korea is viewed as a serious nuclear threat in the ided peninsula, where Kimaposs regime is internationally criticised as a surveillance state and frequently accused of human rights abuses by other countries and watchdogs including Amnesty International. Watchdogs say children are put through months of gruelling train ahead of Pyong Yangaposs annual May Day shows.When the Mirror spent eight days inside secretive North Korea last year , the Pyongyang parade involved , military and civilians and , performers, many of them children.Kim was seen waving enthusiastically to the crowd during the spectacular.   American college student Otto Warmbier was imprisoned in the country in  after being accused of trying to steal a propaganda poster from a hotel.He was released back to the US the following year in a vegetative state and died a short time later. Last year a US federal court found the North Korean government liable for Warmbieraposs torture and death in a case the state did not contest.

Devout Catholics will need to recycle their Bibles after the pontf ordered the change to the line ending: and lead us not into temptation.Francis said it had been poorly translated and in its current form implied that followers could be tempted to sin by God. The Pope changed the line to do not let us fall into temptation after it was approved by the General Assembly of the Episcopal Conference of Italy on May . According to reports in the Catholic Press the Pope has said the wording of the verse is not a good translation: A father doesnapost do that [aposlead us not into temptationapos], a father helps you to get up immediately,Francis said. Itaposs Satan who leads us into temptation, thataposs his department.    The latest interpretation of the ancient text is not without controversy - as some Catholics felt the Pope had overstepped his authority.  At the time the Pope indicated his support for the verse changes in , key conservative evangelicals criticised the Popeaposs support for the revised version.Philip F. Lawler, editor of Catholic World News summed up the opposition to the move in comments to the New York Times , saying that while the translation of the line “isn’t unreasonable,”Francis actually intends to change the prayer, “it’s very upsetting” because it is so deeply ingrained for Catholics.“Pope Francis has made a habit of saying things that throw people into confusion, and this is one of them,” he said. “It just makes you wonder, where does it stop, what’s up for grabs. It’s cumulative unease.” President Cardinal Gualtiero Bassetti announced the approval of the revised line.    It will appear in the third edition of the Messale Ramano, the liturgical book that contains the guiding texts for Mass in the Roman Catholic Church. The key verse appears in the Book of Matthewand has been the focus of expert research for decades, as some raised questions over the current translation in use. French Catholics adopted the change in late , and it was widely predicted Italian Catholics would follow suit. Pope Francis signalled his support for the change that year, also giving an Italian Catholic TV channel his own interpretation of the line. Do not let me fall into temptation because it is I who fall, it is not God who throws me into temptation and then sees how I fell, he told TV.    The change to the verse does not affect Anglican or Protestant worshippers, who use dferent texts. Church Militant reports that the changes in translation policy are backed by the Popeaposs aposGreat Principleaposin . The Holy See has restored authority to bishopsapos conferences for translations, and called for translators to respect local languages over commitment to the Latin. The Pope has also approved a revision of the Gloria, which will change from peace on Earth to people of good will to peace on Earth to people beloved by God.

A bruised and battered face caused alarm on first viewing which gave way to quite a lot of laughter and bold comment.But what a delightful party, laid on by our warden Sheena Stewart and ladies and saw we all had tea, coffee, and home baking, including shortbread and sconesand presents of wine and malt whiskey. What a lovely morning.To all who sent cards for my th, including the community council, the Wednesday Club, the Inveraray Highland Games , my warmest thanks. And many thanks to those who helped me up after my fall and in particular Stuart Campbell of Brambles who took me to the surgery, whose very kind people cleaned me up and sent me on my way to my party half an hour later.And a mention to Take the Floor too on Radio Scotland on Saturday night. Thank you Inveraray and District Accordion and Fiddle Club and Margaret Mather our secretary for this request.So I won#t forget my th in a hurry, but such kindness and friendliness cannot be forgotten ever.My thanks to you all,Niall Iain MacLean, InveraraySir,I read with great interest the letter in the March  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser from C Rees, Lochgilphead.In addition to all that was mentioned I wonderyour readers are acquainted with the McCrone Report which was written in the s As I’m sure your readers are aware this was when oil had just started flowing from the North Sea. Mr Gavin McCrone was, at that time, a civil servant instructed to write a report on the possible effects of North Sea Oil on the argument for Scotland’s devolution.This quote comes from a letter written, by Mr McCrone, in April : #The Paper was written over a year ago in the weeks immediately before the February  election. This will be particularly apparent on page  where, of course, the ministerial pronouncements referred to relate to the Conservative Government.#So he was instructed to write this report by a Conservative Government but was reporting to a Labour Government.This quote comes from the end of the letter: #When my paper was written it was classied “secret” and given only a most restricted circulation in the Scottish Office because of the extreme sensitivity of the subject.#The report discussed the possibility of Scottish Independence and came to the conclusion: #What is quite clear is that the balance of payments gain from North Sea oil would easily swamp the existing deficit whatever its size and transform Scotland into a country with a substantial and chronic surplus.#Now, this is a very tiny segment from a document that could have changed our history but that’s in the past and we must now look to the future.What is upsetting is thatthis wealth had been invested in an oil fund or more fairly distributed by the  British Government # either Conservative or Labour # there might not, now, be an upsurge in support for separation from Westminster.Wilma Watts, TarbertSir,With Theresa May’s Brexit deal yet again failing to get through the House of Commons and a delay to the date the UK is due to leave the EU, it is clear that we are simply lurching from crisis to crisis.One wonders what good an extension will actually do given the negotiating position of both the EU and the UK. The UK is deadlocked, in terms of its people, Parliament and Cabinet and the likelihood of any semblance of a deal that command the majority of the House of Commons is unlikely. This is especially true given the deep isions within the Tories, both Remainers and Leavers, as well as opposition from the DUP.Given this situation those like myself have long argued that a UK-wide referendum on the deal, a so-called ‘People’s Vote’, with the option to remain in the EU, is the only credible way to break this deadlock. For those who argue that this would damage our democratic process, I am not sure we can slump any lower than the situation we are currently in.As David Davis, the former Brexit Secretary and an ardent Leaver, pointed out before the EU referendum: #If a democracy cannot change its mind, it ceases to be a democracy.#There are few I know who voted for Brexit in the belief it would make them poorer, and it is up to the public to give its view on whether the deal, and more importantly its implications, are what it wants.For once I agree with Jacob Rees-Mogg who previously supported a vote on the renegotiated settlement. A statement he now curiously seems to have forgotten.The Scottish Parliament has led the way in backing a People’s Vote and now that we know the precise nature of the deal, it is up to the public to have its say.Alex Orr, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 13","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWe could be wrong, but the confusion over Minard war memorial seems to be nothing a sit-down over a cup of tea couldn#t fix.It#s a pity the community missed out on the centenary fund, but there are general UK funds available for war memorials.

An implementation plan was produced in December  to cover the years -. Who in Argyll and Bute is responsible for this plan  How many of the outcomes have been achieved As someone who has been involved with autism personally and professionally for many years, I find it extremely disappointing there seems to be an inability by those in authority to get organised enough to address the issues and provide services for autistic people and their families.There is no need for further drafts and consultations.Someone in the authority needs to take responsibility for the existing strategy and implementation plan and get on with it.Maureen Mackintosh, Ardrishaig.Sir,Scotland’s small building firms had a strong start to , in contrast to the UK construction small and medium sized enterprisesector, according to the Federation of Master BuildersScotland.The FMB State of Trade Survey for the first quarter of , the only quarterly assessment of the UK-wide SME construction sector, showed SME workloads declined for the first time in six years.In Scotland, however, there was a jump of  per cent compared with the previous quarter. Thirty per cent of weighted responses were positive, up from  per cent from the fourth quarter of .It is encouraging the Scottish construction industry is bucking the wider Brexit trend with workloads and enquires in rude health. The UK-wide picture is very dferent, with the construction SME sector overall contracting for the first time in six years.Scotland’s good fortune could be due to fewer EU workers being based north of the border compared with other parts of the country, like in London where one in three construction workers are from the EU.Relying less heavily on migrant workers has meant the Scottish construction industry hasn’t fallen foul of thousands of EU workers ing home during the long march to Brexit due to no longer feeling welcome in the UK or sure of their future here.Scotland’s builders, however, must not be complacent. Looking ahead, the First Minister has indicated thatthe UK does leave the EU later this year, she wants a second independence referendum before the next Scottish Parliament election in . This additional political uncertainty, on top of the continued uncertainty stemming from Brexit, could impact on the construction sector in Scotland.The fear is a looming second referendum could test consumer confidence this year and next. For construction SMEs, this is particularly concerning as their prospects are vulnerable to dips in consumer confidence as so much work comes from the private domestic sector.Gordon Nelson, Director of FMB Scotland.Sir,I was joined by my fellow Conservative councillors in Kilmory recently as we discussed atthe numerous challenges facing Argyll and Bute.Ferry sailings, roads, education and the SNP#s late single farm payments were all mentioned.With the SNP hammering local authority spending and cutting our budgets, challenges in delivering services will become more prevalent.Despite this climate of cuts from the separatists, Conservative councillors are delivering for Argyll.

The weather was a challenge in itself due to the bitter cold, but the young people rose to the challenge and coped admirably.The climax of the weekend was the presentation of six Gold Chief Scout Awards to group members who have been working hard for four years to gain the highest achievement possible for a Scout. All six Scouts who gained the award have now started their careers in the Explorer section of the group.In late March members of the Scout and Explorer section joined with the Heart of Argyll Wildle Organisation to undertake an Earth Hour Camp. During the camp the group discussed how the unit could reduce its impact on the environment and how these changes could be implemented. Plans are now afoot for a further event in May to create an installation that looks at the impact of plastic on the countryside.Most recently three of the leaders, David Smart, Anne Smart and John McCartan took the chance to abseil  feet off the Falkirk Wheel. This event had been organised by Scout Scotland and gave a chance to meet up with other participants from all over Scotland.Looking to the future the group has exciting plans for the summer. The Beavers will be attending a district fun day in May and the Cubs will be participating in a district trophy event in June.The Scouts are heading to a national Scout adventure camp in May and the Explorers are organising an adventurous activities camp in June.Scout leader David Smart said: #In late June th Argyll Scout Group is expecting to host two Norwegian Scout visitors and in July,  members of the group will be heading off for international adventures. Six young people and two leaders are travelling to Malaysia to undertake community projects in a remote northern village and two Explorers will participate in the th World Scout Jamboree in the USA.He continued: #We are sad that our Beaver leader Eli is leaving us for pastures new.

construction work to restore an elderly womanrsquos home damaged by recent floods.And the group will also take time to hike up Mount Mulanje to reach the highest peak in Malawi.After planning the expedition last summer, the group has need to raise over pound each for the project.Denis Robson, Graham Little, Thea Panter, John Little and Sophie Wilson will team up with five Malawian leaders to host the pilot programme.Through the Rotary Young Leadersprogramme, the Scottish Borders group was able to link up with the Rotary Club of Limbe, to plan the project.Travelling to Zomba, in Malawi, the objective is to develop leadership skills for both the --year olds taking part and the young Borderers involved.Innerleithens Denis Robson, the group leader, has been involved in making connections with the Zomba district for many years.Denis told us: ldquoOur focus is on creating a sustainable model for educating people to become young leaders.ldquoRYLA is a worldwide programme offered by the Rotary to improve the leadership skills of young men and women.ldquoWe are delighted to be taking part in the pilot RYLA Malawi programme and hope to encourage the local rotary clubs to adopt the model in future years and make it sustainable.ldquoWe have an amazing set of Border Exploration Group leaders and graduates who will be able to help share their skills and confidence to the Malawian youths.ldquoAnd I hope they develop a great international understanding that they can have throughout their lives.As part of the development project, the group will work with local skilled people to rebuild a storm damaged home in Liwonde.Malawi often is hit by extreme weather conditions and the recent Cyclone Idai was no exception.Additionally, the programme will include a Climate Mitigation project on the Zomba plateau.Working alongside the Forestry Department the team will prepare a site to plant  trees in October.And educate the community living in the forest to preserve the highly valued resource.It is hoped that these daily activities, together with evening workshops, will develop skills in teamwork, collaboration, problem solving, critical thinking, communication and leadership.A self- assessment questionnaire will be completed before and after the event covering self-confidence, communication skills, practical and leadership ability and general happiness.A presentation to parents s will be given by the young Malawians on the final day explaining what benefit the camp has had for them and how they can apply the experience for the benefit of the community.President-Elect Bernard at the Rotary Club of Limbe:ldquoThe RYLA-Malawi Program will offer an opportunity for Malawian youth to nurture and grow their leadership skills and potential, through boot camp interaction with their Scottish counterparts.Although the team from Scotland will pay their own travel costs, they are still fundraising to meet the expenses of running the RYLA development camp.Sponsorship is needed to cover the cost of all food, accommodation, transport and building materials for the construction projects.For one Malawian youth to attend the camp it costs

\"Currently, UNESCO estimates that one in ten African adolescent girls do not attend school while they have their period and that their full engagement in school activities is negatively

development of sustainable enterprise, and also raising awareness and understanding of the issues surrounding Menstrual Hygiene Management.Lois added: \"During the first phase of the project, the kits

By this time all ranks of the Battalion had been briefed on maps with bogus name and map references - but everyone was fully in the lsquopicturersquo as to the plan for the invasion of the continent . The time in A was spent testing weapons and lsquoteeingrsquo up all the last details for the lsquobig dayrsquo.In the early morning of June , the Battalion embussed in TCVs and moved to the final Assembly area at Victoria Barracks, Plymouth. At am we were informed that owing to bad weather the operation had been postponed  hours.On June  we again moved to Victoria Barracks and at  hours started embarking on LSIs , although there was a fairly heavy sea running. The Battalion was on board by .. We sat at anchor until . when we set sail for the big adventure for which most of us had been waiting four years. It was an amazing sight, all around as far as the eye could see, there were ships of all shapes and sizes bobbing up and down on the water with their ensigns flying bravely in the summer breeze. As we passed the flag ship, with our Divisional Commander, Major-General Rennie and Admiral Vian on board, all ranks turned out on deck and saluted while the pipers played our Regimental march ldquoBlue Bonnets orsquoer the Border.The sea journey was one of the worst we had experienced, there was a heavy swell running and most of the Battalion felt very ill. After midnight maps were issued and from these, we saw we were scheduled to lsquotouch downrsquo at Lion-Sur-Mer about three miles west of Ouistreham.About . on June  we could see faintly the coast of Normandy on the horizon, all around us were battleships, cruisers and destroyers firing at the enemy, while overhead there was a continual stream of bombers and fighters. As we drew nearer the shore, we could see LCAs, DUKWs, etc ferrying stores from larger ships to shore.At . we were ordered to lsquostand byrsquo to disembark. Each man carried his normal equipment and personal weapon plus to extra bandoliers of ammunition, two -hour ration packs and an airborne bicycle. We had expected a wet landing but when we touched down, dead on time at ., we stepped off the LCI on to the shore. The Navy had certainly put up a terric show and now it was up to us.It took only a few minutes for the Battalion to disembark and then we moved off to our Assembly area north of Hermanville-Sur-Mer , this move was carried out without incident except for a few heavy shells from the coastal guns at Le Havre.At . the Battalion were ordered to move to St Aubin drsquoArquenay and ordered to lsquodig inrsquo. At . we witnessed what must be one of the most spectacular sights of the war - the landing of the Reserve Brigade of the th Airborne Division. It was certainly heartening for us, as up to then we had the feeling that we were all alone on the continent. Several prisoners were brought in during the night.Early on June  we prepared to attack the village of Gazelle. We moved on bicycles through Periers-Sur-le-Dan preparatory to the attack. At midday patrols reported Gazelle clear of the enemy and led by lsquoCrsquo Companythe Battalion moved through Gazelle to the woods north of Le Mesnil.We stayed until the morning of the th when we were relieved by the S Lancs while the Royal Ulster Rlesattacked Cambes Wood. At . the Battalion was ordered to pass through the RUR who had reached their objectives but were pinned down by heavy machine Gun, and Mortar Fire. The Battalion attacked after passing through the RUR and were met by machine gun fire and heavy mortar fire, but all Coys successfully reached their objectives. The Battalion suffered several casualties mainly from mortar fire.From June  to  the Battalion remained in Cambes Wood, where we were continually shelled and mortared and suffered fairly heavy casualties.Enemy mortar and artillery was very active ndash Battalion HQ receiving most attention. lsquoArsquo Coy HQ unfortunately came in for a very heavy lsquostonkrsquo and lost five killed and seven wounded.

A large formation of Allied bombers raided Caen in the early evening.On July  the Battalion again moved forward, this time to the area of Lebissey. There was some enemy mortar and artillery fire, but few casualties were suffered.On July  in conjunction with the RUR and Canadians, the Battalion attacked Caen. The Battalion was ordered to attack from the West with the RUR on our right. The Battalion moved to the Forming Up Pointon the outskirts of Caen. We were continually shelled from the Eastern side of the River Orne. It was a very unpleasant approach march to the FUP as the ground was completely open and overlooked from the high ground on the far side of the river. Led by lsquoCrsquo and lsquoDrsquo Coys the Battalion advanced into Caen and proceeded to winkle out the enemy. This proved a very slow job, the town had been heavily bombed and the roads crated or blocked by rubble, giving ideal cover from snipers and Spandau posts. By early evening all companies had reached their objectives, patrols established on the canal, and contact established with the RUR. The civilians gave everyone a terric welcome and produced wine, fruit and bouquets of flowers.On July  the Battalion continued to lsquomop uprsquo the town. There was slight enemy shelling during the day.On the morning of July , the Battalion were relieved by Canadians and moved to a rest area at Plumeto where the time was spent cleaning up, kit inspections and parades.

This was the worst approach march the Battalion had ever experienced. It was a hot summerrsquos day and having to follow the same route as an armoured Div and we were completely overlooked by the enemy. Enemy shells and mortaring was heavy and we experienced for the first time the enemyrsquos multi-barrelled mortarndash several casualties were suffered by the Battalion, including the CO, Lt.

He was wounded in the face and arm but refused to be evacuated.On passing through the RUR at Sannerville lsquoDrsquo and lsquoBrsquo Coys pushed forward and encountered enemy machine guns.

Both Coys advanced, but were met with heavy machine gun fire, and although supported by tanks, were forced to withdraw with heavy casualties.The Battalion took up its former positions and spent a most unpleasant day of enemy mortar and shell fire.The C.O. was ordered to be evacuated by the Brigadier and Major T.G. Coverdale took over command of the Battalion. Casualties in the Battalion in this action were  officers and  other Ranks. To make things more unpleasant we had  hours solid rain. Enemy shelling and mortaring continued but our own guns had moved up and they did some very good counter battery shoots.On July , two enemy Stretcher Bearersapproached lsquoBrsquo Coy position and asked that they and ourselves should bury our dead who were lying in lsquoNo manrsquos landrsquo. A party of SBs under our Padre, Capt Wilson, went out and did this job.

It was recommended that for approval.A report for the meeting, prepared by executive director of development and infrastructure Pippa Milne said: #Officers are of the view that the primary benefit to the council in having this site designated as a Centenary Fields site is more in the symbolic sense – that the site is officially recognised by both Fields in Trust and the Royal British Legion as space to be protected for future generations to enjoy.#[It would also be] to commemorate those servicemen and women, as well as civilians, who played their part in the First World War.#There may also be the opportunity to use Centenary Fields status to help lever in external funding for the site.#Every site receives a commemorative plaque to display on site, as well as receiving associated signage, the display of which is optional. There is no requirement for an actual name change.#This status does not prevent disposal at a future point in time, as long as disposal is of a clear advantage to, and in the best interests of, the community from a recreational perspective.#Ms Milne’s report also stated that the council would continue to manage and maintain the park, with Fields in Trust’s role purely an advisory one.There would be no minimum expectation for maintenance requirements, or pressure to make money as a result of any Centenary Fields status.Ms Milne added: #To achieve Centenary Fields status, the site must have a link to World War One and be suitable for sport, recreation and or play.#The only two sites which appear to officers to meet this criteria are Kinloch Park in Campbeltown and Hermitage Park in Helensburgh.#Given that the profile of Hermitage Park is being raised through the £ million restoration project, officers are of the view that, on balance, it would be more appropriate to put Kinloch Park forward.#This is on the basis that Kinloch Park is likely to derive greater benefit from this enhanced status and protection.#"},{"url":null,"title":"musselburgh-homecoming-for-new-pinkie-st-peters-headteacher","story":"She started le living in Tranent, where she went to Tranent Primary School, but her family moved to the Honest Toun when she was eight.After attending Musselburgh Burgh Primary School near where her grandmother lived, she moved on to Musselburgh Grammar School, becoming head girl and enjoying a Saturday job in Woolworths at Musselburgh.And after years of studying and working her way up the teaching career ladder, she has succeeded Sarah Ogden as headteacher at Pinkie St Peterrsquos after being its acting headteacher previously.ldquoFrom day one I have absolutely loved it at Pinkie St Peterrsquos Primary School, she said.ldquoThere are so many parents who come through the door that I went to school with, which is great.ldquoIt is important for me to be giving something back to East Lothian.

He goes to bed with his T rex, plays with dinosaurs constantly and knows even the complicated names of lesser-known dinosaurs.However, we have tried very consciously to allow our kids to be who they are and resist the gender stereotyping that defines what a girl should be and what a boy should be.But here was my youngest daughter, at the age of five, clearly articulating the ision between girlsrsquo and boysrsquo toys.Her list was in line with the way toys are still marketed. Often there are two versions of the same thing, one for girls and one for boys.Even some story books are defined in this way, with images and colours which are used to reinforce the gender identity of the object evengender is not specically mentioned.Donrsquot get me wrong, I have no problem that my son loves dinosaurs.But I do have a problem with marketing directed at my children to force them into a narrow definition of what toys they should like based on a patriarchal version of gender.In truth, itrsquos not so much the toys themselves but the emotions and ways of being that are deliberately connected to them.Itrsquos the idea that boysrsquo stuff promotes bravery, toughness, being fierce and adventurous, while girlsrsquo stuff promotes cuteness, romance, beauty and love.It is changing and itrsquos much better than it used to be because there is so much more awareness and debate about this issue. Gender neutral marketing is more common now, mainly as a result of public pressure.But as the conversation with my daughter shows, we still have a way to go.But does it really matter  Is it just a politically correct obsession that is making a mountain from a molehill ldquoBoys will be boys, after all, and ldquogirls are all sugar and spice, and all things nice.It really matters, of course, and I think it matters just as much for my son as my daughters, perhaps even more so.That may be controversial, but I believe that as gender stereotyping is being challenged, it is often more dficult for boys to free themselves from the traditional definition of male identity than it is for a girl.I say this as a father of four girlsand one boy.Perhaps part of the reason for this is the fact that being male is still in many ways the privileged gender, and so there is an understandable focus on removing the restrictive definition of female roles which limit opportunities for women.But the struggle for gender equality has to be a two-way processit is to be ultimately successful.We must also unshackle our boys from the narrow definition of what it is to be male, a definition which still remains powerfully entrenched in our mindsets and the way society works.I personally suffered from this when at school. I was ldquosoft, sensitive, a daydreamer. I was often made to feel I was not a proper boy. There was no space for me to realise that the lsquoladdishrsquo way of being male was not the only way.Irsquom not advocating taking the dinosaurs away from my son and forcing him to play with a unicorn or Barbie doll. Even I loved dinosaurs when I was young. But it does mean allowing him, and yes encouraging him, to explore sides to his nature that society would still label as feminine: nurture, co-operation, make-up, dresses, dancing, looking after dolls and toys, and feeling vulnerable and being allowed to express it.The best way to encourage boys to express this part of who they are is through role modelling by other men, especially in the early years of childhood when a childrsquos brain is forming, and the childrsquos view of how the world works is being created.This includes how to treat others on a personal level.So nurture and care by male family members can be a crucial part of this. But one gender inequality we rarely hear about is the fact that men make up only two per cent of early years childcare workers. And this is an inequality not just for adults, but for our children.It conveys the message to young children that caring and nurture is not a manrsquos job or a male quality. So we grow up believing this is lsquonaturalrsquo.And this idea is so entrenched that there have even been examples of parents complaining that a man is working in a nursery!Looking after children is as much a manrsquos job as it is a womanrsquos. Or it should be, and seen to be. But itrsquos not just about work, or even childcare or parenthood. Itrsquos about ways of being and understanding that there are hundreds of ways to be a man or woman and we all have the right to make our own path.Thatrsquos why itrsquos important from the beginning to show that therersquos no such thing as boysrsquo toys or girlsrsquo toys: there are childrenrsquos toys.Or perhaps more accurately, to show the emotions and qualities traditionally associated with them are not gender specic.As always, children teach us. When we got home, Lewis put his T rex to bed. ldquoHersquos tired, he said, ldquoand hersquos a nice T rex.This was my lesson from my son: a T rex can be nice.He summed up the issue as only a child can."},{"url":null,"title":"looking-back-25-years-since-east-lothians-independence","story":"Twenty-five years ago this week, the Courier proclaimed the news with the headline: ldquoItrsquos independence for East Lothian.This week, East Lothian Council chief executive Angela Leitch said: ldquoThe Local GovernmentAct of  saw the abolishment of the two-tier Region and District Councils to be replaced with  unitary authorities across Scotland.\"I believe this has greatly benefited East Lothian communities, as responsibility for major services including education and social work were decentralised from Edinburgh and instead became the focus of political decisions at a more localised level.\"Over the years, our politicians have ensured ongoing investment in all of our towns and villages, providing facilities for local people, developing our infrastructure and continually working to improve the services we deliver. This has been recognised in a iety of inspection reports that have confirmed that East Lothian Council is a high performing council and has an ethos which recognises the importance of working closely with its residents and communities.\"Our elected members all live within the county, understand local issues and can ably represent the views of communities.\"Previously, some political decisions about our county were approved by people who had no real knowledge of East Lothian.\"Local government reorganisation has improved both local democracy and the ability of local people to hold the council accountable for the decisions it takes.Here, we take a look back at how we reported the news that the county had secured its place as a stand-alone local authority in the upcoming local government reorganisation:East Lothian has won the battle for independence.In a dramatic about face, Scottish Secretary Ian Lang has given in to the majority wishes of the population and decided it can stand on its own two feet.From , the district will once again become master of its own house as an all-purpose local authority.It means East Lothian councillors will be responsible for running a full range of services ndash from education and social work to rubbish collection and recreation.The Local Government Bill which will end the -year lespan of Scotlandrsquos network of region, district and island authorities is currently going through its final stages in Parliament.And earlier this week, Mr Lang ndash supported by local Labour MP John Home Robertson ndash tabled an amendment to give East Lothian the go-it-alone status it wanted.It was the high point in a hard-fought campaign by angry locals which began last year when the Government announced its original intention to lump East Lothian in with Berwickshire.But their success in fighting off that idea was not the end of the battle ndash they still had to persuade Mr Lang and his local government minister Allan Stewart that East Lothian was NOT too small to become an authority in its own right.They had also to force them to give up alternative plans to create an East Lothian-Midlothian-West Lothian authority ndash and more recently a proposal to merge East and Midlothian.As councillors and senior staff celebrated the announcement with champagne, [district] council chairman George Wanless smiled and said: ldquoWe are absolutely delighted with the outcome.He said it was dficult to say what eventually changed the minds of ministers.ldquoBut I have no doubt that the campaign the district council fought had a lot to do with it.He added: ldquoIf I was being charitable, I would say it was a case where the Scottish Office actually listened to the people for a change...It was, however, a ldquogreat decision for the people of East Lothian, who had supported the campaign from the start.ldquoI would like to thank all those who came out on the streets and took part in demonstrations in the early days of the campaign ndash and all those who wrote to Ian Lang in support of the idea that East Lothian should be an all purpose authority.Councillor Wanless totally rejected the previously-held Government view that East Lothian was too small to stand on its own.ldquoWe currently have a population of something like , and growing.ldquoBy the year  we could have at least , and my colleagues and I along with our officials are confident we can handle all the services that the new council will be responsible for.And he insisted: ldquoWe will do so in the same economic and efficient way the electorate have been accustomed to over the years.MP John Home Robertson said the White Paper to reform local government could have been the ldquodeath knell for East Lothian.ldquoBut people all over East Lothian fought back in a massive local campaign and we have won a magnicent victory.He paid tribute to Councillor Wanless and others who took part in the campaign, saying: ldquoWe have shown that public pressure can move even this Government.ldquoHowever, we are not out of the woods yet.ldquoLocal government is all about providing important services to local communities and we must continue to fight to ensure that East Lothian is properly provided with the funds it requires through revenue support grants.The councilrsquos Conservative group leader, the Rev Dr David Whiteford, said: ldquoI am very pleased that the Scottish Office ministers have listened to the electorate.ldquoThe view of the electors all along has been consistent ndash that East Lothian could and should be an all-purpose authority.ldquoI believe East Lothian has the capacity and potential to become an authority on its own and its staff are well capable of serving very well the needs of all the people.He added: ldquoI am very pleased that that message has now been accepted by the Scottish Ministers and that they have departed almost entirely from their original plan.ldquoLarge is not always beautul and I think we can do better on our own.He believed the transition to a stand-alone East Lothian council would be fairly simple.ldquoThe staff structures are already on the ground and all you really need to do is build on that.ldquoI do not anticipate a great deal of dficulty.ldquoIt is a challenge.ldquoIt is something that we should think through.ldquoWe have a new council coming into being and we should try to run it in a new style way.ldquoI hope councillors will concentrate on the needs of East Lothian people and will try and make that their main concern.Said SNP councillor George Thomson: ldquoEast Lothian has a growing population.ldquoWe have a good district council which is well capable of becoming a single tier all-purpose

brother as part of a Preston Athletic Youth FC group that had travelled to the park in Yorkshire for a weekend football tournament.However, as reported in last weekrsquos Courier, the entire group of  people were asked to leave a day early after several incidents involving adults and young players.Flamingo Land took the decision to evict the group after a couplersquos domestic altercation at the

park.The family had made the trip south as Sophiersquos brother Kaden, , was playing in the May - football tournament.Mr Carruthers said that he, along with most of the group, woke up on the Sunday morning totally unaware of the events of the previous evening which resulted in the group not allowed to remain at the park, where they were due to stay another night, after their football tournament at nearby sports pitches ended.ldquoIt was all very upsetting, he said.ldquoWe didnrsquot really know what was going on. To kick everyone out after a few incidents seems to me really unfair.ldquoThere were young kids there who were very upset and humiliated.ldquoAs I understand it, the people responsible for what happened had offered to leave so that the rest of us could stay. It seemed cruel to kick every single one of us out.ldquoWe were on the bus when members of the security team came on and cut the childrenrsquos wristbands off [for entry to the park] which was really unnecessary.ldquoMy daughter was crying, it was disgusting behaviour.ldquoWhen it came time for us to leave after packing up our stuff, we had to walk to the place of pick-up and wait for the buses, watched by security guards the whole way.ldquoWhen we got to the place we were getting picked up from, we then found out that they werenrsquot going to allow the buses into the park. My daughter had her walker with her instead of her chair and was already struggling at how far she had had to travel there was no way they could ask her to walk another fair distance to the buses.ldquoIt was after what felt like ages, and I had kicked up a bit of a fuss, they finally let the buses come down to us to collect us. It was a humiliating experience.And he claimed: ldquoThe security guards were very intimidating, especially to the children.

Warmer summers and milder winters could increase opportunities for year-round outdoor recreation and leisure.Changes to marine le could also provide an opportunity, the report claims, adding that ldquowarmer waters may see the arrival of new commercial fish species, which could boost the local fishing industry.It even manages to find a positive in predictions that substantial smog episodes, which were seen in  in Europe, could become typical by , increasing summer pollution.It said: ldquoEpisodes of winter smog, by contrast, are likely to be less prevalent due to higher wind speeds which will help disperse pollutants.A warmer climate could also, the report says, improve residentsrsquo health by encouraging more outdoor activities in the summer and reducing a reliance on heating helping reduce fuel poverty.However, the report was unable to come up with the positives when it came to the impact on emergency services and coastal erosion, both of which only identied risks.The council has launched a public consultation on its draft climate change strategy for the next five years.It aims to reduce its carbon emissions by . per cent annually and work towards a zero waste target.It said: ldquoThe strategy sets out how the council will tackle climate change, and how it will work in partnership with our local communities, businesses, organisations and iniduals to ensure that East Lothian can play its full part in the national and international efforts to reduce carbon emissions.ldquoThe strategy will contribute to raising awareness of climate change challenges and opportunities in EastLothian.ldquoIt also sets out the priorities and actions for the council and the wider East Lothian community to mitigate against and reduce the impactsof climate change and the inequalities that can result.Among the councilrsquos proposals to tackle climate change by reducing carbon emissions are: continuing to improve the energy efficiency of homes and public buildings reduce, reuse and recycle waste improving active travel and sustainable transport networks and promoting behaviour change to more sustainable travel choices supporting local businesses to improve resource efficiency and sustainability and managing the natural environment to off-set carbon emissions.An eight-week consultation period on the draft strategy is open.Angela Leitch, council chief executive, said: ldquoThe draft climate change strategy is an important piece of work which sets out how the council will tackle climate change locally and also how it will work in partnership to ensure that East Lothian as a community can play its full part in the national and international efforts to reduce carbon emissions.ldquoClimate change is one of the defining issues of our times.

Trees emit chemicals too, and darken the land, thus absorbing heat. But letrsquos not quibble. The Committee on Climate Changewhich inspired last weekrsquos landmark target, is in no doubt that mass reforestation ndash and wersquore talking billions of trees ndash will be one of the major methods of scrubbing CO from the atmosphere.Scottish Greens: How you can help fight climate changeScotland is well placed to deliver on this at least. Those barren hills and glens used to be under a dense covering of foliage. The forests were cleared for agriculture and charcoal in the south, and latterly for sheep and deer in the north. So mass forestation is only restoring the ecological default in Scotland.Nice to know, too, that Scotland, on paper at least, is leading the way on meeting climate change targets, having reduced emissions by a creditable % since . This is better than the UK as a whole, which is itself a world-leader in climate control. Scotlandrsquos abundant renewable energy is going to play a major role in transforming the UK economy.Transport is one of the main areas yet to be decarbonised, and every watt of that green energy is needed to make the switch from petrol and diesel in the next decade. Itrsquos long overdue. The internal combustion engine is th-century technology, horribly complex, unreliable and inefficient. Future generations will be astonished that we allowed our city streets to remain sewers of toxic chemicals.Mind you, the Scottish Government needs to put its foot on the environmental accelerator pedal. It is three years since I wrote a series of articles on electric cars after being allowed to drive some of them around Scotland. There were precious few charging points back then, and therersquos scarcely any more now. Yet, the electrication of transport should be a relatively simple exercise.Every petrol station should be a charging station, every supermarket car park, every school and hospital. Wherever cars congregate, in fact. The good news is that no-one who tries a modern electric car will want to drive anything , because they are faster, cheaper, safer and more reliable.Of course, manufacturing any car uses prodigious amounts of energy too, requires many costly materials and produces toxic waste. Electric cars arenrsquot a solution to climate change, but electrication of transport must be, especially micro-transportation. Every city in Europe seem to be turning to those electric scooters ndash except in the UK where they are illegal. Half of the bicycles sold in Germany now are electric. People are turning naturally to more energy-efficient transport so why not give them a push :Climate clock is ticking and now is time for politicians to fightThe CCC report was rather benign on flying. Yoursquoll be pleased to know that itrsquos not being phased out. This is probably because reducing aviation requires international agreement. However, cuts in air passenger duty seem dficult to justy. The Scottish Government wants APD cut by % to attract more business and tourists to Scotland. But Nicola Sturgeon is going to have to bite the environmental bullet here. The optics are wrong. It looks too much like a middle-class subsidy, even though many working-class people swear by Ryanair.Then therersquos the nuclear conundrum. Scotlandrsquos nuclear power stations account for % of electricity generation ndash a large proportion of our nominally clean energy. But they are old and unreliable and in need of replacement. However, nuclear power stations are regardedas a safety issue following Fukushima. They are also ruinously expensive and damage the environment by producing toxic waste which needs to be stored for thousands of years.The nuclear industry leapt upon last weekrsquos CCC report as a vindication of nuclear as part of the de-carbon equation. Big money is going into painting the atom green. But the prospect of the Scottish Government commissioning a new nuclear plant, given the explosive cost of Hinkley Point C, Englandrsquos first new nuclear power station in decades, seem remote. Renewable energy is much cheaper, joule for joule,it can be brought to grid fast enough. We are in a race against time to seeTorness and Hunterston can be made redundant before they fall apart.There are other issues too. Homes need to be insulated, gas boilers are going to have to go. Wersquore told to keep our home thermostats at  degrees, when most of us donrsquot have them. Itrsquos all expected to cost -% of GDP. But what was remarkable about last weekrsquos much-anticipated report was how doable it all appeared. By comparison with the apocalyptic forecasts of the climate Cassandras, like -year-old school striker Greta Thunberg, the CCC sounded like a walk in the environmental park. Nicola Sturgeon insists that cutting carbon will improve our health and wellbeing and the quality of le. Wersquoll all be happier, cleaner and probably working less in our new habitable planet.I hope shersquos right. There was an air of wishful thinking about last weekrsquos pronouncements. But therersquos nothing wrong with accentuating the positive. The problem with the more alarmist forecasts of Extinction Rebellion, who want net zero by , is that they induce not willingness to change, but a sense of futility and public apathy. If addressing climate change is going to involve banning travel, eating no meat, digging for vegan victory and plunging the economy into a biblical recession, as we close down whole sectors of industry, then people will not buy into it. The Yellow Vest movement was ignited by an environmental tax.Scottish Greens: How you can help fight climate changeIt may well be that the climate change targets are still too conservative. According to the UNrsquos International Panel on Climate Change, CO emissions need to be cut faster to prevent the planet warming by more than .C ndash the new tipping point. But the Scottish and UK governments have consistently outperformed their targets since they started making them seriously over a decade ago. They can do so again.Much of climate hygiene is self-evident. The public are morally signed up to it, and while abandoning their petrol and diesel cars may seem a grim prospect now, in practice it is likely to be a liberation. Most cars spend their lives sitting near a pavement losing value through depreciation. With proper public transport and urban alternatives, everyone wins.Vested interests are always a block on progress, but there is now a remarkable consensus, from the CBI to the GMB, BP to the NFU, the BMA to BMW. Addressing climate change need not take us back to a pre-industrial world of squalor, disease and hardship. The human race isnrsquot over yet."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/9918363.jpg?type=article-full","title":"a-guide-to-some-of-scotlands-best-beer-gardens","story":"Relaxing with a cold drink and enjoying the sunrsquos rays is a rare but welcome treat for us Scots.

Buy a token for pound and a child in dficult circumstances will be able to feel the sand between their toes, have their imagination sparked by a day at a castle, or let off steam at a theme park.Gts of any amount are welcome at www.quarriers.org.uk summerAs Ruth Park from Quarriers explains, this annual appeal helps children from babies to -year-olds, right across the charityrsquos wide range of services that extend across the country, from Moray to Stranraer and the Borders.ldquoThere are families in Scotland struggling with a wide range of issues, says Ruth. ldquoThe children who benefit from Quarriers Summer Days Appeal can be young carers, children who are experiencing poverty, or children who are affected by disability.ldquoIn , the appeal allowed  children to enjoy an unforgettable day out and this year we would like to do even more. A pound token can help make sure that every child we support has a day out during the summer.ldquoMany of us will be planning elaborate holidays, but for some children and families just one day out can provide a vital break from everyday problems. To have these experiences is a really important part of growing up.Ruth provides some examples of the experiences that are made possible by the appeal.ldquoOur Family Resource Centre in Ruchazie is very much about getting families out together, but at other services children need a break from whatrsquos going on for them at home, so our support workers accompany the children.ldquoChildren can choose their own day out. One young man wanted to go to the art galleries in Glasgow. A -year-old girl who has been in care for many years had never been to a restaurant for Chinese food, so wanted to go out for noodles.ldquoOur Renfrewshire service helps adults with head injuries, but often their children are affected too, especially as incomes can drop dramatically. When a -year-old was asked, he said lsquocan I use the money to go the pictures with my pals and get popcorn rsquo.These are all things that most of us take for granted.A day out gives children the opportunity to try new things, make friends, feel included and just be a kid for the day. The Summer Days Appeal allows us to give a child one day where they can escape the dficult circumstances they find themselves in.Doesnrsquot every child deserve that CASE STUDYSophie is  years old and her wish for this summer is to go to the beach with her mum ndash just like so many other girls of her age.The dference is that this is the last summer that Sophie will have with her mum, who has terminal cancer, and the family simply doesnrsquot have the means to make it happen.Rhonda is the familyrsquos support worker at Quarriers and says that this one day out would mean so much to such a loving little girl.ldquoSophie has a mild learning disability, but goes to mainstream school, she says. ldquoHer family doesnrsquot have much and now they are facing the worst imaginable time.A donation to the Summer Days Appeal could give Sophie treasured memories of spending valuable time with her mum.ldquoI am helping Sophie to come to terms with what is happening, adds Rhonda, ldquoand have organised to take her to child-friendly bereavement counselling sessions at the hospice.ldquoSophiersquos dad is young. Hersquos doing his best to look after everyone, but they are all struggling. Sophie needs a break, but this family has so little, they have no hope of financing that.Ruth Park says that bereavement is an area that Quarriers recognises as important to help with. ldquoIt is such a time of change for children. The mental health services that we have launched in schools help children facing those issues, whether its the loss of a parent, grandparent or a sibling, or even a orce.All Sophie wants to do is go to the beach with her mum, something that most of us donrsquot think twice about.

In short, our parents have a lot to answer for.Yet while Plomin is adamant that itrsquos a pupilrsquos background that determines their exam results, he is also aware that choosing a private school is usually about much more than winning top grades. Fettes or Gordonstoun, Roedean or Harrow are seen as exclusive institutions where sons and daughters will meet the right class of people and ndash as importantly ndash not have to mingle with the wrong. Long after they have left the dorm and playing fields, these old chums will form a network whose efficacy in helping them up the greasy pole is affirmed by the front benches at Westminster.As Plomin writes of his conclusions, ldquoI hope it will help parents who cannot afford to pay for private schooling or move house to know that it doesnrsquot make much of a dference in childrenrsquos school achievement. Clearly he recognises the financial dilemma facing those, not in the first rank of wealth, who want their kids to have the best possible start in le and think itrsquos worth almost bankrupting themselves to put them through the elite system. If his evidence of the superiority of nature over nurture is right, then it rebuts the age-old belief that money solves every problem, and that those born on the cusp of an overdraft are on the back foot from day one.Read more: Rosemary Goring: Do not rush to judge Theresa May or any other leaderRaised as I was in a family of teachers convinced that the state sectorrsquos better-qualied staff offered a finer education, I was, you might say, indoctrinated about the deficiencies of fee-paying establishments from an early age. The opening pages of Evelyn Waughrsquos The Ordeal of Gilbert Pinfold merely confirmed that view, although in recent years Irsquove had to acknowledge that private education has improved considerably since I last dipped into an inkwell.Yet the most important message to take from Plominrsquos work is not that any school will serve its educational purpose. Rather, it is that responsibility for a childrsquos intellectual capabilities lies with parents, not teachers. Home is where the future lies. For years now, teachers, be they state sector or private, have increasingly been expected to take on the roles of nanny and counsellor, nutritionist, health advisor and social worker, not to mention become expert in conflict resolution. All this as well as their bread and butter task as educator.When a child does not excel, parents demand to know why. The blame for poor results or under-performance is too often laid at the teacherrsquos door, when mum and dad should instead be looking into a mirror. This is not to say that every teacher is above reproach. But it is to suggest that on balance, parents should ask not what school can do for their child but what they can do for their child ndash and have already done, through no virtue or neglect on their part.Money aside, on the question of state v private education, there now seems a simple distinction. Private institutions offer a one-stop shop, in which extracurricular activities are gathered under a single umbrella. In contrast, many pupils at ordinary schools are like popcorn in a microwave, bouncing from one out-of-hours ersion to another, be it football or ballet, violin or swimming lessons, Rainbow Club or Scouts.Thanks to these myriad options, the distinctiveness of fee-paying schools is being whittled away. In addition, children at after-class events are mingling with a far wider group than could be found in private establishments. As a result, the private sector is in more danger of appearing narrow and restrictive than elitist.That, of course, is a separate discussion. For the moment, Plominrsquos results should simply help calm the angst that blights so many parentsrsquo lives. If nothing , they offer a reason to relax a little, and allow nature to run its course."},{"url":null,"title":"fringe-offers-new-counselling-for-performers-in-biggest-festival-yet","story":"But appearing in the three week festival, especially for debut performers shouldering the cost and stress of performing in Edinburghrsquos world-famous event, can also be testing and, at times, overwhelming.This year, as the Fringe unveils its biggest- ever programme for the  festival, organisers have revealed a series of new measures to address the mental health of its performers at its base, Fringe Central.The daily health and well-being measures, including counselling services aim to help performers at a ldquostressful and pressured time, especially those in the  shows where performers are entering the three-week Fringe maelstrom for the first time.This yearrsquos Edinburgh Festival Fringe is once again even larger in size and scale than the year before: the  programme includes , shows, up from , in , and , performances, up from ,.The programme has a record  countries represented, and more than  free shows, with more than  lsquopay what you wantrsquo shows, an increase from  last year.In the  Fringe programme - more than  pages long - there are also  Scottish shows, with  being produced from Edinburgh.Shona McCarthy, the chief executive of the Fringe Society, said that the new measures for the well being of performers has been boosted from previous years.One-person shows, often with personal and confessional content, can be enervating for performers, the festival noted.The Fringe is also opening Respite Room, a dedicated space for performers who need help, and ldquoaway from the bustle of the Fringe.Ms McCarthy said: ldquoThere is exhaustion, it is a long run to do, especiallyyou are doing a one person show - you can be exhausted by the end of it.

targets.Rural economy secretary Fergus Ewing told MSPs the changes were the first step in a ldquobroad programme of reform to improve the industry.He also said the government would explore how third-party independent checks on lice counts could be used to back up self-declaration.He said: ldquoTaken together, the new measures signal a major sht from self-regulation to statutory regulation. They also seek to move to an approach that supports prevention through robust and independent monitoring.However the Greens said he was ldquocajoling rather than compelling the industry to clean up its act.The move followed the Scottish Environment Protection Agencythis week publishing a new regulatory framework for the finfish aquaculture sector.It includes tighter limits on waste produced by fish farms, including faeces, uneaten food, and chemicals to treat lice and other diseases.There is also improved monitoring, and a sht to siting farms away from sensitive areas in future.Mr Ewing said a review of salmon farms by Holyroodrsquos environment committee had concluded the status quo was ldquonot an option and new legislation was required.He said this would take effect in , forcing farms to be more transparent and responsive to sea lice infestations.He said farms would be required to file a weekly sea lice number with the governmentrsquos fish health inspectorate one week in arrears.The trigger thresholds for reporting and intervening on sea lice problems would also be lowered in stages.Currently a farm-wide average of three adult female lice per fish for reporting and eight for intervention, the triggers will be cut to two and eight respectively, then two and four after another year, unless there is compelling evidence to the contrary.Mr Ewing said he was ldquoextremely concerned about the decline in wild Atlantic salmon, and aquaculture was one of  key factors involved.He said sea lice were ldquoubiquitous in the marine environment and have the potential to impact on wild and farmed fish, but improved compliance with voluntary codes and investment in new technology saw lice levels fall last year to their lowest annual average since .Scottish salmon farms directly employ  people and contribute poundm a year to the economy, while supporting a further , jobs and adding another poundm.Tory MSP Sir Edward Mountain, who owns half an poundm fishing beat on the Spey, was sceptical that the ldquovery poor enforcement in the sector would improve.Mr Ewing said the changes involved ldquoan aspect of independent audit and insisted the government took enforcement seriously.The Scottish Greens said the siting of existing salmon farms should be reviewed as well as the location of future farms to assess their impact on the environment.MSP Mark Ruskell said: ldquoPeople are rightly upset and angry after shocking revelations of the appalling conditions in many of our salmon farms and there are real fears that the industryrsquos plans to double annual production will cause needless suffering to millions of fish.Labour MSP Claudia Beamish said: ldquoThe Cabinet Secretary must ensure that any plans for the closed containment of fish will be fully tested against animal welfare standards.ldquoSEPArsquos sht to encouraging applications for larger scale fish farms in deeper waters may simply disperse fish faeces and medicine more widely in the marine environment, pushing it further out of sight and out of mind.ldquoScotlandrsquos coastal communities need a strong aquaculture sector and it is important that the SNP government listen to concerns to get secure its sustainable future for years to come.Julie Hesketh-Laird, Chief Executive of the Scottish Salmon Producers Organisation, said the sector had been leading for some time led on greater transparency and the speedier publication of data.ldquoThe SSPO has been voluntarily publishing lice data since  and since  reporting has been on a farm by farm basis.

The subsequent scorching hot summer saw flowers dying of thirst ndash which meant little food for bees.There are now concerns that rsquos perfect storm of weather conditions saw fewer bumblebee queens making it into hibernation over winter, with ramications for this yearrsquos populations.The trustrsquos findings also revealed the most common species of bumblebees normally found thriving in gardens appear to have been hardest hit ndash raising questions over whether trends towards easy to care for gardens, fake grass and even articial flowers in gardens are having a detrimental impact on bee numbers.Among the bees giving most concern is the Great Yellow bumblebee, the only one of the UKrsquos  species found only in Scotland.Noticeable for its furry body, conspicuous stripe across its thorax, elongated face and, should bee counters get close enough, its long tongue, it was once common across the UK.Loss of habitat since the s has seen its numbers reduced to small pockets of Caithness, north-west Sutherland, Orkney, and the Inner and Outer Hebrides.Trust spokesman Barnaby Smith said the Great Yellow is a prime example of the plight of the bumblebee in general: ldquoIts numbers have gradually retreated over the past two decades and itrsquos now only really found right on the edge of the northern fringes where it particularly enjoys the plants that are found on the machair. But itrsquos very challenging for us to find out much about it because of its remote location and the small numbers that remain.ldquoWe do know that like other bumblebees it has suffered greatly in many areas because of changes in natural landscape and how we use the land.Holidaymakers and locals in northern Scotland are now being urged to look out for one of the UKrsquos rarest bumblebees to help save the species from extinction.The Bumblebee Conservation Trust is asking people to search for the Great Yellow bumblebee to create a picture of where it can still be found.The trust is now asking people to look in  specic grid references ndash each measuring xkm ndash at sites ranging from Tiree, the Uists, Harris and Lewis, across Sutherland and Caithness on the mainland, to Orkney and Shetland between June and September.The trustrsquos Great Big Great Yellow Bumblebee Hunt, which begins on Saturday, features  grid squares where the Great Yellow used to live, but which have not been checked in recent years.Anyone able to visit these sites is asked to record all the bumblebees they find, whether Great Yellows or not.If they think they have found a Great Yellow bumblebee, they are asked to take photographs to help experts confirm identication.The Great Yellow is a large bumblebee entirely covered with golden-yellow hairs ndash apart from a black band across the thorax between the wing bases.Good places to look are areas of flower-rich grassland, particularly those with clover, thistles, vetches and knapweed, which the Great Yellow loves ndash ideally when it is sunny and warm, and not too windy.The  BeeWalk findings revealed relatively common garden bumblebees which normally thrive during spring were hardest hit by the severe winter conditions.Numbers of Early bumblebees ndash noticeable for their slightly red-shaded tails and typically seen in gardens from early April ndash suffered their worst year since , when weeks of almost constant rain impacted on numbers.Othercommon species including the Garden, Buff-tailed, Heath and the White-tailed bumblebee all decreased in numbers.However, conservation work to support some of the rarest bumblebees appears to be working, with rare species found in England and Wales showing improvements thanks to projects to create and conserve habitats.BeeWalkers are encouraged to stroll the same fixed route once a month until October, counting the bumblebees they see and identying them according to species and caste ndash queen, worker, male ndash where possible.Mr Smith added: ldquoPeople often confuse bumblebees with honey bees.ldquoA good way to think of them is that bumblebees are fat, cheery and buzzy, while honey bees are slimmer, they donrsquot have much hair and they can be a bit angrier.ldquoBumblebees get up earlier in the morning ndash they originated in the Himalayas and spread around the world, so they prefer a cooler temperature.ldquoThey also have smelly feet ndash when they drink from a flower they mark it with scent from their feet to tell others not to bother, that theyrsquove already cleaned it out.ldquoAnd the females do all the work.

Airdrie was just  when he sailed on a Royal Marine landing craft from Portsmouth to Gold Beach. Today, he will be making the journey once again on the th aniversary of D-Day, in hopes of meeting up with some of his old comrades on the journey. For those who survived the onslaught at Normandy, it’s a day that has lived long in their memories.And in this, the th anniversary year of the landings, some  of the survivors – most now in their s – are making a poignant pilgrimage to the beaches on which they served.Poppyscotland, Legion Scotland and the Royal British Legion have chartered the cruise ship MV Boudicca to take them to Bayeux in style – exactly  years to the day since the infamous landings.After setting sail from Dover on Sunday, the veterans took centre stage at national commemorative events in Portsmouth on Wednesday before retracing their famous journey across the Channel today .Fresh-faced...Denis Gregson and his fellow crewmen spent more than three months at Gold Beach, helping to build its mulberry harbour.Among those on board are six Scottish veterans who, prior to their departure, posed for stunning portraits to highlight their remarkable stories – taken on a Graflex Super D large format film camera made in the USA in the s.Dr Claire Armstrong, chief executive of Legion Scotland, said: “The remarkable stories of these six Scottish veterans provide us with an important reminder of both the bravery and tragedy which surrounds that day. “It will be an honour and a privilege to host these incredible gentlemen and to recognise the immense contribution of an entire generation.”Prior to their departure, we met one of the veterans, Denis Gregson, at his home in Airdrie.\" title\"In , Denis was honoured with Frances highest medal of distinction, the Legion dHonneur, in recognition of his service on

It’s a long time ago but, thinking about it now, it was not pleasant to see that.”The noise of that longest of days has also lived loud in Denis’s memory.He said: “The guns never stopped firing for a full  hours from morning through the night to the following morning.“I always wondered what the French civilians thought of it – farmers getting up for their work and being caught up in it all.”Denis spent more than three months in France, with just one three-day break from the action. But once he and his crew helped to create a mulberry harbour – to facilitate the rapid offloading of cargo onto Gold Beach – they ed home.He was later posted to Kiel, a submarine base in Germany which was guarded until the war ended.He then escorted a German destroyer to Rosyth and by Christmas , Denis was back home in Leeds.Demobbed in August , he married Doreen in July  and became a cooper, moving to Airdrie where he has lived for more than half a century.Denis was honoured with France’s highest medal of distinction, the Legion d’Honneur, in  in recognition of his service on D-Day. He visited Normandy last year with the Legion and was keen tothis year.He added: “Historian Dan Hill is travelling with the veterans and is trying to find outany of my crew are on board.

According to these three parties, the new power supply system — known as #cold ironing# — will reduce the overnight carbon footprint from the vessel’s diesel generators and engines. It is believed that this will lower the ferry#s fuel consumption by at least  tonnes a year and resulting in a signicant reduction in carbon dioxide. It is also hoped that this will make a contribution towards further reducing nitrogen oxides, sulphur oxides and noise.According to the organisations behind these plans, it will be £, cheaper to service MV Hamnavoe each year, as a result of the project. £, of funding was secured for the scheme from the European Regional Development Fund in August last year, with additional funding coming from OIC#s Miscellaneous Piers and Harbours fund and HITRANS.The scheme is expected to fully pay for itself in three years’ time through efficiencies and cost savings.Organisations behind the project say that other benefits will include the installation of an electric bus charger at the ferry terminal to open up opportunities for an electric vehicle to be used on the Stromness to Kirkwall route. There are also plans for the installation of electric vehicle charging points, as well as  electric bicycles for use by members of the public.For the full story, pick up a copy of The Orcadian, this Thursday.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Anyone can get involved with this citizen science initiative to save a species. Because this iconic insect’s last havens are in some of the country’s most far-flung corners, we don’t have enough volunteers to find and record its whereabouts. “So we’re asking people holidaying in the north-west Highlands and islands this year, as well as those living in these beautul places, to help.”The great yellow is a large bumblebee. It is entirely covered with golden-yellow hairs, apart from a black band across the thorax between the wings.The charity is asking people to record what they see and to take photographsthey think they have found a great yellow. This will help experts confirm identication.Good places to search for specimens are areas of flower-rich grassland, particularly those with clover, thistles, vetches and knapweed – ideally when the weather is sunny, warm and not too windy.The great yellow bumblebee is a late emerging bumblebee. Queens are usually seen from mid-June, when they will feed on nectar and begin to search for a suitable nest site.They will use old mouse nests, rabbit burrows and other holes under grass tussocks as nest sites. The Great Big Great Yellow Bumblebee Hunt begins this Saturday and features  grid squares where the species has been known to live, but which have not been checked in recent years. Anyone who wants to take part in the project should visit the Bumblebee Conservation Trust website for instructions – www.bumblebeeconservation.org – and a map of the search areas.The UK’s bumblebee populations have crashed during the past century, with two species having gone extinct. Loss of habitat – including at least  per cent of wild flower meadows – is the biggest threat to the survival of these important pollinators. Climate change, disease and pesticides may also be major threats. Today  bumblebee species remain, several of which have declined dramatically.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"loch ness monster study makes surprising find","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...A scientic trawl of the waters of Loch Ness by researchers hoping to uncover the truth behind the myth of the famous monster has made a #surprising# finding.Professor Neil Gemmell from the University of Otago in New Zealand, who led the study, said his team had managed to test most of the main theories about the Loch Ness monster.While he declined to reveal exactly what they had found until the results have been fully analysed, he hinted the Nessie myth was likely to endure.Prof Gemmell is preparing to announce the full results of his research almost a year after taking a series of water samples from the loch with the hope of capturing the monster’s DNA.His team was using a new technique that can pick up traces left behind by passing animals in miniscule amounts of fur, skin, scales, faeces or urine. Having been extracted in the lab, the DNA has been sequenced and compared against known species, creating a near-definitive list of everything that lives in the loch for the first time.The results of the study were supposed to be published in January, but cataloguing the extensive range of micro-organisms and bacteria has taken longer than expected.The team has found around  dferent species of fish and up to , species of bacteria, some of which will have been deposited in Loch Ness by animals using connecting rivers.Prof Gemmell said he hoped to announce the full findings of the study at a press conference in Scotland next month.“Is there anything deeply mysterious  Hmm. It depends what you believe,” he said. “Is there anything startling  There are a few things that are a bit surprising.“What we’ll have achieved is what we set out to do, which is document the bioersity of Loch Ness in June  in some level of detail.“We’ve tested each one of the main monster hypotheses and three of them we can probably say aren’t right and one of them might be.”Although Prof Gemmell would not confirm which hypothesis might be right, the two main theories about the monster is it is a long-necked plesiosaur that somehow survived the period when dinosaurs became extinct, or it is a sturgeon or giant catfish.Prof Gemmell admitted that part of the reason for the delay in publishing the results was due to a series of failed attempts to film a television documentary.Negotiations with a series of production companies ended without a deal.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"workload demands force scots teachers to work six days a week","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...More than half of full-time teachers are working at least an extra day more each week than their contracted hours, because of the extent of their workload.A survey by the Educational Institute of Scotland found that . per cent of teachers reported working an extra eight hours or more every week, which was having a negative impact on their families and their health.The figures were released by the teaching union ahead of its annual general meeting in Perth today with the stress of workload expected to feature heavily in debates.EIS general secretary Larry Flanagan said: “Teachers across Scotland have serious concerns about the excessive workload demands that are being placed upon them.“These concerns are common across all levels of school, at all grades of post and in all parts of the country.

As an SNP voter, I feel that both the Liberal Democrats and the SNP now have to demonstrate how remaining in the EU can be beneficial to the the Scottish fishingand agriculture # a very dficult task.Strong anti-Brexit result in Shetland. The European Parliament has not fallen into the hands of the far right. In Britain the total Remain vote was larger than the total Leave vote :. Fishermen will always need a market for their landings and remote farmers and crofters know Europe tries to look after them even though nationally agribusiness seeks to pocket too much subsidy. Overall a victory for hope not hate. Lest we forget what international solidarity and cooperation sounds like:Love it. What a wonderful man and what a great work – one of Europe’s greatest composers and one of Europe’s greatest poets – a sublime combination. Here’s to Europe and Europeans: Wo dein zanfter Flügel weiltThis has always been my favourite stanza, but I’ve yet to find a satisfactory English translation – one that conveys the humanity as well as the poetry. Would you happen to have one Peter as ian says your discount the exit tories and labour. and best for remain itsa draw at worse its a good win for leave.In Britain, the total Remain vote was larger than the total Leave vote :. you claim that is not true.O dear me, Peter, you have absolutely forgotten both the Tories and the Labour voters. What you have counted was the Leave without a deal of any type vote  and your figure of  includes voters who may care nothing about the EU but are considering a host of other reasons for casting their vote.LOL The London Liberals’ view of democracy:“Dear plebs, we’re honouring you by asking your advice on which of two options # Leave or Remain # you want us to adopt .” 🙂Alternative description of London Liberals:They made it % clear that they want to withdraw Article  and remain in the EU.They expressed this view in language that was so clear that not a single person could misunderstand them.Millions of London plebs agreed with them and voted Liberal, so they won the election.If you saw anything dferent John, I suspect your moving picture wireless needs re-tuning.Would you say the same about the SNP in Scotland, Malcolm Liebe Rosa, you’ve fairly thrown down the gauntlet there!I agree, each translation has issues, but happily help is at hand within Shetland culture. Schiller was surely making a typically Enlightenment-era appeal for people everywhere to enjoy brotherhood or solidarity, irrespective of the irrational isions imposed on us, saying that joy in this reunites us. He knew it was chance that saw us on one side or another of any nationalist driven war, and wanted to emphasise the need for healing and togetherness.It’s a concept of course that also is captured by Robert Burns ten years after Schiller in: For a’ that and a’ that, or Trotz alledem und alledem, as it also became in . The final lines guaranteed translation into many other language too:Shall brithers be for a# thatSchiller would also have recognised the romantic sensibilities which informed Shetland’s Up-Helly Aa, or unserer feuer-trunken Faschingsdeinstag, ob du wilst. I think these lines from the closing verse of The Galley Song capture Schiller’s intention perfectly:O’er stre the curtain drawHappy to see Europe inspiring Shetland still!#Schiller was surely making a typically Enlightenment-era appeal for people everywhere to enjoy brotherhood or solidarity, irrespective of the irrational isions imposed on us#Unless of course they#re English eh Peter. You want to separate scotland from the rest of the UK yet come out with the PC BS above. just who are you trying to kid I wondered when the anti- English racist rhetoric would raise its ugly head on here. Rule Britannia was actually written by Thomas Arne a Roman Catholic who was proud to be British. He’d get short shrt on the so called Liberal Shetland Islands.The first  notes of Beethoven#s Fth. Lest we forget how Europe became free.And there is a big world out there we don#t need Europepo founded , napoleon long dead by then. liberals to replace lairds  look at tavish family historyThe original company originates from , with the formation of the Peninsular  Oriental Steam Navigation Company, Napolean not long dead . Napoleonic Wars were certainly consequential in the rationale behind the companies formation. Particularly the Peninsular war.It wasn’t of course ever a one way street. Garve, a contemporary of Schiller and Goethe, did a great to broadcast the gains of the Scottish Enlightenment by translating and accrediting the works of Smith, Hume, Ferguson, Hutcheson, Reid and others, to the extent that Goethe himself, though perhaps before his heyday, said there was nowhere in Europe that could hold a candle to what was happening in Scotland. It would be unreasonable to suggest Burns did not become familiar with the thoughts of Kant, Rousseau, Locke, and other European philosophers, directly or indirectly, in the salons of Edinburgh. It would similarly be a nonsense to suggest that Haldane had no exposure to all this. His inspiration cannot be orced from the earlier flourishing of inspirational ideas of brotherhood and equal worth that happily live on yet. Shetland, after the Napoleonic era, seems to have been quite a radical place to a degree, as the later broken-promise legal challenges possibly demonstrate. There was also a legal challenge related to a whale grounding in Sandwick which seemed fairly radical in intent. The underpinning ideas don’t appear to respect the random lines drawn on maps that seem to dominate some people’s thinking.Some lines are more equal than others eh Peter The modern Labour movement of course grew out of the earlier Liberals, with many older ideas and values broadly held in common. Opening the debate, crossbencher, Lord Lisvane saw a problem where Scotland and Northern Ireland, as two of four parts of the United Kingdom, backed Remain, yet could be dragged out of Europe against their will. He identied #a sort of imperial condescension from the centre—from Westminster and Whitehall# and sought #a devolution settlement properly owned by its participants# that would #include something perhaps missing from the present arrangements: the R word—respect.#Most Scots voted to continue their solidarity with Europe, whilst a signicantminority of English and Welsh voters would apparently risk sacricing their older union with Scotland in order to Leave. Schilleradvocated seeking broadminded and warmhearted company. Should the UK falter, will it be those who sought to continue to enjoy the benefits of the wider degree of solidarity who are really to blame I am so sorry, Peter Hamilton, Schiller died two hundred years ago. Have you someone a little more contemporary to bore us with  Tony Benn had some creative thoughts about Europe, as did Jack Jones. They were real socialists and Democrats, not pretentious windbags. Now carry on spouting, Liebe Rosa, will be most impressed. # made me realise how cushioned from the worst excesses of Tory Lib-Dem austerity we are in Scotland: free prescriptions, no bedroom tax and – of vital important to many state benefit recipients – universal credit payment choices, to name but three. This of course, was reflected in Shetland’s EU election result. My friend is planning on early retirement and swt relocation to pro-Europe Shetland.In that same spirit, and reflecting on Northern Ireland’s and Scotland’s situation, I found myself wondering how someone might feeltheir favourite pub, which offers a decent selection of bar meals, was to be burned down by their dour in-laws who run the bog standard cafe next door, all in order to secure wider access to the market.These words were in the context of his apologising to the Roma people for Catholic discrimination.They sit in contrast to Farage’s racist and isive comments regarding Romanians that some people willingly overlook.

Students have learnt about the aquacultures along the tidal zones of Skye and food practices that can support them.During the summer, three graduates of the course have been awarded a Climavore apprenticeship in restaurants across Skye and Raasay # Edinbane Lodge, Raasay House, and Scorrybreac Restaurant. Working in close collaboration with the chefs and kitchen teams, the apprentices will develop, prepare and serve Climavore dishes to support and develop alternative aquacultures that promote cleaner usage of the tidal zone.The programme will be launched with a celebratory meal on Saturday st June at the oyster table in Portree. Prepared in partnership with the pupils, diners will be treated to a lunch of scallop ceviche, oysters, seaweed soup and carrageen panna cotta, washed down with a Harris Gin and sea buckthorn cocktail.Events on Sunday nd June will include a walk to a rare native Skye oyster habitat, which will be followed by a screening of the recently-released film #Artishal# at the Aros Centre in Portree.

The late Peter McCambridge won his Distinguished Conduct Medal on the Longest Day - but he had, in fact, dropped into Normandy in the late evening of June , .Anyone who has seen the film of The Longest Day will remember the scenes featuring Richard Todd and the Glider troops of the Oxs and Bucks Light Infantry attacking Pegasus Bridge.Mr. McCambridge, then an NCO with the thParachute Btn. of the th Airborne Division, was fighting only yards from this famous action in the nearby village of Le Port.In later years, Peter McCambridge was a familiar figure in Ballymena. He lived at Wilson Crescent and was a keen walker. Few,any, would have known that the tall, bespectacled figure who went about his civilian le so quietly and modestly was one of the heroes of D-Day.This is what his citation recorded about the action:-  Unit : B Company, th Parachute Battalion. Service No. : . Awards : Distinguished Conduct Medal‘This NCO was one of the parachute troops who landed behind the German lines in Normandy on the night th th June . During the fighting for Beacutenouville bridge on the th June, McCambridges platoon was responsible for holding the village of Le Port. At one period his section became detached from the platoon and the fighting, which went on for  hours almost without pause, was particularly fierce. McCambridge noticed that one house dominated the scene of the fighting. By skilful use of a smoke grenade and displaying the greatest dash he got his section across a road swept by Machine Gun fire and into the house. He used anti-tank grenades to smash open the garden gate and the door of the house. Once inside the house he was completely cut off from the rest of his company, who actually had withdrawn slightly, but he was in a dominating position and became the target for the enemy who greatly outnumbered his section and were surrounding him. So well did he dispose his men however and so splendid was his leadership that he held this isolated house until the seaborne troops eventually entered the village from the other end, several hours later. At times the enemy were close enough to try and beat down the door by beating it with their rle butts - McCambridge dealt with such attacks by having grenades dropped on them from the upper windows. There is no doubt that the holding of this dominating house seriously weakened the enemy attacks and greatly assisted the battalion to carry out its job of holding the bridge. On the th June at Bois de Bavent during a company attack Sgt McCambridge, together with another NCO, saved the le of his platoon commander, who had been wounded and whose phosphorus bomb was burning in his pouch. Between them they extracted the burning bomb and dragged the officer to cover despite heavy and accurate mortar and Machine Gun fire.McCambridge has shown himself throughout the three weeks continuous fighting to be a truly magnicent NCO. He is calm, cheerful and always reliable.

The Amateurs celebrated reaching the historic milestone by holding a gala sports dinner at the Millbrook Lodge Hotel in Ballynahinch“Sixty years is a long time for a Junior or indeed an Intermediate club to keep going, especially in the modern day when there are so many other attractions,” said Mr Martin.He revealed that the Irish FA was working on a strategy to reverse the nationwide decline in the adult game, and hoped that the Amateurs would themselves benefit from this plan in the near future.Over  members, friends and former players of Dromore Amateurs enjoyed a fantastic evening at the Millbrook Lodge Hotel, Ballynahinch on April  as the club celebrated in fine style its th anniversary.Formed at the beginning of the   season, the Amateurs have maintained football in the Co Down town for six decades.Terry Pateman, chairman of the Northern Amateur Football League, presents a crystal vase to Amateurs chairman Russell WardAs well as the president of the Irish FA, special guests on the night included Terry Pateman, chairman of the Northern Amateur Football League, and Maurice Johnston, vice chairman of the Mid Ulster Football League.Dromore played in the Northern Amateur Football League from  to  and again from  to , before moving to the Mid Ulster Football League where they currently play in the Intermediate B Division.The compere and after-dinner speaker was BBC legend Jackie Fullerton, whose wit and charm throughout the evening brought much fun and laughter.The Ballymena man’s tales about sporting icons George Best, Joey Dunlop and Alex Higgins went down a storm with the audience.Mid Ulster Football League representatives Maurice Johnston, vice chairman, left, and Stephen Magill, honorary secretary, right, make a presentation to Russell Ward, chairman of Dromore AmateursMr Fullerton was the perfect gentleman with all he met, mingling with guests and accommodating every request for a photograph or a selfie with good grace.SpeechesThe Amateurs’ hard-working committee was delighted to secure the attendance of such a prestigious guest as the president of Irish FA.Universal Credit in Crisis: These people want you to hear their stories of le on the problem benefit before it is rolled-out even further Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"However, the pleasure was reciprocated because, of course, Mr Martin is an Amateurs old boy himself.Top goalscorer and first team player of the year Matthew Reain, centre, withcoach Keith Halliday and manager Graeme DavisHe spent  years with the club as a player and club treasurer.“I receive many invitations over the course of a year but this is one which gives me so much pleasure in being able to attend,” Mr Martin told the audience. “It was Mountview Park in  when I joined the club.“I was a second team player. Robert Gracey, Sam Vint, Aubrey Davidson, Wyn Crothers, Brendan Maginess, Philip Roy, Bernie Mackin, John Toucher and, of course, so many others, were my teammates.“They were great times, great moments. We weren’t successful, however these guys were fine clubmen.“I was treasurer from  to . We developed the clubhouse and upgraded the pitch and surroundings. We put the club on a sound financial footing before I left in  – this was achieved from a less-than-zero position in .“Suffice to say, this is where I began as a football administrator and I have always been grateful to the club for that.”Commenting on the Amateurs’ exciting plans for a new pitch and clubrooms, Mr Martin said the future was looking bright for his old club. He brought the best wishes of the Irish FA and on their behalf presented a crystal bowl to Dromore chairman Russell Ward to mark the occasion.Indeed, Mr Ward was a busy man on the night.In addition to making two fine speeches himself, the Amateurs chairman was presented with a further two pieces of crystal from Mr Pateman and Mr Johnston. Both league officials made excellent speeches during which they brought the best wishes of their respective organisations and paid generous compliments to Dromore on reaching their th anniversary.AuctionA highlight of the evening was the auction of sporting memorabilia. Hospitality tickets for a Northern Ireland game, signed shirts from Ulster Rugby and Linfield FC, and signed footballs from Rangers FC and Manchester United, all sold for very respectable sums.However, a titanic bidding war took place over a signed Liverpool FC football and the atmosphere in the room was electric as the figure kept getting higher and higher.When the auctioneer, Mr Fullerton, eventually brought the hammer down and declared ‘sold’, it was Amateurs committee member and local businessman Darren McCauley who became the new owner of the prized football.He might have paid an eye-watering amount, but being a lelong Liverpool fan and a great Dromore clubman, Mr McCauley was delighted with his purchase – and with Liverpool having won the Champions League final at the weekend, it now looks like a clever investment.With the formalities over, it was time for the band to take to the stage, and five-piece Klass proved a big hit, packing the dancefloor until the finish.AwardsThe final act of the   season came on Saturday, May  with a charity match between current players and a team of Amateurs “legends”.An entertaining game was played in a friendly but competitive spirit at the Community Centre.The youthful legs of the current players proved too much for the wise old heads of the legends. However, a clever tactical decision to play the last  minutes with  players on the pitch helped the old boys finish the game with a respectable - defeat.It was wonderful to see so many former players come along, pull the boots on and attempt to relive past glories. Special mention goes to Malcolm Hanna, who celebrated his th birthday with a sterling display in midfield.A total of £ was raised for Diabetes UK, with the costs of the day kindly sponsored by Trevor Tate and Son Transport Ltd.Afterwards, the Amateurs held their end-of-season awards presentation in the clubrooms.Chairman Russell Ward expressed his sincere thanks to the coaching staff, players and committee for all their efforts throughout the season.First team player-manager Graeme Davis was praised for guiding the Amateurs to their highest place league finish in many years.Dromore ended the season in fth positionin the Intermediate B Division of the Mid Ulster Football League.Their record was as follows: P W D L Pts .Graeme can be proud of this achievement in his debut season in charge.

Although there were many ups and downs over the year, the team stuck together and there was a great spirit in the changing room, right up until the last game.The award winners for both teams was dominated by young players – an encouraging sign for the future.The first teams gongs were a family affair, with the Reain brothers, Josh and Matthew, iding up the trophies between them. These two fantastic athletes will be the backbone of the first team for many years to come.Young player of the year was Matthew Briggs, who moved up from youth football and played the entire season in the first team - a tremendous achievement.In the seconds, top goalscorer Jonathan Rodgers only joined midway through the season but he is a great attacking player and is such an exciting prospect. And -year-old Nathan Thompson capped a wonderful season by taking home both the manager’s and players’ player of the year trophies. Nathan is a quiet young man – but on the pitch he makes his presence felt, and is a model defender who rarely makes a mistake.Clubman of the year was the popular Christopher Tate – a committee member and first team coach, Christopher puts his heart and soul into the club.Dromore Amateurs will hold their AGM in the clubrooms on Monday, June  at pm.

It was really satisfying, there were no TVs, no gaming machines, managing there was all about conversation.”Gerry spoke of how the initial spark of the Jawbox brand came about due to his “wee bit of entrepreneurial spirit” – the ‘spirit’ being his drink of choice.“In all the years I’ve worked in bars the only spirit I’ve ever liked was gin. I had the idea of producing my own gin, bringing out my own brand. If it didn’t work I was more than happy to stay on as a barman, I would’ve always regretted never giving it a go.”Gerry said the process took over two and a half years from the concept to getting the name registered.“I did come close to giving up but all the right people came together, the absolute best of the best, with Echlinville distiller Shane Branf, his head distiller Graham Miller and packaging and branding coming from Drinksology. Everything started to move dead fast.”The launch night of Jawbox took place in late February  – “a night of one of the worst storms, so I wasn’t hopeful people were going to turn up” – at the Linehall Library, with a little help from the then Lord Mayor Arder Carson.“I didn’t want to launch Jawbox in a bar, every other bar would’ve gone ‘Well, why didn’t you launch it in my bar ’ I wanted something ‘old Belfast’ and at the start Linenhall [Library] told me that didn’t really do launches as such. I loved the setting and told them I had the Lord Mayor on board – I just had to ask him,” he laughed.“I then went over to City Hall and said ‘Any chance of speaking to the Lord Mayor ’ The staff were brilliant and Arder came over and fair play as he likes a brandy.“The next day, when it was being rolled out, I think almost every bar in Belfast took it.”In the event, over  people turned up to support Gerry that night – “one of their own”Jawbox is now served in bars across Ireland, has its own mural in Kelly’s Cellars, is the go-to spirit at Belfast International Airport, is served across the water as well as its signature label displayed in over , retail outlets in England, Wales and Scotland.Recently awarded Supplier of the Year at the Institute of Hospitality Awards at Titanic Belfast, Gerry was one of five artisan suppliers chosen to showcase his product at a reception for Prince Charles and Camilla at the Grand Central on Wednesday.“The name comes from my granny, Maisie, Maisie Cunningham, who would always say to us ‘In my day we all stood round the jawbox and did our washing,’ as not everyone had the pleasure or the luxury of having their own shared washing area. Everything would have been washed in a big Belfast sink, clothes, dishes, the baby –everything was washed in it. People shared their stories, told their tales, it was their jaws going round the box. I always say to people to this very day, when they have parties, where do people go  The kitchen. Everybody stands around the sink.”It’s evident just how much pride and enthusiasm Gerry has for the product that has grown at a speed he never foresaw just three years ago.“The award for Supplier of the Year meant an amazing amount to me, it was my fth time being shortlisted, twice for Jawbox, always the bridesmaid, never the bride. It was fantastic.”The -year-old says the power to promote Jawbox via social media is “amazing”.“There are places Jawbox is appearing that I would never know. Philip Schofield posted a bottle to his Snapchat, everybody was ringing me saying ‘did you see it  Did you see it ’”Having grown up in C­onway Street and later Lenadoon, Gerry has his base just off Queen’s University Belfast. “Where will the next three years take Jawbox ” I ask him. He replies: “The States.”“You only get one chance in America. It’s a matter of making sure we have the right importer, distributor. Sean Muldoon and Jack McCarty from the Dead Rabbit are out there who are going to be so supportive.

These lines of inquiry do not include the journalists, Mr Birney or Mr McCaffrey, as suspects in the investigation.“At all times, my officers have acted in good faith, within the law and followed due process. The warrant application was originally submitted to and approved by a county court judge. We do, however, accept and respect the decision of the High Court last week.“We plan to produce a final report to the Chief Constable of the PSNI outlining all of our findings.”In response PSNI Chief Constable George Hamilton said: “In , PSNI became aware of an alleged theft and or unlawful leaking of sensitive documents relating to the Loughinisland investigation from the Office of the Police Ombudsman. To ensure independence and address any conflict of interest I asked Durham Constabulary to conduct the investigation.“I am grateful to Durham Constabulary and to Chief Constable Mike Barton for the work they have conducted on our behalf in this sensitive investigation. I have always accepted the autonomy of Chief Constable Barton’s inquiry and I fully concur with his decision not to progress the investigation into the two journalists Mr Birney and Mr McCaffrey.“Throughout the period of this investigation, the horror of what happened in Loughinisland has never been far from any of our thoughts. The perpetrators of that crime have never been brought to justice and that is a matter of huge regret for policing.“The police investigation into who murdered the six innocent men in the Heights Bar in  remains open but progress is dependent on new information. There are people out there who know what happened. I would appeal to them to come forward and make a statement that will help us finally bring justice to the families of the victims.“I am aware that the investigation over the last year has caused concern for families who have already suffered so much. That is something none of us would ever have wished to do.“However, as a police service, the suspected theft or unlawful leaking of any sensitive documents containing information that may endanger le is a serious matter which we are statutorily obliged to investigate.“Recognising the sensitivities, we asked an independent Police Service to conduct the investigation. The clarity provided by last week’s hearing has now brought a signicant part of that investigation to a conclusion.“I await the final report from Durham on this complex investigation.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"tim and jake unveiled as feile comedy leads","story":"NORTH is set to meet West as Belfast’s comedy big hitters come together for Féile an Phobail’s annual comedy night.

They want a brighter future for the world.”Olivia PartridgeFollowing the unique opportunity to learn about news and Northern Irelands public transport network, the young writers and their teacher Fiona Donnelly were presented with their cheque for £,.\"Having learnt about report writing in the classroom, it was great for the children to experience it in a real-le context and to get a taste of le as a journalist today,\" Ms Donnelly said.\"They were particularly interested in the photography and digital aspects of the newspaper and were surprised by just how much work goes into preparing the paper for print.\"The teacher now believes she has quite a few budding journalists and engineers in her class but for now, they are all focused on their next challenge - working out how to spend their prize money.\"Some initial thoughts have been to put it towards further developing our outdoor area at school so the whole school community can benefit - but Im sure well keep some aside for a well-deserved treat,\" she said.Speaking about the competition, Translink said:“On behalf of everyone in Translink, I want to take this opportunity to say a huge congratulations to St. MacNissi’s Primary School on winning this year’s Little Reporters competition! We enjoyed reading the competition entries and welcoming the winning class to our Train Maintenance Depot where they learnt more about the workings of our public transport network. The children certainly demonstrated a keen desire to get to grips with the many benefits of public transport and our team was thrilled to answer their burning questions, helping them form their news story.We hope the £, cash prize will provide the class with more learning resources and they will continue to be advocates for public transport! Well done again everyone!”Chris Conway, Group Chief Executive, Translink"},{"url":null,"title":"oops sinn fein press advisor accidentally sends mass email asking about redundancy","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsEU Elections Top  CompaniesNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The party lost  seats on local authorities around the country last week, and at least one MEP.Ms McDonald has accepted responsibility for the result, telling reporters: “The buck stops with me.” The result has sparked fears within Sinn Fein that the party will lose some of its  Dail seats at the next general election.Mr Treacy was a late substitute onto the party’s election ticket for Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council.He secured just  votes in the Glencullen-Sandyford ward."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38184574.ece/804a7/BINARY/trump_shannon_002.jpg","title":"the donald gets into the swing of things after landing in rough with border faux pas","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsEU Elections Top  CompaniesNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Were used to Americans coming over and flattering the Irish with faux praise about how their ancestors built their country. Trump is somewhat dferent, though.Sources say the US President told Taoiseach Leo Varadkar that he always thinks of the Republic as \"a huge country\" because of the impact its people have had. Varadkar happily told him the country has just five million people.It was one of the lighter moments in a meeting that briskly moved from serious topics to sport. Brexit, immigration and all featured, before conversation swayed to The Open. At one point the Irish side found itself explaining how, for some sports, the whole island plays as one team, while for others, there are Republic and Northern Ireland teams. The US President was fascinated. Insiders say the atmosphere was \"warm\", which probably matched the temperature in the makesht meeting room that was dressed up with a few net curtains and colourful flowers. On the American side, Trump had some big hitters, but they didnt throw any punches. There was his Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, National Security Advisor John Bolton and Secretary of the Treasury Steve Mnuchin. Varadkars back-up team included his Chief of Staff, Brian Murphy, main Brexit brain John Callinan, US envoy John Deasy and Ambassador Dan Mulhall. Even before the meeting began, it was obvious Trump was in a good mood. He allowed journalists to fire questions at him for eight minutes without trading any insults. He also denied being in Ireland to play golf and promote his hotel but struggled to show that he had done any actual preparation for the meeting. The Taoiseach was brave enough to publicly correct him when he tried to compare the Irish border situation with his plans to build a wall between the US and Mexico. \"His basic knowledge isnt great,\" a source admitted. However, Mr Varadkar insisted afterwards that the purpose of the meeting was to educate the US delegation.Soon, Trump and his we, Melania, were on board a chopper bound for Doonbeg. Irish officials were more than a little relieved. Mr Varadkar went on to defend the cost of providing , unormed and  specialist gardai for the trip. \"The good bilateral relationship between Ireland and America is worth a lot more than €m,\" he said. Trump is unlikely to have taken in much of what was said, but he didnt call anybody, including Michael D Higgins, a stone cold loser. No real damage done, then, which is the best they could have hoped for. There was no mention of wind turbines or fake news. \"I learn from my mistakes,\" the Taoiseach laughed as he left the post-match analysis session.  data-dfpadtargeting and First Lady Melania Trumpdisembark Air Force One upon arrival at Shannon Airport in Shannon, County Clare, Ireland on June , .

I believe we have achieved this outcome with the design incorporating the Mourne mountains, said Cllr Clarke.ldquoI am also pleased that dedicated motorhome bays have been provided in Castle Park and that the spaces are being well used.Cllr Clarke said it was important that the local authority works with motorhome owners as Newcastle and the wider region needed to be a welcoming place for

obesity epidemic  ","story":"NEWRY, Mourne and Down Council is aiming to help fight the growing obesity crisis across Northern Ireland.Local politicians are gearing up to declare war on the issue and implement a new policy that will result in high sugar items such as sweets, fizzy drinks and high fat snacks being banned from vending machines in council buildings across the district, including its leisure centres.The high sugar items will be replaced with healthy choice snacks and drinks with local politicians hoping that other organisations across the district, which have vending machines in their buildings, will follow suit.A number of local schools have already banned chocolates and crisps from their vending machines with politicians keen to lead from the front in encouraging people to eat more healthily and exercise regularly.Last year, the local authority launched a new app to make it easier for residents across the district to take part in sport and leisure activities and receive up-to-date information about the local authorityrsquos leisure facilities.Now it wants to go a step further to help improve peoplersquos health.The move to ban high fat and sugary items from vending machines across council buildings, which will be formally discussed later this month, comes after it emerged this week that sweets, crisps and fizzy drinks could soon be sold under cigarette-style plain packaging under plans by a number of leading brands to help combat the obesity epidemic.A recent Department of Health survey revealed that that % of people in Northern Ireland were overweight, with % classed as obese with councillors acutely aware that obesity continues to be one of the most important public health challenges.They recognise that being overweight or obese increases the risk of le threatening disease, with its costs extending far beyond the public sector, affecting iniduals, families, communities, the economy and society as a whole.At Monday nightrsquos monthly meeting of the local authority, politicians agreed to debate the possible ban and view the move as an important step towards tacking the obesity issue.They aim to encourage people to opt for healthier food choices and to change their diet as part of the drive to create an environment that supports and promotes a physically active lestyle and healthy diet.Mournes councillor Willie Clarke, who is spearheading the drive to ban sugary snacks and drinks from council vending machines, said he hopes it will empower people to make healthier choices and reduce the risk of overweight and obesity related diseases.He said tackling childhood obesity was already a public health priority and was keen for Newry, Mourne and Down Council to do all it could at a time when research suggested that one in four children across the island of Ireland carried excess weight.Cllr Clarke said that without action to reverse current trends, the next generation will be beset with signicant ill-health related issues linked to obesity, most of which are potentially preventable.ldquoI am keen for the local council to introduce a new policy to effectively ban high fat and sugary foods and drinks from vending machines across its facilities and replace them with healthy options, he explained.ldquoI also hope that the local authorityrsquos many partner organisations will follow suit. We do not want to see obesity becoming a social norm and I believe we can help make a dference by exercising greater control over what items are in vending machines in all council buildings.Cllr Clarke said he viewed a ban on sugary snacks and drinks as ldquojust the start of a concerted campaign to help tackle obesity and get people move towards healthier lestyles.ldquoI think it is important that the council takes the lead on an issue which everyone can support. It is essential people signicantly reduce their intake of unhealthy food and drinks, he said.The local councillor also suggested that the local authority should offer politicians healthy options when they arrive for their tea ahead of the monthly council meetings.ldquoHealthy options featuring salads, fruit and vegetables should also be on the menu at council-organised s so people can choose to eat healthily. While I want the council to take the lead on this issue, I hope many other bodies it works alongside will follow suit.ldquoWorking together we can make a dference and help people change their lives. The councilrsquos lead on this issue could have a ripple effect across the district beyond.Cllr Clarke added: ldquoThis is not about being a kill joy but encouraging people to be more health conscious when it comes to what they eat and drink and is the first step in a process..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Countdown to DownTime summer festival  ","story":"THE countdown is on for this monthrsquos spectacular DownTime summer festival which has something for everyone.Organisers of the four-day community event mdash which kicks off on June  mdash are promising a sparkling festival of fun which includes two daysrsquo of not-to-be-missed horse racing at the widely acclaimed Downpatrick track.Horse racing first took place at in Downpatrick in  and for almost  years the local track has been constantly improving, boasting great racing, modern facilities, themed race days and a rather unique atmosphere.DownTime summerfest has been organised by a dedicated local team from all sectors of the community whose aim is to get people out and about not just over the four-day festival, but across the summer.Now in its second year, the festival is supported by Newry, Mourne and Down Council and features over  events covering arts, heritage, music, food and, of course, sport.There will be street art, live music, theatre performances, free train rides, a living history Viking encampment at the St Patrick Centre and an artisan market mdash which will be open between am and .pm mdash cradled in the grounds of the Down County Museum.Locals and visitors alike will experience a haven of freshly produced food, bespoke crafts and relaxing surroundings.

Antrimrsquos expected fightback started immediately with the accurate Katie McAleese keeping her side in contention with five consecutive points, including three from play.There was only a point in it as the first half drew to a close, but Down broke free from their shackles and Mallon sent her side into the break with a - to - lead with a well-taken score.Antrim reduced the leeway to a single point at the start of the second half with a score from Bronagh Orchin, but a composed Down side replied with a brace from Mallon as the Mourne girls took a - to - lead after  minutes.McAleese and Paula OrsquoHagan swapped points before Down hit the jackpot when Sara Louise Carr found the back of the Antrim net for Downrsquos second goal and a six point lead with  minutes remaining.Full credit to Antrim, they refused to throw in the towel and three unanswered points from Maeve Kelly and McAleeseleft a puck of the ball between the sides.It was a hammer and tongs finish with both sides feeling the pressure, but it was Downrsquos Niamh Mallon who settled the issue with a converted free and give her side a deserved victory.Down captain Fionnuala Carr was delighted after her sidersquos victory and it marked a successful season on both the club and county front for her after she also lted the All-Ireland Intermediate Club Camogie title with Clonduff in March.ldquoThere are a few of us that played for Down for many years and couldnrsquot win an Ulster senior.

Apart from a host of blister complaints, the bulk of real casualties were a handful of people taken to Downe Hospital suffering from heat exhaustion.One woman suffering from exhaustion had to be taken by an RAF helicopter to the Red Cross mobile treatment room and a man, who was knocked unconscious when a small boulder struck him on the head, was also taken to hospital.Despite minor upsets, the whole day was a big success story. The chief organiser, Mr Paddy McAteer, said he was stunned by the huge turnout.ldquoThe walk was a tremendous success with a record number of starters and a high number of people who completed the trek, he said. ldquoThis walk is undoubtedly getting bigger and bigger and it is amazing to see people from all walks of le coming together.The walkers were supported by a range number of voluntary route marshals.

With winter over, during which time many elderly residents were effectively trapped in their homes after dark, the news may not be much consolation for residents.The committee also heard that their plea for a telephone kiosk at Cuan Beach had been refused and that an alternative site has been found for the Toye Kiosk at the New Line.ANNSBOROUGH mdash The youngsters of Annsborough have at last been able to use their new playing fields where a mix-up in the erection of a fence had kept them out for several months. Grazing cattle which have been using the field have been banished to the sidelines behind a new fence.The problem started when Enterprise Ulster erected only one fence at the new playground and forgot about s second fence to keep out nearby cattle. The mistake led to angry words at Down Council where officials were blamed for not supervising the work and inspecting the completed job.However, Enterprise Ulster workmen responded quickly to a council call and within days had put things right.SHRIGLEY mdash A new factory in Shrigley, which will manufacture plastic products and employ  people, is expected to open within the next few months.The factory is sited in premises vacated by the tannery at Shrigley and the man behind the venture is Mr Garfield Brown, who already owns the Killyleagh Rug Company.It is not exactly clear when the new firm will open, but itrsquos managing director, Mr Lance Walker, says he is optimistic that production will start in August.He said the factory will carry out plastic processing and will provide materials for the packaging industry. ldquoObviously we want to start as soon as possible, but at the moment machinery is being delivered and we are waiting for more to arrive. This makes it impossible to announce when production will start, he added.CROSSGAR mdash Mr Edward Cargo, from Crossgar, retired this week after  years of service to transport and received an inscribed gold watch from his colleagues to mark the occasion.Mr Cargo, who was based at Downpatrick bus station, received his gold watch from the station manager, Mr Ian Cunningham, at a specialheld in the Slaney Inn, Raholp.Mr Cunningham, who made the presentation on behalf of Mr Cargorsquos colleagues at the Downpatrick, Newcastle and Ballynahinch Ulsterbus depots, thanked him for his long and distinguished service in transport, starting with the old Northern Ireland Road Transport Authority and finally Ulsterbus.Mr Jim Prior, on behalf of the engineering department, wished Mr Cargo a long and happy retirement and thanked him for all the help and friendship he gave to all the men in the garage over the years.SAINTFIELD mdash Preparations for the th annual Saintfield and District Agricultural Show have been finalised and the organisers are hoping for good weather to ensure big crowds.Entries for the agricultural, home industry and poultry sections are very high.

He started out on his footballing journey as a fresh-faced teenager in the mid s alongside his brother Denis, the McClurgs and Pattersons at Kilmore United, and was an integral part of the embryo that was to become Kilmore Rec.Originally from Inch, just outside Downpatrick, Cyril followed Denis to Killyleagh YCin  and that was the start of a close link with the club that lasted the best part of  years.He spent a decade at The Showgrounds before moving to Drumaness Mills where he again endeared himself to all at Meadowvale with his goals and whole-hearted play.When he hung up his boots in the mid s he bided his time before taking up the role as manager at Drumaness with his pal Paul Gelston mdash he also had managerial spells at Ballynahinch Unitedand Kilmore Rec.However, in  he ed to The Showgrounds to team up with Dee Heron and together they set about building one of the best team sides to play in the Amateur League.They won everything there was to win with the exception of the Intermediate Cup.They lted the Steel  Sons, Border and Clarence Cup with regularity, as well as six Amateur League Premier Section titles in a row.In addition to his time at Killyleagh, Cyril was Heronrsquos assistant with the Amateur Leaguersquos representative team and also teamed up with Nortelrsquos Ricky Beggs as manager of the Amateur League U- youth team for three years.In more recent years Cyril, although he wasnrsquot attached to any club, still followed the highs and lows of all local outfits and loved nothing better than travelling to watch Northern Ireland.Sincere condolences are expressed to his we Betty, daughters Jenner, Pamela and Heather, and extended family circle..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Walking along path of history on the Camino pilgrimage  ","story":"THE faint sound of a church bell ringing in the distance, a cockerel crowing under a leafy olive grove at sunrise or the thunderous crash of an Atlantic wave as it beats off a rocky shoreline in northern Portugal became a welcome replacement to the bustle of Downpatrick last month.For  days, my friend Shona and I ventured the -mile trek of the Camino Portuguese from the beautul and vibrant city of Porto to Santiago de Compostela in neighbouring Galicia, in northern Spain.Time stood still as we listened to the rhythmic crunch of sandy gravel underfoot and breathed in the soft pine-scented woodland pathways that led to an ever increasing number of pilgrims making their way up through the captivating beauty of the Camino da Costa mdash just one of many routes leading to the famous cathedral which is the final resting place of St James the Apostle.Our journey began after a seriously hearty breakfast in one of the many fabulous street-side cafes in Porto on Thursday, May . The traditional merchant city is situated on the lsquoRiver of Goldrsquo. It was here in the th century that Portugal took its name. Much of its fine architecture in the old medieval quarter and a mandatory wine tasting session of the world famous ruby-port wine warrant atrip in itself some day.Hugging the coastline, this first stage meanders along a low lying shoreline of boardwalks and sand dunes to Vila do Conde where we took lodging for the night in a guest house as the townrsquos albergue offered only mattresses in a hallway.Day two saw us slowly begin to adapt to the rigours and demands of the Camino. I secretly longed for the day to be over before it began and was relieved that not just a few of us were wondering the same thing. Yet,  miles later, with a one and a half stone weight packed inside our rucksacks and the unwelcome emergence of a cluster of painful blisters forming, we were singing with joy as we arrived at the popular surfing resort of Esposende in the Braga district later that afternoon.Day three began in much the same way, neither of us forgetting the miracle cure that can be derived from a good nightrsquos sleep. We crossed the Rio Nieve to the first of two  foot peaks leading to Viana do Castelo where the majestic Monte Santa Luzia stands atop of a steep hill overlooking yet another captivating beachside town.Half way between Esposende and Viana do Castelo is Igreja Santiago de Castelo do Neiva, where an altar inion relating to St James and dated  AD was found during the reconstruction of the church. This is the oldest consecration to the apostle to be found outside Spain and has put this relatively recent route firmly on the official routes map for pilgrims.Onwards we hiked to Caminha on day four, where more beach board walks, pebbled pathways and sand dunes morphed into woodland trails, offering welcoming shade from the midday sun. Another steady uphill climb helped us reach here before crossing the Spanish-Portuguese border the next day.Farmers still tend their crops by hand in this part of the world, which harks back to a bygone era, leaving it untouched by modern intensive farming methods and giving us a window on the past.The fth leg of our journey began by being ferried across the border in a row boat which had a small motor installed, leaving behind the harbour town of Caminha for the Spanish town of Garda a few short miles round the bay.Further up the coast we trekked, for -and a-half miles until we reached the quaint seaside hamlet of Oia and its famous Cistercian monastery, Real Monasterio de Oia, which dates back to .By this stage our trek was getting easier as we adapted to the distances we were hiking each day. By way of a measuring stick as to how far wersquod come, we got chatting to a couple from Kent who had made their way to a villa they had rented out for a short break.They had driven from Porto in a hired car up the motorway the day before and it took them  minutes. It had taken us five gruelling, but extraordinarily peaceful days to reach the same point and we laughed at how easy it could have been.Each day we handed over our pilgrim passport to be stamped by church sacristans, post office workers, tourist office clerks, cafe and hostel owners, each of them eager to put their mark on our pilgrim way as we followed another hand-painted yellow arrow or scallop shell, dutully painted and maintained by locals proud to be part of a , year-old Christian pilgrimage, which has exploded in popularity in recent years not only with Christians, but also with the unbeliever, the doubter, the atheist and the sceptic mdash all eager to take on its challenges in a bid to escape the rigours and stress of modern day le.Each day too locals seemed to appear out of the midsts, asby magic, beckoning us with a whistle or a car horn to prompt us to turn aroundwe had mistakenly taken a wrong route mdash for which we were very grateful because each step we took seemed to matter a great deal.On day six the town of Moughas gave way to the mountain village Baiona, from where we walked to Ramallosa, famed for its historic sites and narrow medieval streets.Day seven presented a continuous series of spectacular vistas, each imprinted upon our minds until the day we die, such was their beauty, until we reached the large city of Vigo.Between Ramallosa and Vigo we met with a retired local man out walking his dog along the seashore. Silently he studied the two of us slouched exhausted over a park bench at mid morning. We could almost hear the mechanisms at play within his mind.ldquoWhere are you from  he enquired in a fair attempt at English.ldquoNorthern Ireland, we both replied, knowing that he was going to say something witty.ldquoAh, Paddies, he said, aswaiting our next move in a chess game.Ah, you must be Pedro, we retorted, intending no harm.ldquoWhere are you walking to  he enquired.ldquoSantiago de Compostela in Galacia, we both said.It was a trigger. After telling us quite succinctly what, over the last several decades, he had slowly come to realise le was about and how it should be lived, he asked: ldquoWhy are you doing it Neither of us was prepared for his directness but I showed him my rosary beads nonetheless. ldquoItrsquos a sacrice, I said straight out. He paused before he shook his head and said: ldquoYoursquoll never make it.As he watched us stand up he was only too eager though to hold our rucksacks as we reached into them again after our short but thought provoking rest.After wishing us buen Camino, he asked us to remember him when we reached the tomb of St James.Day eight and the noise and bustle of Vigo soon gave way to  feet and a steady climb of mountainous terrain and shady woodland trekking until we reached the refreshingly rural town of Redondela.Quiet country lanes led to  miles of more pebbled rustic pathways and stony gravel lanes on day nine until we reached the city of Pontevedra. As good fortune would have it, Friday, May , was a public holiday across Galacia and every shop, except cafes and wine bars were closed. We did mange to explore the magnicent Roman town though in the evening, but our bank balance didnrsquot suffer too much.Pontevedra paved the way on day ten with more forest trails and waterfalls. Our first climb of the day was to Caldas de Reis, home of the famous volcanic foot spa where for centuries pilgrims have been dipping their sore and weary feet in water of  degrees.Our penultimate day saw us take on the dizzy heights of Mount Corgullion before reaching the famous city of Padron, where we sampled the world famous padron peppers with dinner in the evening.Padron is  miles south of Santiago and is the starting point of St Jamesrsquos ministry in Spain and to where his remains were brought following his martyrdom in Jerusalem. His remains were later taken to the cathedral in Santiago where they lie in a tomb.We gazed in awe at the great Jacobean treasure and the original stone mooring post of Padron, from which the town gets its name.On the twelfth day a final temptation presented itself in the form of a train station that was situated directly opposite our lodgings that evening. Fellow pilgrims laughed at the idea that a train would take us to Santiago in  pain-free minutes,we werenrsquot up to the final trek and the almost , feet climb.I wasnrsquot laughing. I seriously eyed up the possibility, going as far to check train times. It was a stroke of good luck when I learned there was no other half way stop between Padron and Santiago. After what we had endured over the last  days, not to walk the final few miles would have been an obvious regret.And so we reached Santiago on foot shortly after pm on May , overjoyed and in a state of euphoria. The city of Santiago was worth the hike. Itrsquos as beautul and charming as it is captivating.The camaraderie and craic shared among all us pilgrims who made it from Porto to Santiago that day was incomparable to anything I have encountered before. The memories will stay with me until the day I die..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/17689164.ambulance-attends-farm-incident-in-south-fermanagh/resources/images/9948626.jpg","title":"rapper cardi b pulls out of headline slot at parklife music festival","story":"We are currently working on an updated schedule, please see below for the full statement. pic AdimRxDHgmdash Parkle June , Parkle  will take place this weekend, June -, at Heaton Park in Manchester.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ahead of the first episode, Ruth told the News Letter: “I was nervous at the start about it coming on TV. Then whenever I saw the adverts it’s put me at ease a wee bit. Businesswoman and fashionista Shirley“We’ve seen a few clips but we don’t get to see the whole episodes until the public sees them.”While it’s been billed as Northern Ireland’s equivalent as TOWIE and Made In Cha the characters come across as being a lot more down to earth.Ruth, , said: “It’s just the way we are everyday. People in Co Tyrone are very genuine.“It might come across as we all know each other but a lot of the people in the show I hadn’t met until we came together for the programme.Country singer Neil“I’d never met Bobby or Lynda or Audrey or Melvin. We’re all friendly now.“Even when I met them and the cameras weren’t on we got on really well. Bobby constantly had me in stitches. He could have his own show.“We’re from Dungannon. Lynda is Omagh direction, Audrey I think she’s up by Clogher.NI athlete Erin McConnell happy to rise before am to achieve Olympic dream\"  \"  Reported On This Day  Years Ago : Entry rules for the Downpatrick races are listed Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“The way it’s filmed it might seem that we live closer together.”Ruth said she had some dficulties with the cameras to begin with but soon found her feet: “When it was being filmed they said, ‘pretend we’re not here’. At the start I was accidentally looking into the lens. After a while, after the second or third time, you do forget the cameras are there.” Ruth explained how she got involved with the programme which was filmed at the start of last summer: “They went to my friend’s salon and they were giving out flyers trying to find someone who comes from a farming background and is also into the beauty and all. Helen said about me and passed on my details. They contacted me and I said I’d be interested, it sounds like great craic.”Ruth revealed that it wasn’t technically her TV debut: “When I was in primary school I was in school choir of the year, but that was in a choir and I’m a blur.”In one scene, Ruth who is a member of a gun club takes two of her friends shooting: “Hollie had shot once before, Helen had never shot in her le. We just sort of thought we’d go for the craic. That’s the sort of thing that we did for the show. It’s not like reality shows were they make drama for the sake of it.”Ruth described herself as “a part time farmer, part time beautician and a full time mum”. She said: “Maisie is two this week. She’s not in the show but I do talk about her.“I have a boyfriend, we’re not married or engaged. We’ve been going out for three and half years and we’ve been friends since we were .”During her early days as beautician she needed someone to practice on. Cue her dad John: “When I was training as a beautician I had to practice eyebrow waxing. I got my kit and asked dad would he let me practice. I think I got one strip pulled off and he stopped me. He said he’d been in enough accidents on the farm but that was by the far the worst. He ended up with one bushy eyebrow and one normal one.”She added: “My oldest brother John is a full time farmer. He’s won’t be on the show, he’s a bit shy. He works on the farm with my dad and my dad’s friend Billy.“My mumhelps out on the farm before her own job as a classroom assistant in a special needs school.”Ruth appears in the show alongside her brother Neil. As a duo they’re used to being in the limelight together.She said: “Neil’s a country singer. We used to sing together. We were a two-piece band then I went to Australia for a year and he went out on his own.“He started to make it really well on his own so I left him to it. I started a new job as a beautician and helped my dad out on the farm.”So has she got the bitten by the TV bug “It’s was really good craic,” she said. “If there was a second series and they asked me to be in it, I’d definitely say yes. I suppose they’re waiting to see how the first series goes.”She added: “The first night the trailer was on TV quite a lot of people videoed it and sent it to me on Snapchat. A lot of people have taken an interest.”try catch  TrendingPolice searching for missing N.I. man Ryan Smyth find bodyTT : Ian Hutchinson escapes serious injury following high-speed crash in qualyingIncreasing concern for N.I. teen who has vanishedSinger Malachi Cush lsquostablersquo in RVH following road collisionN.I. child reported missing is found safe and well*,:after,:before .teaser-essential,.u-clearfix .teaser-essential:after,.teaser-essential:before,.u-clearfix:after,.u-clearfix:before .teaser-essential:after,.u-clearfix:after .teaser-essential__link-primary .teaser-matrix__image, .teaser-matrix img, .teaser-matrix--native-ad img -moz-transform: rotate-ms-transform: rotate-o-transform: rotatetransform: rotatedisplay: blockwidth: %height: %overflow: hiddenobject-fit: coverobject-position: center@font-face src: url format, url format, url formatfont-weight: font-style: normal@font-face src: url format, url format, url formatfont-weight: font-style: normal.slab-matrix__title .slab-matrix__title span .teaser-matrix__readers, .slab-matrix__tabs li .teaser-matrix__heading, .teaser-matrix__category-link, .teaser-matrix__sponsor-link, .teaser-matrix__sponsor-text .slab--wowbrand  .slab__inner  .slab__block @media .slab__inner  .slab__block @media .slab__inner  .slab__block @media .slab__inner  .slab__block @media .slab__inner @media .slab__inner .slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title @media@media@media@media.slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title:hover,.slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title span:nth-of-type:hover .slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title span:nth-of-type:hover .slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title span:first-child .slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title span:nth-of-type @media .slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title span:nth-of-type .slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title .logo .slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title a,.inews-link-mobile a .inews-link-mobile a .inews-link-mobile @media@media.slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title a:after,.inews-link-mobile a:after .slab-matrix .slab-matrix .slab__block @media@media.slab-matrix .slab__block:nth-child, .slab-related .slab__block:nth-child @media.slab-matrix .slab__block:nth-child, .slab-related .slab__block:nth-child @media.slab-matrix .slab__block:nth-child, .slab-related .slab__block:nth-child @media.slab-matrix .slab__block:nth-child, .slab-related .slab__block:nth-child .slab-matrix__tabs .slab-matrix__tabs li .slab-matrix__tabs li.is-current .slab-matrix__title @media.slab-matrix__title span .slab-matrix.tabbed, .tabbed.slab-related .slab-matrix.tabbed .slab__block, .tabbed.slab-related .slab__block .slab-matrix.tabbed .slab__block .slab-matrix__title, .tabbed.slab-related .slab__block .slab-matrix__title .slab-matrix.tabbed .slab__block:nth-child, .tabbed.slab-related .slab__block:nth-child .slab-matrix-link .teaser-matrix, .teaser-matrix--native-ad @media@media@media@media.teaser-matrix:hover .teaser-matrix__image, .teaser-matrix--native-ad:hover .teaser-matrix__image, .teaser-matrix:hover img, .teaser-matrix--native-ad:hover img .teaser-matrix__image-container .teaser-matrix__image-container:before .teaser-matrix__image-container  img .teaser-matrix__image, .teaser-matrix img, .teaser-matrix--native-ad imgcontrastfilter: saturate contrast-moz-filter: saturate contrastopacity: .teaser-matrix__text-container .teaser-matrix__heading .teaser-matrix__heading:hover .teaser-matrix__meta-container @media.teaser-matrix__category-link .teaser-matrix__category-link--relative .teaser-matrix__category-link--relative.popular .teaser-matrix__readers .teaser-matrix__readers:after .teaser-matrix__readers svg .teaser-matrix__readers svg path .teaser-matrix__readers.up svg fill: #CFC.teaser-matrix__readers.up svg path .teaser-matrix__readers.down svg .teaser-matrix__readers.down svg path animation: half-fade s ease-out infinite.teaser-matrix__readers  span @media span @media span .teaser-matrix__sponsor-link .teaser-matrix__sponsor-text .teaser-matrix__link-primary .teaser-matrix.is-ie-fit .teaser-matrix__image, .is-ie-fit.teaser-matrix--native-ad .teaser-matrix__image .teaser-matrix.is-ie-fit .teaser-matrix__image-container, .is-ie-fit.teaser-matrix--native-ad .teaser-matrix__image-containercontrastfilter: saturate contrast-moz-filter: saturate contrastopacity: .teaser-matrix.is-ie-fit:hover  .teaser-matrix__image-container, .is-ie-fit.teaser-matrix--native-ad:hover  .teaser-matrix__image-container .ie .teaser-matrix__image-container .teaser-matrix--native-ad__meta-container .teaser-matrix, .teaser-matrix--native-ad .teaser-matrix__image-container .teaser-matrix__text-container background: -webkit-linear-gradient.teaser-matrix__heading @media@media@media.teaser-matrix__category-link .teaser-matrix__readers .teaser-matrix__sponsor-link .teaser-matrix__sponsor-link:hover .teaser-matrix__sponsor-text @media screen and .dy_unit .dy-editorial-wow__items + .dy_wow_widget_header .st .st The EssentialsVisit inewsVisit inews        v.. -

The PSNI will not make such a decision in isolation.”Asked what advice police could give to motorists faced with long delays for an appointment, the PSNI said: “Keep checking the online booking portal for cancellations. Carry your appointment letter with you.”Council told to reveal secret Master Plan document Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Mr Cousens said: “If not quickly resolved, lawful drivers could be unfairly penalised for an issue outside of their control.“It’s not just the private motorist at risk either, as delivery vans are being caught up in the backlog. As the majority of freight is moved by road, inaction could dent the Northern Irish economy.“In previous periods of delay, Stormont has allowed exemptions to affected vehicles while the backlog is cleared. We hope that this can be repeated again while a long-term solution is sought.”Almost , more tests than normal were made in the first three months of this year.The Department of Infrastructure has said additional staff are being recruited and “urgent consideration” is being given to the possibility of opening testing centres on Sundays for a limited period of time in order to address the current backlog.try catch  TrendingPolice searching for missing N.I. man Ryan Smyth find bodyTT : Ian Hutchinson escapes serious injury following high-speed crash in qualyingIncreasing concern for N.I. teen

I want my children to grow up knowing and seeing their local history around them.Cardf South and Penarth AM Vaughan Gething met with Ms Weighton and Ms Crutchley over the campaign recently .Mike Clogg, the Vale of Glamorgan Council operational manager for neighbourhood services and transport, said: ldquoThe council is replacing a number of lighting columns in ious areas of Penarth.

Unfortunately the swing bridge has been out of commission since June .I have met with residents and local Labour councillors, who have been working closely with residents to discuss their concerns and plans to make the bridge once more available to the public.The bridge is owned by the Vale of Glamorgan Council and leased to Penarth Quays MarinaLTD. It was built to ensure that both residents and boat owners had equal access to land and water.I understand that there are no mechanical reasons why the bridge should not be used.The Vale Council and PQM have agreed that safety upgrades need to be carried out for the bridge to reopen. In October  PQM submitted a planning application for modications to the swing bridge. I have been told that PQM were contacted by the Vale council to mody the current application to include lower intensity flashing lights and lsquosilent alarmsrsquo. Unfortunately PQM felt that the changes would not meet the safety standards they felt necessary and choose to withdraw the application. I understand that the Vale Council is currently awaiting the outcome of a noise report which will feature in future discussions between the Vale and PQM over the future of the swing bridge.The swing bridge has been an integral part of marina le for many years and is enjoyed by both residents and the thousands of tourists to the area. Connecting the two sides of the marina the bridge acts as a short cut for residents, particularly useful for those with walking dficulties. Having spoken to local businesses about the potential for the reopening the consensus seems to be generally positive. Reopening of the swing bridge, customers could use the car park on Llwyn Passat and use the bridge to access Portway businesses.I hope that the Vale council and PQM are able to work together to find a solution. I think we can all agree that the way forward is to ensure safe operation of the bridge while minimising disruption to adjacent properties.Before the Easter recess I met with residents to listen to their concerns over plans to remove Victorian lampposts from across Penarth. The cast iron lampposts, which have been an integral part of Penarthrsquos street scene for a century are being replaced by the Vale council with modern LED lighting. I am disappointed that several lampposts along Cwrt-Y-Vil road have been removed without notying residents.Residents have set up a petition, of which over a thousand people so far have signed asking for the old posts to be left in place with new ones installed beside them. This has been carried out in towns and cities across the UK to protect the local heritage.The petition can be found at www.change.org p vale-of-glamorgan-council-save-the-victorian-heritage-of-penarth u .I will continue to work with your local Labour councillors on these issues.

Although a relative newcomer to the site, having previously taught in Newport, it is clear he is immensely proud of the students and staff.ldquoVisitors to the school often comment on the warm, friendly and purposeful environment that exists at Stanwell and, despite its size, they see how the school cares about the inidual child and their progress, he said.ldquoThe schoolrsquos Mission Statement is summarised as lsquoLearning to Excelrsquo and this is the vision for every child, whatever their starting points, interests or talents. The school thrives because we have a fantastic team of teachers, teaching assistants, support staff, parents and governors who help make this vision a reality.ldquoThis is what makes the school so successful because everybody gives so much.Wandering through a theatre the school uses to put on assemblies and biannual productions, Mrs Kynaston pointed out a section of floor that moved away to create an orchestral pit. The production value afforded to every department ndash theatre, maths, sports, English ndash was astounding.ldquoWe try to give our pupils the very best, said Mrs Kynaston. ldquoWe want them to truly reach their potential. To excel.Mr Brown agreed. ldquoOur amazing staff believe in every young personrsquos potential to succeed and really do go the lsquoextra milersquo for pupils, he said. ldquoOur pupils flourish academically but also as well rounded, confident young people ready to contribute to society.The extra-curricular provision at the school is broad and this really helps to develop our students confidence and skills beyond the classroom setting.That extra-curricular provision is a key focus for the school.Lessons finish at .pm, earlier in the day than most other schools, but that affords pupils plenty of time to take on other pursuits.The school offers a huge number of activities, ranging from the expected - rugby, football, hockey, theatre and orchestra - to the esoteric, like German Film Club or Cipher Club.School trips in recent years have taken students to such exotic destinations as Costa Rica, Iceland, Borneo, Morocco, Spain, Germany, France, and Italy, allowing students to soak in culture both at home and abroad.Clearly, a huge pupil base allows for a huge number of options.The schoolrsquos ability to bring such a population to the table, and keep them focussed, has produced excellent results.In the last fty years alone, it has produced Olympians, rugby internationals, Members of Parliament and television presenters.It has ties to Nasa, and men who walked on the moon have visited the school for talks.Its most curious claim to fame comes in the form of a mascot painted on a wall.Emma Davies, a former pupil of the school, had a design chosen as the official Welsh Wenlock ndash the Olympic mascot for the London  games.But Stanwell flourishes academically, as well.In its  GCSE results,  per cent of Stanwell pupils achieved at least their expected grades, compared to  per cent of the rest of Wales. The same story went for maths, with  per cent again hitting their expected target or better, against  per cent of Wales.       ,params: .pushAt A level,  per cent of all grades were A* or A, with  per cent of the year group achieving A* to C overall.A level results put Stanwell students amongst the top performers in Wales, with many iniduals securing exceptional grades.  of themachieved the equivalent of three A grades or better.Three of its pupils went to Oxford University last year, while another earned a place at Cambridge University.Mr Brown said: ldquoWe place a large emphasis on listening to our learners and and our pupils make a dference as leaders in the school, whether itrsquos through well established groups such as our school council, eco-committee or charity committee, or in aspects of teaching and learning where we have subject prefects and learner voice groups.ldquoThey help us evaluate our work as a school and plan for the future.ldquoWhat always comes through is how proud they are of their school.Rightly so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

They toss, turn, and grade the shellfish according to size, before ing them to the seabed. Across the Lough we can see the Cooley Peninsula and Co Louth. In the Brexit border debate, this is ground zero.Growing oysters takes three years, says Darren Cunningham, owner of Killowen Shellfish, and he exports stock every week. “It leaves on a Friday evening at around pm, and % is exported to France. It goes through Dublin and Rosslare to the top oyster buyer in Europe. The oysters are in purication tanks in France by Sunday evening. That’s how quick it is.” Carlingford Oysters then travel to restaurants in Paris and other European capitals. How is business  “Very good,” Darren says. “We sold nearly  tonnes of oyster last year. Two tonnes went to China and the rest to France.” Is there much competition  “Not for us. We’re the talk at the minute. We have the best stuff.”Darren and his team work next to Ballyedmond Estate, the family home of the late Edward Haughey, founder of Norbrook, one of the world’s leading veterinary pharmaceutical companies. If you travel further up the lough – past Warrenpoint, home to Northern Ireland’s second largest port – you will reach Newry, where Norbrook is based.Killowen Shellfish and Norbrook, which generated an operating profit of £.m in the year to August , are very dferent businesses, yet both speak the common language of exports. There are around , VAT registered businesses in the greater Newry area and many of them are accustomed to criss-crossing the border.“We have a number of major global players based here in Newry who supply goods across the world,” Colm Shannon, chief executive of Newry Chamber of Commerce and Trade says.He name-checks MJM Marine, a leader in the global marine industry, which employs  people in three offices across Europe. “Equally, we have a number of smaller companies who are involved in north-south trade. That’s usually the first step into the export market.”Exports are the essence of business for Re-Gen Waste, a Newry firm established in  by five siblings. Re-Gen began by recycling paper, cardboard, tin and plastics, before graduating to municipal waste and black bin waste. The family developed their own purpose-built facility in Newry, creating a business that generates millions. Its work is spread across Northern Ireland, the Republic and rest of the UK.According to John Doherty, a director at the business, Re-Gen “exports hundreds of tonnes across the border every day. We’re the fourth largest recycler in the Republic.” Its recycled products are exported to almost  countries around the globe. Re-Gen is not alone. Other successful Newry exporters include FM Environmental Group, which has offices in Malta and the Middle East. In , Newry’s BM Steel landed new business, in a deal worth £m, in the Netherlands and Great Britain. Around Noon, a producer of high-quality sandwiches, employs  people and has made acquisitions in Dublin and London. Newry-based construction firm mac-group is another all-island operation. In , it completed a £m refurbishment of River House, a -storey building in Belfast. Simultaneously, it was working the new Barclays headquarters in Dublin. “We employ over  people, across four dferent offices,” Brendan Moley, group interiors managing director at mac-group says. “The Newry office has  full time people. A lot of those staff members support projects in Dublin, London and Birmingham. There’s a lot of commuting back and forth across the border. We are trading in cross border services on a daily basis, but we’re also heavily involved in products and goods.”Although GB is Northern Ireland’s biggest external market, businesses in the Newry region are accustomed to cross border trade due to their geographical location. “We’ve always looked at Newry as being half way between Belfast and Dublin,” Brendan says. “You can get to Dublin Airport in  minutes from here. The talent available within the Newry market, in terms of some of staff, skill-set and knowledge, is extremely beneficial as well.”Some businesses fear that a hard border, in the event of a ‘no deal’ Brexit, will cause delays. According to Darren Cunningham, only a few hundred lorries crossed the border every day in . That number is around , today. “A minute delay can knock everyone back hours,” he says. “My oysters can’t hold their breath forever. They’re a living creature. They only have a certain amount of time. The quicker they get to France, the better condition they’re in.”Re-Gen operates its own transport department. “Currently we send a lorry to Dublin twice in a day to collect materials,” John Doherty says. “If there is a delay at the border, you are likely require a second lorry. The cost of taking everything from the Republic to the north doubles.”Technology, such as unmanned border posts equipped with cameras, would be unlikely to solve the problem, suggests Brendan. “Any type of border control will impact business. Being from the border area myself, knowing how many crossings there are, I think it would be absolutely impossible to police it in any sensible way.”Newry businesses fear they will face mountains of costly paperwork post-Brexit. There may also be compliance issues, such as food traceability dficulties for food producers like Killowen Shellfish, construction product regulations for mac-group, or paper work for Re-Gen’s haulage drivers, whose Certicates of Professional Competencemay not be to be recognised in a post-Brexit EU. The Government has suggested imposing zero tarfs on goods from the EU in the event of no deal. Newry businesses believe this would put them at a competitive disadvantage. “The business community has expressed concerns that Northern Ireland will become a back door into the UK market for goods coming from the EU,” Colm Shannon says. “History tells you when you have iation of tarfs on the border, that’s an opportunity for smuggling.”Staff recruitment is another concern at Re-Gen, which has a -strong workforce. “We’re already finding it dficult to recruit staff,” John says. “Often, the people we’re hiring are seasonal and foreign workers. It’s the same for the agricultural industry, hotels...”But what about the arguments that a managed no-deal could be good for business  Firms would still have access to EU markets under WTO rules. Furthermore, the UK might strike lucrative trade deals in the years to come. Businesses around Newry are not buying this. Certainly not Norbrook, which has “an integrated supply chain, with a global supply base, which relies on frictionless trade,” according to Liam Nagle, the company boss.Uncertainty reigns for export businesses in the Newry area. “The chaotic nature in which this has been managed has restricted companies like ourselves from planning for the future,” Brendan Moley says. “It’s one  dawn after another.”Darren Cunningham, looking across the water to where Co Louth is starting to feel very far away, says: “A lot of people are in complete disbelief and don’t think it’s going to happen. I can’t get my head around it at all. That’s the truth.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/jannine_1.jpg","title":"my day jannine waddell","story":"Posted on Friday  May  by Ulster Business Name: Jannine Waddell MBE Position: Managing director at Waddell Media .amMy alarm goes off and I instantly check the weatherand have a quick look at emails that have come in overnight.

So, why are Northern Ireland’s makers and engineers bucking the trend  John Mulgrew takes a look at our top performers and what may be skewing the figures If there’s been an industry yet to be tainted by the ill-effects of the run-up to Brexit that I, or other journalists haven’t written about, I’d be very surprised.The latest economic metrics and predictors have been tarred by the three years of uncertainty and political instability. But, according to the latest purchasing managers’ indexfrom Ulster Bank, manufacturing here has seen an uplt – unlike the other sectors.Globally, however, the growth of the manufacturing sector has slowed closer to stagnation, sitting at . in Januaryaccording to the JP Morgan Global Manufacturing PMI.“At the moment, exports are falling in German manufacturing,” Richard Ramsey, Ulster Bank chief economist said. “Northern Ireland and the UK compare favourably to the German powerhouse, and countries such as France and Italy.”He says that nine out of the  nations which are recorded by PMIs show manufacturing is falling.For Northern Ireland and the UK as a whole, Brexit-related stock-piling is certainly a factor. Let’s say you’re a cross-border business and you could be burdened by World Trade Organizationtarfs on your exports to the Republic in the event of a hard exit. What do you do  You produce more, and warehouse in your export market.Graeme MacLaughlin, relationship director, Barclays in Northern Ireland, said the “underlying state of health of UK manufacturing continues to be obscured by stockpiling, albeit down from the last survey’s record high, as Brexit uncertainty still thwarts investment intentions”.Ulster Business has revealed in this magazine that one major manufacturer, which has its base here, had stockpiled more than £m in food stock for its market in the Republic amid border concerns – and is now left with huge levels of product in a warehouse, with the exit from the EU now not likely until Halloween.“Continuing increases in inventories of both inputs and finished goods have exacerbated the slowdown in growth of new orders and given the loss of momentum in exporting activity, with growing signs that overseas markets are looking to alternative suppliers, the sector needs some degree of clarity on the future relationship with the EU sooner rather than later,” Graeme MacLaughlin said.Looking at what organic factors and positive stories which are fuelling the increase in manufacturing, Richard Ramsey says the success stories and expansion of firms such as CDE Global and Terex could be among those contributing.“They seem to be in expansion mode. But they are firms which are more exposed to the US, which is growing strongly. I would imagine those focused on eurozone are maybe experiencing that fall in demand.”Stephen Kelly, chief executive of Manufacturing NI, told Ulster Business that “in the past year, our firms have been busy”.“The economic conditions have been right. A purple patch indeed. Admittedly Brexit stockpiling has driven demand for many and as that begins to wash through the system in the coming monthsand with slowing of international and domestic demand, then now is the time to ensure we have the right conditions to ensure that this success is sustained.“By value, our engineering sector remains our most important. The extraordinary growth of the export focused sector in Mid Ulster, South Derry and West Tyrone contributes huge levels or employment and wages but as labour and skills have become more dficult to secure, firms have begun to spread out. CDE’s investment in Monkstown and Terex’s announcement for the North West demonstrate their commitment to creating more jobs here instead of overseas.“There has been much speculation about the demise of our manufacturing over recent years but the sector continues to confound its detractors. Employment levels, despite high profile closures, are back to  levels with exports at record levels and orders at home remaining strong. Our sector is larger and more important than manufacturing in the rest of the UK. Through direct and supported jobs, one in four local families rely on a manufacturing wage with our rural economy and community depending on manufacturers to bring both wealth and work.“Our award-winning food firms feed families at home and abroad with a greater number securing supply contracts with the UKs and Ireland’s largest buyers. Indeed news that Dale Farm had secured a supply contract with Greggs is further evidence that there is more growth possible for this critical sub-sector of manufacturing.“Often overlooked is our strength in building products. From Specialist Joinery and Carella fitting out the best of corporate offices to Smyth Steel and Macrete making the bulk of the new Tottenham Hotspur stadium, regarded as the best in Europe, in factories here before shipping on barges to London.“We’re also leading the move in construction from site build to factory built homes, schools, hospitals and offices at the McAvoy Group and Fasthouse. We have even seen a beautul table made by Terry Design from Portadown in  Downing Street.“Whether it is a critical spring on the Mars rover, or a defibrillator in the Oval office or indeed the fact that one in  people on the planet this year benefiting from a Randox test, products made in Northern Ireland are making a dference and making a huge economic contribution.“It is therefore critical that we cherish and celebrate our great firms who are making great products with great people in every postcode area. We must create the conditions that allow them to be free to make a success of their business and their community.As for the current and future “disruptor”, Richard Ramsey says while Brexit is the largest, the impact of Trump on the global economy, could have an impact on business here. “The thing is, it’s to what extentthere is when there is a trade war. Trump is increasing tarfs on China, then he focuses on the EU – how does the EU retaliate ”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/kpm_1.jpg","title":"ni bosses searching new markets to boost exports","story":"Posted on Tuesday June  by John Mulgrew Around % of Northern Ireland bosses are exploring emerging markets in order grow their exports, according to the latest survey from KPMG.

Of the Northern Ireland bosses surveyed, % said they want their employees to feel ‘empowered to innovate. On the issue of Brexit, around two thirds of business leaders see the UK’s exit from the EU as the greatest threat to growth. Looking at overall growth, all of those questioned said they expect ‘top line revenue growth over the next three years’. But just % of company bosses said they ‘expect to increase headcount in the next three years of more than %’. John Hansen, partner in charge of KPMG Northern Ireland, said: “Successful CEOs know they need their companies to be as innovative as possible and it’s clear that the right environment is being created in Northern Ireland to do just that. “Our leaders aren’t afraid to give their teams the scope to try new ideas which may have a risk of failure and that opens up a world of potential.

Ulster Business speaks to director Clare Kelly about a burgeoning firm which is leading the way in more than just business, but connectivity, co-working and wellness for its members Eighteen years ago and in its early stages of infancy, Glandore began its le in one building at Fitzwilliam Square in Dublin – capable of hosting just  members.Fast forward to the present day and it’s an all-island business with an -strong workforce across nine locations in Belfast, Dublin and Cork – playing host to as many as , people. And it’s very much a family-owned and run business, led by founder Michael Kelly with daughters Clare, Fiona and Rebecca each as directors within the company.Glandore’s high-end flexible working spaces have been up-and-running in Belfast for  years – with capacity for  members across its two locations here. However, the family’s connection to the city dates back to , when Michael first bought - Arthur Street, now Arthur Place.It’s been at the forefront of attracting some of the leading international foreign direct investmentto Belfast, working closely alongside Invest NI to bring in cyber-security and technology firms from the US and beyond – first setting up here in . Glandore offers its members a wide iety of flexible office space, co-working and hot-desking – designed so companies can grow organically. But it’s also focused on bringing its members together, connecting indigenous and international firms, while also considering wellness in the workplace, and improving its green credentials. Clare Kelly is a director of the family business – a qualied occupational therapist and Trinity College graduate, who joined Glandore in .She’s now tasked with focusing on the key marketing and business development elements of the burgeoning company – attracting and retaining members, and ensuring there remains a strong pipeline of clients.“We offer our members a erse range of services,” Clare tells Ulster Business. That includes short-term hot-desking for small businesses with just a handful of employees, to providing flexible high-end office space for companies with dozens, or hundreds of workers.”And while the flexibility allows firms to scale from small numbers to a larger workforce – taking short-term space for as little as just three months – Clare says many of the companies stay for several years, orto Glandore further down the line in their own business journey.“We also host a range of events, and can bring everyone together through the network of our members. That has allowed us to cater from very early start-ups, right through to the largest multi-national company, or scaling FDI business,” Clare says.“The dference with Glandore is the flexibility. A company may wish to bring in one or two people, and then concentrate on recruitment – but they can then scale with their growth, from say  to  people. “That flexibility and scale is key. In terms of Glandore, we are offering high quality space, but also offering a range of business services to our members.”Across its two Belfast city centre flexible workspace buildings, Glandore’s expanding network means it can now host around  members – with locations at Arthur House and the nearby Arthur Place.It has six locations in Dublin, including the Silicon Docks and Central Business District, and has boasted a long list of foreign direct investment firms, including Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox and Smartbox, and has also opened its newest office space building in Cork city.Glandore has forged strong relationships with Invest NI – helping provide high-end working environments for rapidly expanding FDI businesses – along with Belfast City Council, the Belfast Chamber and Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Some of its high profile international current, or former members, include cyber-security experts Rapid , digital marketing firm Bazaarvoice and global payments giant Cayan – a company which has now expanded into its Belfast headquarters at City Quays.The quality and bespoke nature of the offices are part of what helps Glandore stand out from the crowd. Clare says firms are able to specy exactly what they want, with a top-end design and fit-out team on hand to develop a specic working environment for each business.“When Glandore was set up by Michael in , he always focused on a high quality working environment,” Clare says. “We take premium office space in premium locations, and there is no expense spared in fit-out.“We provide a bespoke set up – whether they need a co-working space or a virtual office, for example. We can tailor that for each business. It’s not a cookie-cutter approach.”And while she says design and the aesthetics are important, behind the decor is the IT and security infrastructure to ensure that guests have the very best available to them.“We have always invested heavily in our network, and have our own on-site IT. We have an IT director, manager and team – so there is support even before day one. All of these things are important to firms of all sizes.”For Glandore, it’s not simply about putting guests on seats – there’s much more to the offering. “We have such a erse mixture of companies in the network and community, and we are able to mix the indigenous firms with the international companies, and actively, facilitate connections between our members.”That includes an alumni programme, which sees members past and present ing to celebrate their successful partnerships.“We bring back customers from the last  years, and representatives from Invest NI and Belfast City Council. It’s about making the connections between the current scaling members and those which have come before,” Clare says.“That support is invaluable. It can be very isolating in the those days when you are setting up, so it’s great to have someone you can bounce ideas off.”Glandore goes further still, with the introduction of both the Glandore Wellness Programme and Glandore Green Initiative – the latter focused on creating a greener and more sustainable office space.“We have been working with these companies for several years, and we get a bird’s-eye view,” Clare says. “One thing we have been very mindful of is the need for us to support from a wellness perspective.“We offer a complimentary wellness programme, which started in , long before it became a buzzword. It offers a way for our members to connect with each other, and help in retaining talent.”And while almost every business has experienced some Brexit-related impact, Clare says Glandore has reached its highest occupancy rate in its history – rising to % in Belfast.“It has been a very uncertain time and that has impacted businesses across Northern Ireland. There have been some delays in regards to FDI, but our hats go off to Invest NI which still attracting businesses into Northern Ireland.”And while there’s also scope for further growth in Belfast, there’s potential for that demand to move outside Belfast, with a potential to grow into the North West.“The hope is to continue our expansion as an all-island business, having operated on both sides of the border for  years, with capacity to grow the businesses in Belfast.“With the likes of Derry, that would be something on the agenda for Invest NI as part of its remit to win investment for outside Belfast. We will take the lead from the councils and from Invest NI, and we will look to see where we can add. If there isn’t space for a business to land, people will go where.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
