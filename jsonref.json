That’s interesting.” ’Mayo says. ‘It was not how I imagined the end of my career at Radio 2 would work out! I certainly had no intention of going anywhere.‘I had thought I would stay there until I was 94, then retire and drop dead. But it didn’t work out like that, so it was an uncomfortable period.‘They thought it would be an improvement and make the network more contemporary.

He’s also about to launch a new digital classical radio station called Scala. ‘When the offer came in it sounded new, positive and sparkly. I wasn’t feeling new, positive and sparkly at the time...’ That’s a huge understatement from a presenter known for his dry wit and sunny disposition, at least on air.

He said to me, “Brod, shall I go gay?” That is a fact. We all roared with laughter and moved on. I think the market was so narrow… and of course she had to be a virgin.’When responding to a remark that there were few around, Munro-Wilson said: ‘There were probably none, and I think it was a tricky one for him.’Paxman himself started at Cambridge when Charles began his third year. ‘You certainly never saw him in the pub,’ says the presenter.Das boob!

The Year Ten pupil never takes a day off, even during the school holidays, to ensure his 70 orders a week are promptly filled.After his early success with the foam guns, Tommy ordered a range of 200 products to sell through his eBay shop and his father, engineer Charlie, 43, arranged for him to store his stock in one of the family farm’s converted milking parlours.

Smollett told police that he was walking alone down East North Water Street in the 300-block around 2am when the two men approached himThey got up and walked away and all three walked out of the cameras\u0027 view. Smollett was picked back up by a different camera 60 seconds later as he entered his apartment building. He had the rope around his neck and there was salt on the front of his sweatshirt from the ground. At 2.35am, an associate of the actor\u0027s called 911 and officers arrived at an apartment where he was at 2.42am. It is not clear if it was his apartment that they went to or his friend\u0027s. After giving his statement, Smollett took himself to hospital where he was treated for lacerations to the face.           The attack took place here, in the street, outside the apartment building where Smollett stays while he is in Chicago filming. It is in between two luxury apartment buildings and two hotels but police say they have not yet recovered surveillance footage of it    Smollett, 36, who is also a singer, is due to perform on Saturday night in Los Angeles Police had asked him to turn over his phone for them to verify that he had been on a call with his manager, as both claimed, when the incident happened but he refused, saying he was uncomfortable doing so. Chicago Police Department spokesman Anthony Gugliemi told DailyMail.com on Thursday that it was not suspicious for him to have refused doing so and that he may have been concerned with privacy. He has been entirely cooperative otherwise, he said. The attack has enraged the country and caught the attention of the president who deemed it \u0027horrible\u0027 on Thursday. \u0027That\u0027s horrible....there is nothing worse, as far as I am concerned,\u0027 Trump said on when asked about the incident. Smollett\u0027s famous family released a statement abhorring the attack, and countless celebrities, including his Empire co-stars, have also spoken out to support him. He is due to perform a show in Los Angeles on Saturday night.  Jussie Smollett Cancels Concert Meet and Greet for Security Concerns | TMZ.comTim Stack (@EWTimStack) on Twitter"},{"url":null,"title":"Inside one Britains egg freezing parties","story":"    The London Egg Bank is offering a service for busy career women to freeze their eggs while in their 30s so they can consider having a baby later in life, using the better quality eggs           Women were invited to the Egg Freezing 101 seminar after they registered with the clinic\u0027s website. They were given coffee and biscuits while they were told about the process          The event was held at the London Egg Bank, part of the London Women\u0027s Clinic, picturedIt’s an introduction to the bizarre world of the egg-freezing trade, in which young professional women will be persuaded into parting with thousands of pounds in order to secure their future hope for a family.The London Egg Bank, part of the London Women’s Clinic, a fertility centre based on Harley Street, is selling itself as the place for career women to get their eggs frozen.This will, it is suggested, give them the chance to preserve their fertility, with the option of trying to conceive at a later date with eggs which have been put on ice when they’re younger – and are therefore better quality.Egg Freezing 101 is a ticketed event that’s free to attend, as long as you sign up to the London Egg Bank website.\u0027Shall I go gay?\u0027 Prince Charles joked he should get a...Share this articleGuests are invited to join the ‘rapidly growing’ number of women who are choosing to freeze their eggs. The event promises to show women how egg freezing can help them, as well as giving them the enticement of discounts to the clinic’s services.The surroundings are discreetly luxurious. Gold and black pendant lights hang in the reception area. Glass consulting rooms look as if they’d be more at home in a fashionable advertising agency than a hospital. With a teacup in one hand and biscuit in the other, the women are invited to gather around while they wait for the rest of the party. Everyone is handed an information folder containing price lists and a flyer for the clinic that reads: ‘Take Control.’The majority of the guests are women on their own, although two have come with male partners, and one appears to be there with her mother.          The majority of the guests are women on their own, although two have come with male partners, and one appears to be there with her motherOperations manager Marta Wolska takes the stage and begins the sales pitch. She explains that using the latest technique called vitrification – in which eggs are flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen rather than gradually lowered in temperature – 96 per cent of eggs that are frozen will survive defrosting.Marta’s message is clear. Fertility declines with age, and by investing in egg freezing at a young age, a woman can defy Mother Nature and preserve her fertility for years to come.If the women sign up today they’ll be offered a 30 per cent discount on all of the clinic’s services, from a fertility MOT at £370, to a three-cycle package of egg freezing at a full cost of £9,500.For those women under 35, the clinic’s services are free if they sign up to the ‘freeze and share’ option – a new programme where women donate half of their ‘harvested’ eggs to the clinic, which will then sell them on at a cost of £10,700 to women unable to conceive with their own eggs.The remaining half will be frozen for two years at no cost and then attract a £250 a year freezing fee after that. Marta boasts of the clinic’s flexible opening times – staff even work on Sundays.Then, extraordinarily, she offers to escort any woman home after the egg harvesting treatment if they don’t have a partner or good friend to do it.At this point I have to pinch myself.          Britain\u0027s fertility industry is worth an estimated £320 million a year It’s hard to believe they are talking about real human lives, about babies and vulnerable women, so worried about their futures that they’re susceptible to the tantalising promise of extended fertility. Never mind that the procedure being described is highly invasive, expensive and stressful.It’s as if the women here are just commodities to be signed up for their contribution to a fertility industry worth an estimated £320 million in the UK.Once Marta has completed her talk, Kamal Ahuja, founder of the London Women’s Clinic, comes on stage. He is introduced as the doctor and his talk focuses on the great strides there have been in fertility medicine since he began his career in the 1980s.While the women listen intently, there is one statistic that both presenters have remained conspicuously quiet about: the chances of actually giving birth to a baby using a frozen egg.Ahuja touches on about various legislative and ethical issues and then talks about his best patient, who ‘produced 50 eggs for me’.It’s an unpleasant image that makes her sound more like a battery hen than a human being. Particularly as the number of women suffering from ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome – in which their ovaries grow dangerously large because of aggressive fertility drugs – are rising.          Dr Kamal Ahuja of the London\u0027s Women\u0027s Clinic gave the women a talk about the process and how fertility changes in later lifeEventually, he offers a statistic: if a woman has 50 eggs frozen, she will have a 70 to 80 per cent chance of having a baby.Soon afterwards, he reveals that to gather 50 eggs would usually mean five cycles of egg collection. That is far more than most women could cope with, let alone afford (it would cost more than £17,000 for five cycles. And that cost is for freezing alone – it doesn’t include later fertilisation and implantation of embryos).Ahuja then points to a Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority leaflet, which is available to pick up at the back of the room – although it was noticeably absent from the information pack handed out at the beginning of the session.In the leaflet, the HFEA states the more sobering reality: ‘18 per cent of IVF treatments using a patient’s own frozen eggs were successful – this means that in around four in five cases, the treatment was unsuccessful.’ This is significantly lower than the chance of having a baby from a ‘standard’ fresh cycle of IVF, which is 30 per cent. However, women freezing their eggs also tend to be older, which skews the success rate.But still Ahuja continues with his positive tone. He tells us that there are more than 20,000 eggs in storage in Harley Street.He paints a picture of a buzzing industry, with a bright future of ever-improving statistics and ever-relaxing laws.HE IS also so quick to discourage the women from believing the other side of the argument that it makes one wonder if the clinic is offering a discount so that women sign up before going home and reading the HFEA leaflet that makes this optimistic picture feel altogether more confused.Even more worrying, as the event proceeds it is far from clear what exactly the process entails.The drugs, the injections, the mood swings: it’s made to sound easy. In reality, it is a serious medical procedure.It starts with more than a week’s worth of hormone injections to encourage the ovaries to produce multiple eggs (instead of just the one egg produced in a typical cycle).When the eggs are mature and ready to be retrieved, the patient undergoes sedation and a needle is used to harvest the eggs. There have been rare cases of women bleeding so severely from the needle that they’ve had to have their ovaries removed.Rehan Salim, consultant gynaecologist and specialist in reproductive medicine at Hammersmith and St Mary’s Hospitals in London, advises women to do their research before committing to anything.Mr Salim states that patients should seek treatment only from a consultant gynaecologist who has completed an accredited training programme from the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists in London.Worryingly, the London Egg Bank’s website reveals that there is not one consultant gynaecologist listed who has qualified in the UK.When the presentation is over, the women are encouraged to talk to the doctor privately with any questions. Next to me is a woman, 34, who would only like to be identified as Megan. She is at the event alone. She has a partner but is unsure whether or not she will stay with him, so would like an insurance policy in case her situation changes.Megan is confused and tells me: ‘It’s not clear how likely it is that I’ll have a baby from a frozen egg.’ So she may not go ahead.She goes to talk to the doctor but then returns to say she will sign up after all. What changed? ‘The doctor explained that the statistics are all very conservative estimates.’ I find this worrying, since they are based on official HFEA figures.Another woman, Hannah, 36, is there with her partner. She has been diagnosed with blocked fallopian tubes, so she wants to freeze her eggs because she will struggle to get pregnant in the future.Although her boyfriend is at the presentation, she is not sure of their longevity, so she also wants an insurance policy.Hannah is impressed with the clinic, saying: ‘I thought the presentation was very clear and I’m going to go ahead and sign up today.’Among some women, there is an air of quiet panic. Attractive and intelligent with good careers but finding themselves without committed partners, they are worried about the future. They know they want a family, but time is ticking on. They want an insurance policy.Raquel, 38, is single and wants to freeze her eggs in case she meets someone in the next few years. She wants to buy time. She wants to be able to spend time getting to know a man rather than feel forced to rush into something.She was confused by the live birth statistics but in spite of that she wants to go ahead.‘In March, the clinic is bringing in an option to pay for the treatment in monthly instalments, so I guess I will start then. Otherwise, it’s a lot of money to find,’ she admits.Two other women, Roxie, 31, and Monica, 32, are at the clinic to do the ‘freeze and share’. Both have successful careers in software and want to be in control of when they start a family.Have they thought about a knock at the door in 18 years’ time from a child conceived with their donor egg? ‘I am prepared for that,’ Monica says, laughing. ‘I don’t mind. I can cope with it.’But Roxie is not so sure. ‘No, this is what worries me. I am not so sure I want to think about this knock at the door.’At her young age, it’s a scenario that’s difficult to imagine – and a potentially devastating one, if she hasn’t been able to conceive her own child for whatever reason.As the event draws to a close, some women have left, while others are still clamouring around the doctor in the hope of gaining answers to their questions.Of course, no matter how bright Ahuja thinks the future is, it’s not physically possible for any of the women to get the absolute certainty they hope for.It’s a complex situation, with many variables. If the statistics are to be believed, for most of the women anyway, it will end up being nothing more than a very expensive gamble.The London Women’s Clinic last night declined to comment. The names of the women have been changed. "},{"url":null,"title":"Venezuelas ambassador Iraq diplomat Guaido air force general defects","story":"\u0027Supporting the president of the National Assembly is our obligation, duty and constitutional responsibility.\u0027The Venezuelan envoy to Iraq said that Guaido had the right and the \u0027constitutional duty to assume the Presidency of the Republic.\u0027\u0027Mr. President, Guaidó, you are on the right side of history, the people and the Constitution, which is why we place you at the service of the State, which you constitutionally represent and direct,\u0027 he said.Ramirez called on other senior government officials to renounce Maduro and throw their support behind Guaido.\u0027We call upon all those citizens who have exercised or exercise functions of State and Government to reflect and, in defense of the Constitution and the people, take a step forward with the sole intention of being on the side of the Constitution, history and the people,\u0027 he said. \u0027Maduro and his clan of usurpers overcame a barrier that breaks the permissible limit of being a State official and another an accomplice of a usurper, despotic, autocratic and dictatorial government.\u0027Ramirez finally urged the military to overthrow Maduro.\u0027Brothers of the Armed Forces, do not allow them to turn them into an army of mercenaries who kill the people,\u0027 he said.

To meet the changing emissions regulations we\u0027ve had to invest much more in new powertrains for our future models like X-Trail. At the same time, the volume forecasts for X-Trail in Europe have reduced.\u0027For those reasons the company has decided to optimise our investments and concentrate production in Kyushu, instead of adding another production site. For the European business, this does not change the fact that X-Trail is - and will continue to be - a crucial model for us.\u0027Today\u0027s announcement will be interpreted by a lot of people as a decision related to Brexit.

The case belonged originally to a beauty consultant named Darlene and contained old jars of cream, powders and brochures. But the thing that piqued Niemi’s interest after she bought it was a receipt from August 1960: Darlene had sold a jar of Liquid Beauty and one Temptress’s Hairspray, both to herself. “It left me with a feeling of a woman’s failed attempt at success,” says Niemi. “I started to picture her alone, being both beauty consultant and customer, and this led me to my fictional version of Darlene and her relationship to herself.”The image here comes towards the end of the visual short story, after the two characters’ stay in an extravagant desert house and before the final image, in which one buries the other under the shadow of a Joshua tree.The macabre series is one of six collected in the Norwegian photographer’s book In Character, each inspired by a different, pre-owned object.

I have always been drawn to the act of transformation – as a kid, dressing up made me really happy.

The book was illustrated with McCullin’s acclaimed black-and-white photographs, images of war and human suffering that helped define the conflicts they described. It was a book that bowled Duley over. Today, the two men sit opposite each other in McCullin’s quiet cottage on the Somerset levels – as far removed from the horrors of war as can be imagined. The excuse for their meeting and for our conversation is a major retrospective of McCullin’s work at Tate Britain, opening next week. Not that any excuse is required because, as they reveal, they are friends already.At 83, McCullin’s hale appearance and eloquence, after 60 years of taking pictures in war zones and elsewhere, cannot help but seem a death-defying fluke. He brushes aside any mention of the injuries he sustained falling off a roof in Cambodia (he broke several ribs and shattered his arm) and does not dwell on his hellish struggles in the city of Hue in Vietnam, which left him (as he reported in Jacqui and David Morris’s 2013 documentary McCullin) like a “tormented animal”. His restraint may partly be that he is a stoic but it is also, presumably, because of Duley’s presence. For Duley, as McCullin puts it, has “paid the price”.On 7 February, 2011, while involved in a photographic project studying the impact of war on soldiers in Afghanistan, Duley was “embedded” with the 1st Squadron of the 75th Cavalry Regiment of the US army and blown up by a landmine. He became a triple amputee. Most soldiers with similar injuries do not survive. But one of the many astonishing things about Duley (who is at pains to point out that his subject is not war itself but its aftermath) was that his first thought when he realised he had retained his right arm was: “I can still work as a photographer.”I first interviewed him in Charing Cross Hospital in October 2011. Not long afterwards and still in recovery, he visited McCullin and his wife, the travel journalist Catherine Fairweather, in Somerset. He was in a wheelchair then but today, now 47, walks on prosthetic legs and is working hard, his spirit modest, engaging and awe-inspiring. Duley’s Legacy of War photographic project, launched in 2013, explores the long-term effects of global conflict and, in 2015, he was commissioned by UNHCR to document the refugee crisis, visiting 14 countries in the Middle East and Europe and publishing, in 2017, I Can Only Tell You What My Eyes See. He has inspired Angelina Jolie and PJ Harvey and countless others. He has raised money to help some of the people he has photographed and has a gorgeous Instagram feed, The One Armed Chef, with pictures of the food he painstakingly prepares. He often cooks with refugees before photographing them. It is a convivial thing, he says.Our focus today is on the Tate’s McCullin retrospective, which begins in 1959 with The Guv’nors, the first McCullin photograph published in the Observer – of a north London gang (McCullin was born in rough Finsbury Park) theatrically posed, looking out from the timbers of a burned-out building, each occupying his own space, as if about to burst into song. It was the Observer that gave McCullin his start, though it was the Sunday Times that made his name. The show includes his most famous pictures – such as the albino boy in Biafra, clutching the corner of a corned beef tin. But it features less familiar photos too. In a BBC4 documentary to be aired on 4 February, Looking for England, McCullin says that whenever he is away, the longing for home exerts the strongest hold. His pictures of the Somerset levels are seen through a glass darkly: pewter, silver and black – anything but bucolic, potential battlefields. In McCullin’s work, darkness is always visible.Listening to the two men talk, affinities and differences emerge. Both have courage, empathetic vision and resist being described as heroic. But while Duley stays positive, McCullin, who once described war as “madness… insanity… schizophrenia”, is restlessly self-questioning – and although he is a gent with a wicked sense of humour, he can tilt into gloom, not about to let himself off any moral hook. Their conversation veers from growing up (both were dyslexic children) to dilemmas about what it means to photograph suffering, and each has a stab at addressing the toughest question of all: what can a photograph change? KKKate Kellaway: My first question, in the spirit of setting off, is what do you both take when you go into the field? What are the practical things that you need?Don McCullin The right attitude really. You have to know why you’re going are you committed to taking the risk? Particularly when one had a family, children, as I did. And then a lot of premeditation: “Will I be able to do this? Will I be able to do that?”Giles Duley I always take Tabasco with me, because of the amount of terrible food I’ve had. And I always have a doorstop. In a lot of the places I work now, kidnapping’s become a big thing. So I always shove that in the door, then at least if somebody tries to kick it in, there’s a wedge on it. It’s funny how you have these little things from habit.DMcC I used to take a crepe bandage in case I busted an ankle or something. And Ready Brek because I was always afraid of winding up with nothing to eat in the morning. There are all those niggling things.DMcC When you experience a calamitous day and see bullets flying over and shells coming and you survive that day, there’s no doubt, the adrenaline’s at full blast. But then this goes on for war after war until you come to the conclusion that you’ve been kidding yourself, thinking that war is exciting, and you forget that people are suffering and dying around you.It seems like a simple question but is actually a very complicated one: what makes a good photograph?DMcC A photograph should shout at you and tell you something’s wrong, that you’re not living in the right kind of world, something that words can’t explain to you. When I walked into a schoolhouse in 1969 in Biafra and saw 600 dying children, some of them collapsing and dying in front of me, I just cannot tell you what it was like, knowing I had my own children living in Hampstead at the time. When a picture like that is so bad, it’s easy to press the button, but it’s not easy to live with it. Morally, I’ve always had a terribly uncomfortable conscience about it. Trying to justify my work, in any statement, in any form or shape, is most difficult for me.GD For me – and I’m sure it’s the same for Don – when you actually take a photograph, it’s not just etched on the camera, it’s etched in your mind. I can remember every photograph I’ve taken. And actually the photographs that really haunt me are the ones that nobody sees, the ones that for whatever reason don’t make the edit, don’t get published. Then you feel like you’ve let those people down, because they’ve entrusted you to take their photograph and it ends up in a folder somewhere.But I think what I’m getting at here is are good photos found? Or made? Does the eye find the image?DMcC It’s about the emotional – we’re not just photographers, we gather emotionally. A camera doesn’t mean a toss to me. I just put it in front of me and transfer the image through that piece of glass and that film. But I’m using my emotion more than I’m using that piece of equipment. And at the same time there’s a thousand thoughts going through my brain saying: “Is it right do this?” I’ve seen men executed and I haven’t photographed it and I thought my God, if my editor knew that I hadn’t pressed this button he’d give me the boot. But it’s my moral duty not to take that picture because the man who’s about to be killed hasn’t given me his permission.DMcC When a man is standing in front of you about to die, you can’t help him. He’s crying and he’s looking at you. He’s looking up to where he thinks God is and he’s scrambling around like mad to this last chance to keep alive and you’re standing there, you can’t help him. You are ashamed of humanity.You have said, Don, that you feel in some way that you’ve failed to do what you would like to have done through photography, but you can’t surely have thought that photography would put an end to war or human misery?DMcC A lot of people wouldn’t understand what one means by “fail”. All I’m saying is that when one war’s cleared up, the next war is waiting in the wings and they seem to have got worse over the years. When I first started, there weren’t crazed 14-year-old boys in west Africa with machetes, lopping off the arms of people and babies and children. You thought it couldn’t get any worse than that and then along came Isis, setting fire to that Jordanian pilot in that cage. And if you think about the two most important pictures that came out of Vietnam, one was the girl running down the road, which was taken by Nick Ut (although everyone thinks I took that picture… I don’t know why) in 1972. The other picture was Eddie Adams’s 1968 picture of the police chief shooting the man in the head. It took several years after them for the war to end. So that’s what I’m getting at. Do we change anything? The pictures didn’t stop the war, did they?GD People ask: can you change the world with your photograph and I would say, no, but maybe we can inspire the people who do. A couple of years ago, I got a letter from a man in Australia who had just got into medical school. He really struggled growing up, at home and at school, but he had a picture of mine on his wall, one I took in Afghanistan. “That’s what made me want to be a doctor,” he said. Every day, he would look at that photograph to remind himself. Honestly for me, if that’s the only impact my work’s had then it’s great. And Don says his work hasn’t changed anything, well it changed my life. It made me do what I do. GD I always have that trump card! I was walking around Mosul in a hospital a couple of years ago and people had lost their legs. I was joking: “Well it’s only one leg, what are you fussing about?” I’m one of the few people who get away with that. But I remember before I got injured, photographing a boy in South Sudan who’d been shot in the stomach and kidneys and I was just alone in a little mud hut with him, because the doctors had left. I pointed my camera and took a photograph and almost vomited afterwards because I felt so sick at what I’d just done. You think you’re there for the right reasons because it’s important that the story is told. But pointing a camera at a dying person, if you did that in London in the street, people would think you’re the most vile person in the world. So why is OK to do it because we’re abroad? It’s not a human thing to do.GD But then in a lot of places that you have been, say, Vietnam, you might have been with American troops but you wouldn’t hold them responsible for your safety?DMcC No. But in those days, you weren’t embedded. You got the rank of major, jumped on a helicopter and went where you wanted. They didn’t care if you got killed. I have to say, my son was in Afghanistan with the Marines, only for six months, but all the time he was there I was thinking of you and I thought, it’s such a selfish thing for me to say, I didn’t want him to come back horrendously injured the way you did. He came back and, he was fine, he’s happy. I was making out it didn’t worry me, but I was worried to death.You were thinking like a father. Giles has paid a huge price, but also, you have to reflect on the part that luck plays...GD Well of course. I see myself as the luckiest man in the world. Only 20 people in this country have even survived being blown up and losing three limbs. Eighteen months later I was back in Afghanistan working. I’ve travelled to 14 countries in the last year on my own. I have everything I ever wanted in my life, plus a lot more experience, a lot more understanding of life and death, my empathy, my connection with people.It’s clear from your autobiography, Don, that war photography is not a great career choice in terms of your private life?DMcC It can ruin you. That is what happened with my first marriage, although my children have come back to me in a very generous way and forgiven me. We’re a very close family but photography – it’s not all good.GD No. And even if you are forgetting the dangers, it is just the amount you’re away. Something else might be planned and then you just go off… It is selfish. I mean there is no way around that.DMcC It is a dangerous mistress, and it’s one of those love affairs that never ends, you know. It just never ends. You’re totally captive to photography once it gets a grip of you.GD I don’t know if I’ve ever told you the story of when I flew back to Birmingham from Afghanistan, three days after I was injured. They wheeled me off the plane doped up on morphine and my sister said: “He’s trying to say something.” They took the oxygen mask off and she thought these were going to be my last words (they had said I wouldn’t make it through the night). My poor sister bent over and was expecting me to say” “I love you” or” “I’m sorry.” I whispered to her: “I’m still a photographer.”You both do wonderful work in black and white - it’s almost a hallmark for you, Don. What does black and white have that colour lacks?DMcC I’ve done a few colour pictures, but I think in a way it starts kind of glamming it up a bit. You see colour, you think of Hollywood. But black and white is not truthful, is it? I mean, we don’t live in a black-and-white world. We use black and white as a weapon because it will shout and scream at you. You won’t miss the black and white, but you could walk past a colour picture.GD For me, there is no truth in photography. It’s all our interpretation. If you stick me in a room and I look in one direction and take a picture, it’s different from what’s behind me. So in a way, black and white is saying it’s not true. It’s saying, this is an artistic statement of it. When I see a lot of colour photographs of conflicts…DMcC … especially on digital…GD Yes. It’s saying: “This is exactly the reality.” But it’s not. A photograph is still a fake thing. It’s one second I’ve taken out of the whole day my version of reality. Black and white for me is honest, it’s saying, this is obviously not reality.The pictures I find most powerful are a bit like hauntings. They hang around.DMcC They should. That’s what we try to bring. If I can haunt people with my pictures I have done my job.Both of you had dyslexia as boys and I wonder whether your brilliance at photography was a way of finding a different, powerful way of communicating?DMcC I suffered for being dyslexic. The schoolmasters used to knock seven bells out of me because they thought I was skiving. I took some terrible hidings from sadistic, Victorian schoolmasters who were the last of that legacy. GD When I was 13, I was held back a year at school. When you’re that age, to be told you’re stupid and have everyone make fun of you leaves a huge imprint. So when at 18 I discovered photography, found all these photographers’ work, it was like discovering poetry or literature.DMcC That’s what makes us so different, Giles. You had this amazing kickstart into culture. At the age of 15, I was working on a steam train going up to the north of England, washing up in the dining car. I was living out a raw life. I was watching nude shows! I used to sleep in the sheds in the railway sidings outside of Liverpool – Edge Hill – and I met this boy there who took me to this shabby old theatre in Liverpool. The women were naked – only from the waist up in those days – and they were not allowed to move. It was all done in a tasteful tableau.Looking to the future of photography now, we are a culture saturated in images: are mobile phones and Instagram a menace?DMcC Not a menace at all. Take the white helmets who risked their lives in Syria: phones were the only means of us getting information out. Photojournalism has had its day, though. When did you last see a really serious great set of pictures? Newspapers, even great newspapers, they’re almost running tabloid-type material of film stars and footballers and crap like that.What about the work you do when you’re not photographing terrible things abroad? I’m thinking of your cooking Instagram pictures, Giles, and your pictures of the Somerset fields around here, Don.GD I actually reached a point with the documentary, humanitarian work, I ended up photographing everything I hated in life. It sounds silly, but going back and starting to do some portraits again, I started enjoying photography in a different way.DMcC I get a lot of letters – and you must get the same – saying: “I want to be a war photographer”. I say to people that’s fine, but there are just as many wars going on in our cities. If you want to be a war photographer, go out and help yourself. My best story wasn’t in a foreign war my best story was the homeless story I did in the 1970s, in Aldgate, on the periphery of the great moneymaking part of this country, the City.And that’s going to be in the Tate exhibition, isn’t it?DMcC Yes. I’m more proud of those pictures and I’m more proud of the social pictures I did of poverty in the north of England than I am any of my war pictures. I’m not proud of my war pictures at all.GD Yes, what’s the point in taking a photograph if nobody sees it? You have to find it, whether it be in a gallery, whether it be in a newspaper.Finally, I wonder what it would actually mean for you both, to give up photography?DMcC It will be the day I die. That’s when photography will be stolen away from me. I don’t intend to die yet, by the way. My most exciting time in my life is coming up on Monday at my exhibition. I don’t know why, I’ve had lots of exhibitions and all of a sudden I can’t sleep at night thinking about this one.GD I made that comment about the words I said when I was taken into hospital. If I hadn’t been able to take a photograph again then I would rather have died in Afghanistan. Photography, it’s me. It’s my voice. Simple as that.Don McCullin is at Tate Britain, London SW1 from 5 February until 6 May"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18a80e1355cb7688ef7280cfcc5d0932ddb7d42f/0_329_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=077898bcc94c9ae73188ea1a93f81ff4","title":"original observer photography","story":"Stage, screen, song and Sambuca - the best photography commissioned by the Observer in January 2019"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/554b1050d6d3a2e4e7ebe14fece85a005e7fbfe8/0_475_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=06dab90fabee93a19cc700ca47704977","title":"screen dreams cinemas of the world in pictures","story":"For 16 years, Paris-based photographer Stephan Zaubitzer has been photographing cinemas around the world.

Britain has a productivity problem. Since the financial crisis, growth in output per worker has barely risen and the gap with other industrial countries is large. London is much more productive than the other big cities.Now here’s something you might not know: a lot of it has to do with buses. Public transport really matters.Cities tend to be more productive than towns or villages because of agglomeration effects: the notion that bringing people together in one large urban centre leads to new and better ways of doing things. The bigger the city the bigger the agglomeration effect.This rule holds true in other countries. The second-biggest French city, Lyon, is more productive than Marseille, the third-biggest city, which in turn is more productive than the fourth biggest, Lille. In the US, Germany and the Netherlands the same applies.In Britain it is a different story, however. Here, big cities such as Birmingham are less productive than smaller cities such as Oxford and Cambridge. And that’s because the problems people have in getting from their homes to the places where the jobs are shrinks the real size of UK cities. Research by the Open Data Institute in Leeds has shown that the effective size of Birmingham is about half that of the nominal population because of the problems caused by inadequate public transport.What the Leeds researchers did was to record 40m bus departures from all over the city to see how long the journeys took in peak and off-peak times. They assumed that to be part of the Birmingham agglomeration someone should have a travel to work time of 30 minutes or less. The half-hour limit did not include waiting at bus stops or walking at either end, which would take the total door-to-door journey time to 50 minutes.The research showed that in peak time, getting around Birmingham by bus is a painstaking process. A 3.5-mile journey from Stirchley in the south of the city to the centre takes about 20 minutes between 7am and 8am but about 40 minutes between 8am and 9am.Contrast that with travel by tram. The West Midlands has one tramline, linking Wolverhampton with Birmingham. Someone who gets on at West Bromwich for the 8.5-mile journey to Birmingham knows that it will take 30 minutes, regardless of whether it is during the rush-hour or not.Now consider the public transport infrastructure in Britain and France. The second, third and fourth-biggest cities outside of Paris – Lyons, Marseille and Lille – have eight Métro lines between them (four in Lyon and two each in Marseille and Lille). The UK equivalents have none.Manchester has a tramway system to match that of Lyon, with about 100 stations in each city. But Marseille (three lines) and Lille (two lines) are far better connected than Birmingham, with its one line, and Leeds (none).“Our hypothesis is that, by relying on buses that get caught in congestion at peak time for public transport, Birmingham sacrifices significant size and thus agglomeration benefits to cities like Lyon, which rely on trams and metros.”As Forth notes, Transport for the West Midlands – the public body that coordinates transport in the region – knows there is a problem and is taking steps to cut journey times. There is investment in bus lanes, seven sprint bus routes are in the pipeline, two tram extensions are under construction and railway stations are being reopened.To punch at its full weight, however, Birmingham would require investment in new transport infrastructure – trams and metros. The same applies to the other metropolitan cities outside London.The messages from all this are clear. First, transport infrastructure makes a real difference to the effectiveness of local economies and the lack of investment in places such as Birmingham has come at a price.As a report on how to rebuild the regional economies of the UK published last week noted, it is time the Treasury revised its assessment criteria for transport projects to give more weight to the less prosperous parts of the UK. The payoff in productivity terms would be considerable.Second, if money is the issue the government should think about scrapping HS2 and reallocating the tens of billions it is going to cost to smaller-scale local projects. It would not be nearly as sexy but, pound for pound, the benefits of improving the bus network in Birmingham or criss-crossing the West Midlands with trams would bring much more to the local economy than cutting the journey time to London on HS2.Finally, the story of Birmingham’s buses makes the strongest of cases for power and money to be devolved. The people who know just how long it takes to get from Stirchley to New Street station should be given the responsibility for doing something about it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7f8c68029805b6b19f985a2610e219abd10b5392/0_54_3956_2373/master/3956.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d61ac8135e97ab1dba2ba6549a69eb07","title":"jeremy hardy true to himself and his comedy","story":"The campaigning comic was political to his bones, yet also gloriously sillyEven a decade ago, Jeremy Hardy used to worry about the vulnerability of his supposedly aged Radio 4 fanbase: “I hope we don’t have a harsh winter – I could lose half my audience.” This was characteristically modest, since he was loved and admired by comedy fans of all ages, from the spit’n’sawdust clubs where he started out in the early 80s to the Hay festival and the BBC Radio theatre. So many of the tributes pouring in after the announcement of his death from cancer on Friday, at only 57, have come from younger comics with stories to tell of his unstinting generosity, support and kindness towards those coming up in the business.Hardy was a comedian’s comedian, which is to say that he was steeped in a love of standup and was regarded in turn as a master of the craft by his contemporaries and those who aspired to follow him.“If you loved standup, you loved him,” says the comic and writer Shappi Khorsandi, to whom he became a mentor and friend early in her career. “There was no ego, it was never about fame, it was always about the craft. He would always speak his mind, but his fierce intelligence meant that his self-expression was absolutely watertight.”It was in part that consummate clarity of expression – the ability to sound, even off the cuff, as if each sentence had been polished and carefully edited before leaving his lips – that made him such a unique voice in British comedy. But his instinctive feel for the perfect turn of phrase and comic timing was underpinned by a formidable knowledge of current affairs, politics and history. His longtime friend and colleague Mark Steel tweeted on Friday that a journalist from a national paper had called him to ask if Jeremy was political at all (yes, seriously). “I shall forever regret not saying, ‘He was chair of East Surrey Conservative Association but didn’t like to mention it,’” Steel added.Hardy was, of course, a political comedian to his bones, though the label bothered him. “I’ve always been uncomfortable with that epithet, ‘leftwing comedian’,” he told his friend Jack Dee, who interviewed him for BBC Radio 4’s Chain Reaction in 2007. “It’s like you’re not a proper comedian, but people approve of you.”Not everyone approved when he joked on Radio 4 that the world would be a better place if all members of the BNP were shot in the back of the head, there were complaints to the BBC and a gig in Burnley was cancelled.But for the most part, Hardy won audiences over because he was never hectoring – he delivered lines like the above with a cheery reasonableness that usually allowed him to slip potentially isive points under the radar, but mainly because, above all, he was so funny. Hardy used to joke that he wasn’t all that leftwing, it was just that everyone else kept moving to the right. “I’ve always been an old-fashioned leftist-liberal,” he told Dee, “but the country had moved so far to the right that I’ve ended up the most leftwing person in the country.”But beyond the jokes, Hardy was respected by colleagues and audiences from middle England to Stop the War rallies, because he walked the walk. Plenty of comics have tackled topical material, especially on the alternative scene in the 80s where he learned the trade, but Hardy’s politics were inisible from who he was. Much of his time was spent campaigning, not for big showy benefit gigs but quietly, behind the scenes, for the issues he cared about, from the Guildford Four to Palestine to the plight of child refugees.Hardy was serious about his politics, but never dour or earnest, and always took the trouble to put people at ease. The first time I met him, some years ago in Hay, he chatted easily, as if to an old friend, despite the fact that I was so obviously awestruck at meeting someone who had been a comedy hero since my teens.He was as loved by fans for his glorious silliness, including his celebrated tuneless singing on I’m Sorry I Haven’t a Clue. He once referred to his colleague Graeme Garden as “a quiet genius”, a phrase that could be applied equally well to Hardy himself. His death leaves a gap in the comedy landscape that won’t easily be filled and we will miss his wisdom in the years to come."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e05d49c4a0cd88f96ef5209ea32f23a82c0795dd/0_65_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=08cac11d695231cabdff89cbe73eb373","title":"tories should heed oliver letwin wont be forgiven no deal brexit","story":"One of the better, because more honest, speeches delivered during parliament’s most recent Brexit debate came from Oliver Letwin. While other Tories carried on fantasising and wrangling about what they would or would not permit, Sir Oliver confessed that he was “past caring what deal we have” and would support whatever Mrs May comes up with next. He would do so, the former cabinet minister explained, because if Britain crashes out of the EU without a deal and the consequences are bad, “my party will not be forgiven for many years”.Were I a Tory, I’d pay attention to that warning. Sir Oliver speaks with experience of what follows when politicians wilfully inflict abominations on their voters. He was one of the architects of the poll tax in the 1980s. Some readers may need reminding that this reckless experiment in changing local taxation without thinking through the consequences led to rioting in Trafalgar Square and the defenestration of Margaret Thatcher at the hands of her own party.The poll tax will look like a mild kerfuffle if Britain exits the EU without an agreement or a transition period and the result is widespread and severe havoc to some of the most basic aspects of everyday life. More klaxons have sounded in the past few days, including warnings from supermarkets that some of their shelves will be empty. If we tumble over the cliff edge without a parachute, opinions differ about whether it would be merely calamitous or utterly catastrophic.No one can be entirely sure. One of the issues with a no-deal scenario is the difficulty of making accurate predictions about what will follow the stark termination of decades of trading and legal agreements, and the overnight shredding of many thousands of intricate and vital arrangements. Because there is no precedent for such an event happening to a country as advanced and complex as Britain, everyone is having to guess. Some of the hazards of a no deal might transpire to be less terrible than forecast. Unforeseen perils, for which there has been no preparation at all, would likely materialise. Documents prepared for Operation Yellowhammer, the government’s no-deal contingency planning, coyly refer to “unanticipated impacts”. This is one of the greatest hazards of no-deal Brexit: even the people paid to do so can’t identify all the risks and how menacing they might turn out to be. We are in the Rumsfeldian realm of known knowns, known unknowns and unknown unknowns.My view of what no deal would mean is informed by my chilling conversations with ministers, civil servants and heads of government agencies who have responsibility for essential services and commerce. They are sweating fear. So are public sector and business leaders. The people who would have to handle the consequences of Britain crashing out of the EU are very scared indeed. This fright is shared in the highest reaches of the cabinet. So if we end up in a no-deal scenario, it would mean that senior ministers had allowed it to happen, fully conscious that they were playing roulette with Britain’s future like a last chip gambler in a Las Vegas casino. Sir Oliver is surely correct when he says that the blame for a nightmare Brexit would be indelibly stamped on his party.For sure, there would be those who would seek to cast culpability elsewhere. Some would accuse the EU of being “unreasonable” and elements of the media would megaphone that view. Others would point a finger at the Labour party for being an accessory to the calamity by first electing a Brexiter as its leader and then standing by while he shuffled along the fence doing nothing to arrest the country’s slide towards disaster. The Opinium poll we publish today, as with other recent polls, suggests that voters are not at all impressed by the endless equivocations of Jeremy Corbyn.But the Conservative party should expect to receive the harshest judgment from history and the greatest punishment at the hands of the electorate. And rightly so. To govern is to be responsible for calamities that happen on your watch. The more so when the disaster is not a bolt from the blue that the party in charge could not have reasonably anticipated, but a horror that it authored and inflicted.It was a Conservative prime minister who called the 2016 referendum in fright of the right of his party and in a vain attempt to settle the Tories’ civil war over Europe, a gambit that has only inflamed that conflict and infected the whole country with its poisons. Leading Tory politicians fronted the Leave campaign and mouthed its mendacities. Another Conservative prime minister has presided over the combination of tragedy and farce that has unfolded since. I thought I had seen it all until Theresa May got to her feet to invite parliament to instruct her to go away and renegotiate the agreement that she has spent weeks – no, months – telling everyone is the only possible deal available.Voters will put up with quite a lot of mistakes by governments. When the alternative is prime minister Corbyn, Britain might even choose to forget that the Tories made such an atrocious mare of the Brexit negotiations if the ending is not too grisly. But tolerance will not extend to forgiving the Conservatives if they unleash havoc that throws everyday life into chaos. Ted Heath was taught that when the miners went on strike in the winter of 1973-74 and the government’s emergency measures included imposing power cuts and a three-day working week. I recall it being rather fun doing my homework by candlelight, but less great that the television didn’t work. In desperation, that Tory prime minister called the “Who governs?” election of February 1974. If he had to ask that question, the public decided it shouldn’t be him governing and he was expelled from office. The Winter of Discontent, the wave of strikes that paralysed Britain in 1978-79, did such enduring damage to the reputation of Labour as a competent party that the Tories were still using that crisis against Labour three elections later.The Conservatives will own a nightmare Brexit and it will not just be Remain voters who will take their revenge on the Tory party. It will also be Leave voters. If Brexit goes horribly wrong, Leave voters are not going to find fault with themselves for being suckered by a bogus prospectus, unrealisable promises and a red bus emblazoned with a lie. Leave voters are going to blame the Tories for betraying them.There is one further caution for Conservative MPs about what a nightmare Brexit will do to them. The voters will almost certainly not discriminate between Tories on the basis of where they have stood in all the arguments. If the country is in a mood to punish the Conservative party as a collective, it will not much matter to a voter whether this or that MP had always been against Brexit or had argued for a compromise or was a Brexit ultra. Tories of every faction will feel the hot vengeance of the electorate’s wrath. That was a lesson of the 1997 election when the Conservatives went down to a landslide defeat after five years of warring with themselves about Europe. Whether a Tory MP was a Europhile or a Europhobe proved to be irrelevant to their fate. The swing against Tory candidates was uniform.Oliver Letwin was around for that catastrophe for his party, which was followed by a 13-year period in opposition for the Tories, their longest stretch out of power since the introduction of universal suffrage. Not enough of his colleagues were prepared to act on his warning in last week’s votes. There was only a narrow majority for a non-binding caution to the government that parliament doesn’t want a no-deal outcome. There was no majority for the amendment that would have compelled the government to avoid it. When we get to the very edge of the abyss – and that moment is alarmingly close – my hunch is that parliament will act. I suspect that enough Tories share Sir Oliver’s dread of no deal and what the consequences would do to their party.It’s only a hunch, mind, and one based on the fragile assumption that the Conservative party still has some instinct for self-preservation and a residual capacity to think rationally."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a1708c11b626446358b0ea5fe59c04e6aef662d/0_357_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=03854c58eb70f40e8b1a4ab3fba47dad","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of pleasure","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘pleasure’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘pleasure’.Share your photos of what pleasure means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 6 February at 10am.

What is the the impact of an ‘ethical tide’ on cultural funding?‘The true purpose of art is to recycle money,” or so once said the American theatre director Peter Sellars. It’s a mischievous suggestion that is a favourite with Ruth Mackenzie, the British arts director and curator. “Let’s face it, there are ethical issues about money pretty much wherever it comes from,” said Mackenzie, speaking from Paris, where she is soon to launch her first season as artistic director of the Châtelet theatre. “Arts organisations anywhere are lucky to find a business prepared to support them. And it is crucial now. These are very difficult circumstances.”In the past few days the big-bucks mechanics of corporate backing for the arts have come under scrutiny following Man Group’s decision to pull out of sponsoring Britain’s leading fiction prize, known commonly as the Booker. Its high-profile termination of a relationship that, by the time they bow out in October, will have cost them £25m is thought to have been prompted by the author Sebastian Faulks, who last year suggested the global hedge fund managers behind the prize were, in fact, “kind of the enemy” and ought not to be applauded by literary figures.Faulks has since denied this is what he meant, and it’s probable that the 18-year annual prize sponsorship was already at the end of its natural life, but in an era when businesses find it difficult to plan just one month ahead, and when arts institutions face shrinking state subsidies, corporate philanthropy is especially precious.Peter Bazalgette, the former chair of the Arts Council of England, recalls the difficulty of getting cultural organisations to seek greater support from the world of business immediately following the credit crunch: “Every organisation, whether a book prize, a theatre or dance company, or a little gallery, needs to have a properly worked-out policy about whose donations it accepts. All these policies will be different, but it is very important that a board has agreed it with the executive.”Among other sponsorship deals under the ethical microscope are the oil giant BP’s support of the British Museum, the annual portrait award and the Royal Shakespeare Company, an arrangement particularly unpopular with actors Mark Rylance, Vanessa Redgrave and Maxine Peake. Shell’s former sponsorship of the National Theatre also prompted protests a decade ago, as did last spring’s abortive attempt by BAE Systems, the weapons manufacturer, to support the Great Exhibition of the North.Eyebrows will no doubt also rise when Huawei, the Chinese technology company accused of high-tech state espionage, unveils its latest creative venture in London, a musical collaboration that has used artificial intelligence to complete Schubert’s Unfinished Symphony. It may not allay fears to hear that Huawei’s European boss, Walter Ji, said this weekend: “If our smartphone is intelligent enough to do this, what else could be possible?”Yet it is no time for British arts to be squeamish. The chair of the government’s digital, culture, media and sport select committee, Damian Collins, has called for more corporate sponsorship of the arts outside London. Meanwhile, the Arts Council of England is carrying out a major review of its grant-giving strategy for the next 10 years, with a predicted new emphasis on improving ersity and correcting geographical bias. This could mean a threat to the museums, galleries, theatres and opera houses of the capital city.If so, willing corporations will have plenty of fresh holes to plug, and for Mackenzie, whose Parisian project is sponsored by the US financial media company Bloomberg, the hope remains that world-class firms will always want to be associated with top-quality art. “Organisations in Britain are now very good at getting sponsorship from everywhere local and national governments, and from charitable foundations. But the government needs to help them along,” she saidNevertheless, a survey conducted a year ago by the online magazine Arts Professional detected that British arts workers are resistant to dirty lucre from the commercial world. Nearly all of those asked wanted their organisation to look carefully before signing up, while 73 per cent feared they “were vulnerable to reputational damage” through links with the wrong sponsor or donor.Bazalgette respects, he says, the ethical positions adopted by arts organisations, but he praised Man for promoting the book prize for so long and the Edinburgh-based investment firm Baillie Gifford for supporting the arts in its home city, as well as sponsoring the non-fiction book award he currently chairs, known as The Samuel Johnson Prize until 2015.“The key thing is that each organisation develops its own rationale,” Bazalgette said. “Personally, I also think BP have been magnificent supporters of the arts and I would happily take money from them. I see everyone driving around in cars, so I think that is reasonable.”Several arts prizes are so tightly entwined with the name of a former longterm sponsor it takes time for public perception to shift. For many, Britain’s leading annual award for fiction remains “The Booker”, in recognition of its first corporate sponsor, a food distributor. Similarly the Women’s Prize for Fiction still looks distinctly “Orange” to some, while on the Edinburgh fringe circuit comedians continue to yearn for a prize once associated with a particular French fizzy water, some 13 years after Perrier walked away.The Edinburgh comedy prize, run by Nica Burns, has moved through several sponsors since Perrier and the key, she believes, is finding the right fit. “I would say you need a sponsor who is genuinely going to benefit,” she said. “Done properly, it gives them a lot of brand awareness and the longer it goes on, the more benefit they get.” A good match is so vital for Burns that she funded the comedy prize herself one year “because you have to be comfortable with a sponsor”.On the broader cultural field, Burns believes prizes are a great way to find unsung talent, but admits lengthy sponsorship deals have become trickier to secure.“I could look any sponsor in the eye and say it would be good for them, but a longer commitment is hard now because the commercial world is changing so fast.”Toby Mundy, director of the Baillie Gifford Prize, also sees backing an arts prize as “tremendously good value”. Not only is there an annual news hook for media coverage, but also a clear association with excellence.Arts organisations may have become more cautious, Mundy adds, but with a good partner the benefits are better than just cash. “Generally there’s tremendous asymetery between a wealthy sponsor corporation and the sponsored arts organisation, who are usually short of the business advice a sponsor can offer.”For Mundy, changing the name of a prize seems a small concession to make for a corporation “putting a ton of money in”.Among the other corporate benefactors out there are Merrill Lynch, Deloitte, Coutts and Travelex, which until last year provided the National Theatre with 15 years of discounted tickets, and the French champagne maker Ruinart which supports the annual Frieze art fairs in London.Philanthropy, whether personal or via a legacy foundation, is a different but equally fruitful source of arts funding. Illustrious surnames such as Clore, Duffield, Sainsbury, Blavatnik and Manoukian regularly reappear across the cultural piste.Sackler has proved more problematic, with the Tate and the New York’s politan Museum of Art criticised for their association with a family linked to the US opioid epidemic through their company Purdue Pharma. Some argue that at least global corporations, whatever their flaws, are forced to be transparent due to the pressure exerted by shareholders and regulators.Risk of reputational damage swings both ways, of course, because artists are inclined to be volatile. In 1972 the late novelist John Berger blamed Booker for exploiting workers at its sugar plantations in Guyana when he won the prize for his book, G. Similarly when Hyundai sponsored the latest installation in Tate Modern’s Turbine Hall, it could not have guessed it would be drawn into a diplomatic dispute when its Cuban creator, Tania Brugera, was detained for four days on her native island.Moral implications on both sides of a sponsorship deal are increasingly soupy, agrees Stephen Deuchar, director of The Arts Fund. Fiscal propriety, personal behaviour, and even historical links to a colonial past are all now likely to be spotlighted.“The ethical tide is certainly rising,” said Deuchar, a former director of Tate Britain, “but good models include the arrangement between Ernst \u0026amp Young and the Tate. It works when there is a long-term affinity.”Mackenzie, who was once Chris Smith’s advisor at department of culture and is current London head for the Arts Council, thinks companies must be encouraged to see that British cultural institutions are world leaders. “Whatever happens, the British Museum and the National Theatre are not moving out. They are staying where they are. And, within reason, we should agree there is no such thing as totally clean money. After all, I don’t ask the people buying tickets for my shows where their money comes from.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dc8c4e07c2a7e00672b3364df1086628d66f73dc/0_3_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8f1b256c1d83736518937ec210fe8d08","title":"call for more regulation of home schooled children in england","story":"Children’s commissioner wants stronger measures to stop schools ‘off-rolling’ pupilsThe children’s commissioner for England is calling for greater supervision for children being home-educated after their numbers have doubled in the past five years, driven by pupils being “off-rolled” or informally excluded by schools.Anne Longfield wants the estimated 60,000 home-schooled children in England to be registered with local authorities as well as stronger measures to stop schools illegally pushing pupils off their books, often by persuading parents to home-school them.“The numbers are rocketing and no one knows how they are doing academically or even if they’re safe. Many are being off-rolled. It also seems that a relatively small number of schools may be responsible for this sharp rise in children leaving school for ‘home education’ in this way,” Longfield said.“We need to know who these children are, where they are, whether they are safe and if they are getting the education they need to succeed in life. There is a clear case for the government to introduce a compulsory register for all home-educated children, without delay.”According to data gathered by the children’s commissioner’s office, 58,000 children were being home-educated last year – double the number recorded in 2013. But the precise figure is unknown because parents do not have to register home-educated children, meaning up to 80,000 children may have been home schooled.Longfield’s figures are similar to the estimate of 52,000 home-schooled children in 2017-18, in the annual report of the Office of the Schools Adjudicator. Shan Scott, the chief schools adjudicator, said councils reported parents being “coerced” by schools into home-educating their children, often before sitting GCSE exams.In a Channel 4 Dispatches documentary on Monday night, Longfield is shown visiting families in which children are being home-schooled, with the programme detailing the wide variety of circumstances under which it occurs.“Many parents who make a philosophical decision to home-educate provide their children with a high-quality education. But there are many other families who have ended up home-educating for other reasons, and are struggling to cope,” Longfield said.“Many of these children are very vulnerable, have special educational needs, or are unable to cope with a ‘one size fits all’ school system. Schools should be for all children, including those with complex needs and those who struggle academically.”Nearly all the local authorities surveyed said they did not have enough powers to ensure the safety of home-schooled children, and a large majority said they did not know the exact numbers in their area.The report suggests “off-rolling” – excluding a pupil without going through formal proceedings, often for academic reasons – has played a significant part.An increase in formal exclusions may also be contributing: Department for Education figures show there were more than 40 permanent exclusions a day in 2016-17, a total of 7,700, compared with just over 35 a day the previous year.Longfield’s call for greater oversight was backed by the Local Government Association, saying it was needed for the minority of cases where children were being taught in dangerous or unsuitable conditions.“Placing a legal duty on parents to register home-schooled children with their local authority would also help councils to monitor how children are being educated and prevent them from disappearing from the oversight of services designed to keep them safe,” said Anntoinette Bramble, the chair of the LGA’s children and young people board."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb0e09d0825aa55d8319e6a51edbd9a34a6644f6/0_454_4195_2518/master/4195.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ad06cfac2a76240313dfa65aeaac8196","title":"belgian kids march against climate change why dont ours ask dutch","story":"Some put lack of action down to fundamental differences between the two countriesIt started with a solo protest outside Sweden’s parliament by 16-year-old Greta Thunberg and has snowballed across the globe.Schoolchildren demanding action on climate change have played truant and taken to the streets in Australia, Finland, Germany, Ireland, Switzerland and, in their greatest numbers, in Belgium, where 35,000 made their voices heard in Brussels a week ago and a further 12,500 marched on Thursday.But in the Netherlands, where half the country is below sea level and awareness of global warming is high, there have been no such demonstrations. And for the first march, planned for Thursday in The Hague, organisers say they hope for a rather modest turnout of about 3,000.“The commitment of Belgian youth seems to be greater than that of Dutch young people,” said the Dutch newspaper Trouw on Friday. “Why?”Certainly the attitude of the Dutch government has not been particularly welcoming of the truancy movement. The country’s education minister, Arie Slob, while welcoming the enthusiasm for saving the world, suggested those who wished to make their point should do so on the weekend.“Education is education and we are not going to give way to truancy,” he told the current affairs show Nieuwsuur this week. Fearing the prospect of mass truancy, some schools have also taken a hard line. Heleen Klootwijk at Herbert Vissers College in Nieuw-Vennep spoke for many by warning that students who went to The Hague demonstration next Thursday would be listed as truanting “with accompanying consequences”.But while encouraging students to make their voices heard, the Dutch MEP Sophia in ‘t Veld suggested there may be a cultural reason for Dutch teenagers’ apparent reticence. In report after report, the Netherlands tops OECD countries for high life satisfaction among its young people, partly because they already have the ear of their elders.“It’s a different tradition, I suppose,” In ‘t Veld said. “It doesn’t always work but there is a relationship between the government and the social partners. The government could reform the pensions today from above but they won’t. They will talk with the stakeholders. The children live with that different experience. In Belgium and France it is more top down – and people turn to the streets.”The difference in approach has certainly been notable in the attitudes of some senior politicians in Flanders, where the Youth for Climate movement first emerged in Belgium.Bart De Wever, the chairman of the Flemish nationalist party the New Flemish Alliance, which was until recently in government as part of a coalition, urged the young protesters “not to believe in the apocalypse” but to go back to their books and have “confidence in the future and in the power of innovation”. “We will not solve anything with green taxes and making people feel guilty,” he said.His colleague, the former secretary of state for migration Theo Francken, tweeted: “Dad, where’s my cell phone? Gone! When are we going to ski? Never again. Where will we go this summer? Home. Is the power on? … Put on sweater. Are you taking me to football? Pack your bike. Dad, why are you doing this? Sorry kid, you convinced me that it should be different.”But this week the Belgian students launched an online platform to collect ideas for tackling global warming, and they say they will keep on skipping school until their message is heard."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/031079c32ab0548656496a7cb65037c19723ab28/502_108_3158_1896/master/3158.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=349101966560281ca2411ef639af24d2","title":"black sheep guardian film nominated for best short documentary oscar","story":"Ed Perkins’ film about a young black boy’s response to a racist gang after he moves out of London is up for an Academy awardBlack Sheep, a film commissioned by the , has been nominated for best short documentary at the 2019 Oscars.Directed by Ed Perkins, Black Sheep tells the story of Cornelius Walker, a black 11-year-old from London who moves with his family to a housing estate in Essex after the murder of schoolboy Damilola Taylor in 2000. Walker, the same age as Taylor and of similar background, found himself confronting a gang of local racists and, after first fighting back, went to extraordinary lengths to fit in and gain their friendship.The film features interviews with Walker looking back 15 years on from the events he describes, which are re-enacted in the locations where they took place, with Kai Francis Lewis playing Walker.Responding to the nomination, Walker said that he was, “humbled and proud. I worked on this film to tell my story and hoped that it would resonate with people. To be nominated for this award is the highest recognition.”The film was produced by Simon Chinn and Jonathan Chinn of Lightbox (collaborator on the Whitney Houston documentary Whitney).

More than 40 years too late, in fact. Yet I have always found it peculiar, to say the least, that when Billy Bremner had his punch-up with Kevin Keegan in the 1974 Charity Shield, the Football Association thought it perfectly normal to ask Sir Matt Busby, legend of Manchester United, to be part of its three-man disciplinary panel.Unless, of course, you could imagine the modern-day equivalent and Sir Alex Ferguson being invited to pass judgment when, say, the football authorities get round to deciding what punishment, if any, Leeds should face for the spying missions launched by Marcelo Bielsa’s operatives on opposition training grounds this season.Over time, you come to realise that a lot of football people have stories about wanting to make a quick exit from Elland Road. Keegan’s goes back to Norman Hunter’s testimonial, when he accepted an invitation to turn out for a Don Revie XI. This was the same season that Keegan and Bremner had traded punches at Wembley and his welcome to Leeds came in the form of Hunter harpooning him with an early challenge.Hunter did at least apologise when Keegan asked whether it was acceptable to crock someone that way in a benefit match. He was even decent enough to pick Keegan off the floor. The next time Hunter poleaxed his opponent, he looked down and smiled again. “You don’t think I’m going to change for a testimonial, do you?” he asked. After the game, Hunter gave Keegan a clock to thank him for his contribution and the Liverpool player limped away to count his bruises, as he often did after games against Leeds.That, in a nutshell, probably encapsulates what a lot of people think about the team who were battling against Norwich on Saturday to see who would finish the weekend at the top of the Championship: dirty Leeds, cynical and hard‑faced, storing up their grudges, permanently aggrieved that they did not think of the “No one likes us” chant before Millwall. The team that should have chucked away their medals, according to Brian Clough, because they won them all by cheating, “the Nazis in Umbro”, as the broadcaster and author Stuart Maconie once wrote. “Daleks dressed in Gola, a crack squad of inhuman automata with one purpose in mind, the ruthless subjugation of other life forms … a team of 11 JR Ewings, duplicitous, untrustworthy, conniving and, as in when they taunted a beaten Southampton with those 32 passes on Match of the Day, heartlessly smug.” Maconie, to clarify, was an avid Leeds fan.Even when Leeds played football that warranted praise and popularity, most notably in the years of Peter Ridsdale’s overspending, they managed to find a way to make it difficult for outsiders to embrace them properly. Just think back to the time David O’Leary’s team played Valencia in the 2001 Champions League semi-final and someone clearly decided it would be a good idea for all the players to shave their heads, prison-style, for the first leg in Spain. “Leeds reminded me of the poor Englishmen who invented football 15 centuries ago when they cut off a Viking’s head, put it in a bag and started to kick it around,” Julián Ruíz, Marca’s correspondent, paid tribute. Though a personal favourite was the letter to the Daily Mail after the criminal trial involving two of the club’s players later that year. “Leeds footballers wearing gloves isn’t a fashion statement,” it read. “It’s so they don’t leave any fingerprints.”Unfortunately for Leeds, the boy of nine or 10 who cried on television when the chilly fingers of relegation closed round the club’s neck in 2004 might be drawing his pension by the time that perception ever changes. In football, it has always been easier to get a bad name than to lose one. The die is set now for Leeds. It goes back five decades and that was a belter of a line when the club apologised for all that unfortunate business outside Derby County’s training ground recently. The club, a statement read, intended to remind Bielsa of “the integrity and honesty which are the foundations that Leeds United is built on”. Which was an unexpected twist of humour, intentional or not.At the same time, I have to confess that I would like to see Leeds recover from Saturday’s 3-1 defeat to return to the Premier League next season. Bielsa has created one of the more watchable sides in the country, albeit one that will be feeling badly demoralised today, and who could possibly argue that a club their size would not be a better fit in the top ision? Or that it would not be fascinating to see whether their Argentinian manager can flourish at the higher level?That is written with the understanding that many people will be hoping for some sort of karmic comeuppance when the club in question often leave the impression they take some form of pleasure from being the bad guys in this pantomime (hence the “Dirty Leeds” scarves on sale outside Elland Road). And, yes, it is certainly true that, as a club, they do not help themselves sometimes, as we have seen lately.For more evidence, just consider some of the more wretched content from the Massimo Cellino era. Or the recent revelation that when Dennis Wise was managing the club, with Ken Bates as chairman, they offered a youth-team player professional terms even though, privately, they knew the boy was nowhere near good enough to make the grade. The method to the madness, according to Wise, being that the teenager’s father had offered to sponsor the club in return for them going through with this pretence. Even ignoring, for one moment, the spying controversy, there are plenty of stains in the Leeds back catalogue that will be hard to wash out.Even so, there is also plenty to admire about this stout old club, the history that is attached to that greying stadium beside the M621 and the way, despite everything, they have retained a tremendous backing during their 15 years outside the top ision, always guaranteed to fill your away end. The average crowd at Leeds this season is higher than those of Leicester, Cardiff, Wolves, Brighton, Southampton, Crystal Palace, Fulham, Huddersfield, Burnley, Watford and Bournemouth more than half the Premier League.Even during their years in League One, Leeds were regularly getting bigger crowds than half a dozen top-ision clubs. As for “Dirty Leeds”, I tend to agree with Howard Wilkinson, one of Bielsa’s predecessors, when he called it a “tired cliche” – and that was in 1991.Mud sticks, of course, and it would be a lot easier to make this argument before all the spying lark came out (I mean, of all the clubs in the world, it just had to be Leeds, didn’t it?) and if they had not just lost their place at the top of the table. But the point remains that there are plenty of other adjectives – stylish, vibrant, exciting – that could be applied to the modern team during long parts of the current season.As a club, they might still have a few behavioural flaws. They still possess a difficult streak, they still have a tendency to stick their middle finger up at the rest of football and it is all a bit baffling why their supporters persist on singing about being champions of Europe. But nobody could ever accuse Leeds United of not being interesting and, if they do manage to go up, the Premier League will be better for it.John Cooper-Clarke, AKA the Bard of Salford, has a poem in his collection that is dedicated to the town of Oldham and introduced during his live appearances by a rather entertaining preamble in which he notes how, according to his information, this satellite town to the east of Manchester isn’t officially twinned with anywhere but has a suicide pact with Gdansk.Interestingly, he also confesses that he has never been there because, where he was from, Oldham was in the wrong direction to everywhere. But he is clearly intrigued by what he has heard and finds himself wondering whether the town has a motto. “Reversing into the future together,” being his suggestion.Maybe not the town, but that would certainly work for the football club, currently 15th in League Two, and living on the memories of happier times judging by the discovery, on my last visit to Boundary Park, of a note on the dressing-room door prohibiting the players from swapping shirts with opponents “due to a severe shortage” of first‑team kit.Since then, there has been a takeover by Abdallah Lemsagam, a former agent, but the reports have not been hugely encouraging, including tales of wages not being paid, all sorts of fallings-out behind the scenes and the story of Frankie Bunn, a club legend, being sacked as manager on Boxing Day via an email. If, as expected, Paul Scholes is to replace Bunn – with José Mourinho no doubt taking a keen interest in how one of his more outspoken television critics does in the dugout – nobody could ever accuse him of taking the easy route into management.It is fair to say that events at Notts County escalated far more quickly than I had anticipated when I wrote about their ownership under Alan Hardy for last week’s column and some of the reasons why they had been marooned at the foot of League Two, in grave danger of losing their title as the oldest club in the Football League.Presumably you might be aware why Hardy issued an apology later that day, then hastily announced he was putting the club up for sale and closing down his Twitter account in a sequence of events that also saw him making his debut in a David Squires cartoon for the .Hardy has had a difficult week, to say the least, and it remains to be seen what his departure will mean for the kids’ zone at Meadow Lane, where the club’s youngest fans are invited to measure themselves against wall diagrams of popular children’s characters: Pikachu (1ft 4in) Yoda (2ft 2in), Elsa (5ft 4in) and, rather unexpectedly, “Big Alan” himself, giving his height at a very precise 6ft 4.5 inches. That extra half an inch, always worth counting.In the meantime, at least there now appears to be a thaw in relations with Nottingham Forest, leading to the Championship club loaning their neighbours a young striker by the name of Virgil Gomis to try to help them clamber out of trouble.

This has become a great deal more than just a straight dash to the line, broadening out into a piece of theatre that touches on managerial legacy, red-shirted will to power and elements of tactical compromise in a Manchester City team that appeared close to unstoppable a couple of months ago.On Tuesday, City turned up at St James’ Park and performed like a group of movie-set stunt doubles running through some Manchester City-style motions for lighting and camera angles as a prelude to an actual Manchester City Premier League performance.That limp 2-1 defeat was followed by Liverpool’s fretful point at home to Leicester on Wednesday, a game the league leaders might easily have won, but also saw the team’s muscular defensive heart in uncharacteristically brittle mood.With their lead extended to five points Liverpool would probably have to lose at least twice between now and mid-May to miss out on the title. Their outstanding recent record against the league’s mid-table filler suggests this is a distant prospect. The draw with Leicester was the first time Liverpool have dropped points against a team outside the top six since April.These are interesting times, though. The shift in early January into late midwinter has become a kind of ision bell for the title race in recent seasons. It has been five years now since the last real umbrella-gnawing, down-to-the-wire finish. Since then, the decisive kick away from the pack has tended to arrive a little earlier, as fixtures pile up, injuries begin to bite or heal, and the midwinter-slog works its way into the bones.This time last year Manchester United lost to Tottenham and Newcastle as January melted into February, while ahead of them City won five out of six and turned what was already a title procession into a hand-waving title trot-past in full ceremonial gold-leaf carriage.The year before Tottenham dropped seven points while Chelsea just kept on storming on through as January melted into February. The season before that it was around the same time that Leicester began to find an unanswerable rhythm. With this in mind we are now entering what could be a key 10 days. Starting with Arsenal at homeon Sunday, Manchester City have three tough-to-middling league games in a week, with Everton away on Wednesday, and Chelsea’s mannered and fretful Sarriball all-sorts at home next Sunday.Over the same period Liverpool play twice: West Ham away on Monday night, and then Bournemouth at home on Saturday. After which they have a two-week break in the league before trips to Old Trafford and Goodison at the start of March. Drop points now and those two fixtures start to look ominous, both of them against opponents who will be focused with a murderous eye on ripping a hole in that red-shirted pre-title triumphalism.Perhaps with this in mind Pep Guardiola, so used to storming away as a title frontrunner, has even made his first few rather gauche attempts at a little cross-Lancashire mental disintegration. “All the teams who want to win the title have to feel the pressure, but you have to handle it,” Guardiola hammed in his Tuesday press conference. “I don’t know what they will think. I’m not in the locker room.”While it seems unlikely Jürgen Klopp will find himself reduced to a state of quivering, tear-snorting Kevin Keegan-style meltdown at the force of these gentle little snipes, the timing of it is at least spot-on. For the teams at the top, this is the winter red zone. Best of all, this is a title two-hander that will come down to more than simply injury lists, luck and the form of key players. At stake for Guardiola and Klopp is something more, a systems-clash, a battle between pragmatism and perfectionism.If Liverpool have an advantage this season it is that Klopp has been able to change his team’s rhythms, to play another way, to find other gears below the most extreme expression of his own gegenpressing, high-velocity attacking style.Through the first half of the season Liverpool found a low‑corrosion way to win. The formula was clear. With the defence strengthened Liverpool knew they would rarely concede. At the other end the movement and craft of Mohamed Salah is usually too much for most defences.From week to week, and the odd blip aside – we remember Klopp sprinting across the pitch at home to Everton like a man being chased by rabid huskies – they won with strength in reserve.What is fascinating is the way the past few weeks, as muscles have tightened, have seen a return to the Liverpool of last season, or at least to a less controlled style. Every goal since Boxing Day has come from the front three. Clean sheets and controlled 1-0s have been replaced by a slightly wilder approach to winning. This is a team fighting not just its rivals at the top of the league but a weight of history, a shared emotional longing.The battle for Liverpool from here might be to drop the throttle a little, to get back as far as possible to the calm, methodical pragmatism of the first half of the season even through the chills of a title-chasing February.Whereas for City and Guardiola it is the refusal to change, the insistence on simply playing the same way, running though the same distinct registers that has made their title chase so engrossing. Guardiola teams don’t drop the throttle, don’t win in other ways. They improve by becoming more themselves, become more efficient and nuanced. Even in defeat, as at Newcastle, it is that same recognisable Pep-ball.Hence this strange current run, whereby either the system clicks, the parts fall into place and City swipe opponents aside or those rhythms can be disrupted, leaving the parts of the machine still running through the same patterns like a broken circuit board.There are some who might say Pep hasn’t managed 99 Premier League games as City manager, but has instead managed the same game 99 times. This is both incorrect and beside the point. City have more ways of playing than simply classic short passing Pep‑ball, as did Barcelona and Bayern Munich before them. But there is something to be said for winning if not ugly, then without being forced to reach the higher registers, as Liverpool have done this season.Guardiola’s ability to make his own very distinct kind of systems‑football work even in the mud and blood of a race to the line in Europe’s noisiest league will be key to what happens from here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/05ea1ecc39a7910c0f92bb350640f3c2ac36b3bc/0_63_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7dfe7648d7e1b0dbeb61b9137ff68f0b","title":"leicester city v manchester united premier league live","story":"Fancy a rollicking pre-match read?

Here, she describes the tough and often hilarious journey that set her ‘glam and gorj’ inner a freeI was never not a drag queen. I shan’t invoke the passé gay idea that I emerged dancing, in patent stilettos and glistening sequins, straight from my mum’s vagina (love you Mum!) and on to the stage. Why? Well, first, because I was born via C-section. And second, a queer life can’t be narrated by a catch-all idea. To file it neatly under “gay and fabulous” erases the daunting task of getting from A to She, and all the ups, downs, tucks and sucks it takes to be able to stand tall in front of people, while you lift the often crushing weight of transgression, and the aggression that comes with it, up on to your padded shoulders.I did all the comings-out society requires of people like me: at the age of five, I acquired my first dress and was discovered lip-syncing to Celine Dion. At the age of 13, I came out as gay to an unprepared family while wearing a fluffy dressing gown, clutching a mug that read “I love shoes.” In 2009, at the age of 19, I stepped out in full drag for the first time. When I was 21, my family attended their first ever drag show – starring me. At the age of 25, I was violently attacked outside my home in east London, something that I’m still coming back from. And at the age of 26, I came out as non-binary.These comings-out might appear to be the defining moments in my journey to becoming a drag queen or, perhaps more appropriately, to becoming the most real version of me. Yet, throughout all this, I was never not a drag queen. I was always inexplicably performative, lewd, flamboyant, feminine. There’s a photograph of me at school, aged five, in a black sequined dress and pearl earrings, holding court in front of an adoring crowd (of classmates most probably still in nappies).Growing up in Lancaster, flanked by farmland, I was engrossed by the trappings and signifiers of femininity and femaleness, by any crumb of glamour I could get my hands on. I was deeply in love with my mum and my grandma, fascinated both by their appearances and their heady mix of northern savageness and warmth. And I was enchanted by the ways of the women in my quintessentially northern home town, who remain some of the most gender non-conforming people I’ve ever encountered.There was the dinner lady who had her eye removed and was, no joke, back behind the food counter the very next day. Though she’ll never know it, it was she who first taught me how to hold a room, as I studied her ability to inhabit each character while recounting gossip with the precision of a professional, while sheeny purplish lipstick ran through the cracks around her mouth, engraved there after years of pulling at cigarettes and cross-examining a day’s hearsay. That kind of brilliance makes masculinity look so wonderfully pitiful. And I lived for it.While the women of Lancaster were magnificent and were often my only protectors, from primary school onwards, I was derided painfully for my likeness to them, to these women I tried so desperately to mimic. And from the age of nine, I was flooded with confusion. To me, I was these women. They were my idols, and yet…There was my body. My male body, which in my teens grew and grew as I ate and ate anything I could get my hands on. Any food, all food, any men, all men, all in order to fill a hole inside myself which, if left empty, would be flooded with terror and fear and self-loathing. The shame of my apparent moral transgression put me on a destructive path of obsessive over-achieving and self-medication, both mechanisms employed in an attempt to drown out the piercing noise of being told that my very existence was wrong. Coming out as gay didn’t help. It merely confirmed everyone’s suspicions, stocking the arsenal of my detractors with ever more deadly weaponry.But I was still a drag queen. Now, though, I hid behind closed doors, tucked my maleness between my legs, and performed to a fragile shrine of icons – Madonna, Celine, Tina – that I’d built inside my wardrobe. After a day of dodged rocks, hocked-up phlegm and fag ash dropped in my hair on the 555 bus, I would come home, night on night, and perform the most affirming of survival rituals. I would gather up the scattered pieces of me and paint them with makeup I’d shoplifted, or swiped from my sister’s room. And while in public I was an insecure, bitchy gay 14-year-old, in private I was an all-powerful a.As I hurtled through teenagerdom and into young adulthood, via comical sexual experiences that saw me drinking out of toilets (never again) and being asked to dress up as Snow White by a married man with young children, I continued to practise my nightly ritual, compelled by need, not necessarily by want. All I really wanted was to be normal. But, with the imperceptible, incremental shifts brought about by my nightly a worship, normal stopped being an option. At 17, I dredged up the courage to sing an Amy Winehouse solo at a school talent show, dancing on stage in all my femme glory. And (obviously, LOL) I won.Here was a taste of being adored for who I was. And like any born queen, I was hooked. So I began to repurpose my fat tummy as curves, to cherish my high, stereotypically gay voice as something of wonder, difference and beauty. I wasn’t like the other boys and as I grew up, and left Lancaster, I was thrilled that this was so.At university I slowly started to bring Crystal out, and after being spotted at a club in a stinking fake mink coat and plastic hair extensions, I was invited to audition for a drag troupe called Denim. I got the part! Rapidly, the wonder of being in (bad) drag, of finally feeling celebrated for a part of me that had incurred so much bullying, outshone my rather conventional dreams of graduating with a veterinary medicine degree. My parents were furious. To them, I’d chosen heels over financial stability. To me, I’d chosen profound happiness over mere survival. I’d chosen honesty, with myself and with those who would listen – and there is no better antidote to all that shame.Together, as Denim, we attracted hundreds of people who would come, even if just for a night, and mess with their genders alongside us. Boys, girls, theys and thems, and anything else imaginable. As Denim we played Glastonbury, we sang with Florence Welch, we transferred money into each other’s accounts, and shared makeup and meatball wraps from Pret when the going got extra tough. Like a family, we were each other’s mothers, sisters, bankers, brothers, drunken aunties and personal assistants.It was this new queer family that showed me not only how sublime and powerful drag could be, but how sublime and powerful I was. I hadn’t realised until I met a clan of people like me that there, behind my bedroom door in Lancaster, I had been performing the Japanese art of kintsugi, where you heal the cracks in broken pottery using lacquer dusted with gold, silver or platinum. What was cracked by others, I put together and sealed with sequins, lipstick and feathers. Once my queer siblings had brought her to life – like a glamorous, incisive, glistening Frankenstein’s monster – I carried Crystal into my everywhere.And in embracing her, I couldn’t not shift my perspective – from a belief that I was in the wrong to a conviction of the wrongness in the structures around me, structures that cause so much hurt. This insight is the most precious gift that being a drag queen, and a queer, has given me.In 2013, after university, on a floundering overdraft, I moved to New York – in search of Big Things, namely a deeply crap job in fashion production. I quit drag, deciding it had been fun at university, but was untenable in the “real world”. But after three months there, I had little to show for myself. All I’d achieved was a stunning city-wide ban from Union Market after I’d been caught stealing a wheel of brie and an orange because I was so broke, and a deep, bleak sense of loneliness. It sounds so glam and gorj in hindsight.Then the penny dropped on penniless me, and I realised that the Big Things I sought were already found – in the family I’d nurtured at university, this group of people who didn’t need the real world, because we’d formulated our own. Once I arrived back in London, after I managed to charm my way on to a free flight home from JFK, Crystal pulled me on to a path towards a career in drag: one of late nights, precarious pay cheques, cracked nail beds and back problems from too many hours limping around festival fields in heels. My parents came round, they always do. At my first show in London they surprised me with their attendance, and I dedicated my song – Euphoria – to them. My mother often says I’ve led them on a merry dance, a dance that continues to play on. Two years ago over breakfast the day after a show, I told them I was non-binary, and asked them to use a “they” pronoun for me. Still, my parents bundle me back to the binary every now and again, but I simply remind them, they apologise, and we move on. Much like my other comings-out, it takes time to adjust. But now they know it’s not a phase, frippery, a millennial fad. It’s about respect. And after much trial and error, we carry endless respect for one another, and insurmountable love.Recently I took public transport wearing drag for the first time since I was homophobically attacked on my doorstep in full face. And out there it still feels like a battlefield. Yes, visibility grows – I mean look: she’s in the Observer! – but with it comes more vitriol and abuse. And there on the train, strangers’ eyes still pierced, men (of the kind I’m so gleeful not to be), still laughed, school kids still took pictures without asking. What’s normal for them was never going to be my normal.And thank goddess. Because now, when I kick all of these things into gear – and become Crystal – she feels like power. This is a power that so many seek to deny me, deny women, deny femmes, deny non-binary people. And now, the difference between this girl on the train and that girl on the 555 bus back in Lancaster, is that I am aware of my power and how it intimidates, and that feels glorious. My hair is also way better.Crystal is the thing I’m second most grateful for, though I despise the gruesomely millennial idea of gratitude journalling. Truly I am most grateful for the people who brought her to life: our forebears, our chosen and, if we’re lucky, our biological families, our community, those among us who work their acryliced fingernails to the stub to create space for our power to proliferate.People often think drag queens are stupid or self-involved or exploitative of femininity, but those of us who are gender non-conforming are the diametric opposite of this. Through our need to be who we are, we become vectors for change, for exploring potential, for demonstrating just how full of colour, and questions, and limitlessness this dangerously dull world can be.I was never not a drag queen, but she grows as I grow. The source of my greatest pain is now the source of my greatest joy. Because being a drag queen is not a final destination, a choice, or a coming-out. It’s a long and often painful dirt track, but tripping down it in 5in heels with a bunch of queers on each arm is, trust me hun, the best way to do it.Diary of a Drag Queen is published by Ebury at £14.99 on 7 February.

Amy Romer’s book The Dark Figure* reveals the terrifying ordinariness of the sites of their captivityIn 2013, a 22-year-old Hungarian woman responded to an online ad for a babysitting job in London and, after a telephone interview, was offered the post. When she arrived in Budapest to travel to London, she was met by three men who confiscated her mobile, drove her to Slovakia and forced her on to a coach bound for Manchester.There was no babysitting job. Instead, the woman had been “bought” for £3,500 by a Pakistani man and was told to prepare for marriage. After being held captive at various Manchester addresses, she finally alerted the police from a house in Cunliffe Street, Chorley, where she was rescued and later repatriated home.There is nothing to indicate “slavery next door” about Cunliffe Street, a nondescript terrace of brick houses. And that’s exactly what Amy Romer, a 30-year-old photographer originally from Exeter, set out to show in her book The Dark Figure*, which juxtaposes images of seemingly innocuous, everyday British locations – country lane, suburban cul-de-sac, muddy farm – with descriptions of the crimes of modern-day slavery that have taken place there. The result is a quietly powerful challenge to how we identify slavery as a society – do we still only envision shackles and transatlantic ships? – and an uncomfortable reminder of how little we know about what is happening behind our neighbours’ closed doors.For the series, Romer trawled news and police reports for modern slavery crimes, and travelled around the UK to take pictures. The book includes accounts of women forced into prostitution Vietnamese men trafficked to work on cannabis farms vulnerable people rounded up and imprisoned in filthy caravans. We see the image and the words, but the brain struggles to match the ordinariness of the landscape with the horror of the account. (Romer says Chloe Dewe Mathews’s stark portraits of the locations where soldiers were executed for cowardice in the first world war were an inspiration.)Even without the captions, Romer’s photographs evoke a haunting stillness. Some of the landscapes include main thoroughfares and popular byways, but nearly all the images are void of people in every shot, it feels as if we are peering into a ghost town, waiting for the protagonists – or the action – to arrive.Though the term “slavery next door” may sound exaggerated, one of the Plymouth addresses Romer photographed happened to be just one street over from a flat she lived in and in the book’s foreword, Lancashire-born social justice educator Pete Brook writes that the Chorley house to which the Hungarian woman was trafficked was “adjacent to cafes in which I’ve sat and pubs in which I’ve drunk”.“It really homes in on the idea that slavery is happening on our doorstep,” says Romer.The Dark Figure* began as Romer’s third-year project at university but today the Home Office, local councils and British police use it as a training resource to help identify and raise awareness about modern-day slavery in its various forms. “The police actually uploaded a few of my photos on all their screen savers,” says Romer, “so whenever they log into their computers, they see my images. It’s kind of crazy but really cool.”The Dark Figure* by Amy Romer is published later this month by Another Place, £16November 2013politan police from the Human Trafficking Unit arrested 73-year-old Aravindan Balakrishnan and his wife, 67-year-old Chanda Pattni, at their residential address in Brixton. They were investigated for slavery and domestic servitude.Three women had escaped from the same property a month earlier, having been held against their will for more than 30 years. Aishah Wahab, a 69-year-old Malaysian woman, and Josephine Herivel, a 57-year-old Irishwoman, met Balakrishnan, known as Comrade Bala, in London through a shared political ideology. He was the former Maoist leader of the Workers’ Institute of Marxism–Leninism–Mao Zedong Thought. Rosie Davies, a 30-year-old British woman, had spent her whole life in servitude under Balakrishnan.The women were not physically restrained, but held by subjection to brainwashing, emotional abuse and physical abuse. Police were tipped off from a charity supporting victims of forced marriage, after receiving a phone call from the women, who had been watching the ITV documentary Forced to Marry.December 2015Balakrishnan was convicted of child cruelty, false imprisonment, four counts of rape, six counts of indecent assault and two counts of assault. Chanda Pattni, had been released without charge in 2014.Balakrishnan was sentenced to 23 years in prison in January 2016.May 2008The discovery of the remains of a body in a garden shed near Bamfurlong Lane triggered a year-long investigation, including a five-month surveillance operation in 2010 of the Connors family’s traveller sites.The body was identified as that of Christopher Nicholls, who had been working for the Connors for three years and had been reported missing by his parents in 2005. He had been struck by a car in 2004.March 2011Gloucestershire Police carried out warrants at three properties in Gloucestershire, Derbyshire and Leicestershire. Nineteen vulnerable people were found living in squalid conditions at Beggers Roost caravan park in Cheltenham, subject to assault, theft of benefits and exploitation.Survivor Mark Ovenden reported that he was heading to his local soup kitchen in Bournemouth when a white van pulled over ahead of him. The driver approached him and offered him a job near Leighton Buzzard in Bedfordshire. He was taken to Beggers Roost and subjected to modern slavery for the following two years.Some of the rescued men had been kept at the Connors property for as long as 30 years and, having been institutionalised, did not recognise themselves as victims.Five members of the Connors family were charged with offences involving the serious mistreatment of people who, because of their personal circumstances, had little option but to remain with the family. All five were found guilty of conspiracy to require a person to perform forced or compulsory labour between April 2010 and March 2011 and are facing a maximum sentence of 14 years.November 2014Police arrested 53-year-old Jurate Grigelyte at her property in Easton, Bristol, after a school raised concerns about the welfare of a six-year-old boy, who was discovered to be the son of a victim of human trafficking and forced labour, working under Grigelyte.Grigelyte trafficked Lithuanian nationals to the UK with the promise of good employment and accommodation, but instead would lock victims inside cramped, squalid properties, only allowing them to enter and leave through a window.The victims, many of whom spoke little to no English, worked for Grigelyte’s charity bag business collecting donations and sorting through clothing. They were transported around the south-west in vans with no seats or windows. A typical working day lasted from 5am to 6pm. Grigelyte promised workers £25 per day, but would deduct money for rent, travel and various fines, often leaving workers debt-bonded, with no money for food.Debt bondage is the world’s most widespread form of slavery. A person becomes a bonded labourer when their labour is demanded as a means of repayment for a loan. The victim is then tricked or trapped into working for very little or no pay, to repay debts their employer says they owe. Often, the victim’s identification is taken and bank cards are controlled, limiting any hope of freedom.June 2015Grigelyte was sentenced to three years in prison after admitting to 10 charges of facilitating entry into the UK with a view to exploiting labour, 10 charges of human trafficking and one count of forced labour.February 2016A gang of three brothers, their uncle and two women were found guilty of 55 serious offences, some of which had lain undetected for almost 20 years. Fifteen vulnerable girls, one as young as 11, were subjected to acts of sexual violence between 1987 and 2003 including rape, forced prostitution, indecent assault and false imprisonment.Karen MacGregor was sentenced to 13 years for conspiracy to procure a child for prostitution, false imprisonment, and conspiracy to rape. MacGregor was a high-profile campaigner on behalf of abused children. In 2013, she founded KinKids, a community support group for kinship carers. MacGregor boasted that KinKids had helped families affected by the scandal. She had persuaded Rotherham council, local Labour MP John Healey and other local organisations to support KinKids in the wake of heightened investigation into cases of child abuse in Rotherham.She had been luring vulnerable girls to her home in Walker Street, which was described by one of the victims as akin to the Hansel and Gretel fairytale. There, she would groom them before pimping them out to earn their keep.One of her victims described how MacGregor was a motherly figure, who had taken her under her wing at a difficult time in her life and treated her like a daughter. Another victim recalled how within days of arriving, MacGregor had plied her with vodka to the point of unconsciousness and she had woken up to find herself being sexually assaulted.Since 2016, 33 men and one woman in this case have been imprisoned for rape, false imprisonment, sexual intercourse with a girl under 13, and indecent assault, for a total of 445 years and three months.2017The conduct of more than 60 officers from South Yorkshire police who had dealt with the victims across the 20-year period is now under investigation. It is the largest Independent Police Complaints Commission inquiry since the 1989 Hillsborough football disaster.An inspection of Rotherham council found it was “not fit for purpose” after an independent inquiry into its handling of child sexual exploitation reports since 1997. The inquiry identified a culture of “bullying, sexism ... and misplaced ‘political correctness’”, along with a history of covering up information and silencing whistleblowers. The leader of the council, Paul Lakin, resigned, and the government replaced its elected officers with a team of five commissioners, including one tasked specifically with looking at children’s services.July 2013The authorities were alerted when a 20-year-old male trafficking victim contacted a charity, revealing he had been the victim of offences committed in 2011. More victims soon came forward, and others were identified. Convictions were made against Hungarian traffickers Janos Orsos and Ferenc Illes, who had been providing workers to Kozee Sleep, a bed factory that supplied retailers including John Lewis, Dunelm and Next.Company owner Mohammed Rafiq and two of his employees were charged with conspiracy to facilitate travel within the UK for exploitation. Rafiq was the first owner of a UK company to be charged with human trafficking offences.Workers supplied to Kozee Sleep were forced to live with up to 42 men in a two-bedroom house on Batley Field Hill, and were found to be surviving on scraps of food. The men would work for up to 20 hours a day and were paid as little as £10 a week.May 2014Janos Orsos pleaded guilty to conspiracy to traffic a person into the UK for exploitation, blackmail and converting criminal property. He was sentenced to five years’ imprisonment. Ferenc Illes pleaded guilty to conspiracy to traffic a person within the UK for exploitation. He was sentenced to three years’ imprisonment.January 2016Mohammed Rafiq was found guilty of conspiracy to traffic and was sentenced to two years and three months in prison. He pleaded not guilty.2013A young Hungarian woman was captured and trafficked to the UK after responding to an advert for a babysitting job.

I calculated that figure – the size of approximately 30 bath towels, overlapping slightly – while reading the story on my phone while drinking tea while watching Grand Designs on my laptop.It was an episode set in Amersham in 1999, when Kevin McCloud still wore a fleece but also hair. “To what extent is this project… mad?” Kevin asks, within a minute of meeting a couple planning to design an “invisible” house that will blend in with the earth banks of the surrounding reservoirs. This couple who, in that way that people do in ancient footage from 1990s Britain, look both extremely old and also extremely untouched by the grinding horror of post-millennial life.Upon seeing a picture of the site, a 100ft water tower built by German prisoners of war in 1916, the wife tells Kevin that she said no way. Said it was too tall, too close to the road, but that her husband had breezily replied: “Well, we’re going to live here.” He is an architect, of course, with an idea to build an open-plan extension to the water tower, which promises to be uncompromisingly modern. At the sound of the word “uncompromising” I growled gleefully to an empty room, “Oh yes?” and put down my tea.Elsewhere, on a wintry day in November, a couple in complementary body warmers will gesture shyly at the sky as they prepare to build the home that will expose all their cracks. Rather than lying on a carpet, they will stand in a field with Kevin to consider the view of a mountain as dawn breaks, and the ethical implications of mud. They will design triple-height ceilings to honour the memory of a church that one half of the couple, let’s guess the husband, visited as a child. They will return often to a single word, “light” or “uncompromising” or “playful”, which will, four years later, realise itself as a children’s swing-set in the kitchen, or a sunken hole near the wood-burner for storing magazines – a nod, Kevin might explain, sensitively, to the wife’s previous career as a journalist.Grand Designs’ utter Britishness was clarified this week by the New Yorker explaining its appeal to Americans now watching on Netflix. “The show’s central theme,” the writer explained, “is man’s morbid need to erect a monument to himself” – which, wow, is not wrong. Elsewhere on Netflix a documentary about the fiasco of Fyre Festival had a similar theme. It reminded me of a fiasco unravelling closer to home – people having sold tickets to an island dream, with those who believed their promises of models and music or, say, blue passports, arriving on a completely different island to find disaster relief tents and a single slice of processed cheese. Anyway, as I scrolled through yet more news about how homes continue to define and defeat us (foreign investors took advantage of the Brexit-induced decline in the value of sterling to buy up three times as many £10m-plus luxury homes as before the referendum vote), the writer’s explanation of Grand Designs made me feel a little wobbly.Both Grand Designs, with its great British dream of building one’s own castle, and the shrinking of possibilities for people without the time or income to do so, coexist in our housing market. On one side, the psychedelic glamour of designing a different bathroom for every excretion and, on the other, living with black mould because if you tell your landlord he will put the rent up. The housing crisis, it’s emerging, as we move into its second decade, numbing ourselves at night with Kevin McCloud’s bitchy wisdom about dry-walling, is a mutable thing that expands in our hands like spray-foam insulation.One lesser discussed aspect is the distance it creates between those watching and those doing – those who are required to take what’s given to them, and those wild-eyed couples building barns out of glass.I saw Ronnie Spector perform last week, one of my absolute heroes. Her voice is unique - a cracked glass of milk - and it’s joyous to see her so strong now, after a life under Phil Spector, who kept her prisoner during their marriage.

Arrived in countries with a holdall and that’s it. Last year, at midnight, I booked a plane ticket for 7am that morning from London to Glasgow, packed a bag barely heavier than the quotidian, and off I went. I have gone to Morocco and Egypt in similar circumstances.Travelling is wonderful, but the downsides – with air travel in particular – are easy to acknowledge: the dragging of heavy suitcases (often with a wonky wheel or broken handle) the queueing the waiting around for luggage – and the potential for it to be lost the paying extra for, seemingly, everything. The poor sods rifling through their carefully folded underwear to find something of sufficient weight to remove, rather than pay an extortionate £40 surplus baggage fee.Smugness is not a quality to cultivate, but I can’t tell you that it isn’t immensely satisfying not to have to worry about all of the above when travelling light. It isn’t always possible, of course – work trips, longer holidays – but when it is, it’s perhaps the closest thing to feeling free. It’s a twist on that hole-in-a-sack riddle: what can you pack that will make your bag light? Nothing.My favourite lyrical paean to the practice is Jeffrey Lewis and Diane Cluck’s on their appropriately titled Travel Light: “When I was an astronaut I didn’t take my boots  When I was a record store I didn’t have the blues  I travel light and that’s the life for me.”I have travelled in the opposite situation, too. When I moved back to the UK after living in another country, a huge Klimt print I had bought in Moscow six months earlier had its own plane seat. (I didn’t buy it its own seat, but the stewards were keen on protecting it.) It hangs in my flat to this day, but it was incredibly stressful, moving with everything I owned.I often travel alone. It is good for the soul, and all I need then is: my passport a good book or three (paperback, obviously) a playlist relevant to where one is going (surely I cannot be the only nerd who does this?) a language app (if relevant) a rolling countryside view from a train window, or a pointillist expanse from a plane window and possibly, depending on mood, an incredibly interesting seat partner from whom one learns new things.Because how many pairs of jeans are you really going to wear? Why take weighty bottles of shampoo when every hotel, Airbnb, or couchsurfing host will have some? Not having much on the back means one’s plans can always change on a whim, too. And, in my opinion, plans are made for changing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c45e4ca2239c068dd7088f2924f981db671ab79c/0_298_2362_1417/master/2362.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9bb17e0ca8d070687a6bf663ccabf877","title":"ultimate guide stress at every age","story":"Every life stage brings its own pressures, from worrying about exams to juggling the needs of family. Here are the best coping tactics for each generationTriggers“Children are really the canaries in the mineshaft of human society. They are the iniduals within our cultures that are the most sensitive to the difficulties – and stresses – that societies experience,” Tom Boyce tells me. Professor of pediatrics and psychiatry at the University of California, he specialises in the treatment of three- to eight-year-olds. Major stressors in this age group include marital conflict, violence in the home, violence in the community, problems with parental mental health – a mum or dad who is depressed – maltreatment and disciplinary behaviours that become punitive.On top of all that, as Dominique Thompson, a former student health GP who treated clients aged 11 and up, points out: “School is a source of huge anxiety.” SATS ensure that academic pressure is felt even in primary school. “Children are naturally very wary of letting people down,” Thompson adds. Friendships, social media, and social situations are additional triggers, while teens especially struggle with identity. “The whole point of adolescence is to separate from their parents”, she says. “They are creating their new image, who they want to be, what they want to be known for. That in itself is a stressful process.”The signs“Some kids can say what is bothering them,” says Boyce, whose new book, The Orchid and the Dandelion, explores why some children struggle to survive while others thrive easily. More often, he says, parental detective work is required. There may be nightmares, night-waking, bed-wetting. Children may seek to avoid activities they would normally take pleasure in. Some may display obsessive behaviours, overuse social media, or become withdrawn.What helpsFor children who want to talk repeatedly about worries, set aside 15 minutes’ daily “worry time”. Establish that worries may be thoroughly discussed in worry time but not outside of it say, “let’s talk about that in worry time”. Thompson recommends Headspace’s kids app, which she uses with her nine-year-old. “He has two minutes’ mindfulness before bed,” she says.Deciding when to push a child and when to accede to their refusals is difficult, and can only “be based on intuition of your own infinite knowledge of your child”, Boyce says. Creativity helps. He mentions one mother of a young child who refused to get ready for school. She stuck fuzzy felt-type pieces for brushing teeth, putting on shoes, eating breakfast etc on a board and let her son choose which order to arrange these events in each day.Boyce’s key recommendations for children are: stick to routines and rituals. Engage in play. Show compassion, communicate that your love is unconditional. Honour the differences between children. All of this takes time but Boyce is fond of telling parents that there is no such thing as “quality time”. Just provide enough time of any kind together. Closeness and frank conversations can emerge out of this swathe of time, at unplanned moments such as during a journey to a football match or while doing another activity.For children who become avoidant, Thompson suggests this approach, influenced by cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT): “Don’t ridicule. Don’t catastrophise. Say, ‘What are you worried might happen? ... And what would happen then?... OK, we can deal with that. We’ve got plasters, a first aid kit …’” When stress and anxiety “interfere with normal life”, she says, that’s the time to see your GP.Triggers“Developmental tasks from late teens into early adulthood are about moving away from your family,” says Alex Fowke, a clinical psychologist. With independence comes the fear of rejection and humiliation. Relationships, or lack of them, cause immense stress, not least because these are busy years in terms of shaping identity. Greater fluidity around identity can bring its own challenges. Fowke mentions a former client who was fluid in gender and sexuality. “As much as they found themselves attracted to everyone, by fitting everywhere, you don’t fit anywhere,” he says. All this at a time when you might find yourself, as a student or in a first job, living away from home with strangers.Financial worries are common, although according to Thompson, who is a member of the Student Minds clinical advisory group, students tend to cite these less often than relationship and academic pressures. At exam time and during university, the atmosphere can foster a tendency towards perfectionism – the setting of impossible targets, often accompanied by self-beration, prevarication, and impostor syndrome.Social media exerts its own particular pressures and a habit of incessantly comparing with others — what Fowke describes as “compare and despair”. In addition, family stressors – orcing parents, for instance – are common. Thompson advises parents robustly to resist the temptation to look to their older children for support.The signsAt this age, stress can sometimes disguise itself in strong emotions. Thompson says that lots of young women present with tearfulness, and men with irritability and anger – punching walls or picking fights. Others may find that they are compulsively seeking reassurance. There can be a non-specific sense of dread in the back of the mind. Some may use alcohol or drugs or smart drugs to manage worries, especially those who are living away from home or in reach of a cheap student bar. “Focusing and attention become difficult,” Fowke adds, “and can result in what might look like a memory problem.” Many will choose to avoid any kind of social scenario. Some will lurk on social media in order to compare themselves with others.What helpsIf identity or legacy issues are causing stress, Fowke recommends doing some work on your values: ask yourself what you would like people to say about you at your leaving party. Retirement is a very long way off, but according to Fowke, legacy worries commonly present at this age, perhaps because the choices young people are asked to make can feel like committing to an entire career. Thinking about the bigger picture helps to adjust expectations. “Sometimes our task as iniduals is to reconcile the stuff we do for fun with the stuff that just needs to be done,” he says.For those about to embark on university life, Student Minds has free, downloadable resources. Student unions are a good starting point, while universities offer counselling and courses to tackle perfectionism, exam pressure, prevarication, and other mental health challenges ask if yours has signed up to a closed trial of Fika, an app designed to foster self-acceptance and coping skills. The website Kooth offers free online counselling, and a place to monitor your emotional wellbeing.TriggersThis is a time of huge life transition. “There is this pressure to make lifelong decisions at a really young age,” Fowke says. Social media permits endless comparisons, with others who have made the same or different decisions. “When we do social comparisons,” Fowke adds, “we typically come off worse.” Many in this age group will focus on how to have the perfect marriage and children while still making an impact at work. They might compare their lives to those of their parents at the same age. There may be a pressure to start a family. “One of the stressors tends to be: ‘I should have these things by now. I see my friends settling down. I’m not even dating anyone.’ There’s sometimes an unrealistic expectation that everything is possible,” Fowke says. For women in particular, children impact on career progression, which brings new worries.Those entering employment for the first time face a major adjustment perfectionists can suffer. “They find themselves in a situation where they are deskilled or incompetent, and it unsettles their sense of self,” explains Sally Brown, a coach and counsellor who says she sees many young, driven, outwardly successful people aged 18 to 30 who are struggling with debilitating levels of anxiety.The signs“Anxiety will leak out in whichever way that your inidual vulnerability will allow it,” says Brown. “I saw somebody recently who became very anxious about whether she had hit someone while driving. That is a form of OCD.” She also cites the compulsive overthinking of social situations. “Post-event analysis: coming home, rerunning conversations, feeling judged.”Some people find they lose the will to do tasks they were previously happy to do, from getting on the underground to speaking in meetings. They might become avoidant, while others exist in a “hypervigilant state, where you feel that something awful might happen. This sense of fear lurks around the edges. There can be a constant narrative of ‘Am I having a breakdown, will I be able to cope, will I have another panic attack?’” Brown adds.Self-criticism is “massive in this age group. Many clients “have installed an inner bully in their head, that berates them 247. We would not tolerate that kind of person in our life following us around saying that to us, but we do it to ourselves.”What helpsBrown advocates self-compassion. “It is not about letting yourself off the hook, it’s about self-acceptance.” To those who self-berate, she suggests an experiment. “For one week, treat yourself with the same kindness and acceptance that you would treat a good friend whom you love. That in itself can be transformative.” Sometimes it helps to label the self-berating voice. Brown talks about “putting the troll back in the box”.Listen carefully to your anxiety. Panic attacks are often “a sign that the brain needs to have opportunities throughout the day to come down to a state of calm,” Browns says. She recommends “a personal daily prescription for mental wellbeing”. Take five minutes with a cup of tea resist scrolling through your phone. “Check in with yourself,” she says. Ask yourself, “How do I feel, where’s my thinking going?” If your shoulders are up by your ears, let go of tension. Try 711 breathing – breathe in for a count of seven and out for 11: a longer out-breath regulates the level of carbon dioxide in the blood.Brown likes the 5-4-3-2-1 exercise as a way to ground yourself in the present: think of five things you can see, four things you can hear, three things you can feel, two you can smell and one you can taste. Try to resist the urge to check social media first thing in the morning. One early refusal can make a big difference to the day.Know your thinking patterns: catch yourself in the act of catastrophising or being a perfectionist, or inflexible, and name the behaviour to yourself. This helps to take anxiety out of the driving seat.Triggers“There’s real mental and physical load at this age,” says Louise Tyler, a counsellor based in Altrincham who works with many high-achieving professionals on building resilience. Financial concerns, ageing, a sense of mortality are all factors, along with what Tyler calls “an existential search for purpose. People start to become aware that life doesn’t go on for ever.” There are questions such as “Have I put enough money aside? How will I face retirement?” And all the while there’s “a need to feel constantly productive and efficient”, she says. Commonly known as the sandwich generation, many in this age group will care for both teenage children and ageing parents. Relationship breakdown, orce and loneliness can be further triggers, along with the emergence of health issues.For others, Fowke says, anxiety may be triggered by grief at not having had children. The perimenopause and menopause both cause stress, including both physical and emotional symptoms. For men, there is thought to be a similar life change called the andropause, associated with a gradual drop in testosterone. Men may develop depression, loss of sex drive and other symptoms.Waking at night, often with the mind whirring. “If you have cortisol racing through the body in the day, it will not switch off at night, Tyler warns. “Your body will ping awake.” Stress hormones can bring palpitations and nausea, a lack of energy and restlessness. Tyler finds some people develop irrational phobias that they’ve not had before – becoming fearful, for instance, of driving on the motorway. Rauch cites “unaccountable frustration and disappointment”. Anger and arguments with partners can increase.What helpsTyler says that women in the sandwich generation tend to “take on more of the emotional laundry” and arrive at her door “burnt out”. She encourages these clients to give themselves permission to switch off and suggests including regular “stop points” – ideally three times a day. What you do in this time doesn’t matter it’s the stopping that counts. Meditate, read the paper, put on music during the commute home. It’s important to “make that switch from seeing downtime as selfish”, she says. Exercise also helps by burning off adrenaline. Tyler thinks it may help to stop thinking of exercise as something you “should” do, and to see it as “a useful strategy” you choose to deploy. Counselling works for some.Triggers“Death, to be blunt,” says Martin Pollecoff, 69, a psychotherapist and chair of the United Kingdom Counsel for Psychotherapy. Friendship groups at this age may be decimated by ill health and death. As in any time of transition, the strain on relationships is immense. “It’s quite common that one partner is much better at amusing themselves,” says Celia Dodd, author of Not Fade Away: How to Thrive in Retirement. “If one partner is retired and one isn’t, the one who isn’t is very likely to say, ‘What have you been doing all day?’” This can exacerbate the sense of purposelessness. There may be conflict with grownup children, distance from grandchildren.For those who have associated stress with a busy working life, it can be hard to recognise listlessness as a sign of anxiety, while those who are new to retirement might be running on adrenaline, with nowhere to spend it, no sense of purpose.For some, Dodd observes “a kind of competitive retirement” in which there is “a new pressure on people to have a great time.” Regrets can loom large. And underlying all this is deep uncertainty about what lies ahead.The signsProcrastination, along with enlarging health worries. Many people feel reluctant to leave the house. Some feel frustration at not achieving anything in the day, or ruminate on past disappointments. “Wine o’clock starts earlier and earlier,” Dodd says. “And then just feeling uninterested in life, thinking, What’s the point in anything?”What helpsAcceptance. “Accept the things you have done, the things you will never be able to do,” Pollecoff advises. “You have to face up to the paths you didn’t take,” Dodd adds. “Think about them. Then try to think of the good things that you did instead.”Rauch, 58, is finding this age “a great period for relaunch. Our values change. We put less emphasis on ambition and more on relationships, other people, which is very rewarding.” Finding new routines helps. “Work fills up this big space in our life, and it is a question of finding new things that have value,” Dodd says. “They are really to do with people. Connecting with other people.”For those who find it hard to get out of the house, Dodd suggests making small changes. Listen to a different radio station. Go to a cafe for breakfast. Walk a different way to a familiar destination. Find a new activity that challenges you. “Comfort zone is a horrible phrase,” Dodd says, “but you’ve got to keep stretching and be prepared to be a bit uncomfortable sometimes. Then you get this fantastic sense of achievement.”Volunteering is one way to do this, although the challenge could also be planning a holiday, with a subsidiary goal of learning a language, say, or a physical challenge such as running a 5K. Try your hand at something new. And remember, “It’s OK to be crap at things,” says Pollecoff. “One of the great things about old age is that you can fail and it’s not going to destroy you.”Use newly available time to prioritise health. “Become your own doctor,” Pollecoff says. “Diet. Exercise. Put health first.” Finally, Dodd and Pollecoff both agree that “following your curiosity” is key.TriggersEach decade over 70 brings subtly different challenges, but throughout this period you may be facing the loss of a partner, or of friends, and a perceived loss of place in society. For some there is the prospect of a move into a care home, or the fear of it. For those with early stages of dementia with some insight into their condition, there may be the sense that “the locus of control is moving away from you”, explains Duncan Forsyth, a consultant geriatrician.According to Alex Bailey, a doctor in the old age faculty at the Royal College of Psychiatrists, fear of death is not a big problem. “I’m 40 and I’m terrified of death,” he says. “But you don’t tend to see that in older people so much. People who have had a long life experience have generally come to terms with that.” Or built resilience against it. Ill health, on the other hand, does lead to anxiety, especially if the illness is a threat to independence.There may be financial worries, particularly about the cost of care. “You may not be confident in the ability of your family to steer your life. How much do you trust your kids, for example?” asks Bailey. “There can be a fear of being seen as a burden, as well as the fear of physical and mental incapacity, and of being left alone, while others may have the stress of contributing to the care of young grandchildren. Loneliness is rife. On top of that, “The messages that older people get from society are that life is less meaningful than it was.”The signsSomatising – expressing distress in physical symptoms – is common. Loss of weight and appetite are often interpreted as the result of an altered lifestyle: “Well, I don’t move around as much, so I don’t need to eat as much.” But they may be caused by stress or anxiety – a leg pain might be the result of anxiety around walking, for example. What helpsThe key, Bailey says, is to keep your social network as active as possible. “We’re social creatures. Keep at it.” Communities are full of opportunities to socialise: seek them out. Even small daily moments of interaction help, such as chatting to postmen or shopkeepers.This is a great time to take up a new hobby or physical activity – especially one that involves meeting others.Try to focus on what is causing the stress and try to set the worry to one side. “What is it that you are thinking about that stops you going to sleep. Why can’t you switch your brain off? Have you always been a worrier, a person who cogitates too much in the dark hours when you should be putting into neutral?” Forsyth asks. Try altering your breathing to slow the heart rate (by breathing out for one second more than you breathe in, for instance). “Anxiety is a pathological state. It can be helped,” Bailey says. If you have or fear early stage dementia, the National Dementia Helpline offers free advice. CBT is another option. More sessions may be needed in this age group, Bailey says.And while friends and family members may judge your decisions, it is not for them to change or make them: “If you want to make a crazy decision, that’s your right,” Bailey advises. This applies to relatives who may be trying to influence your care provision to your choice of holiday.Psychotherapy can also be beneficial in this age group. Ask your GP if the NHS’s Adult Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) scheme is available to older people in your area."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c08bd090a688b1bb8d8adc7d947d9203596fa1de/0_830_7792_4674/master/7792.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3e366c7ccdafba0852a22a3c6ac92ac3","title":"im the gay tupac jussie smollett","story":"Jussie Smollett was blunt, emotional and defiantly determined on Saturday night at a southern California concert some urged him not to play. The actor and singer told the crowd before singing a note that he had to go on with the show because he couldn’t let his attackers win.“And above all, I fought the fuck back,” he said to cheers. Then he paused and said, emphatically but with a laugh: “I’m the gay Tupac.” “The most important thing I can say is ‘thank you so much, and I’m OK,” said the Empire actor and R\u0026ampB singer from the stage at the Troubadour in West Hollywood in his first public appearance since he reported to police in Chicago on Tuesday that two masked men had assaulted him and put a rope around his neck while using homophobic and racial slurs. “I’m not fully healed yet,” said Smollett, who is black and openly gay, “but I’m going to be, and I’m gonna stand strong with y’all.” The concert had been planned long before the incident, and his family members and others had urged him to postpone it. “I had to be here tonight, y’all. I couldn’t let those motherfuckers win,” he said, to screams and cheers from the packed room of about 400 people. “I will always stand for love. I will only stand for love.” His small band then launched into an upbeat song and he broke into dance, wearing a simple white buttoned shirt, white sneakers and black jeans, shuffling across the front of the stage and at times standing defiantly with a fist in the air. Smollett kept the tone mostly celebratory through his hour-long set before addressing the attack head-on toward the end of his hour-long set, when he told the crowd he wanted to clarify a few things. He said he was bruised but his ribs were not cracked. He went straight to the doctor but was not hospitalized, and physicians in both Chicago and Los Angeles cleared him to play but told him to be careful.Fan Monique Davis said after the show that she was shocked he spoke so bluntly and directly about the incident, but she’s glad he did. “It was amazing, it was emotional, it was inspiring,” Davis said. “He showed everyone in the room he was strong.” Smollett told police the men attacked him as he walked home in Chicago early on Tuesday, throwing a chemical substance at him in addition to shouting slurs and putting the rope around his neck. No arrests have been made, and police have not found surveillance video of the attack, though they found footage of Smollett walking home with the rope around his neck. Smollett had made his first public comments about the incident on Friday in a written statement that said he had been “consistent on every level” with the police during their investigation, countering comments on social media saying he had changed his story and been uncooperative with investigators. Chicago police also said Smollett has been cooperative and they have found no reason to think he’s not being genuine. Smollett stars alongside Terence and Taraji P Henson in Empire, the Fox TV show about the power struggles of a family in the music business that is now in its fifth season. The series has allowed Smollett to play, sing and occasionally write music in addition to acting.Last year he released a solo album, Sum of My Music, which made up much of Saturday night’s set, along with songs from Empire.He often sits at the piano on the show but stood front and center at the microphone at the Troubadour, the legendary Los Angeles club that helped launch the careers of James Taylor, the Eagles and Elton John. He was joined in jubilant dance by his family members during his encore. Earlier, they had taken the stage and voiced their support before he came on. “To be honest, as his big brother, I wanted him to sit this one out,” Joel Smollett Jr said. “But we realized this night is an important part of Jussie’s healing. He’s been a fighter since he was a baby. He fought his attackers that night, and he continues to fight.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dcbafbcecaabde051fdc05685c3292a3e5c75b3d/0_1148_3678_2207/master/3678.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dff3d2ae40f6da1d9aa0dc509214e306","title":"specials terry hall horace panter lynval golding hope what else have we got encore interview","story":"On the eve of their first album in decades, 2 Tone’s finest talk to Miranda Sawyer and, further down, answer questions from readers, and famous fans including Richard Curtis and Lauren LaverneIn an east London photographer’s studio, one man is dancing and two men are not. Beres Hammond is playing over the speakers and the dancer – Lynval Golding, guitarist – freeze-frames for the camera shutter, but otherwise is in constant motion. Bassist Horace Panter, determinedly non-dancey, stands dead still, chin jutting, as though he’s ready to punch you if you get too cheeky. And in between them is singer Terry Hall, who doesn’t move much. Hall’s face, though, is always changing, flicking between exasperation, resignation, wry amusement and a withering teenage side-eye. His left hand sticks out. It looks as though there’s a gap for a cigarette in between your fingers, I say, and Hall says “You’re right”, and goes outside to smoke.These three men are the Specials, 2019. The Specials started in Coventry in the late 1970s, a mixed-race ensemble playing a thrilling mixture of ska, reggae and punk, with pointed, politically sharp lyrics. Originally, there were seven members – the three here today, plus band foundersongwriterkeyboardist Jerry Dammers (creator of the 2 Tone record label, to which the Specials were signed), as well as singer Neville Staple, guitarist Roddy Radiation and drummer John “Brad” Bradbury. Much of the Specials’ impact back then was collective: a group of street-tough iniduals, the band as gang. Their gigs were raucous, confrontational affairs, occasionally marred by far-right elements wanting to cause trouble with a group that had both black and white members.In 1981, after their scorching single Ghost Town went to No 1, Hall, Golding and Staple left to form the Fun Boy Three. The remaining Specials added more members and continued as the Special AKA, before splitting in 1984 (though Dammers was held in a record company contract until 1987). Since then, there have been various Specials reincarnations. People have been in and out (30 members since 1979: Wikipedia has resorted to a graph). Panter was an art teacher for special needs children for a while, Golding moved to Seattle. He and Hall didn’t speak for more than a decade. Neither Dammers nor Hall rejoined for years. Hall was focused on his solo career. Dammers – who started the group and owned their name – tried to restart the Specials in the late 00s on the condition that they play new material. They got as far as two rehearsals before everyone fell out again.The most common question from the Observer readers concerns whether Dammers will ever rejoin: when I ask it today, Hall, Golding and Panter give answers that are noticeably varied. Is the door open for him or not? Dammers himself, when I speak to him later, says that he was served with a legal letter and forced out of the band.“There was never a long-term plan,” says Panter. “But once we got ourselves established, the obvious thing to do would be to make a new album. It was just getting the right consensus between the iniduals.”As you can imagine, embroiled as they were in legal battles, this consensus took time. From 2009 on, the Specials, sans Dammers, toured, and then toured, and then toured again. According to Panter, it wasn’t until 2012-13 that there was a settled membership: but then, in 2013, Staple left, due to ill health, followed by Radiation in 2014. This left Hall, Golding and Panter, plus Brad, the drummer. But then Brad died, in 2015, and, once more, things were put on hold. Until last year. “We were in California playing with Neil Young and the Pretenders,” says Hall, “and I remember thinking: ‘Well, they’re writing new stuff, why don’t we?’”Now, much-loved reggae and jazz drummer Kenrick Rowe has joined them to play live Steve Cradock (Ocean Colour Scene, Paul Weller) is on guitar Nikolaj Torp Larson plays keyboards and, along with Hall, Golding and Panter, wrote and produced the new album, Encore. And it’s the release of new material that changes everything. “All this,” says Panter, gesturing around the studio. He means photoshoots and interviews. “You forget, that’s what albums do.”Encore is strong, musically, with an unexpectedly broader palette that takes in disco, funk and oompah as well as reggae. For original fans, there are callbacks. The lead single, Vote for Me, opens up with ascending Ghost Town-style chords, and there’s three covers: of the Equals’ 1970 track, Black Skin Blue Eyed Boys, of Blam Blam Fever (Gunfever) by the Valentines (1967) and of the Fun Boy Three’s The Lunatics Have Taken Over the Asylum. Prince Buster, a huge influence on the band (Gangsters, their first single, was a reworking of Buster’s Al Capone), is referenced in 10 Commandments, featuring the words and vocals of activist Saffiyah Khan. It’s a clap-back to Buster’s 1966 track that, for the benefit of any Buster-fancying woman, listed his 10 jokily chauvinistic lady friend requirements. (Prince Buster also made Princess Buster’s original 1967 answer track.)Lyrics take on the personal and the political, the US and the UK, though more ambiguously than the Specials’ original precision attacks. On BLM (Black Lives Matter), Golding talks us through three racist experiences from his past. And then there’s Vote for Me. Golding points out that the Specials’ (as opposed to the Special AKA) last release was Ghost Town, so it seems right that the next release, 38 years later, is Vote for Me. Hall agrees: “With Ghost Town we didn’t say, ‘This is the right way, this is the wrong way’, we just said, ‘Things are pretty shit, really’. And we’re saying the same with Vote for Me. I find it difficult to vote on anything, really. Whereas before, we were staunch Labour. Now, I feel like I don’t trust you, I don’t like your face. On a personal thing with Corbyn, I definitely can’t do it any more. But what are the alternatives?”It must be strange to make a comeback now, to return in your middle age at a time when Britain itself appears to be determined to return to the more depressing parts of the early 80s.“Well,” says Hall, “if we’d released a record at any point in the last eight years it would have been relevant. Because not a great deal has changed. There’s different names for it, like Brexit, which sounds nuanced, but isn’t far from the one called ‘unemployment’ and the one called ‘racism’. Look, we didn’t plan it. We didn’t say: ‘Let’s get a mix done quick, because Brexit’s out at the end of January.’”There are non-political songs on the album. The penultimate track, The Life and Times, addresses Hall’s depression. Though his unsmiling demeanour has always been part of Hall’s appeal – “God, people saying, ‘Cheer up’ and ‘Why don’t you smile?’… I get fed up with saying, ‘Fuck off’” – a resting bitch face is far removed from the actual terror of depression.“With every record I’ve done, I’ve made reference to it,” says Hall, “but this is out-and-out. I was diagnosed with manic depression and schizophrenia about 11 years ago and that diagnosis made a big difference, because then I started taking medication. And the change in me, to be able to function… I couldn’t have done this 12 years ago. People used to say to me, ‘Why don’t you try yoga? Or St John’s wort?’ But there’s a massive difference when you’re in a deep depression and feeling shitty with the world, and the stage that I got to, where you want to give yourself a lobotomy, it’s that bad.”Medication – “lithium, hardcore drugs” – has really helped. Hall knows that his episodes are cyclical and he can feel when a depression is coming on. “And before, I used to have to give in to it and people would say, ‘You’ve been in bed for three weeks’, and I thought it was 10 minutes. But now I can feel it coming and I can also feel the medication, it blocking it. It’s brilliant. Recognising you’re blocking it is amazing. It’s really weird. It’s like looking at a bruise develop on your leg.”The album’s final track, We Sell Hope, is uplifting musically and lyrically, a contrast to all the excoriation that comes before.“Well, in the end,” says Hall, “if you’re talking about each other, all you can offer is love. To respect people, and be kind to people, and hope that they give it back. They sometimes don’t but they sometimes do. But there’s that sense of hope. What else have we got?”The photo session is done. The dancing and non-dancing are over. Hall has another cigarette and then we gather around a table to answer questions from Observer readers and famous admirers. There are more than usual. “Hmm,” says Hall. “I bet you say that every time.” (There are I don’t.) “Fire away…”Encore by the Specials is out now on UMCWhat moment from your height of fame are you most proud of, the moment that provides the legacy of the Specials in years to come?Horace: Ghost Town getting to No 1.Terry: Yes, I’d go with that. It was an unbelievably brilliant finale to what we’d done for a few years, and every band should fold after Ghost Town really, because what else are you going to do?!Is pop much worse now than the early 80s or am I blinded with nostalgia? Now it seems really dull when we glance at the mainstream…Terry: I’m actually going to see Joe in a couple of weeks, his band. I don’t know. We get asked that a lot. “What are you listening to now?” And what I’m listening to now is a Grateful Dead album, because I never heard it first time round... Horace: I’m sure there are some things that are great out there but I don’t know where to look for them. I haven’t got the time to spend a fruitless three hours ploughing through YouTube.Terry: The last thing that I saw that I really, really liked was the Fat White Family. They were funny and everything you wanted. Bit druggy, funny, they look really good. Lynval: There’s one band that I like. Easy Life. They’re a young band from Leicester, I saw them on Jools Holland, they’re really, really good. If I could have a vote for a band to be with us on any bill, it would be that little band. The kid’s got the right attitude. He’s a star.When are you happiest?Horace: Most of the time.Lynval: With me, when we made the album, to get up and get on a train and go to work every day, come to the studio, that was really weird – but when we finished the record, I was completely lost. I didn’t know what to do with myself. We had so much fun doing this record. We’d take it in turns to sleep on the couch. Wake up, “Oh, that’s nice, yes,” and go back to sleep.Terry: Probably happiest when I’m watching football. Even through all the shitty times, five minutes before kick-off you think: “This is great.” But in the last week or two do you know what’s made me happiest? In our bathroom, on the floor there’s mosaic tiles and one was lost. It’s white so I tried putting Polyfilla in, but I couldn’t get the grouting to look good. Then I thought: “Well, why don’t I look in the vac bag?” So I got the bag out and put my hand in and I found the tile. Honestly, that made me really happy. A great moment.You wrote a song about a Ghost Town, but have any of you actually seen a ghost?Lynval: I was born in Saint Catherine, Jamaica…Terry: And he’s off…Lynval: This man was crippled and he sat in front of this house in the village, where I come from, this brownstone house, on a mat. He died and I went down to the river with my sink pan on my head to fetch the water. It was broad daylight. I’ve got the water, I’m walking, then suddenly there he was, sitting in front of his house on his little mat. My mind just went, “Wooah, wooah,” and the sink pan of water has gone off my head. I just run. And often now, I don’t believe that I saw him, but I saw him. I still can’t grasp it.Terry: Weed’s a funny thing, isn’t it? I definitely haven’t seen a ghost, no.One thing I find with accomplishment is that it can feel so insignificant overall, but I know that’s something to do with bouts of depression. Do you feel this sometimes about what you’ve done and still do as musicians?Terry: It does matter, really, and even when it doesn’t matter, it still matters. People see success as getting to No 1 and being platinum. I don’t see that at all, I never have. I think the success is getting something inside, out, and getting someone to listen to it. That is success. For the first 20 years of my life, nobody would listen to me. Nobody. At school, jobcentres, they just didn’t listen, they were never bothered. But then you say something and somebody says, “I agree, I disagree”, and so wow, somebody’s listened. That’s success.In my opinion you’re the best band to grace this world. Which song do you still love banging out the most?Lee Griffiths, via emailLynval: I like Nite Klub. It’s a bit of a naughty one: “I won’t dance in a club like this All the girls are slags And the beer tastes just like piss.” It’s what we guys, when we get together, we talk about. We don’t shout it out loud to people. I quite enjoy that.Horace: Yes, I’ll go Nite Klub too. There’s a version of it on the deluxe edition of the album and it’s fantastic, I love it.Terry: I quite like stuff from the second album. International Jet Set and Stereotype. Just because I’ve always had this thing about people seeing us as a ska band. We don’t play ska music, and if you look at International Jet Set, you couldn’t be more removed from ska. On the second album, I couldn’t pick one song, but I could say with that album: “Wow, something good is happening here.” And then we split up!I remember hearing Gangsters for the first time in 1979 when I was in an amusement arcade on my school holidays. The energy of that song stopped me in my tracks and the Specials have been my band ever since. What’s your music moment that’s stayed with you?Angelina Jones, via emailTerry: I’d go with Gangsters. When we did it on Saturday Night Live in New York. Because it felt so alien to the people on the show, the ones working there and the audience, and that was the first time I thought: “Something good’s happening here.” We took off the shackles when we did it, people were just roaming on and off stage. And it felt really like the right song at the right time. I remember doing photo sessions and people thinking we were like, a gay choir, because we all had short hair. Either ex-marines or a gay choir.Lynval: Remember when we did it in Chicago? When they got the audience to throw these fake dollar bills on the stage? Because… gangster, yes?Terry: Al Capone.Miranda Sawyer: But can you think of a song that isn’t yours where you thought: this changes everything?Horace: I was delivering car spares to a store in Birmingham. This was about 1990. And this song came on the radio, and I was standing there with this box, and this bloke was going, “Come on, give me the box,” and I go, “Shh.” And it was Smells Like Teen Spirit by Nirvana. It was the first time I heard it, and I thought, “Flippin’ heck. That’s good.”Lynval: “Get up, stand up. Stand up for your rights” by Bob Marley, because it was around the time when we started having our own identity. We started getting away from the colonial ways that were forced on to us. And that’s when the Rasta theme started coming up, something we can call our own, you know? That really hit me.Miranda: How about you, Terry? Is there a song you can think of that changed things for you?Terry: I will come back to Shaddap You Face again… No, Anarchy in the UK. It was like everybody was waiting for something like that. It was a turning point.What are your thoughts on Coventry becoming a UK city of culture in 2021? Have you been approached to do something?Liam Nagle, CoventryHorace: I’m the only participating member of the Specials who still lives in Coventry and no, I haven’t been approached to do something. I would like to see money put by to provide for music lessons for children in schools, a proper legacy. I’m more interested in that than “Here’s a couple of boutique hotels”, and who needs another wine bar for goodness sake?Terry: I get really bugged by this City of Culture thing. If you have to really search for the culture, you’re making it up. The landmark for me in Coventry is the cathedral.I heard activist Saffiyah Khan has sung on the album. How did this come about?Barry Mingard, Welwyn Garden CityTerry: We saw Saffiyah in that photo. She had a Specials T-shirt on, and she was standing up to a member of the EDL, who was screaming at her, and she just smiled back. A fantastic reaction, because it made him look stupid. So we got in touch with her and said: “Come to our gig in Birmingham.” Then when it came to recording the album, we were thinking about people who might like to be on it, and she was definitely in my head as somebody who could have something to say. And at the same time I was listening to Prince Buster, Ten Commandments of Man, and I couldn’t believe...Miranda: How rampantly sexist it is?Terry: It goes back to Dave Lee Travis, like hand-on-the-arse times. So then the idea came like: “Wouldn’t it be nice to do an answer to that?” But obviously from a woman. Saffiyah was the obvious choice, and we just said to her: “Here’s the Prince Buster song. Do you want to try to reply to it?” And she got on with it.Bloody hell, I don’t think I’ve seen such effortlessly cool looking gentlemen ever. Please give me a clothing tip.Tenement Funster, onlineHorace: Smart casual. And wear your T-shirt outside your jeans.Lynval: Horace is stepping up now, he’s the man. Me, I love that sort of stuff from the 70s, like reggae style, you know? Gregory Isaacs.Terry: It’s simple. Avoid horizontal stripes. Didn’t work when you were 18 mate, and now you’re middle aged.Terry, as a lifelong Man United fan, what do you think Ole Gunnar Solskjær has to do to get the manager’s job full time?Thehumblegent, onlineTerry: No idea what he has to do. I mean, he just wins at the moment. He’s such a lovable bloke and a real legend, but whether he’ll keep the job, who knows?Lynval: He’s a real Man U guy, he spent half his life there, it’s in his blood, and it’s got to be in your blood to be able to manage a club like that. I think they should hold on to him, and give him the job full time. It could be another Fergie in the making.Terry: I think realistically, for me, Ferguson is managing the club again. He’s using Solskjær as his mouthpiece. Ferguson is smiling way too much.Lynval: It’s brilliant. The next legend manager.Why aren’t Neville, Roddy and Jerry back in the band?Diesel Estate, onlineHorace: They left.Lynval: They left. It’s as simple as that. Roddy left the band, Neville left the band. Jerry didn’t fully join the band back. There’s nothing we can do about it.Terry: Roddy and Neville feel comfortable where they’re at. They play pubs and small clubs, and I think if you lack that much charisma then that’s probably a wise thing. They enjoy small intimate venues with very few people there. That’s where they feel most comfortable."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/166f65a62cd64034126de9ddf6182115c9cfdb13/0_104_4720_2832/master/4720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ef7ff992059f6fd3e61120812f865613","title":"arron banks man who bankrolled brexit podcast today in focus","story":"Carole Cadwalladr has been covering the biggest pro-leave donor for nearly two years.

In the House of Commons, MPs spend hours debating points of parliamentary procedure, but are unwilling to take real decisions about our country’s future. Negotiations between the prime minister and EU leaders seem to have reached an impasse. But in the real world, businesses are at breaking point.I know from my own business career that – above all – what business needs is certainty. Certainty about the terms on which they will be able to sell products and services to our largest export market. Certainty about their ability to import the parts and raw materials they need without costly tariffs and delays. And above all, the certainty that they need to invest in the UK, to create the high-quality, high-skilled jobs we need to meet the economic challenges of the future.I understand why some people find it easier to dismiss these concerns than engage with the complex reality of Brexit.But businesses don’t have the option to cross their fingers and hope it will be all right on the night. Every day that goes by without answers to these questions accelerates the flow of investment, jobs and economic activity out of the country – and to the EU.This is why it is vital that this issue is settled when parliament next considers it on 14 February. It is time that MPs stopped ducking their responsibility to take decisions – telling the government what they don’t want, but not what they could support. Given the importance of the question, and the isiveness of the debate, we need to reassure citizens and businesses that we have found a sustainable way forward.We can only do this by coming together around an outcome that commands a significant majority in the House. And if that is not possible, we have to grasp the nettle of an extended article 50 period, taking a no-deal Brexit off the table to allow time for discussions to continue.I understand the concerns of some MPs about being seen to delay or frustrate Brexit. And I know that, for others, they just want to “get on with it”. But however bracing the prospect of instant liberation from the EU may feel in abstract, that sentiment won’t last long when confronted with the economic, legal and practical reality. In the chaos that followed no deal, voters would turn on the Tory party, and rightly so.So it is time to focus on what in the end matters most – supporting growth and jobs in the UK. This government, through our industrial strategy, has acknowledged the challenges we face and set out a clear plan to deal with them.A no-deal Brexit would undermine all our efforts. It would entrench this country’s social and economic isions, not heal them. And it would turn a crisis into a catastrophe. That is why, on 14 February, just a week on Thursday, parliament needs to rule it out once and for all.Richard Harrington is minister for business and industry and MP for Watford"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/33951cb1300b44f16ccecd32fa691d3eb630288f/219_98_2950_1770/master/2950.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1b404172d6a964647d6c59ecbd0016a6","title":"six nations england ireland clash leaves brexit politics behind","story":"As England and Ireland fought it out in Dublin at the Six Nations clash, political animosities took a back seatIt was a battle of wills between England and Ireland filled with yelling and chanting, rucking and mauling, penalties and dummies, and there could be no escape from Brexit metaphors.England’s rugby team plus thousands of England fans entered the Aviva stadium in Dublin for a Six Nations clash that seemed to double as a proxy for tension between the British and Irish governments.“Dear England, sorry for the last two years of pain, suffering and humiliation. Another 798 and we’ll be even,” blared a full-page newspaper advertisement by the bookmaker Paddy Power (rather prematurely as it turned out).It also ran billboards across Dublin featuring images of bulky men in green jerseys alongside Brexit references. “No stopping these backstops.” “Just try putting a tariff on this Irish beef.” And perhaps most pointedly: “Welcome to the biggest English-speaking city in the EU – post March 29.”Relations between London and Dublin verge on the nauseous, stirring old suspicions and stereotypes: the arrogant Brit, the stubborn Paddy, the Irish question with no answer, only trouble.Leo Varadkar, the taoiseach, is insisting on the backstop – an insurance policy to avoid a hard border – which may doom Theresa May’s chance of wrangling EU concessions over the withdrawal agreement. Mutual resentment and incomprehension are zinging back and forth across the Irish Sea.Dominic Raab, the former Brexit secretary, has accused Varadkar of leaking inaccurate information, prompting a counter-accusation of Raab being “off the wall” and inventing “pure spoof”.The BBC presenter John Humphrys infuriated many by suggesting on the Today programme to Ireland’s Europe minister, Helen McEntee, that Ireland should also quit the EU with the UK.Among many Irish people, the arch-Brexiter Jacob Rees-Mogg has inspired scorn and abuse. “The arcane MP who looks as though he has been extracted from the nightmare of a Victorian child,” Megan Nolan, a London-based Irish writer, wrote in the New York Times. It was headlined “I didn’t hate the English – until now”, which inspired its own backlash.Fintan O’Toole, one of Ireland’s leading commentators, has pummelled Brexit as a post-imperial English fantasy, eliciting a sharp rebuke from John Lloyd, a contributing editor to the Financial Times.Spats, insults, intellectual argy-bargy, and then on Saturday a formal contest: Ireland v England.An annual clash of sporting rivalry tinged with history, former coloniser versus former colony, now with the tables turned. Ireland, once the championship runt, grown mighty and favoured to beat the visitors in white.There was just one problem with the rugby-as-Brexit metaphor. It didn’t work.Interviews with Ireland and England fans around the Aviva Stadium before kick-off showed no sign of resentment and incomprehension between visitors and hosts. Quite the opposite: they showed the enduring ties that bind the two nations.“There’s no niggle at all,” said Russell Clarke, 38, an IT salesman who had travelled with a group of English and Irish friends based in Northampton. “It’s not coming into our thought processes.” He sported a curly red wig, which represented the Lions, the joint British and Irish international rugby team.“People are here for the sport, not politics,” said Mark Beckett, 53, a financial adviser from Liverpool. “We’ve always been friends and rivals, the Irish and English. We get on. Nothing’s changed.”Adrian Corrigan, 48, a demolition contractor who was born in England to Irish parents, wore an Ireland scarf. “I’m English, not Irish. But when it comes to sport I support Ireland.” English people no longer viewed Ireland through a colonial lens, he said. “People are a lot more grown up about it now.”Phil Slater, 57, a finance manager from Peterborough, agreed: “Today, here, Brexit is irrelevant.”Detente reigned inside the Bridge 1859 pub. “Brexit? We’re all fed up with it,” said Una Kindlon, 69, a musician from Cork. “Give us a decision and move on.” The British government’s stance rankled but did not sour her on England or the English, she said. “I don’t do resentment.”Her brother, Brendan Kindlon, 74, a retired dentist, was over from England, his home for the past 50 years. “I’m a mongrel – an Irishman very happily living in England.”Rugby also served as a bridge in 2007 when England played at Croke Park, a Gaelic-sports stadium steeped in Irish nationalism, reinvigorating the reconciliation that dated from the 1998 Good Friday agreement.Brexit has shaken Northern Ireland’s constitutional arrangements and rekindled talk of a united Ireland, but not revived hostility between the English and Irish, said Peter Shirlow, director of Irish studies at the University of Liverpool: “I have no sense of any developing prejudice, of going back to the stereotypes of the Irish being dangerous alcoholics.”The IRA were not bombing England and Irish emigrants were integrated into British society, he said. “The relationship changed.”A fraught showdown between the governments still looms, but a banner outside the Aviva Stadium captured the other side of Anglo-Irish relations. “Brexit schmexit.

They say the system “is causing considerable distress to our constituents and places another barrier between them and post-Brexit certainty for themselves and their families.”Since 21 January, the 3.6 million EU citizens living in the UK have been able to apply for settled status by using an Android-only app to confirm their identity using their passport, then complete their application on the gov.uk website by providing evidence they have lived continuously in the UK for five years. Anyone without the right phone can only verify their identity at one of 13 centres around the UK, but groups such as the3million, which represents EU citizens in the UK, have been critical that people in some areas face long journeys. Cornish residents must travel to Bath, and the only Scottish centre is in Edinburgh.On 30 March, the day after Britain is due to leave the EU, applicants will be able to have their identity documents checked by post, and the number of document-checking centres will be expanded to more than 50. The Home Office says the current system is a “test” that is “entirely voluntary”.“Promising it will be OK in the future doesn’t give our EU friends the certainty or confidence they need,” Pollard said. “Ministers are rolling out a system that is causing distress and concern. It should have been right for every EU national from the moment the scheme was launched. They should not have to wait for virtually the day we leave the EU to have a system that works properly.”Many of the MPs say they have received correspondence from constituents anxious about their right to live and work in the UK after Brexit and are unable to finish their application because they don’t have the mobile phone type stipulated by the Home Office.“This is a cruel and ridiculous oversight by ministers,” Pollard added. “We saw in the Windrush scandal how administrative errors caused genuine pain and misery for British citizens, but clearly these lessons have not been learnt.”Blomfield said the government was making EU citizens “jump through hoops”.“Requiring people to apply to secure rights that they have had for years is bad enough, but making the application process inaccessible adds insult to injury and risks people falling through the net,” he said. “The Home Office needs to get a grip on this as a matter of urgency.”Jess Phillips, the Labour MP, has offered the use of her mobile phone to any of her Birmingham Yardley constituents and Addenbrooke’s hospital in Cambridge has paid for two mobile phones for its staff to use."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ed7c87110b004c187e5bb97a9b2be155fe320db/0_106_2919_1751/master/2919.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=53107b204897c1c1c1f337d90ae10ead","title":"queen to be evacuated if brexit turns ugly reports","story":"Cold war plans revived to move royals to safe locations away from London if unrest follows no dealBritish officials have revived cold war emergency plans to relocate the royal family should there be riots in London if Britain suffers a disruptive departure from the European Union, two Sunday newspapers have reported.“These emergency evacuation plans have been in existence since the cold war but have now been repurposed in the event of civil disorder following a no-deal Brexit,” the Sunday Times said, quoting an unnamed source from the government’s Cabinet Office, which handles sensitive administrative issues.The Mail on Sunday also said it had learnt of plans to move the royal family, including Queen Elizabeth, to safe locations away from London.In January an annual speech by the Queen, 92, to a women’s group was widely interpreted in Britain as a call for politicians to reach agreement over Brexit.Jacob Rees-Mogg, a Conservative MP and keen supporter of Brexit, told the Mail on Sunday he believed the plans showed unnecessary panic by officials over a no-deal Brexit as senior royals had remained in London during bombing in the second world war.But the Sunday Times said an ex-police officer formerly in charge of royal protection, Dai Davies, expected Queen Elizabeth would be moved out of London if there was unrest. “If there were problems in London, clearly you would remove the royal family away from those key sites,” Davies was quoted as saying."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d991d24790f7bbc5a7a1ea0a145b1ffb1cd26d01/0_168_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ca16200eaebb452b183ed0e590a089c7","title":"sajid javid dismisses speculation of snap general election in june","story":"Home secretary says ‘last thing we want is an election, the people will never forgive us’Sajid Javid has said “the last thing we want is a general election”, emphasising that the government is still hoping to secure a time limit or unilateral exit mechanism for the Irish border backstop.The home secretary dismissed newspaper reports that Downing Street strategists were considering holding a snap general election on 6 June, if Theresa May cannot get her Brexit deal through parliament before the 29 March deadline.“The last thing we want is a general election, the people will never forgive us for it,” Javid told the BBC’s The Andrew Marr Show. “They want politicians to get on with the job. They have been given a very clear mandate, now it’s our job to get on with it.”There are signs that the Conservatives have started to gear up for a possible snap election, with the party’s chief executive, Sir Mick Davis, placing the Tories on a “war footing” last week and increased fundraising activities under the cover of the local elections in May.“I know that Conservative party headquarters is planning on only one set of elections, which is the local government elections. The last thing this country wants is an election they want parliament to deliver Brexit in an orderly way,” Javid said.The home secretary indicated that May would shortly be returning to Brussels for further negotiations – without giving a date – and said she would be working closely with two senior ministers in those talks.Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general and the government’s chief law officer, will be leading a fresh push to see if “there can be a hard time limit on any backstop or our own exit mechanism”, Javid said.The Brexit secretary Steve Barclay, will lead efforts to assess whether alternative technological arrangements can be put in place to eliminate the Irish backstop, so customs checks can take place away from the physical border.Last week, MPs voted in favour of an amendment in the name of Sir Graham Brady, a senior Conservative, to examine the possibility of alternative arrangements, but it is unclear that the necessary technology exists.Brexiters in May’s party remain concerned that the prime minister will fail to secure a legally binding mechanism to effectively eliminate the unpopular backstop in her discussions with an already hostile European Union.Steve Baker, the vice-chairman of the hard Brexit European Research Group, said there was “trouble ahead” if May was prepared to accept only an attachment to the withdrawal agreement, or codicil.“Leave-backing MPs voted to support alternative arrangements in NI but with grave misgivings about the whole agreement,” Baker tweeted on Sunday morning, accusing May of co-opting “us into accepting everything but the backstop and, on the backstop, accepting a codicil”.Downing Street said that was not the case, adding that May wanted to reopen the withdrawal agreement in emergency negotiations, even though the EU has repeatedly said that will not be allowed.Javid said he believed there was no mileage in May trying to compromise with Labour and its leader, Jeremy Corbyn on a deal that would keep the UK in a customs union with the EU after Brexit.He said he did not think such a deal would get a majority in the Commons, partly because “the other half of Labour say they want a second referendum” but also because “you’d lose votes on the Conservative side it’s a complete non-starter”.The home secretary was also pressed on whether he believed the UK would be as safe in a no-deal scenario. The EU has said Britain would no longer be part of the European arrest warrant system, which allows suspects to be extradited back to the UK.Javid said there would be “a change in capability” if there was no deal because there were “certain capabilities that we rely on for security, such as databases, arrest warrants, others. That of course will change. I’m not pretending that you can have a like-for-like capability.”“We will still be a very safe country,” Javid said. “Most of these capabilities began in 2015. We were a safe country then, and we’d be a very safe country in a no-deal scenario.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8ffec33dad75fbc8260d84ee4354562e69c51279/0_33_1935_1162/master/1935.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ca72f710df34e63882b908552de1fa8f","title":"tom brady super bowl new england patriots los angeles rams nfl","story":"As usual Tom Brady had the final word. More than 35,000 fans had turned up to the pep rally hosted by the New England Patriots before they departed for Atlanta. Team captains spoke one at a time and last up was the quarterback. He hailed his colleagues for staying grounded through a rollercoaster season. And then he led everyone in a chant of “We’re still here”.Yes, still. Seventeen years have passed since Brady led New England to an upset victory over the St Louis Rams at Super Bowl XXXVI. On Sunday, he will compete in the NFL’s championship game for the ninth time. No team outside of New England can match that number, let alone any inidual player.The opponents are once again the Rams, though it speaks to how the sporting landscape has shifted around Brady that they are now based in Los Angeles. Where he has spent his professional career in the same place, working under the same head coach – Bill Belichick – the Rams have churned through eight different coaches and two cities in that time.If Brady’s story were being scripted in Hollywood, then this game might have made for a fitting final act. He was the underdog in the 2001 season: a backup quarterback and anonymous sixth-round draft pick thrust into the limelight early in the campaign when New England’s starter, Drew Bledsoe, went down hurt. Today, he has nothing left to prove.Brady surpassed his childhood idol, Joe Montana, two years ago as the quarterback with the most Super Bowl rings. Combining regular season and play-off games he has thrown for the most yards and the most touchdowns than any other player and won more games as well. Why not ride off into the sunset now, widely acknowledged as the greatest of all time, with one last reprise of the game where it all began?Brady has delivered his answer through various interviews in recent days. He told ESPN there was zero chance he would retire after the game, repeating his insistence that he would like to play on until the age of 45, a further four years from now. “I feel like I’m asked that a lot and I feel like I repeat the same answer,” he said. “No one believes me.”Perhaps they simply do not want to. Such unending domination has not exactly made him popular among fans of the NFL’s other 31 teams. A TV news producer at a CBS affiliate in Pittsburgh was fired last week after running a graphic over footage of Brady describing him as a “known cheater”.The reference was to the Deflategate saga of 2015, when the quarterback was accused of instructing members of the Patriots staff to underinflate footballs to be used in their play-off win over Indianapolis. He was suspended for four games, after an appeal process that escalated to the federal courts.Even as that case was being litigated Brady stumbled into another controversy when he placed a “Make America Great Again” cap on display in his locker in 2015, during the early stages of Donald Trump’s presidential run. He insisted this was simply a gift from a long-time golf buddy and did his best to sidestep any questions about his political beliefs.Trump, however, would assert during a pre-election rally that Brady had voted for him. The player’s wife, Gisele Bündchen, contradicted that claim in a reply to a follower on Instagram. Brady subsequently declined an invitation to the White House after the Patriots’ 2017 Super Bowl win – citing a family emergency – and rejected Trump’s criticism of NFL players who had protested against police brutality by kneeling during the pre‑game national anthem.If national politics became an unwelcome sideshow, it was a power struggle within the Patriots’ own organisation that posed a greater threat to Brady’s career. He has credited his longevity in part to the work of a man he has described as his body engineer, Alex Guerrero, but the latter figure’s growing influence and belief in alternative approaches to medicine and nutrition became a source of contention with New England’s own training staff.Brady’s response, however, was simply to raise his performance bar even higher at an age when one would expect some physical decline. This is the fourth time in five seasons he has taken the Patriots to the Super Bowl, after making two in the previous nine-year stretch. Garoppolo was traded to San Francisco in 2017.“Some people are born with great height,” said Brady last week when asked about what keeps him going. “Some people are born with great size, great speed. Some people are born with other things I would say are more intangible.“It started when I was young and it’s really a part of my whole family. It’s definitely in my family’s DNA to compete and to win. People think: ‘You’re 41. What are you doing?’ And I’ll still be shooting for the stars. I’m doing something I love to do.”He has not always been able to channel such competitiveness in healthy ways. Brady has recalled breaking TV remotes and punching a hole in a wall when things did not go his way as a kid. Ask those at New England who have played with him and they will tell more recent tales of board games being flipped and table tennis paddles shattered in fits of frustration.Little wonder Brady is so reluctant to give up the gridiron: a space where a furious desire to win and a willingness to get physical are tremendous assets. He is still here and intends to be for a little while longer yet."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3ad257901ae080e9b217c74f5742bf287eba3833/0_24_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=104e87f722b151d0dce923c64b43412f","title":"huawei friend or foe global 5g dominance","story":"If, according to an ancient Chinese proverb, “a crisis is an opportunity riding the dangerous wind”, then Huawei is barrelling in on a storm force 12. Where the hurricane takes it, though, may be out of the telecoms giant’s control.A slew of bombshell allegations have raised troubling questions about the telecoms company’s probity and revived long-held concerns about its relationship with China’s intelligence services. The UK, in need of friends as Brexit looms, is struggling to negotiate the fallout. To ignore the mounting brouhaha risks alienating its closest ally, the United States, currently locked in a bitter trade war with China which has become synonymous with Huawei. But the UK needs Chinese technology to keep pace with the 21st century.“The UK, like much of the west, struggles to know whether to see China as threat or opportunity,” said Robert Hannigan, former director of the British intelligence centre’s GCHQ and now European chairman of the cybersecurity company BlueVoyant. “It’s a difficult balance. My view is that we want the benefits of Chinese technology and inward investment and we should find ways of managing the risks, pushing back where necessary.”Last Monday a 13-count indictment unsealed in a New York court, charging Huawei and its chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, with Iranian sanctions-busting – charges rejected by the company – made the balancing act that bit more difficult. A second indictment, unveiled the same day, alleged that the firm tried to steal technology from mobile operator T-Mobile US. Huawei insists the matter has been settled.It was just another bad week for a company that is making a habit of garnering negative headlines. Not a week goes by without a UK politician taking aim. Defence secretary Gavin Williamson expressed “grave concerns” about Huawei in December. Last week Chris Bryant, the Labour MP and member of the foreign affairs select committee, claimed: “Day by day we see more evidence that Chinese companies like Huawei are breaking all the rules and undermining British security.” In December a Huawei executive was arrested in Poland on charges of spying for China, a dramatic development that the company insisted had nothing to do with its operations, a rebuttal that did little to convince sceptics who view it as an appendage of China’s Communist party (CCP).While Huawei likes to portray itself as an independent enterprise wholly owned by its employees (“we’re the John Lewis of China,” one claimed), no Chinese company could succeed abroad so spectacularly without the party’s patronage, said Martin Thorley, an expert on international engagement with China at the University of Nottingham. “There are a growing number of exciting Chinese companies that could compete abroad in a range of sectors, but the CCP has made it’s choice, and it has chosen to retain power in all spheres to the detriment of these companies’ international aspirations.”For westerners who struggle to understand the power of CCP patronage, Thorley offers an analogy. “Imagine if the Conservative party in the UK controlled the army, the judiciary, all newspapers, the police force, major companies, all universities. It would be a very different country indeed.“Huawei is a part of this network and subject to these forces, so the question is whether a company ultimately subject to the whim of the CCP should be involved in sensitive security projects abroad. Some may argue that it should but they need to understand that when called upon Huawei must do as the party says.”In the UK, however, Huawei has gone to great lengths to present itself as a paragon of corporate accountability. It hired the government’s chief information officer, John Suffolk, as head of cybersecurity and its UK board is the envy of many FTSE 100 firms. Notable appointments include ex-BP boss Lord Browne of Madingley, Sir Andrew Cahn, the government’s former chief trade ambassador, and, until her death in 2017, Dame Helen Alexander, a former CBI president.In addition to the links it has forged with academia, the company is a donor to the Chatham House thinktank and has funded two influential parliamentary technology committees. A former global sponsor of Arsenal football club, Huawei will achieve a rare PR coup on Monday when an unfinished symphony by Schubert, completed using the company’s smartphone technology, will be performed for the first time at London’s Cadogan Hall.But its expert deployment of soft power cannot stanch the flow of bad publicity. Amid growing disquiet about Huawei’s activities, UK operator BT has announced that it will remove Huawei’s technology from parts of a network it acquired from a rival, a move that some suggested was down to security concerns. Last week Vodafone confirmed that it was restricting its involvement with Huawei in the UK. Huawei is already barred from supplying next-generation 5G equipment – the technology that will connect “the internet of things” – to Australia and New Zealand.Company insiders insist these developments have nothing to do with security issues, but the optics don’t look good and several UK institutions have taken fright as the charges have piled up. Oxford University and the Prince’s Trust, two venerable organisations that have received Huawei funding, have broken links with the company in the last few days. Some 19 UK universities still enjoy Huawei sponsorship, but, given events, they may now be reconsidering their positions.More bad news is to come, on both sides of the Atlantic. The Observer understands a report to be presented to parliament’s intelligence and security committee in the coming months will flag further concerns about the use of Huawei’s software in the UK telecoms networks, something that will be seized upon by the company’s critics, who warn that sensitive data generated in the UK is at risk of being re-routed to China.In the US, alongside its broader attack on Chinese imports, the Trump administration wants to ban US companies from using Chinese equipment in their critical telecoms networks. Some believe the administration’s ultimate goal is to push Huawei out of Europe and the US, leaving America to frame the global standards for 5G.Behind the scenes, some see a level of coordination in the way the US and its allies have been gunning for Huawei. “Each week there’s a new hit,” one seasoned Huawei watcher observed. “It’s really quite impressive, from a PR perspective.”As China has pushed back, for one person at least the geopolitical row has become a matter of life and death. Following Meng’s arrest in Canada at the request of the US, the Chinese authorities seized two Canadians and sentenced to death a third man, Robert Schellenberg, who had initially been sentenced to 15 years in prison. The decision prompted the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, to accuse China of “arbitrarily” applying the death sentence.In a rare meeting with journalists last month, a sign the company knows it needs to halt the flow of negative headlines, Meng’s father, the company’s founder, Ren Zhengfei, insisted the decision was “not related to Huawei in any way”.“We are like a small sesame seed, stuck in the middle of conflict between two great powers,” said Ren during the round-table discussion, a transcript of which has been shared with the Observer.Not that small a seed. With 180,000 staff around the world (1,500 in the UK), Huawei produced revenues last year of more than $100bn. In 2017 it invested $13bn (£10bn) in research and development, half what the UK spent. Not bad for a company founded in a small flat with a $2,500 loan barely more than 20 years ago. Curiously, as the row over Huawei’s activities has sucked in each of the UK’s intelligence-sharing partners in the so-called “Five Eyes” spying alliance – the US, Australia, New Zealand and Canada – Theresa May’s government has been strangely quiet about its position. But then, to be seen taking up the cudgels against Huawei would be to risk unpicking the years of work that the UK has spent assiduously wooing China.The idends of this courtship are manifold. Between 2016 and 2017, Chinese investment in the UK doubled to $20.8bn, according to a report produced by the TMF Group, a consultancy, on behalf of the China-Britain Business Council. This was all the more astonishing given that, in the same year, overall Chinese outbound investment declined for the first time since records began in 2003.More is to come. Between 2018 and 2022, Huawei alone has pledged to spend some £3bn in the UK. It is perhaps no coincidence that, as Chinese money has poured into the UK, hundreds of Chinese investors have received golden visas granting them residency. And nowhere is the burgeoning Anglo-Chinese relationship more tangible than London.Two of the City’s most recognisable buildings, the 224m “Cheesegrater” and the 38-storey Walkie Talkie, are now owned by Hong Kong companies, while the multibillion-pound redevelopment of the Royal Albert Dock in east London is being spearheaded by the Chinese developer ABP.These projects pale into insignificance compared with the £20bn development of Hinkley Point C. The new nuclear station in Suffolk that will generate low-carbon electricity for about 6 million homes is a third-owned by China’s General Nuclear Power Group.But some experts question where this relationship will end. “My fear is that, just as financial elite influence over government ensured light-touch regulation that led to financial disaster in 2008, so similar interests have steered the UK government towards the ‘golden era’ policy with China,” Thorley said. “This policy has stalled somewhat since David Cameron and George Osborne left Downing Street, but we still may feel its consequences in the UK’s energy strategy and beyond.”The UK’s assiduous courtship of China was evident in 2010 when Cameron set up his National Security Council, comprising eight committees, six of which he headed. Significantly, though, of the other two, the one relating to cybersecurity was to be overseen not by the prime minister but by the chancellor.At the time intelligence experts were quick to interpret this shift. One told the Observer that they believed the Treasury wanted to “own” cyber because it believed the opportunities afforded by the development of the technology should not be subsumed beneath national security concerns, a view that at the time alarmed some in the intelligence community.And for good reason. Under article 7 of China’s 2017 National Intelligence law, companies like Huawei are legally obliged to help the Chinese intelligence agencies upon request. This fact alone might convince many that Huawei should be nowhere near the UK’s critical infrastructure.But Huawei is subject to unique supervision by the UK’s intelligence services. In 2010 the UK government established the Huawei Cyber Security Evaluation centre, overseen by GCHQ’s national cybersecurity centre, to monitor the company’s operations in the UK.Staffed by 35 heavily vetted analysts, the centre flags security issues arising from Huawei’s activities to government. A report issued by the centre’s oversight board last July raised serious concerns about the poor quality of Huawei’s security engineering. As a result, the board conceded that it could provide only “limited assurance” that any risks to UK national security from Huawei’s involvement in the UK’s critical networks had been sufficiently mitigated.Another report from the board, to be published this spring, is expected to raise similar concerns, giving more ammunition to Huawei’s critics, the Observer understands. However, while the intelligence agencies may harbour concerns about the robustness of Huawei’s software, the centre has never found evidence of the fabled “backdoors” that would allow China to penetrate the UK’s telecoms networks. “Critically, it has concluded that Huawei falls short in its approach to cybersecurity, but it has never uncovered hostile state activity by Chinese government agencies,” Hannigan said.Ren, a former officer in the People’s Liberation Army, insists Huawei would never betray its customers. “When it comes to cybersecurity and privacy protection, we are committed to siding with our customers. We will never harm any nation or any inidual.”The extraordinary level to which the UK has gone to accommodate a company regularly accused of spying for a foreign state says much about where the shifting balance of power now lies in the world. In the era of “techno-nationalism”, countries that innovate dominate.Last year the broadband comparison website, Cable, published an annual league table revealing that the UK had the 35th fastest broadband in the world, a slip of four places since 2017, one that put it behind almost all other EU member states and Madagascar, one of the least developed nations in the world, according to the UN. Huawei knows it is one of the very few companies that can drag the UK up the table. “Huawei is the only company in the world that can integrate 5G base stations with the most advanced microwave technology,” Ren said.“With that capability, our 5G base stations don’t even need fibre connections. Instead, they can use superfast microwave to support ultra-wide bandwidth backhauls. This is a compelling solution that makes a lot of economic sense.” For economic, read cheap.To switch to an alternative supplier, such as Sweden’s Ericsson, would be hugely costly, Whitehall mandarins concede. Inevitably, the significantly higher prices would be passed on to consumers.Jo Platt, shadow minister for cyber, said UK reliance on a few key tech firms was a concern. “Why are we spending huge amounts of public money on mega-companies like Amazon Digital Services and Huawei how do we redress that?”Perhaps Huawei itself will provide the answer. Amid reports that Poland is pushing fellow Nato members to adopt a “unified position” on Huawei, something that could make life difficult for the UK as it scrambles to keep Huawei onside, Ren promised the company would scale back if it was not allowed to sell its products in certain markets. Such a pledge would never be made by a western company beholden to shareholders. But, as Ren acknowledged, Huawei is different. “We are not a public company – we aren’t overly concerned about beautiful numbers.” He was talking about Huawei. But he may as well have been talking about China.The US issues a warrant for Meng Wanzhou, chief financial officer of Huawei and daughter of its founder, Ren Zhengfei 1 December Meng Wanzhou is arrested at Vancouver airport after US says Huawei was involved in breaking Iran sanctionsTwo Canadians are detained in China, four days after Justin Trudeau refuses to intervene in Meng’s caseCanadian Robert Lloyd Schellenberg is sentenced to death by a Chinese court for drug smugglingHuawei says it will not use US-made components for its next generation of smartphonesMeng is charged with misleading US banks about Iran dealings.

The study asked if the students were “morning” or “evening” people and it showed that “morning” people had a grade point average (GPA) a point higher than the evening types. The researcher’s explanation was simple: early birds get to their classes on time and drink less.In a 2018 study by the University of Bristol, researchers looked at 341 snippets of DNA that controlled whether someone was an early bird or night owl and showed that being a morning person reduced the likelihood of developing breast cancer.A study of 346 German teenagers found that early birds scored higher for persistence and cooperation, while a further study from the University of Education Heidelberg of 1,231 participants found them to be more conscientious.

At 22, he was nearly killed by a roof collapse.He spent a year on his back in the hospital. When he was mobile again, he got a job with the United Mine Workers Union. But after 12 years his injuries flared up and he had to quit. Then Vietnam memories started coming back, and he took to alcohol and pills.“I was a wasted man for several years,” he recalled.In September 2005, everything changed. He went to church and got sober. When his mind was clear, he didn’t like what he saw.“Man,” he said, “I seen all this destruction the coal companies were doing, tearing the mountains down.”Since then, Shoupe has worked with Kentuckians for the Commonwealth, a grassroots environmental and social justice group that wants to do things like insulate old camp homes and use the energy savings to pay the costs. It is also looking to create jobs to replace those that left with the mining companies as coal use declined.Such ideas could now form the backbone of a national strategy that more and more Democrats are supporting and which will also aim to help slow the pace of climate change: a Green New Deal.The concept has the backing of the 2020 presidential contenders Cory Booker, Kirsten Gillibrand, Kamala Harris, and Elizabeth Warren and the likely candidate Bernie Sanders.

It will aim to help people of color and indigenous communities. And it will try to help places like Benham, Kentucky. But most importantly, people involved say, the document will push candidates for the White House to explain what they plan to do about climate change.“Where 2020 contenders stand on this legislation will make it clear who is using the Green New Deal as a buzzword and who is serious about transforming our economy in line with what science and justice demand,” said Varshini Prakash, founder of the Sunrise Movement, a youth climate advocacy group.The concept is already entering the mainstream. Earlier this week, Harris declared her support, telling an Iowa town hall: “Climate change is an existential threat to us, and we have got to deal with the reality of it.” The California senator also touted statistics projecting huge growth in wind and solar power jobs.Behind the scenes, environmental groups, unions and climate justice advocates have been laying out their thoughts on what a Green New Deal should include.For people like Shoupe, it’s hard to get excited just yet. They need help now, while climate scientists stress that the world is already off the pace, having failed to begin phasing out coal and petroleum and working to limit greenhouse gas emissions from industry, agriculture and land use.Then there is the legislative challenge a Green New Deal would present, even if all the groups involved could agree on the best way forward. So far, organizations are aligning around general aspirations, people familiar with discussions said. As concrete policy is generated, that will become more difficult.One conflict will come around whether a Green New Deal can include nuclear power, which is carbon-free but runs on mined uranium. Another will regard the use of carbon sequestration, a technology to collect and store emissions from power plants, thereby letting them keep running.Basav Sen, who works with a national consortium of groups, the Climate Justice Alliance, is against the inclusion of nuclear and carbon sequestration.For Paul Getsos, national director of the Peoples Climate Movement, an umbrella group for community organizations and environmental justice and labor groups, the Green New Deal “has to be about reducing emissions” as well as building a more just economy.Working with unions, meanwhile, could make it hard to set specific goals for phasing out fossil fuels, because organized labor represents people working in coal, oil and gas, steel and concrete: all sources of greenhouse gases.The plan could also ide Democrats in Congress. Representative Jamie Raskin of Maryland has been calling for a “green deal” including a carbon fee and idend.But he acknowledged: “I know some members of the House have concerns about overly ambitious goals built into the Green New Deal, such as trying to wean us off fossil fuels in a decade.” One such member was John Delaney of Maryland, who left the House last month in order to run for president.In January, he told the : “There’s a way of doing something really big on climate change in my opinion: it involves putting a price on carbon … That’s the best way to do it: it’s a market-based solution. But suddenly some people are saying, ‘No, no, that’s not good enough, we’ve got to go further, we’ve got to basically ban carbon in 10 years.’ Now, that’s just not going to happen.“I worry that they move the goalposts to a point where you can’t get anything done and I think that plays into Trump’s hands, actually.”Advocates insist nonetheless that they have an opportunity to overcome such obstacles. Ben Beachy, with the Sierra Club, said he has been happy “to see just how much alignment on the broad goals there has been”.Furthermore, for once, some say they might have an advantage in the messaging war.Julian Brave NoiseCat, a policy analyst for the climate group 350.org and a  contributor, said: “Climate change and climate policy has been framed through tradeoffs, scarcity and sacrifice for so long.“But what’s powerful about the Green New Deal is it frames it as: ‘We can build and provide millions of jobs and do phenomenal things for everyday people through climate policy.’”"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"In 2018, learners received 448 notices to appear in court for not paying \u0026euro80 fineHotel general manager says electrical fire started in lift shaft servicing the hotel\u0026rsquos spaDecision means there will be seven 24-hour strikes this month as part of dispute over paySigns of a fire in room next to where woman was sleeping but little damage to propertyCarl Carr was reported missing in September last year after attending Costa Blanca eventGroup use digger to remove machine at the Glenavy Road, Moira, Co DownBillboards read: \u0026lsquoYou Don\u0026rsquot Pick A Side.

This will mean that respite services for people with intellectual disabilities and also the elderly will be taken into the dispute.The announcement followed a meeting of the INMO executive in Dublin on Saturday.INMO general secretary Phil Ní Sheaghdha criticised the “threats and intransigence” in response to the pay demand by nurses from the Government.“Nurses and midwives proudly stood up in defence of our patients and professions last Wednesday,” she said.“Everybody – except the government – recognise that there is a serious understaffing problem in our health services. The public support for the strike on Wednesday showed that the Irish people stand with nurses and midwives.“Our message is clear. We will not be going away. Resolving this dispute requires direct engagement from the government, recognising the real recruitment and retention problems in Irish nursing and midwifery.“We simply want to be able to do our jobs, but our health service cannot hire enough nurses and midwives on these uncompetitive wages. As ever, we remain available for talks with the government for any realistic proposals.”Minister for Health Simon Harris said he regrets the union\u0027s decision and said there “is an onus on both sides to engage in talks”.\u0026nbspMore than 30,000 nurses from the INMO manned picket lines outside hospitals on Wednesday after talks aimed at resolving the issue failed.Prior to the meeting on Saturday where the INMO decided to extend the strike, Ms Ní Sheaghdha said there had been little activity from the Government to resolve the dispute.Nurses are seeking a pay rise of around €7,000 per annum, or the equivalent of 12 per cent, saying such an increase would bring nursing salaries into line with equivalent health professions, such as physiotherapists, and would also deal with recruitment and retention issues.The Government has said any such pay rise would cost approximately €300 million every year and would lead to knock-on-claims from other public service employees.It warned the State would have to borrow to fund pay increases of this level.Ms Ní Sheaghdha criticised comments by Tánaiste Simon Coveney, that the Government was looking at sanctions to be used against striking nurses. She described them as an attempt to “deviate from the real problem, which is recruitment and retention”.She added: “The health service is in a crisis. We have a seen a massive overrun on the children’s hospital. I haven’t seen any penalties for those that are responsible for that.“There seems to be a big emphasis on penalties for nurses and midwives who have been forced to take a stand to improve a health services that will be available for citizens of this country into the future.On Thursday Mr Coveney said the Government was taking legal advice about their available options in response to the strikes. “We are taking legal advice about the options that are available to us consistent with the (public sector) pay agreement.“There is a responsibility on the Government to deliver on that. “There is also responsibility on the unions and their leadership to fulfil on those obligations and that is what protects Ireland in terms of industrial peace.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3780336.1549114009!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"prepare for a united ireland sinn f%C3%A9in tells unionists","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tLeader of Sinn Féin Mary Lou McDonald. Photograph: Tom HonanThe Sinn Féin president Mary Lou McDonald has said that the unionist community needs to be a part of planning for a united Ireland. Party activists from across Ireland gathered in Dublin on Saturday to discuss the campaign for Irish unity and what they say is a “growing demand for a unity poll”.Ms McDonald reiterated her challenge to the government to convene an Irish unity forum and said unionists have to start planning for “all eventualities”.She said: “Obviously, our unionist brothers and sisters need to be part of planning a new Ireland, their first option, of course, is to maintain the union with Britain and we respect that, but as one ex-leader of the DUP put it, they need to start now planning for all eventualities and unionism needs a Plan B.”Ms McDonald claimed that the growing likelihood of a no-deal Brexit has pushed the idea of Irish reunification to the forefront of politics, but she believes mindset is the biggest stumbling block.She added: “The Good Friday Agreement provides a route to remove the border once and for all. Regardless of Brexit, there will be a unity referendum.“In our time we now have an opportunity denied to generations — a peaceful and democratic route to Irish unity to build a new and united Ireland.“There are those who believe Irish unity is a pipe dream.“Some old wives’ tale about the four green fields, some don’t yet appreciate the huge opportunity that Irish unity can present for all of us socially and economically, and those that are hostile to the idea.“There are those who are not unionists but part of the establishment here in the south who might be hostile to the idea, or anything that upsets the apple cart, and those people are in the minority, the vast majority of people know that Ireland is changing and needs to change more.”Former Northern Ireland first minister and DUP leader Peter Robinson said in July he believed the North should prepare for the possibility of a united Ireland.Speaking at the MacGill Summer School in Glenties, Co Donegal, Mr Robinson said he did not think Northern Ireland will want to leave the UK but that there is no reason they should not prepare for it.“I don’t expect my own house to burn down but I still insure it because it could happen,” he said. – PADeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photogarph: Reuters British prime minister Theresa May has said she will be “battling for Britain” when she returns to Brussels to seek a “pragmatic” Brexit deal that can win over both the European Union and her own MPs.Writing in The Sunday , she suggested that Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn had agreed with her that the Irish Border backstop as set out in the Withdrawal Agreement had to change.It came after a report claimed that Nissan was preparing to scrap plans to build its X-Trail 4x4 at its Sunderland plant. Opponents to Brexit were quick to seize on the Sky News claim, which the firm said it would not comment on.In the article, Mrs May said she was listening to figures from across politics, the trade union movement and business in her quest for a feasible Brexit compromise.She said: “It’s why when I return to Brussels I will be battling for Britain and Northern Ireland, I will be armed with a fresh mandate, new ideas and a renewed determination to agree a pragmatic solution that delivers the Brexit the British people voted for, while ensuring there is no hard Border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.“That is what parliament instructed me to do on Tuesday night.“Although Jeremy Corbyn didn’t vote with us, he also believes the potential indefinite nature of the backstop is an issue that needs to be addressed with Brussels. That is exactly what I’m doing.”Last week Mrs May secured parliament’s backing to go back to Brussels in the hope of hammering out a fresh agreement that does not include the Irish Border backstop - which is unacceptable to the DUP and Brexiteer Tories - and which will command a majority in the House of Commons.Mrs May is due to report back to parliament on her negotiations with the EU on February 13th, with a further series of votes by MPs expected the following day.Wrangling in the Commons has seen backbench MPs put forward a range of alternative plans to find a way out of the situation.Mrs May found herself with some rare good news on Sunday after a new opinion poll suggested the Tories had moved into a seven-point lead over Labour.The Opinion poll for the Observer found that Mr Corbyn’s party had fallen from 40 per cent to 34 per cent since the key Commons votes on the mechanics of Brexit took place, falling behind the Tories who went from 37 per cent to 41 per cent.Public approval of Mr Corbyn’s personal handling of Brexit also fell to a new low of just 16 per cent, from 18 per cent two weeks previously.His disapproval rating is 61 per cent and he has support from little more than four in 10 Labour voters (42 per cent), according to the poll.But Downing Street denied reports in the Mail on Sunday that Mrs May’s team are planning for a general election on June 6th - the 75th anniversary of D-Day.Mr Corbyn used a trip to Scotland to call again for a snap election.Speaking on a visit to charities in Glasgow, he said that “the people who are bearing the brunt of nine years of austerity cannot wait years for a general election”.His deputy John McDonnell had earlier accused the prime minister of trying to get pro-Brexit Labour rebels to “sell their votes” in a “dangerous” bid to win support for her deal.The shadow chancellor claimed reports Mrs May might offer incentives to pro-Brexit backbenchers was the latest example of what he called the Conservatives’ use of “pork barrel” politics, following its post-election spending deal with the DUP.Mr McDonnell also said talk of such “contractual” arrangements, first reported in the Times, pledging investment in the constituencies of MPs who back Mrs May’s deal, was “dangerous for our democracy”.On a visit to Stoke-on-Trent on Saturday, he said: “I don’t think any MP will sell their votes in that way - that sort of bribery and corruption.”Whitehall could be overwhelmed by a no-deal Brexit with the UK department for transport unable to cope with more than two emergencies at once, according to leaked papers reported on Saturday.The Times said the British government made the admission in a document seen by its reporters that formed part of a contingency plan called Operation Yellowhammer.It reportedly states that in the wake of Britain crashing out of the EU without a deal, for months after, the Government may have to engage in a 247 emergency approach.And the priorities in the event of a no-deal will be “welfare, health, transport and security of UK citizens at home and abroad, and the economic stability of the UK”.The 37-page document, which sets out a guide to working in the department’s operations centre, also says the “scale of the operation is potentially enormous”, according to the Times. - PADeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

The  has dubbed it a “secret weapon”.It is the key to a newly hatched Plan B, supported by both hardliners like Rees-Mogg and some moderates in prime minister Theresa May’s Conservative party.If the prime minister fails to return from her negotiations in Brussels with what Boris Johnson has called a “freedom clause” to get out of the Irish backstop, expect Brexiteers to push what they call an Article 24 arrangement.Most of us aren’t well-versed in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the 1948 agreement to reduce trade barriers that is now part of the World Trade Organization.But Article 24 is well-known to experts as the rule that allows groups of countries to discriminate in favour of each other without having to treat all trading partners equally, as the World Trade Organisation’s (WTO) most-favoured nation rules require.Brexiteers argue that the UK and the EU can use Article 24 – and especially paragraph five’s provision for an “interim” arrangement that can last up to 10 years while a permanent deal is being negotiated – to agree a zero-tariff deal with the EU until a long-term free-trade agreement is developed.Presto: Brexit happens on March 29th with no food and medicine shortages, no Irish backstop, no border controls and no panic. If only.The problem here isn’t in drafting a deal quickly. It can be done over lunch, if you know what you are doing. Lorand Bartels of the University of Cambridge’s law faculty, does and did, recently devise a full, ready-made Article 24-compliant agreement, which he tweeted. It contains three brief articles as well as an annex and fits neatly onto three-quarters of a page.Brexiteers seized on the paper as proof an Article 24 Brexit is possible – but they missed the simple point of Bartels’s exercise.Striking a bare-bones trade agreement isn’t hard but it would never come close to replicating the frictionless system that allows the crankshaft used in a Mini to cross the Channel three times before the finished car rolls off the assembly line.It wouldn’t cover service industries, which account for 80 per cent of the UK economy and 45 per cent of total UK exports. A bare-bones Article 24 deal would say nothing about regulations, standards or access to each other’s customs databases.Nor, crucially, would it remove border friction. Brexiteers suggest Article 24 can be used to get rid of the hated backstop that would keep the Irish border open under May’s deal.But Article 24’s reference to measures to “facilitate frontier traffic” in adjacent countries was intended for grazing cattle – provided they return home after crossing the border. It doesn’t begin to address the unique circumstances in Northern Ireland.Of course, the UK can’t sign an Article 24 deal unilaterally it would require agreement from the EU. And why would the bloc consent to anything that imperils the €44.5 billion orce settlement that the UK has already signed up to, or put its cherished Irish backstop in jeopardy?Should Brexiteers insist on going the “interim” deal route – perhaps an easier sell politically – it still wouldn’t be a cinch. Such an agreement must include a timetable and a schedule of items that will be covered in the final agreement.Article 24 is vague about how long this has to be, but Peter Ungphakorn, who worked in the WTO secretariat for nearly two decades, reckons it’s a lot longer than a page.“It has to say what is being implemented in the interim, and give some indication of what the final deal will cover, and how the talks will get there,” he says.And then other WTO members could demand the interim agreement be changed, especially if they felt their own interests were hurt.They could even object if they think it sets a bad precedent. That could lead to disputes – just as the WTO’s dispute settlement mechanism is jammed because the Trump administration has blocked the appointment of new judges for it.Repeat something often enough and it acquires a veneer of respectability. Pretty soon, it just becomes accepted.That has been the case with a no-deal Brexit: It was unthinkable even for Leavers during the 2016 campaign then it was on the fringes of the debate now it is at its very heart, and accepted by four in 10 voters.So clarity on the facts something that never happened during the 2016 campaign, when a distinctly dubious claim about how Brexit would free up £350 million a week for the National Health Service was plastered across a red bus and believed by many is important.Getting a zero-tariff deal with the EU for goods is a reasonable long-term aim, even if it wouldn’t remove all the frictions, especially in services, and non-tariff barriers that will come into play after Brexit.Article 24 exists and is in use. But it isn’t a mechanism by which the extreme economic harm of a no-deal departure can be avoided.It is time to put the idea to rest, before someone puts it on the side of a bus. – BloombergDeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Johannes ElseleAFPGetty ImagesThis week the bid to take on Donald Trump, the presumed Republican nominee in the 2020 presidential election, stepped up a gear.Senator Kamala Harris officially launched her campaign in Oakland, California, gaining primetime TV coverage on an otherwise quiet Sunday afternoon. On Friday, Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey announced his bid.But it was another well-known Democrat who ruffled most feathers. Howard Schultz, the former chief executive of Starbucks, announced he was mulling a run. Though he describes himself as a “lifelong Democrat”, the billionaire businessman announced on CBS’s 60 Minutes that he would run as an Independent if he decides to contest.“We look at both parties, we see extremes on both sides,” he said. “The American people are exhausted. Their trust has been broken. And they are looking for a better choice.”The reaction from Democrats was swift and unequivocal. “We’ve seen this movie before,” snapped Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the Florida congresswoman who chaired the Democratic National Committee during the last presidential primary campaign. “He doesn’t quite grasp the depth of the impact that that decision would have on our ability to defeat Donald Trump,” she said. “It would be incredibly damaging.”Ms Wasserman Schultz was referring to past presidential runs by Independents. The ghosts of Ross Perot and Ralph Nader still stalk the collective Democratic and Republican memory. In the 1992 presidential election, Mr Perot staged a strong third-party bid, winning 19 per cent of the popular vote, which many Republicans still believe cost George HW Bush the election.Meanwhile, Democrats are still wounded by the 2000 presidential campaign when Green Party candidate Nader received more than 97,000 votes in Florida. Given that the state was ultimately won by George W Bush by only 537 votes following one of the most contentious recounts in history, many believe Mr Nader cost Al Gore the presidency.There are also examples from more recent history. Some Democrats will never forgive Jill Stein, who ran for the Green Party in 2016. She won more votes in Wisconsin than Mr Trump’s winning margin over Hillary Clinton in the state.Mr Schultz has hit back. He believes he represents a centrist vision that many Americans can relate to. Describing himself as a fiscal conservative but with socially-liberal views on issues such as abortion and gun control, the 65-year-old has cited the fact that 40 per cent of Americans identify themselves as Independent.But analysts have pointed out that despite this, most voters have a favourable view of either one of the two main parties and are unlikely to vote for an Independent in anything near the numbers that could deliver victory in the electoral college system. While many Democrats believe the two-party system is flawed, they also believe that now is not the time to fix it, when the prospect of a second Trump term looms.As well as the possibility of a Schultz bid fracturing the vote in the presidential election, the billionaire’s intervention has given Democrats another headache by exposing the isions between the more progressive and centrist wings of the party. As it faces a crowded field of primary contenders, he has forced a very public conversation this week about what kind of Democrat should run in 2020. More than two years after the acrimonious primary battle between Bernie Sanders and Mrs Clinton, the isions over the kind of politics represented by both are still not resolved.Fresh from a successful House campaign in the midterms which returned dozens of women, non-white and progressive candidates, the liberal wing of the party has a new spring in its step. So far, more leftist candidates have declared, with Elizabeth Warren proposing a tax on high earners, which Mr Schultz, unsurprisingly, opposes.Ms Harris too has been flaunting her liberal credentials, confirming this week that she supports Medicare for all, a proposal that will delight the more liberal wing of the party, but may not attract centrist suburban voters fearful of losing their healthcare plans.But others believe the party needs to tack towards the centre in order to guard against another Trump victory. Already this week Joe Biden, who is also mulling a run, highlighted his centrist credentials and willingness to work across the aisle during an appearance in Washington DC.As the Democratic field begins to take shape, the key question for potential candidates is how they will position themselves within this ideological framework.Mr Schultz may never formally launch a campaign. But he has started an important conversation about what kind of candidate can take on Mr Trump."},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2017/10/12/TELEMMGLPICT000140439032_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"parliament accused conflict interest rejects nda debate","story":"John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, refused to allow Maria Miller to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerfulHouse of CommonsMaria Miller, the Tory MP, last night accused Parliament of a conflict of interest over Britain\u0027s MeToo scandal after it emerged she had been blocked from questioning the Government over it.The Daily  can reveal John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, yesterday refused to allow Ms Miller, who chairs the women \u0026amp equalities Commons select committee, to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerful, including the Topshop tycoon Sir Philip Green.Helen Jones, chairman of the petitions select committee, also rejected calls to allow a parliamentary debate on non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) after two separate petitions demanding a change to the law between them secured 250,000 signatures. It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination.

His wild boar supplier happens to help with grey squirrel culling, and sends the carcasses down to the restaurant.He said that customers are increasingly interested in eating cruelty-free wild meat and minimising their carbon footprint, which makes squirrel a popular choice.He told The Sunday : “Squirrel is one of the most sustainable proteins you can cook really. It is almost exactly the same in taste as rabbit.“It\u0027s tasty, it\u0027s not as gamey as rabbit, it\u0027s nice white meat. It\u0027s good to cook down slowly and make stews from and ragus for lasagne.It\u0027s very good for you, it\u0027s quite lean.There are 5 million gray squirrels and only about 150,000 red squirrels at the moment, a record low. Because there aren\u0027t really any predators left for the gray squirrels the population is booming and they are taking over the red squirrel habitat.I think sustainable eating is becoming more popular now. More and more people are more conscious of their carbon footprint and the damaging additives that get put in their food. I grew up in South East London and hadn\u0027t heard of wild food. Now wild food is everywhere.”Kevin Tickle, who runs Michelin-starred restaurant The Forest Side in Cumbria, uses the fact he is in a red squirrel conservation area to his advantage.He has had a “critter fritter”, a grey squirrel croquette, on his acclaimed tasting menu since the restaurant opened in 2016.Chef Kevin Tickle and his \u0026#34critter fritter\u0026#34, which contains confit squirrelHe told The : “They\u0027re a pest, we are stuck bang in the middle of a red squirrel conservation area.“I also enjoy shooting, I shoot quite a lot of greys so it make sense to put it on the menu - if we shoot them we should cook with them.”Mr Tickle said customers enjoy the unusual option, adding: “95 per cent of people go for it, it\u0027s on every menu. They find it quite exciting.”Suppliers are also reporting that the meat is becoming more popular. Robert Gooch, director and owner of the Wild Meat company, said squirrel has risen in popularity over the past five year and is now their third biggest seller after venison and pheasant.One squirrel, which feeds one, costs just under £5 on on the company’s website, with the best meat being found on the hind legs.Mr Gooch said It\u0027s our third best seller at the moment. Consumers are very concerned about the stress that farmed animals go through in their lives so are more interested in wild meat.“Eating meat from animals that are killed or culled anyway is sustainable otherwise it would be waste.“Game meat is also very popular in the paleo diet.”Please review our commenting policyAmazon Alexa voice assistant could soon make 999 calls  Distraught mum of missing student Libby Squire thanks students as search enters third dayComment: I\u0026#39ve lost Remainer friends because I backed Brexit compromiseComment: Where is Britain\u0026#39s museum to show the evils of Communism?Comment: Why do liberal luvvies hate Israel so much? How online trolls who hate \u0026#39Lady Megbeth\u0026#39 are taking over the genteel world of royal watching Comment: The Church should call us to debate moral purpose, not act as an echo chamber of the Left Sweden\u0026#39s first new conscripts prepare to repel Russian invadersPope visits UAE in first for Gulf state as \u0026#39important step\u0026#39 for dialogue between Christians and MuslimsUK weather: Motorists urged to delay travel as England sees coldest night of winterOwls should be used to help abused children open up in therapy sessions, says charity boss\u0026#39Once in a century\u0026#39 floods hit northeast AustraliaMinister backtrack on trains Wi-Fi John Constable sketches found among box of dusty drawings by son of playwright during clearoutMayans M.C, review: this Sons of Anarchy spin-off is just as bloody and overheated Royal Marines vs US commandos: \u0026#39First World War stuff\u0026#39 as British troops pass urban battle test in Mojave desertForeign aid for ‘gap year apprenticeships’ Police turn to Ancestry website to help crack identity fraud casesVictims to be able challenge parole board decisions through the Justice Secretary in post-Worboys reformsMental health crises account for one in ten military evacuations, figures released under FOI showWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/02/02/TELEMMGLPICT000187161241_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"pope visits uae first gulf state blue collar catholic community","story":"Expat children hold the candles while serving during the mass at St. Francis of Assisi Catholic Church in Jebel Ali in DubaiPope Francis will make a landmark visit to the United Arab Emirates this week, where he is due to meet government officials, senior Islamic clerics and hold a stadium mass for 135,000 mostly low-paid South East Asian migrant workers.It is the first time a Pontiff has visited the Gulf region, where the majority of the population is Muslim, most laws, financial services and customs are based on Islam, and there are restrictions on the promotion of Christianity and other non-Islamic religions.Bishop Paul Hinder of the Apostolic Vicariate of Southern Arabia (which covers the UAE, Oman and Yemen) described the visit as “an important step in the dialogue between Muslims and Christians” and urged that it “contribute to mutual understanding and peace-making in the Middle East.”In parallel to Pope Francis’ visit, the UAE is also hosting 700 erse religious leaders and scholars – including leading moderate Sunni authority Dr Ahmed Al Tayeb, the Grand Imam of Al Azhar in Egypt and the Chairman of the Muslim Council of Elders – at a Global Conference of Humanity.Despite the dominance of Islam, the UAE is home to more than one million practising Catholics, mainly blue-collar workers from the Philippines, India, Nepal and Sri Lanka. Among these communities there has been considerable excitement about the Pontiff’s visit and the Holy Mass scheduled for Tuesday morning.Two men and a girl pose for a selfie with a cutout image of Pope Francis ahead of his visit to the United Arab EmiratesNumbers for the tightly-controlled event however are limited and those wishing to attend were required to apply online at their church some weeks ago and then take part in a ticket draw.Many, like housemaid Marisa Martija, from the Philippines, were desperate to go to the mass, but didn’t apply because they didn’t think they would get the day off. The 45-year-old, who works 12 hours-a-day six-days a week for a family in Dubai, where she has lived for more than 10 years. “To me, it is like God is coming himself, but I can’t go because of my job,” she said sadly.In late January, more than a week after online applications closed, the government, which is providing free transport to the stadium from all over the country, announced private sector workers with tickets should be granted a day off to attend the mass, although it is not known how or whether this will be enforced. For those who cannot attend in person, there will be an internet livestream of the mass.Filipina accountant Mila Serbenia and her husband Sherwin, booked leave as soon as the mass date was announced last year. The mother-of-three, whose children live with family members back in the Philippines, said she had been prepared to use a day of leave to attend, but was happy it was now a designated holiday.“It is a rare opportunity to see the Pope,” she said. “When I watch him on You Tube or the news, I already get goosebumps, so to know I will see him in the flesh, I am very excited.  It will be a really great blessing and a once in a life time opportunity.”The 41-year-old added: “I know we are very lucky and blessed to have got tickets. A lot people wanted to go but the space is limited, and there are also people who can’t get the day off because of their work as nannies or in healthcare or other jobs like that.”Beyond the significance of the visit for the Catholic community, for the UAE, hosting Pope Francis is an opportunity to promote the country’s regional and global status and to demonstrate its recognition of its expatriate population and their religious beliefs.The Papal Visit is a centrepiece event of 2019, which the government has designated the Year of Tolerance.In a video address recorded days ahead of his Middle East trip, Pope Francis himself praised the UAE, describing itself as a country that is striving to be a model for co-existence, human fraternity, and meeting of faiths and civilisations.For some, however, the UAE’s tolerance branding jars with its authoritarian nature. In spite of its popularity as a holiday destination for Britons, the country, which is a leading player in the conflict in Yemen along side Saudi Arabia, a key regional ally, bans political parties and groups affiliated with the Muslim Brotherhood, and it routinely jails rights activists and critical voices.Last year the government found itself in the international spotlight over the jailing of British academic Matthew Hedges, who was convicted of espionage but later released. Last week, a Reuters report detailed how the UAE had hired former US National Security Agency (NSA) operatives to use state-of-the-art cyber-espionage tools to track human rights activists, journalists and foreign adversaries from Iran, Qatar and Turkey, as well as those who criticised the monarchy.“In the light of the news about intrusive surveillance on journalists and critics, and the instances of harassment against academics such as Matthew Hedges, it is essential to ask ourselves the true meaning of tolerance in the UAE\u0027s state rhetoric,” said Cinzia Bianco, a senior analyst, at Gulf State Analytics, a Washington-based thinktank.“Given the government\u0027s repression of political Islam, is it selective religious pluralism, of the kind that is appealing to international partners?” she asked.Hedges, now back home in the UK after spending seven months in largely solitary confinement in a UAE jail, described the Year of Tolerance as “a meaningless PR stunt”.“I do hope that more tolerance is practised in the UAE, but the reality is that with the level of paranoia felt amongst those in charge, I don’t think it will be,” he told the Sunday .Hiba Zayadin, a researcher within the Middle East ision of Human Rights Watch, also dismissed the Year of Tolerance as “empty rhetoric”. “There are so many examples of intolerance and repression in the UAE that it is almost laughable that they have this year of tolerance. It’s all about their image,” she said.Zayadin, who is based in Jordan, also said that given most of the people attending the mass would be low-paid migrants, she hoped Pope Francis would bring attention to the well-documented abuse of workers’ rights in the country, and that he also used his visit to address the conflict in Yemen.“We would urge that this visit puts pressure on the UAE, a prominent player in Yemen, to investigate alleged serious abuses by their armed forces in the country and those of the Yemeni forces that they are supporting.”Pope Francis, who is known for his outspokenness, has already made several public appeals for a ceasefire in Yemen and called for more humanitarian support for the millions affected by the war there.Father Michael O Sullivan, who is co-ordinating the Papal visit on behalf of the Apostolic Vicariate of Southern Arabia, said Yemen would certainly be addressed during the Pontiff’s 36-hour stay in the country, but he did not expect direct criticism against the UAE or its allies.“The situation here is quite different from any other normal country, in that we are all guests here and not only are invited to behave as guests, but also to appreciate the host country,” he said.Please review our commenting policyAmazon Alexa voice assistant could soon make 999 calls  Distraught mum of missing student Libby Squire thanks students

weathermotorists urged delay travel britain sees coldest","story":"Abandoned cars on the A30 in Basingstoke after Saturday\u0026#39s snowfallMotorists have been urged to delay travelling until this afternoon as roads across the south and east of England are covered in dangerous ice, after England saw its coldest night of the winter so far.Weather warnings are in place for the fifth day in a row after temperatures last night tumbled across Britain.A low of minus 11.7C (12.4F) was recorded at Chillingham Barns in Northumberland in the early hours of Sunday morning, the Met Office said.In Scotland, a low of minus 12.6C (9.3F) was seen at Braemar in the Highlands, although it was a few degrees off the minus 15.4C seen there on Thursday.Elsewhere on Sunday morning, the coldest spot in Wales was at Swyddffynnon in Dyfed, where minus 6.5C (20.3F) was seen, while in Northern Ireland the lowest temperature recorded was minus 2.6C (27.3F) in Katesbridge, Co Down.The Met Office have warned that areas with heavy snowfall should expect it to have turned to ice overnight and any car travel should be taken in the afternoon if possible, so that roads can be treated with grit.Simon Partridge, a meteorologist at the Met Office said: “The main concern is black ice on the roadways, and we simply need time to get to the most at-risk areas.“If you can travel later, please do,” he added.“Today is a Sunday, thankfully, so there are expected to be fewer cars on the roads.”The big freeze could extend into next week with South Western Railway services warning that their trains could be disrupted until 12:00 on Monday.The company said that they are aiming to provide a full service, but depending on conditions there is the possibility of delays or some alterations.Temperatures have not been so low since December 2010, when Scotland reached -21.3C.In the West Country, Bristol airport opened yesterday after snow caused the runway to shut on Friday, but temperatures still dropped to -4C overnight.Yesterday, sleet and snow continued to impact highways across Kent and Hampshire, causing treacherous conditions.In East Lothian, Scotland, a woman fell into the River Tyne trying to save a dog that had fallen through the ice. The woman was rescued but the dog did not survive.Thames Valley Police said that they rescued an eight-week old baby from an overturned vehicle that had come off an icy stretch of road in Bracknell.Sporting fixtures across the UK were postponed because of the weather including Bath vs Gloucester in rugby union and Accrington Town vs Blackpool in football.A time exposure of a couple standing beneath the Angel of the North in GatesheadThere were reports of drivers stuck past midnight on Friday on some routes, with issues reported on the A21, A229 and A249 in Kent, as well as the A339, A30 and M3 in Hampshire.One motorist who gave his name as Joey told the BBC he was forced to eat snow off the roof of his car after he became trapped on the M3.Trees brought down by the weight of snow are cleared in Walderslade, KentKent Police said it had seen an incredibly busy night with multiple vehicles stuck.The force also said there had been numerous RTCs (road traffic collisions) and vehicles going the wrong way on the motorway.“Of course we discourage any motorists driving in the wrong direction due to the danger this poses,” a spokesperson told The .Please review our commenting policyAmazon Alexa voice assistant could soon make 999 calls  Distraught mum of missing student Libby Squire thanks students as search enters third dayComment: I\u0026#39ve lost Remainer friends because I backed Brexit compromiseComment: Where is Britain\u0026#39s museum to show the evils of Communism?Comment: Why do liberal luvvies hate Israel so much? How online trolls who hate \u0026#39Lady Megbeth\u0026#39 are taking over the genteel world of royal watching Comment: The Church should call us to debate moral purpose, not act as an echo chamber of the Left Pope visits UAE in first for Gulf state as \u0026#39important step\u0026#39 for dialogue between Christians and MuslimsSweden\u0026#39s first new conscripts prepare to repel Russian invadersGrey squirrel is on the menu, as diners turn to the wild meat to help boost the redsOwls should be used to help abused children open up in therapy sessions, says charity boss\u0026#39Once in a century\u0026#39 floods hit northeast AustraliaMinister backtrack on trains Wi-Fi John Constable sketches found among box of dusty drawings by son of playwright during clearoutMayans M.C, review: this Sons of Anarchy spin-off is just as bloody and overheated Royal Marines vs US commandos: \u0026#39First World War stuff\u0026#39 as British troops pass urban battle test in Mojave desertForeign aid for ‘gap year apprenticeships’ Police turn to Ancestry website to help crack identity fraud casesVictims to be able challenge parole board decisions through the Justice Secretary in post-Worboys reformsMental health crises account for one in ten military evacuations, figures released under FOI showWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/02/03/TELEMMGLPICT000185261352_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"voice assistants could soon make 999 calls","story":"Voice assistants such as Amazon Alexa could soon be used to make emergency callsIt could be the end of 999 calls.Scotland Yard is developing new technology that would allow victims of crime to use voice-activated personal assistants, such as Amazon\u0027s Alexa and Google Assistant, to contact the police.Under plans being drawn up by Britain\u0027s largest force, people would simply have to shout for help - and any compatible in-range technology would notify the police. A report seen by The Sunday Times reveals that Scotland Yard think voice assistants - currently used by around 3m Brits - will change the face of police contact. It states that the plans being drawn up by the politan Police Force would allow an incoming demand from a home automation bot, rather than from a human.   Work is already under way to design the technology capabilities of the future contact centre and to consider potential developments in this area.The plans could be rolled out within the next 18 months.

Ahrendts said, “I always say that the stores are Apple’s biggest product. I think that the architecture of the stores, that’s our hardware and what we do inside is the software. This is an updated software release of the in-store experience. We have over 50 new sessions. Altogether there are 18,000 sessions a week worldwide.”She went on to say that when the Apple Stores were created by Steve Jobs, that the staff were not there to sell. “You know, Steve built Apple Retail. And he told the teams when he hired them that they\u0027re not allowed to sell. He said they have no commission, no quotas. He told them, ‘Your job is to enrich their lives and you have to do it through the lens of education.’ He also said that Apple is the crossroads between liberal arts and technology. Well, we were brilliant in the stores at technology. But how do we unlock that liberal arts piece?”“Being a creative all my life, it\u0027s kind of a dream job for me to help communities be more creative,” Karl Heiselman, a former CEO of brand consultants Wolff Olins, explained. Apple employs staffers in its stores called Creative Pros, who are as heavily trained as the people in the Genius Bars. “We have 3,400 Creative Pros organised by passion or theme –\u0026nbspso photography, music, art and design, coding and app development. They go deep on each one of those, and these people are amazing. Some of them are Emmy winners, celebrated artists and musicians.”Ahrendts added:\u0026nbsp“If you’re a photographer and that’s your passion, we’ll help make you a better photographer, we’ll demo a lens for you. That whole experience of what you do with your iPhone, we want to give you a rich physical experience as well.” The Creative Pros were key to developing the new sessions.Heiselman also made clear that these people are not there just to talk at you. “The thing that defines Today at Apple is it’s not just sharing your story, everyone gets a hands-on. That participatory piece is very important. Because we always say you don\u0027t want to create a session which is like something you can do on the Internet. So maybe an illustrator might share their story and their work and then we hand out iPads and say it’s your turn. We try to, as much as we can, have the audience give it a go.”So, give it a go I did, at previews of the new schedule.New Apple handset to feature three cameras for 3D imagesThe world’s tech giants are about the feel the pinchApple blocks Facebook from installing its internal apps on iPhonesThere are three kinds of sessions in Today at Apple: Skills, Walks and Labs – though the basic sessions introducing customers to Apple products and the ones aimed at explaining accessibility features will continue as before.Skills are the sessions which focus on a particular feature, such as the one I attended on GarageBand, Apple’s deceptively complex music creation app: it looks simple from the outside but is extensive and feature-rich.\u0026nbspI’ve used it but hadn’t been aware of the seemingly endless range of drums available in it. As with all Today at Apple events, you don’t need to bring your own Apple product, or even own one. They’re supplied when you get there, including – to the relief of the other customers in the Apple Store – Beats headphones to keep my attempts at music private. The purpose of the session was pretty specific, to create a beat using the beat sequencer.There are three sections to each event, inspiration, participation and celebration. This means introducing the topic in enough detail to get people wanting to try it and then let them loose on doing it. The final section involved participants sharing their newly created beats. Of course, sharing what you’ve done is voluntary.The Walks events begin inside an Apple Store and then move outdoors. Photography walks have been a staple of Today at Apple for a while, often showing locals parts of their towns they’ve never really seen before. I went to an Art Walk using the amazingly detailed digital illustration app, Procreate. Armed with an iPad Pro, we strolled the area around the store taking photos of colours that took our eye, from a pale green leaf to an eye-searingly bright yellow fire hydrant. These colours were incorporated into the app’s palette and from there we were encouraged to create our own art. My effort, which a psychiatrist might call a cry for help, is below.Walks are the most popular type of session, Heiselman said.And then there are the Labs. These are the most indepth of the events, lasting up to 90 minutes. I tried out \u0027Video Lab: Small Screen Magic, co-created with Zach King\u0027,\u0026nbspwhich concentrated on how to use a jump-cut technique in Apple’s short video app, Clips. The huge video wall was the focus here, where a specially recorded video introduction\u0026nbspfrom King, a YouTube star known for his “digital sleight of hand” was screened.This screen, by the way, has become so central to these stores that the staff jokingly refer to them as being powered by “Wall OS”. And it’s a magnet: once the session started, scores of people who happened to be in the store stopped to hover and watch.The participation section here was particularly fun and the Apple Store was momentarily taken over by the simulation of vanishing and reappearing chairs while attendees performed precipitous prat falls. When edited together, the final cut movies were shown on the wall.All these sessions are free, with materials provided and no selling involved, though the Creative Pros are knowledgeable about the company’s products as well, so can advise you if you’re interested.\u0026nbspAnd those Pros are pretty remarkable. Ahrendts said they’d been training for months, and it shows. They are professional, unflappable and relaxed performers, eager to share their knowledge and their passion.When Apple’s iPhone sales have dipped, as revealed in the latest figures, it’s interesting to see a company make a considerable investment in staffing sessions like this.\u0026nbspBut it’s a cool way to tempt people through its doors.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

How much is Germany’s slowdown actually due to Brexit? And how damaging would a no-deal scenario be for Europe’s largest economy?Click to followThe IndependentGermany’s Economy Minister, Peter Altmaier, this week unveiled a rather brutal downgrade in his country’s official growth forecast for 2019, from 1.8 per cent to just 1 per cent. This came on the back of the worst year of GDP growth for Germany (1.5\u0026nbspper cent in 2018) in five years.And one of the reasons Mr Altmaier cited for the downgrade was the negative impact of Brexit.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialIf German politicians like Mr Altmaier appreciate that their own country’s economic self-interest is tightly related to avoiding a no-deal Brexit that could change the terms of trade of the EU-UK Brexit negotiations, goes the thinking.But does the logic here stand up? How much is Germany’s slowdown actually due to Brexit? And how damaging would a no-deal scenario even be for Europe’s largest economy?Germany slumps to worst growth in five years in 2018Germany exported around $95bn of goods and services to the UK in 2017, making us the country’s fourth largest export market, after the US, France and China.But Andrew Kenningham, a Europe specialist at Capital Economics, is sceptical that a weakening UK economy ahead of Brexit was the primary reason for slowing German growth last year, noting that industrial disruption due to new automotive emissions regulations was influential in the third quarter contraction.“I don’t think most people would see Brexit see as the main reason for it,” he said.“It’s true that exports from Germany to the UK have been declining. They’ve probably been the weakest of its major export destinations. But they’ve also slowed a lot in China, they’ve slowed to other emerging economies, including Turkey and Russia. It’s not just exports to the UK have collapsed while everyone else is doing fine.”Oliver Rakau, a Frankfurt-based economist for Oxford Economics, says Mr Altmaier was simply listing the long menu of reasons for the slowdown, rather than singling out Brexit.He suspects, based on data released previously in Beijing, that the big drag in terms of German exports in the final quarter of 2018 will turn out to be due to waning demand in China rather than the UK.But Mr Kenningham suggests that Mr Altmaier might have mentioned Brexit for political reasons, rather than economic ones.The economy minister has been vocal for some time about the importance of avoiding a no-deal Brexit and has suggested that the UK should be allowed to extend the Article 50 process to avoid the 29 March cliff edge.But what about the hugely important German car industry? Here the bigger hit to business has been Donald Trump’s trade wars, rather than Brexit, according to analysts.Nevertheless, concerns about Brexit could be dampening corporate business investment in Germany, which has been relatively weak.Exports falling – but not just to the UKBut what about a no-deal Brexit in March? How damaging would that be for Germany? Could that rising threat galvanise politicians in Berlin?In the long-term the IMF estimates that the UK being forced to trade on bare World Trade Organisation terms would cost the UK almost 4 per cent of GDP, versus less than 0.5 per cent for Germany.But what about the immediate impact, the disruption in 2019?Mr Kenningham notes that Germany’s exports of goods and services to the UK account for around 3 per cent of its GDP.“Even if they were hit hard – say a 10 per cent fall for a few months – it wouldn’t have a huge impact if you look at it arithmetically,” he says.But he concedes that’s a narrow way of looking at it.And Mr Rakau thinks that a no-deal would certainly increase the chances of Germany tipping into recession.More pain for UK than Germany from no-deal BrexitSo could car companies, and German industry more broadly, come to the rescue of the UK government and put pressure on Ms Merkel to accommodate the British, perhaps at the expense of Ireland, which wants the backstop to be entirely untouched?Analysts are not expecting that.“I know it’s often cited in the UK that Germany industry will put on pressure – but I don’t foresee that,” says Mr Rakau.“Even the German industrial associations have put out press releases saying this is for the British side to sort out.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Two thirds of the earnings came from the cloud computing arm Amazon Web Services, which boasts fatter margins than Santa after a sackful of mince pies. It\u0026nbsphas a habit of defying analysts expectations on the upside which it did this time around. \u0026nbspDespite all this, Wall Street managed to get itself into a tizzy. Its scribblers and analysts drew their breath in through their teeth and pushed out a cloud of critical comment. The reason: the firm\u0027s guidance for revenues in the three month current quarter came in at\u0026nbspbetween $56bn (£43bn) and $60bn. That was\u0026nbspa shade below the $60.7bn they had pencilled it.\u0026nbspFor exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialAmazon rolls out new delivery robot called ScoutAmazon builds vest for workers to protect them from robotsThe small miss was big enough for the shares to take a tumble in after market trading, when they lost more than\u0026nbsp5 per cent of their value.\u0026nbspWhen you consider that Amazon is capitalised at $840bn in total, that\u0027s a lot of value to shed. Some $45bn in fact.In sterling terms that amounts to £34bn, which a third more than you buy all the shares in Tesco for. The latter is capitalised at just under £22bn.\u0026nbspThe number crunchers were particularly concerned about the giant’s international business, which is still losing money.\u0026nbspAlthough losses have been falling, the Indian government has thrown a fly into the ointment with new rules designed to protect local businesses from giant foreign e commerce operators.\u0026nbspIt has done the sort of thing Britain’s bombed out bricks and mortar retailers have been calling upon our Government to have a go at, without (to date) much success.\u0026nbspWhile this has resulted in the removal of some of products from Amazon’s website, the company has responded by hunkering down and promising to keep at it. Which is what it always does.\u0026nbspOh and finance chief Brian Olsavsky says it’s going to spend more money this year. There is no greater exponent of that old proverb “you’ve got to spend money to make money” than Amazon.There are many, many reasons for criticising the monster this business has become, and feeling ambivalent about the impact it has had on the world.\u0026nbspIts workers are sometimes treated very poorly. It has had a devastating effect on other businesses. It pays about enough tax to buy a couple of Echo Dots (that’s the company’s crazily high selling crazily cheap mini speaker) and a month’s subscription to Amazon Music to go with them.Then there’s the corporate welfare it’s been sucking in back home in America. \u0026nbspYet you still have to admire the way its founder and CEO Jeff Bezos seems sublimely unconcerned about the huffing and puffing of analysts and commentators in response to the latest quarterly results.\u0026nbspI even saw one saying they thought the best may be over for the business.

Small businesses are most at risk from a hard Brexit, while consumers will also be affected, said Kevin Kingston, the group’s chief executive. Danske is one of the main banks in Northern Ireland, having taken over Northern Bank in 2004. “A hard Brexit would undoubtedly have an impact on a whole range of sectors and inidual businesses right across Northern Ireland,” he told reporters in Belfast.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trial“That converts into lower economic growth and businesses making tough decisions about the number of people they employ and their investment.“That, inevitably, will have an impact on consumers in Northern Ireland and the financial affairs of people on the street.”Created with Sketch.Brexit threatens life on the Irish border: in pictures Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.An abandoned shop is seen in Mullan, Co Monaghan.

Companies are willing to shell out huge sums of money for a portion of the airtime during the Super Bowl, with prices climbing every year and reaching more than $5m (£3.8m) for a 30 second slot in 2018.

Tom Petty’s performance is often omitted from rankings of the best Super Bowl halftime shows, but we’re including it here because he absolutely crushed it. Kicking things off with “American Girl”, he followed it up with “Won’t Back Down”, “Full Moon Fever” and the emotional “Free Fallin’”, rounding off with a stirring rendition of “Runnin’ Down a Dream”.U2 had the unenviable task of trying to raise everyone’s spirits just six months after the 911 attacks, but they did an admirable job, with performances of uplifting tracks like “Beautiful Day”.McCartney preceded the pop stars trying to outdo one another with extravagant stage designs and lavish costumes. Instead, he offered four beautifully played songs, of which the final one, “Hey Jude”, prompted an epic singalong with the crowd at Jacksonville’s EverBank Field Stadium.One of the few to outdo Katy Perry’s 2015 entrance was Madonna, three years earlier, who appeared on a giant golden chariot led by about a hundred buff men dressed as Roman soldiers. She brought out Nicki Minaj and MIA for “Give Me All Your Luvin’” and also performed hits “Like a Prayer”, “Music” and “Express Yourself”.There are few entrances as grand as standing on top of a giant golden lion with glowing eyes. Katy Perry went all out for her halftime show in 2015 with performances of “Roar”, “Dark Horse”, “California Gurls”, “Firework” and “Teenage Dream”. And who can forget the notorious Left Shark and his poor coordination?“Put the chicken fingers down and turn your television all the way up,” the Boss ordered. Springsteen’s 12-minute set started out with “Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out” and also included “Born to Run”, “Glory Days” and “Working on a Dream”.710 Janet Jackson and Justin Timberlake – 2004Janet Jackson delivered a blistering, brilliantly choreographed show that ended with “Rock Your Body”. But the moment Justin Timberlake ripped away her costume, and exposed her breast for approximately half a second, overshadowed all of that. The incident, dubbed “nipplegate”, even inspired the creation of YouTube. Jackson was turned into a scapegoat for the ensuing controversy, while Timberlake didn’t receive anywhere near as much scrutiny.One of the most outlandish halftime shows in recent memory, Lady Gaga began her performance by hurtling herself from the top of the stadium (attached to a harness, of course) – sparking a thousand memes. Once safely on the ground, she thrilled audiences with her biggest hits: “Poker Face”, “Born This Way”, “Telephone”, “Just Dance”, “Million Reasons” and “Bad Romance”.Beyonce basically ties with Prince for the greatest all-time Super Bowl performance. It was bold, it was fierce, it was virtually flawless. Bursting onto the stage with “Crazy in Love” after an a capella “Love on Top”, she threw down some of her best dance moves, before moving on to other hits including “End of Time” and “Baby Boy”. Lastly, there was a hysteria-inducing Destiny’s Child reunion with Michelle Williams and Kelly Rowland – a performance so powerful, the lights at the stadium cut out when it ended.The greatest. Of course, the Purple One wasn’t responsible for the rain that began to pour during his hair-raising 12-minute performance, which included covers of “We Will Rock You” and “All Along the Watchtower”. But the timing was so perfect, you wanted to believe he was. Following renditions of “1999Baby I’m a Star”, Prince closed on “Purple Rain” in what has to be ranked among one of his greatest live performances of that song.110 Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers  – 2008No frills, just good old-fashioned rock and roll.

The Super Bowl attracts huge audiences - last year, more than 100 million viewers tuned in to watch the game in the US and similar numbers are expected this year. For new brands, a Super Bowl ad can bring its products to the attention of millions of people instantly, which many would argue justifies the high fee. According to advertising consultancy, in 2018 some new brands raised brand awareness by 36.5 per cent after their Super Bowl ad aired. However, these days exposure can be achieved a lot more cheaply, and most of the brands snapping up space in the Super Bowl ad breaks are already well-known names, like Amazon, Pepsi and Budweiser.For companies like these, Super Bowl ads act as a signal to the world that their brand is doing well, and tells consumers that they can trust in their products.Super Bowl 2019: Odds, Vegas betting lines, moneyline and prop bets 10 Super Bowl commercials that have gone down in TV historyEverything you need to know about the 2019 Super BowlHow to watch Super Bowl 2019 It is virtually impossible to calculate the return on investment for a Super Bowl ad, but each year a handful of brands will win out in the battle to become a talking point long after the final whistle blows. And even if an ad goes viral for all the wrong reasons, it might not be a complete failure for the company behind it. “Even though a Super Bowl advertising campaign might not pay immediately in hard dollars and cents, if a business can afford to produce one of these stellar spots, they stand to earn new customers and build awareness on a scale unmatched by other outlets,” according to Peter Koeppel, founder and president of marketing agency Koeppel Direct.“Good or bad, though, impactful Super Bowl ads are the ones that are getting talked about. What a marketer can’t afford is an ad that completely fails to deliver. Because the Super Bowl is also sort of a Super Bowl of marketing, the competition is fierce – the commercials have to be memorable for them to pay off in the long run. “An ad that doesn’t give viewers something, for better or worse, won’t be a profitable one.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The average 10 year old consumes the equivalent to 13 sugar cubes a day, 8 more than is recommendedWhile there is not enough evidence of harm to recommend UK-wide limits on screen use, the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health have advised that children should avoid screens for an hour before bed time to avoid disrupting their sleep443 Breeding with neanderthals helped humans fight diseasesOn migrating from Africa around 70,000 years ago, humans bumped into the neanderthals of Eurasia. While humans were weak to the diseases of the new lands, breeding with the resident neanderthals made for a better equipped immune system543 Daily aspirin is unnecessary for older people in good health, study findsA study published in the New England Journal of Medicine has found that many elderly people are taking daily aspirin to little or no avail643 Vaping could lead to cancer, US study findsA study by the University of Minnesota\u0027s Masonic Cancer Centre has found that the carcinogenic chemicals formaldehyde, acrolein, and methylglyoxal are present in the saliva of E-cigarette users743 More children are obese and diabetic843 Most child antidepressants are ineffective and can lead to suicidal thoughtsThe majority of antidepressants are ineffective and may be unsafe, for children and teenager with major depression, experts have warned. In what is the most comprehensive comparison of 14 commonly prescribed antidepressant drugs to date, researchers found that only one brand was more effective at relieving symptoms of depression than a placebo. Another popular drug, venlafaxine, was shown increase the risk users engaging in suicidal thoughts and attempts at suicide943 Gay, lesbian and bisexual adults at higher risk of heart disease, study claimsResearchers at the Baptist Health South Florida Clinic in Miami  focused on seven areas of controllable heart health and found these minority groups were particularly likely to be smokers and to have poorly controlled blood sugar1043 Breakfast cereals targeted at children contain \u0027steadily high\u0027 sugar levels since 1992 despite producer claimsA major pressure group has issued a fresh warning about perilously high amounts of sugar in breakfast cereals, specifically those designed for children, and has said that levels have barely been cut at all in the last two and a half decadesNew guidance by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), the body which determines what treatment the NHS should fund, said lax road repairs and car-dominated streets were contributing to the obesity epidemic by preventing members of the public from keeping active1243 New menopause drugs offer women relief from \u0027debilitating\u0027 hot flushesA new class of treatments for women going through the menopause is able to reduce numbers of debilitating hot flushes by as much as three quarters in a matter of days, a trial has found.1343 Doctors should prescribe more antidepressants for people with mental health problems, study findsResearch from Oxford University found that more than one million extra people suffering from mental health problems would benefit from being prescribed drugs and criticised “ideological” reasons doctors use to avoid doing so.1443 Student dies of flu after NHS advice to stay at home and avoid A\u0026ampEThe family of a teenager who died from flu has urged people not to delay going to A\u0026ampE if they are worried about their symptoms. Melissa Whiteley, an 18-year-old engineering student from Hanford in Stoke-on-Trent, fell ill at Christmas and died in hospital a month later.1543 Government to review thousands of harmful vaginal mesh implantsThe Government has pledged to review tens of thousands of cases where women have been given harmful vaginal mesh implants.1643 Jeremy Hunt announces \u0027zero suicides ambition\u0027 for the NHSThe NHS will be asked to go further to prevent the deaths of patients in its care as part of a “zero suicide ambition” being launched today.1743 Human trials start with cancer treatment that primes immune system to kill off tumoursHuman trials have begun with a new cancer therapy that can prime the immune system to eradicate tumours. The treatment, that works similarly to a vaccine, is a combination of two existing drugs, of which tiny amounts are injected into the solid bulk of a tumour. 1843 Babies\u0027 health suffers from being born near fracking sites, finds major studyMothers living within a kilometre of a fracking site were 25 per cent more likely to have a child born at low birth weight, which increase their chances of asthma, ADHD and other issues1943 NHS reviewing thousands of cervical cancer smear tests after women wrongly given all-clearThousands of cervical cancer screening results are under review after failings at a laboratory meant some women were incorrectly given the all-clear. A number of women have already been told to contact their doctors following the identification of “procedural issues” in the service provided by Pathology First Laboratory.2043 Potential key to halting breast cancer\u0027s spread discovered by scientistsMost breast cancer patients do not die from their initial tumour, but from secondary malignant growths (metastases), where cancer cells are able to enter the blood and survive to invade new sites. Asparagine, a molecule named after asparagus where it was first identified in high quantities, has now been shown to be an essential ingredient for tumour cells to gain these migratory properties.2143 NHS nursing vacancies at record high with more than 34,000 roles advertisedA record number of nursing and midwifery positions are currently being advertised by the NHS, with more than 34,000 positions currently vacant, according to the latest data. Demand for nurses was 19 per cent higher between July and September 2017 than the same period two years ago.2243 Cannabis extract could provide ‘new class of treatment’ for psychosisCBD has a broadly opposite effect to delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main active component  in cannabis and the substance that causes paranoia and anxiety.2343 Over 75,000 sign petition calling for Richard Branson\u0027s Virgin Care to hand settlement money back to NHSMr Branson’s company sued the NHS last year after it lost out on an £82m contract to provide children’s health services across Surrey, citing concerns over “serious flaws” in the way the contract was awarded2443 More than 700 fewer nurses training in England in first year after NHS bursary scrappedThe numbers of people accepted to study nursing in England fell 3 per cent in 2017, while the numbers accepted in Wales and Scotland, where the bursaries were kept, increased 8.4 per cent and 8 per cent respectively2543 Landmark study links Tory austerity to 120,000 deathsThe paper found that there were 45,000 more deaths in the first four years of Tory-led efficiencies than would have been expected if funding had stayed at pre-election levels.Hours of commuting may be mind-numbingly dull, but new research shows that it might also be having an adverse effect on both your health and performance at work.  Longer commutes also appear to have a significant impact on mental wellbeing, with those commuting longer 33 per cent more likely to suffer from depression2743 You cannot be fit and fatIt is not possible to be overweight and healthy, a major new study has concluded. The study of 3.5 million Britons found that even “metabolically healthy” obese people are still at a higher risk of heart disease or a stroke than those with a normal weight rangeWhen you feel particularly exhausted, it can definitely feel like you are also lacking in brain capacity. Now, a new study has suggested this could be because chronic sleep deprivation can actually cause the brain to eat itselfDavid Lloyd Gyms have launched a new health and fitness class which is essentially a bunch of people taking a nap for 45 minutes. The fitness group was spurred to launch the ‘napercise’ class after research revealed 86 per cent of parents said they were fatigued. The class is therefore predominantly aimed at parents but you actually do not have to have children to take part3043 \u0027Fundamental right to health\u0027 to be axed after Brexit, lawyers warnTobacco and alcohol companies could win more easily in court cases such as the recent battle over plain cigarette packaging if the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights is abandoned, a barrister and public health professor have said.3143 \u0027Thousands dying\u0027 due to fear over non-existent statin side-effectsA major new study into the side effects of the cholesterol-lowering medicine suggests common symptoms such as muscle pain and weakness are not caused by the drugs themselves3243 Babies born to fathers aged under 25 have higher risk of autismNew research has found that babies born to fathers under the age of 25 or over 51 are at higher risk of developing autism and other social disorders. The study, conducted by the Seaver Autism Center for Research and Treatment at Mount Sinai, found that these children are actually more advanced than their peers as infants, but then fall behind by the time they hit their teenage years.3343 Cycling to work ‘could halve risk of cancer and heart disease’Commuters who swap their car or bus pass for a bike could cut their risk of developing heart disease and cancer by almost half, new research suggests – but campaigners have warned there is still an “urgent need” to improve road conditions for cyclists.3443 Playing Tetris in hospital after a traumatic incident could prevent PTSDScientists conducted the research on 71 car crash victims as they were waiting for treatment at one hospital’s accident and emergency department. They asked half of the patients to briefly recall the incident and then play the classic computer game, the others were given a written activity to complete. The researchers, from Karolinska Institute in Sweden and the University of Oxford, found that the patients who had played Tetris reported fewer intrusive memories, commonly known as flashbacks, in the week that followed3543 Vaping backed as healthier nicotine alternative to cigarettes after latest studyVaping has been given an emphatic thumbs up by health experts after the first long-term study of its effects in ex-smokers.3643 Common method of cooking rice can leave traces of arsenic in food, scientists warnMillions of people are putting themselves at risk by cooking their rice incorrectly, scientists have warned.3743 Contraceptive gel that creates ‘reversible vasectomy’ shown to be effective in monkeysAn injectable contraceptive gel that acts as a ‘reversible vasectomy’ is a step closer to being offered to men following successful trials on monkeys.3843 Shift work and heavy lifting may reduce women’s fertility, study findsWomen who work at night or do irregular shifts may experience a decline in fertility, a new study has found.3943 Japanese government tells people to stop overworkingThe Japanese government has announced measures to limit the amount of overtime employees can do – in an attempt to stop people literally working themselves to death.4043 High blood pressure may protect over 80s from dementiaIt is well known that high blood pressure is a risk factor for dementia, so the results of a new study from the University of California, Irvine, are quite surprising. The researchers found that people who developed high blood pressure between the ages of 80-89 are less likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease (the most common form of dementia) over the next three years than people of the same age with normal blood pressure.4143 \u0027Universal cancer vaccine’ breakthrough claimed by expertsScientists have taken a “very positive step” towards creating a universal vaccine against cancer that makes the body’s immune system attack tumours as if they were a virus, experts have said. Writing in Nature, an international team of researchers described how they had taken pieces of cancer’s genetic RNA code, put them into tiny nanoparticles of fat and then injected the mixture into the bloodstreams of three patients in the advanced stages of the disease. The patients\u0027 immune systems responded by producing killer T-cells designed to attack cancer. The vaccine was also found to be effective in fighting “aggressively growing” tumours in mice, according to researchers, who were led by Professor Ugur Sahin from Johannes Gutenberg University in Germany4243 Research shows that diabetes drug can be used to stop first signs of Parkinson’sScientists in a new study show that the first signs of Parkinson’s can be stopped. The UCL study is still in its research period but the team are ‘excited’. Today’s Parkinson’s drugs manage the symptoms of the disease but ultimately do not stop its progression in the brain.4343 Drinking alcohol could reduce risk of diabetesA new study shows that drinking alcohol three to four days a week could reduce the risk of diabetes. Wine was found to be most effective in reducing the risk due to the chemical compounds that balance blood sugar levels. 143 Cancer breath test to be trialled in BritainThe breath biopsy device is designed to detect cancer hallmarks in molecules exhaled by patients243 Average 10 year old has consumed the recommended amount of sugar for an adult By their 10th birthdy, children have on average already eaten more sugar than the recommended amount for an 18 year old.

However, Rutgers University in the United States last year\u0026nbspconcluded students scored the equivalent of half a grade less in end-of-term tests if they were allowed to use their devices for non-academic reasons in their classes.Children will also be told to break off at least every two hours and avoid social media before bedtime, according to\u0026nbspguidance from chief medical officer Dame Sally Davies,\u0026nbspThe Daily Mail reported. Parents will be told to limit children’s screen time to protect their health.The UK would be following in the footsteps of European counterparts if schools were to introduce a mobile phone ban, with French pupils being told to leave their smartphones at home when they returned from their summer holidays last year.Teachers in the UK have also complained about pupils being distracted or using the phones to take upskirt images of staff in the classroom.Toddler development delayed by too much screentime, research suggestsMr Gibb is the latest figure in education to support such a move, with former Ofsted head Sir Michael Wilshaw saying devices were disrupting lessons.Speaking at the Festival of Education at Wellington College last summer, Sir Michael said that “any sensible head would ban mobile phones”.He\u0026nbspadded: “It’s interesting that President Macron is now bringing in legislation in France to ban mobile phones in state schools in France. We should do the same here.\u0026nbspIt’s far too distracting for children having mobile phones. Texting, sexting, all this takes place.

In a new book, ‘Do They Mean Us’,\u0026nbspCatherine Lough\u0026nbspfinds the eastern European community there is fearful for its futureClick to followThe IndependentThe Lincolnshire town voted with a 75 per cent majority to leave the EUWhen I meet Martyn Chambers, deacon at St Mary’s Catholic Church in Boston, Lincolnshire, he describes the town as “geographically isolated”.Mike Cooper, a Conservative councillor, suggests that many Westminster politicians could not place Boston, or Lincolnshire, on a map.Boston is a picturesque market town, dominated by the medieval tower of St Botolph’s Church, known locally as the Stump.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialIn 2001, its population comprised just 55,750 people, 97 per cent of whom were white British. By 2011, the population had grown to 64,637 people, 15.1 per cent of whom were immigrants.As people migrated from eastern Europe to work in local farms and factories, Cooper suggests the demographic shift was a “massive, seismic change”. He cites this as the reason behind the 2016 EU referendum result.What you can do to help demand a Final Say on BrexitThis “isolated”\u0026nbspplace had the highest recorded percentage of Leave voters in the country, with 75.6 per cent voting for Brexit. For the national media, Boston was suddenly on the map.Local politicians give various reasons for Boston’s support of Brexit. Anton Dani, an independent councillor who formerly represented Ukip, blames the pace of change. “If you suddenly have an influx of 30,000 people, people start to resent that,”\u0026nbsphe says.Dani seems an unlikely Ukip candidate he is Moroccan-born\u0026nbspand his wife is Polish. Indeed, we discuss our families’ experiences of immigration – Dani moved to the UK in the 1980s, working briefly for Marco Pierre White: “My father emigrated from Argentina at the same time.”Now, he runs Café de Paris, a European-style deli in Bridge Street. Yet he criticises the lack of integration in Boston as a factor behind the result.Boston is rural and labour-hungry, so there can be no suggestion that migrants are competing with locals for jobs.Created with Sketch.Britain before Brexit: Yorkshire and the Humber Show all 16Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The Independent’s photographer Richard Morgan is examining his own country in the midst of Brexit’s chaos, scrutinising the contrasts of contemporary Britain and the ambivalence of modern Britishness.

I suppose it is meant to brighten the place up. People walk by to do their shopping, surrounded by stories of the city and the Yorkshire region. A man waits in the hallway, uses the pillar for support, and is told of another thing he is lacking in his life. The walls of this cafe are adorned with paintings of what it’s not, of what it would like to be, perhaps, hanging there like negative mirrors, reflecting back into the emptiness the vibrancy of Parisian cafe culture in full bloom. I wonder if this place used to be a shop selling meaning to the unfulfilled, like some kind of high-street church. It has long since closed down, but the sign remains, playing a joke on the emptiness of the facade. An arcade in the town centre reserves its slot machines in three languages: English, Romanian, Polish. The lady who works there doesn’t know what the second two languages are, but says they get a lot of Eastern Europeans coming in. She tells me I’m better off photographing the ‘spice people’ - addicts to the recently emerging drug known as ‘spice’. I follow a RAF parade through the streets, thinking about the relationship between the armed forces and the civilian high street. As they march past a casino, I consider the contrasting elements: control meets chance, order meets luck, preparation meets possibility. A sign promising redevelopment is a year out of date.

Maybe it has been left there as a joke, or as a warning, or as a work of art.The RAF parade lines up outside the Minster. I notice an arrangement of people that speaks to me about the role of women in modern British society: underrepresented, but central. Outside the the Grand Hotel there is a scene of contrasting ideas about Scarborough. Simultaneously, the town is represented by multiple images: a family holidaying, ideally a solitary man smoking and staring out to sea a town being attacked, under siege. I visit a cabaret show in the ballroom of the hotel. I look for a scene that portrays the stark differences between audience and performers: an injured, resting, healing limb serenaded by high-heeled sex appeal.A shop is closing down and is trying to get rid of its stock.

The graffiti and the initials of the National Front darkened the view of the British seaside.Cooper says the town has “always relied on overseas labour” but cites pressures on infrastructure and housing as a reason for the result. Unscrupulous landlords exploited the increasing demand.“We’ve found some absolute horror stories,” he says. “People living in sheds two storeys up. That’s why people said,\u0026nbsp‘enough is enough.’”Cooper acknowledges the government’s austerity measures may have exacerbated problems. Boston is a low-wage economy\u0026nbspand Boston Borough Council lacks the funding to build new homes (Boston is also on a flood plain, which makes it expensive to build).UK manufacturers stockpile at record pace in January ahead of BrexitOne of the local estates has no money for street lighting at night. “Then they say austerity doesn’t hurt people,” he says. Has it made him doubt his own party? “Yes.”Not everyone agrees that immigration levels have been excessive. The agricultural economy relies heavily on migrant labour.Lamb feels people voted for Brexit “partially out of ignorance”, yet were also misled by the Leave campaign. In her view, it simplified complex issues: “The thing with a referendum is\u0026nbspit’s one question that really covers a hundred, or a thousand questions.“But we are desperate for these people. The way we’ve treated them and made them feel will be to our cost.“People don’t realise how they actually fill the plate. How when you go to hospital, nine times out of 10, it’s not a migrant who’s taken your place, it’s a migrant looking after you”.Her words are borne out by research from the Migration Advisory Committee\u0026nbspthat found EU migrants contributed £4.7bn more in taxation than they received in benefits in 201617, as well as contributing “much more to the health service …\u0026nbspthan they consume”.The report does echo concerns in Boston about pressures on housing. Immigration can increase\u0026nbsprental prices through greater demand, yet the report suggests that, rather than being a net result of migration, these issues are partly caused by political decision-making\u0026nbspand local authorities with “a higher refusal rate on major developments”.Arguably, pressures on services are caused by a lack of planning and foresight from the government.Brexit: How austerity convinced residents to vote LeaveHow does the Polish community feel?For the Polish community, the referendum result has caused considerable uncertainty.Outside St Mary’s Church, I speak to Eva Kowalska, an administration worker who moved from Poland in 2006. She describes Boston then as “a small village” now, its streets are bustling.“Eastern Europeans built Boston, basically,” she says. “Ninety-nine per cent of the people in the fields and the factories were Polish.”After Brexit, Kowalska feels she can no longer plan for the future. She is unconvinced by Theresa May’s wavering assurances that EU migrants will be protected –\u0026nbspthe lack of clarity is too unsettling. “A lot of eastern Europeans are terrified,”\u0026nbspshe says.Kowalska had thought of Boston as her home, but now she feels uncomfortable. “I don’t want to feel like a stranger here,” she says.\u0026nbspHer experiences with locals have been positive\u0026nbspand she was shocked by the referendum result.Przemek Frankowski, who works in the White Hart Hotel, also supports the idea of a second referendum: “I’ve always been pro-EU – I feel it’s better to be within something bigger than being separate,” he says.He has lived here for 13 years and has never felt unwelcome in Boston (“I’ve blended within the British community”) but thinks the impact on services might have contributed to the result, as well as drunkenness from a minority of immigrants.He has not witnessed visible tension or racism, although he does recall hearing people say, “We want our country back” when television crews visited the town in 2016.For Frankowski, who has a young daughter, what concerns him most is uncertainty over the future of EU migrants in the UK.“That’s the one thing I would get worried about,” he says. “We hope we’re not going to be told, ‘Oh, well, I’m sorry but you have to go. We don’t want you anymore.’ That wouldn’t be fair on anybody.”Brexit humiliation is stark reminder of Britain’s waning influenceWe have seen the brutal reality of Brexit – time to revoke and reflectHow can we tackle this Brexit mess? Give more money to the northMiki Bura, a fellow employee who moved to Boston aged nine, says his parents felt shocked and unwelcome after the referendum. “People around here thought we were really coming to take over, but that’s not true,” he says. “All we’re trying to do is get a fair play in life.”Newly-arrived immigrants are understandably more nervous. Zlana and Zlatiana Goneva, who moved from Bulgaria in 2017, run a brightly painted café selling crepes and pastries. Zlana was stunned by the result:\u0026nbsp“We came here to live our whole life. When you hear people voted against us, it means they don’t like us.“It’s strange, because we don’t make problems. We work, we help their economy.”At St\u0026nbspMary’s, I speak with Martyn Chambers as Father Kowalski prepares for the Polish-language mass.Throughout our conversation, parishioners arrive bearing parcels for a Ukrainian children’s charity. When children sing in Polish at the front of the mass, the sense of belonging is palpable.Created with Sketch.10 things immigration has done for Britain Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The 1959 classic, that is, perhaps our greatest piece of industrial design, a miracle of packaging and revolution in motoring.

One abiding legacy we can thank Enoch for.It seems absurd that anyone would question the Polish community’s presence here.Chambers feels Boston is misrepresented as a fractured or ided place. “We had easily in excess of 20 nationalities at the English morning mass,” he explains. “Polish people attend the English mass. To make out the Polish community has been a problem ignores the other communities we’ve had for many, many years.”He points out the long-standing Keralan, Filipino and Portuguese communities here.For Chambers, people voted for Brexit because they were misled, especially with regard to promises about the NHS. “Politicians were throwing out facts and figures like confetti,” he says. Boston’s size and geographical isolation may also have led to resentment over rising immigration levels. “The difficulty for Bostonians was the speed of change.”Despite this, he thinks “there is a great sense of community. If you go into schools, the children all have friends of different nationalities.”Indeed, the Ofsted report for Staniland Academy, which has a high proportion of EAL (English as an Additional Language) students, describes pupils who are “curious about each other’s cultures and backgrounds, and get on noticeably well together”.“The changes are coming through the young people of the town,” says Chambers. “And I passionately believe that’s showing already.”Catherine Lough is a freelance journalist studying for an MA in international journalism at City, University of London.

According to the latest survey by\u0026nbspWhich?Travel, the Irish budget airline faces an uncertain future. To sustain its flying programme across Europe for 2019, the airline must sell 280 seats per minute. Yet according to the magazine: “Ryanair’s reputation has declined so much that thousands of respondents told the consumer champion that they would never again fly Ryanair, even if it was cheaper than its rivals.”The editor, Rory Boland, said of the airline: “It has spent the past two years cancelling thousands of flights, ruining hundreds of thousands of holidays and flouting the rules on compensation as well. The results of our survey show passengers are fed up. They should switch to one of their rivals, which prove that budget prices don’t have to mean budget service.”Ryanair’s share price has lost one-third in the past year, and is 40 per cent down on where it was in the summer of 2017. That was the summer when Ryanair started to upset passengers who choose not to pay for assigned seating. From May 2017, couples and groups who accepted “random seating” typically found themselves sitting in middle seats at the opposite ends of the aircraft. In September that year, thousands of passengers found their flights abruptly cancelled due to a shortage of pilots – which ultimately led to the grounding of 20,000 flights through the winter.\u0026nbspFor exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialThe airline then misrepresented its obligations to travellers whose flights it had cancelled, saying it was not responsible for finding departures on other airlines – even though the European air passengers’ rights rules (known as EC261) state carriers cancelling flights must pay for alternatives. Ryanair had its knuckles rapped by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA).The number of seats per minute Ryanair needs to sellSoon afterwards the airline gave in to demands by crew for union recognition, the first time it had happened in 32 years.The result: a string of strikes by pilots, cabin crew and airport staff. Many of them were coordinated by the International Transport Workers’ Federation, which said: “Demands of Ryanair workers – such as pay for all hours worked and an end to long-term agency employment – continue to go unaddressed.”\u0026nbspDuring 2018 many hundreds of flights were cancelled because of strikes by pilots and cabin crew. Some of the passengers affected sought compensation under EC261 regulations. Payouts are set at €250 (£223) for flights of up to 1,500km, and €400 (£357) for longer flights in Europe and North Africa. Their applications were rejected by Ryanair – which claimed the industrial action was caused by “extraordinary circumstances” and was “totally beyond the airline’s control”.But in another unprecedented intervention, the CAA urged grounded holidaymakers to claim their entitlement. Ryanair still refused, and in December 2018 the authority launched enforcement action, insisting “consumers should be compensated in accordance with Regulation EC261”. For an airline to change its cabin-baggage policy more than once a decade is unusual – but Ryanair passengers had to adhere to three different sets of rules in 2018.Now Martin Lewis, the MoneySavingExpert, has written to the chief executive, Michael O’Leary, about what he claims is a “systemic error” in the Ryanair booking process that changed travellers’ surnames in the same booking to be the same as the lead passenger’s. His organisation has sent a dossier of more than 160 cases to the CAA.Ryanair’s present travails are at odds with its image as the cheeky underdog. In the 1990s, as a tiny Irish airline, it seized on the European Union’s “open skies” policy to create its leading hub at Stansted airport, flying British travellers across Europe and providing Continental travellers with cheap access to London and beyond. But as Brexit approaches, some say the Irish carrier is in disarray, losing passengers in droves and seemingly destined for oblivion.How can a carrier that is apparently widely despised be selling seats at a rate of nearly five per second – and paying prodigious returns to shareholders?\u0026nbspYet Ryanair is set for another year as the most successful airline in Europe, flying close to 150 million people. How can a carrier that is apparently widely despised simultaneously be selling seats at a rate of nearly five per second – and, relative to its rivals, paying prodigious returns to shareholders? The answer lies in Ryanair’s business model, which takes the “keep it simple” principle to extremes.\u0026nbspThe airline has long operated only one type of aircraft, the Boeing 737-800. Pilots, cabin crew and engineers can work on any plane in the fleet. The 189 seats are another constant, avoiding the problems that other airlines – such as easyJet and British Airways – encounter when they “downsize” an aircraft.Ryanair has not always been faithful to Boeing – in the early days it used Romanian-built BAC 1-11 planes, and after it bought the KLM offshoot, Buzz, for a short while it had BAe146 jets in the fleet. But the path to success became apparent as the world assimilated the tragedy of 911. The attack on America changed much in aviation, with airlines cancelling flights and aircraft orders wholesale. And Ryanair was transformed by behaving in the opposite way .In the summer of 2001, Michael O’Leary was known in the airline business as a maverick, who had rescued an ailing regional airline by cutting fares to stimulate business. But by the end of September that year, he had become the fiercely controversial figure he remains – telling Radio 4’s\u0026nbspToday\u0026nbspprogramme that British Airways and other airlines were “screwing” the government for financial support.On 14 September 2001, the day that flights were allowed to resume across the US, with 50 new security directives in place, Boeing announced 25,000 lay-offs. In the next few days, Virgin Atlantic cut 1,200 jobs, together with its routes to Toronto and Chicago, while Aer Lingus shed 1,600 people – more than the total number employed by Ryanair. Two months after the tragedy, Ryanair predicted profits for the full financial year of close to £100m – about £10 for every passenger flown. Other airlines were haemorrhaging cash, or simply going bust (Ansett Australia, Swissair, Sabena of Belgium...).The order books of Airbus and Boeing were full of cancellations. With some almost-new jets being flown to the desert for storage, no one was buying new aircraft. Which, from the point of view of a fast-expanding, opportunistic airline is the ideal time to order some new planes. In bulk. On 24 January 2002, Ryanair ordered 100 Boeing 737s with options on 50 more – the largest ever deal for the world’s most popular plane. The cost per aircraft remains a closely guarded secret but was probably around half the list price.Created with Sketch.Travel Photographer of the Year 2018 Show all 16Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Low-cost aviation relies on keeping costs down. That is obvious to say, but much harder to do. Many elements of flying, such as fuel and air-traffic charges, are priced the same whether you are British Airways or Ryanair. But aircraft ownership costs are negotiable, and at a stroke Ryanair had achieved a deal way better than its rivals.With the fleet set to treble in size, the airline set about expanding its network in a very low-cost way: setting up operations at “secondary” airports. Budget travellers soon became accustomed to finding their way to and from Frankfurt Hahn (closer to Luxembourg than to the German financial hub), Girona (“Barcelona” in Ryanair’s view) and Charleroi (“Brussels south”). Regional authorities poured millions of euros in “marketing support” into Ryanair’s operations, with accusations that the airline was benefitting from state aid.The jury is still out on Ryanair’s play to be an airline for business travellers between Frankfurt and Manchester, for example, the Irish carrier has a single mid-afternoon round tripDuring an expansion that has proved, so far, recession-proof, the airline has long moved into the main airports for those cities, to the dismay of incumbents such as Lufthansa, Iberia and Brussels Airlines.The jury is still out on Ryanair’s play to be an airline for business travellers between Frankfurt and Manchester, for example, the Irish carrier has a single mid-afternoon round trip, while Lufthansa of Germany has five flights each way from dawn to late evening. Passengers on business want frequent flights and a near-certainty that they can get a seat on the next departure – yet Ryanair’s model is to fill its planes as close to capacity as it can.In December, which for the first half is as low-season as the travel year gets, Ryanair flights were 95 per cent full – meaning just nine or 10 seats on the average aircraft remained empty. That achievement is all the more remarkable given the intensifying competition in short-haul aviation.\u0026nbspRyanair and easyJet have a long history of not competing head-to-head. Over the years there have been some spectacular fares wars: easyJet retired hurt after launching flights to Ireland, and for a while it was difficult to pay more than £10 from Luton to Copenhagen. While the two giant carriers have historically competed on only a handful of airport-to-airport routes, expansion makes it increasingly difficult to avoid. And even though Primera Air of Iceland and Cobalt of Cyprus have recently gone bust, other budget carriers are expanding.\u0026nbspWizz Air, the eastern European specialist, is now flying from Luton to a range of western European destinations. Norwegian Air and BA’s sister airline, Vueling, are also chasing the same market. And the “legacy carriers” from Air France to SAS are cutting costs to stay in the game. Ryanair begins 2019 as combative as ever. Cabin crew employed in Spain were planning strikes on 8, 10 and 13 January after failing to reach an agreement over employment conditions, but the airline faced them down.Ahead of Brexit, Ryanair has obtained a UK air operator’s certificate that will allow it to operate British domestic routes and flights to destinations outside the European Union after 29 March. All the available evidence shows that the lowest-cost provider wins in aviation – even with consumer voices raised against it.Ryanair may feel picked on by the authorities. At this time in 2018, Air France workers were gearing up for 15 days of strikes that disrupted many thousands of British travellers. Some BA passengers faced problems during the cabin-crew strikes that dragged on for months during 2017. Yet when the European Court of Justice ruled in April 2018 that wildcat strikes did not consititute “extraordinary circumstances”, the Civil Aviation Authority failed to urge BA and Air France travellers to claim compensation.Created with Sketch.Ryanair: strikes and cancellations cause travel chaos Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Ryanair airline workers shout slogans during a small protest during the first of two days of a cabin crew strike at Adolfo Suarez-Barajas international airport in Madrid in JulyEmpty Ryanair check-in counter at El Prat airport in BarcelonaRyanair employees hold up signs in English and Spanish on the first day of a cabin crew strike in Palma de MallorcaRyanair airplanes stand idle on the tarmacIrish Ryanair pilots outside the company headquarters at Swords in Dublin, as they stage their fourth one-day strike with their union, ForsaA woman sits at a Ryanair airline check-in desk after her flight to Pisa, Italy, was cancelledRyanair employees protest at the entrance of the airport in MalagaStranded Ryanair passengers line up for information at the airport in ValenciaEmployees of Ryanair\u0027s customer service department wear T-shirts with a slogan \u0027Ryanair Must Change\u0027 during the first day of strike of the company\u0027s cabin crew members at Brussels South airport in Charleroi, Belgium, in 25Cabin crew workers for low-cost airline Ryanair went on strike in four European countries over working conditions in July, forcing thousands of passengers to make last-minute travel adjustments at the peak of the summer holiday seasonRyanair Chief Executive Michael O\u0027Leary addresses a news conference in Schwechat, AustriaRyanair employees hold up signs at the airport in Palma de MallorcaPeople queue at the Ryanair airline customer service desk during the first of two days cabin crew strikeRyanair personnel stand at Brussels Airport in Zaventem, during a strike of cabin personnel Ryanair\u0027s customer service department gather behind a banner reading: \u0027Ryanair On Strike - Respect Us!

Travel readers seem to have it in for Ryanair. The Boeing 737s it flies are identical to the bulk of Jet2’s fleet. They hold the same number of people in the same configuration. The only significant difference is that Ryanair’s fleet of 737-800s are younger. Jet2’s score for seating and cabin environment was four stars, while Ryanair received only one star.The most fundamental requirement for any airline is safety, but when an organisation called Airlineratings released its top 10 for “the world’s safest low-cost airlines”, Ryanair was nowhere to be seen.\u0026nbspThe UK’s struggling Flybe and the Anglo-German Thomas Cook Airlines made it, but there was no place for the Irish airline. Which is perplexing, because if you measure safety in terms of flying the highest number of passengers without any of them dying in an accident, Ryanair has the best safety record in the world by a country mile. Since its first flight in 1985, the airline has safely flown 1.25 billion people. Second place goes to easyJet, at 900 million passengers.People\u0026nbsphave flown safely with Ryanair since 1985British travellers have begun another year as the beneficiaries of the best-value air travel in the world, provided by the safest airlines. When easyJet was founded by Stelios Haji-Ioannou in 1995, his main message was that travellers could fly from London to Scotland for £29 – the price of a pair of jeans. Checking flights two days ahead, Ryanair will take you from Stansted to Edinburgh for under £26. And if that’s still too much, the airline will take you from Essex to Italy for under £15.At a time when Europe is fragmenting and slightly more than half the UK apparently wants to be alone, Ryanair is arguably doing more to keep the continent together than a planeload of politicians: connecting families, enabling employment, allowing travellers to discover that Europe is a fascinating mosaic of cultures rather than an amorphous whole.Back to that\u0026nbspWhich? Travel\u0026nbspsurvey: “Of those who said there was one airline with which they’d never travel, 70 per cent named Ryanair – no other airline came close.”Every passenger in Europe benefits from the existence of Ryanair. So while I find it surprising that the airline inflames so much adverse reaction, I believe that even the “bad-boy” image is a consumer benefit. By annoying sufficiently many people who have vowed never to fly on Ryanair, the Irish airline helps its rivals stay in business and keeps competition flourishing.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That meant the scientists could take all of those different pieces of data – related to 700 different places in all – and combine them to understand the gravity on the surface.As the rover started to climb up a hill on the surface, the amount of gravity went up. But it did not go up as much as expected.The lower levels of Mount Sharp are surprisingly porous, says lead author Kevin Lewis of Johns Hopkins University. We know the bottom layers of the mountain were buried over time. That compacts them, making them denser. But this finding suggests they weren\u0027t buried by as much material as we thought.Scientists could use the findings to help understand where places like Mount Sharp came from, and how the Martian surface developed.There are still many questions about how Mount Sharp developed, but this paper adds an important piece to the puzzle, said Ashwin Vasavada, Curiosity\u0027s project scientist at NASA\u0027s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, which manages the mission.

Ashley’s purchase saved the brand, but half of its 62 UK stores will close, putting hundreds out of work.Ashley has agreed to buy Sofa for “a nominal sum”, ending a battle with ScS Group for the online furniture retailer.The Sports Direct owner seems to be linked to just about every high street store that has struggled over the past year. He has held talks with HMV’s administrators and is rumoured to be sniffing around posh cake chain Patisserie Valerie.Putting an exact figure on the value of his combined holdings is tricky but Forbes puts it at $3bn (£2.3bn).Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He’ll have the entire high street soonHe has bought heavily into the high street as it faces some of its toughest ever trading conditions. Close to four in 10 listed retailers issued profit warnings last year, with some doing so on multiple occasions.Emma Shipp, partner at Hewitsons, said Mr Ashley’s history with House of Fraser and Evans Cycles suggests he will continue to cut staff and close stores across all of his recent purchases.Ms Shipp added: “Landlords should expect to come under increasing pressure to reduce rent or offer rent-free periods.\u0026nbsp“Cross pollination between his businesses is another likely outcome – witness the introduction of Agent Provocateur lingerie at House of Fraser stores last year\u0026nbspwhich are both Ashley owned.“For the moment, an overriding strategy in these acquisitions is hard to discern and some have likened it to a ‘Monopoly board’ power grab.”ScS, which stands for “Sofa Carpet Specialist”, has concessions in House of Fraser stores but announced in October that it would pull out because the partnership was no longer beneficial after Mr Ashley’s takeover of the department store chain.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It’s been cancelled now, but that doesn’t mean you can’t catch up with it, and then write Netflix a strongly worded email.220 Money Heist (TV series, one season, 2017–)Known as La Casa de Papel (House of Paper) in its native Spanish, Money Heist is Netflix’s most streamed non-English language show. The bank heist is a tired dramatic trope these days, but don’t let that, or the show’s bland English-language title, put you off – creator Álex Pina has made something special. The heist here, led by a mysterious man known only as The Professor, involves breaking into the Royal Mint of Spain and printing off €2.4 billion. There are even more twists in the show’s 15 episodes than there are hostages. 320 One Day at a Time (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)In stark contrast to the off-beat, low-key comedy that currently rules TV – the kind that provokes a wry smirk rather than a hearty laugh – One Day at a Time is a big, bright sitcom filmed in front of an interminably enthusiastic studio audience. You wouldn’t have thought that the story of a Cuban-American army veteran  nurse  single mother – who suffers from PTSD and depression – would fit into this format, but it does so beautifully, tackling issues of sexuality, racism and sexism in the process.  Based on writer  director Tamara Jenkins’s own fertility struggles, Private Life stars Kathryn Hahn and Paul Giamatti (both giving brilliant performances) as a spiky, loving middle-aged couple desperate to have a baby. They even rope their enthusiastic but irresponsible niece Sadie (Kayli Carter) into the mix, much to the horror of Sadie’s mother (Molly Shannon, turning a potentially repellent character into one worthy of empathy). It’s subtle, restrained and beautifully realised.520 Big Mouth (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Crude, rude, and rife with surprise emissions and bodily functions, animated sitcom Big Mouth is also a sensitive, nuanced deep e into the various horrors of teenagehood. When 12-year-old Andrew Glouberman (John Mulaney) is visited by the hormone monster (Nick Kroll, who voices many of the show’s best characters), he finds his life irreversibly – and seemingly disastrously – changed. Unlike many other puberty-centred comedies, Big Mouth makes as much time for its confused female protagonists as its male ones Maya Rudolph is a delight as the female hormone monster, and look out for Kristen Wiig’s wonderful turn as a talking vagina.  620 Easy (TV series, two seasons, 2016–)Joe Swanberg’s style of defiantly undramatic mumblecore isn’t for everyone, but if you enjoyed his earlier films, Drinking Buddies and Happy Christmas, you’ll find plenty to admire in this anthology comedy-drama series. Big-name stars such as Orlando Bloom and Aubrey Plaza crop up, but Jane Adams – who you might remember from Todd Solondz’s chronically depressing 1998 film Happiness – is the show’s heart, and Marc Maron is its jaded soul.Community’s Gillian Jacobs is brilliant as the prickly, magnetic recovering addict Mickey, who forms an unlikely – and arguably deeply unwise – relationship with her nerdy neighbour Gus (Paul Rust). Despite Gus’s pathological need to be the nice guy, we’re never quite sure who or what we’re rooting for – which is what makes Love such complex, compelling viewing.  In 2016, comedian Patton Oswalt’s wife, the true crime writer Michelle McNamara, died suddenly in her sleep. That subject matter doesn’t exactly scream “stand-up special”, but out of his devastating loss, Oswalt managed to craft something funny and profound. Over the course of an hour, he processes his grief onstage, managing to find humour in the struggle to raise his grieving six-year-old daughter alone.920 Santa Clarita Diet (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Granted, this horror-comedy – which stars Drew Barrymore as a neurotic real estate agent who suddenly develops a taste for human flesh – is really silly, and really, really disgusting. But it’s also strangely charming, and funny. Timothy Olyphant is excellent as Sheila’s frazzled husband Joel, and the pair’s idiosyncratic but respectful relationship with their smart teenage daughter Abby (Liv Hewson) isn’t quite like anything else on TV right now.1020 Dark Tourist (TV series, one season, 2018–)New Zealand journalist David Farrier is an unlikely TV presenter in the same way that Louis Theroux is – in just about every scenario in which he finds himself, he’s a little bit awkward. But as with Theroux, Farrier’s weakness is actually his strength, allowing him to endear himself to the many unusual people he meets on his journey through the world’s most questionable tourist destinations. Farrier’s stops include the site of the Fukushima nuclear disaster, the road where JFK was assassinated, and the Milwaukee suburbs where serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer murdered his victims.1120 Sacred Games (TV series, one season, 2018–)Based on Vikram Chandra’s epic 2006 novel, Netflix’s first Indian original series is a slowly unfolding gem. The first season of Sacred Games – which follows a troubled police officer (Saif Ali Khan) who has 25 days to save his city thanks to a tip-off from a presumed dead gangster – only covered one quarter of Chandra’s 1,000-page novel. As the show itself declared when it announced the forthcoming second season, “the worst is yet to come”.When the trailer for Dumplin’ first landed, it seemed all the ingredients were in place for a film that was at worst tone-deaf, and at best vaguely patronising. Thank heavens, then, that the trailer did Dumplin’ such a disservice. Starring Danielle Macdonald (who broke out in the excellent 2017 film Patti Cake$) as Willowdean, a self-described “fat girl” who enters a local pageant to annoy her former beauty queen mother (Jennifer Aniston), Dumplin’ is as funny, warm and sensitive as its protagonist – and with a killer Dolly Parton-laden soundtrack to boot.1320 Dark (TV series, one season, 2017–)This sci-fi thriller – which features disappearing children, a mysterious local power plant, and scenes set in the Eighties – has, for obvious reasons, drawn comparisons to Stranger Things. But Dark is even more beguiling and (true to its name) less family-friendly than Stranger Things.1420 The Death and Life of Marsha P Johnson (Film, 2017)Though it’s been somewhat tarnished by claims that director David France appropriated the work and research of trans film-maker Reina Gossett, this documentary is nonetheless a loving, respectful tribute to gay rights activist Marsha P Johnson. One of the key figures in the Stonewall uprising (though her involvement was almost entirely eradicated in 2015’s critically hated Stonewall), Johnson modelled for Andy Warhol, performed onstage with drag group Hot Peaches, helped found the Gay Liberation Front, and then died under suspicious circumstances in 1992.1520 On My Block (TV series, one season, 2018–)This coming-of-age series might not have found as many eyeballs as it deserved last year, but those it did find were glued to the screen. In fact, it was the most-binged show of 2018 – meaning that it had the highest watch-time-per-viewing session of any Netflix original. Created by Awkward’s Lauren Iungerich, On My Block follows a group of Los Angeles teens as they navigate both the drama of high school and the danger of inner-city life.Two beleaguered assistants (Zoey Deutch and Glen Powell) conspire to get their over-demanding bosses (Taye Diggs and Lucy Liu) together in order to get their lives back in this winning romantic comedy. Set It Up is responsible not only for coining the term “over-dicking” (it’s much more innocent than it sounds), but for rejuvenating a tired genre.Martin Freeman stars as the father struggling to protect his young daughter from a zombie epidemic spreading across Australia. So far, so overdone. But this drama thriller, directed by Ben Howling and Yolanda Ramke and based on their 2013 short of the same name, throws a handful of unpredictable ners in the works.    1920 Godless (TV series, one season, 2017–)With shades of John Ford\u0027s The Searchers, this languorous western was critically acclaimed but swiftly forgotten after it landed on Netflix in 2016. Set in 1884, it\u0027s about Frank Griffin (Jeff Daniels) and his notoriously ruthless gang of outlaws’ pursuit of their injured former ally Roy Goode (Jack O’Connell), who is hiding out in a small town populated solely by women after a mining accident killed off all its men. A gun-toting Michelle Dockery, clearly relishing the change of scenery after years of Downton Abbey, and a taciturn Jack O’Connell, are on brilliant form.2020 Atypical (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)This coming-of-age series about a teenage boy with autism was sweet and well-intentioned from the start, but its first season was criticised for a handful of inaccuracies, and for its lack of autistic actors. Rather than drowning in a sea of defensiveness – as too many shows tend to do – it listened, and brought in autistic actors and writers for its excellent second season.120 American Vandal (TV series, two seasons, 2017–2018)Part satire of true crime documentaries such as Making a Murderer, part carefully observed portrayal of teenage life, American Vandal was criminally underappreciated during its two season run. It’s been cancelled now, but that doesn’t mean you can’t catch up with it, and then write Netflix a strongly worded email.220 Money Heist (TV series, one season, 2017–)Known as La Casa de Papel (House of Paper) in its native Spanish, Money Heist is Netflix’s most streamed non-English language show.

It’s female empowerment and mental-health aware. It’s everything I wanted\u0027Click to followThe Independent CultureNetflix’s “mind-blowing” new series Russian Doll has won rave reviews, with Natasha Lyonne’s performance and writing being praised by critics.Russian Doll centres on\u0026nbspNadiya – played by\u0026nbspLyonne – who dies over and over again, only to re-appear every time in the same place: in the bathroom at her birthday party. (Unsurprisingly, the premise has been liked to the film\u0026nbspGroundhog Day.)After reaching the streaming service on Friday (1 February), subscribers took to Twitter to discuss the “trippy” series.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trial“Just binged watched Russian Doll,” wrote one.\u0026nbsp”The whole season. Really worth the effn wild ride. Super Trippy. Major surprises.”Another wrote: “Wow. Russian Doll is the best series I’ve watched in a long time.”“I loved it,” one social media user wrote.\u0026nbsp”I watched it all and I wish there was more. It’s smart. It’s female empowerment and mental-health aware. It’s everything I wanted.”Critics have likewise written highly of the series, with Russian Doll currently holding a 100 per cent fresh rating on the aggregate website\u0026nbspRotten Tomatoes.\u0026nbsp“As the series proceeds, it gets more ambitious and more complicated in a way that’s gratifying to watch,” writes\u0026nbspSophie Gilbert for The Atlantic.\u0026nbsp”It’s still anchored, though, by its sense of place and time, and by the infinite possibilities that a night walking around New York City presents.”Joel Keller for Decider writes: “Lyonne puts on the performance of her career in this funny, emotional series.”\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Hidden gems: The best Netflix originals you might have missed Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.120 American Vandal (TV series, two seasons, 2017–2018)Part satire of true crime documentaries such as Making a Murderer, part carefully observed portrayal of teenage life, American Vandal was criminally underappreciated during its two season run. It’s been cancelled now, but that doesn’t mean you can’t catch up with it, and then write Netflix a strongly worded email.220 Money Heist (TV series, one season, 2017–)Known as La Casa de Papel (House of Paper) in its native Spanish, Money Heist is Netflix’s most streamed non-English language show. The bank heist is a tired dramatic trope these days, but don’t let that, or the show’s bland English-language title, put you off – creator Álex Pina has made something special. The heist here, led by a mysterious man known only as The Professor, involves breaking into the Royal Mint of Spain and printing off €2.4 billion. There are even more twists in the show’s 15 episodes than there are hostages. 320 One Day at a Time (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)In stark contrast to the off-beat, low-key comedy that currently rules TV – the kind that provokes a wry smirk rather than a hearty laugh – One Day at a Time is a big, bright sitcom filmed in front of an interminably enthusiastic studio audience. You wouldn’t have thought that the story of a Cuban-American army veteran  nurse  single mother – who suffers from PTSD and depression – would fit into this format, but it does so beautifully, tackling issues of sexuality, racism and sexism in the process.  Based on writer  director Tamara Jenkins’s own fertility struggles, Private Life stars Kathryn Hahn and Paul Giamatti (both giving brilliant performances) as a spiky, loving middle-aged couple desperate to have a baby. They even rope their enthusiastic but irresponsible niece Sadie (Kayli Carter) into the mix, much to the horror of Sadie’s mother (Molly Shannon, turning a potentially repellent character into one worthy of empathy). It’s subtle, restrained and beautifully realised.520 Big Mouth (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Crude, rude, and rife with surprise emissions and bodily functions, animated sitcom Big Mouth is also a sensitive, nuanced deep e into the various horrors of teenagehood. When 12-year-old Andrew Glouberman (John Mulaney) is visited by the hormone monster (Nick Kroll, who voices many of the show’s best characters), he finds his life irreversibly – and seemingly disastrously – changed. Unlike many other puberty-centred comedies, Big Mouth makes as much time for its confused female protagonists as its male ones Maya Rudolph is a delight as the female hormone monster, and look out for Kristen Wiig’s wonderful turn as a talking vagina.  620 Easy (TV series, two seasons, 2016–)Joe Swanberg’s style of defiantly undramatic mumblecore isn’t for everyone, but if you enjoyed his earlier films, Drinking Buddies and Happy Christmas, you’ll find plenty to admire in this anthology comedy-drama series. Big-name stars such as Orlando Bloom and Aubrey Plaza crop up, but Jane Adams – who you might remember from Todd Solondz’s chronically depressing 1998 film Happiness – is the show’s heart, and Marc Maron is its jaded soul.Community’s Gillian Jacobs is brilliant as the prickly, magnetic recovering addict Mickey, who forms an unlikely – and arguably deeply unwise – relationship with her nerdy neighbour Gus (Paul Rust). Despite Gus’s pathological need to be the nice guy, we’re never quite sure who or what we’re rooting for – which is what makes Love such complex, compelling viewing.  In 2016, comedian Patton Oswalt’s wife, the true crime writer Michelle McNamara, died suddenly in her sleep. That subject matter doesn’t exactly scream “stand-up special”, but out of his devastating loss, Oswalt managed to craft something funny and profound. Over the course of an hour, he processes his grief onstage, managing to find humour in the struggle to raise his grieving six-year-old daughter alone.920 Santa Clarita Diet (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Granted, this horror-comedy – which stars Drew Barrymore as a neurotic real estate agent who suddenly develops a taste for human flesh – is really silly, and really, really disgusting. But it’s also strangely charming, and funny. Timothy Olyphant is excellent as Sheila’s frazzled husband Joel, and the pair’s idiosyncratic but respectful relationship with their smart teenage daughter Abby (Liv Hewson) isn’t quite like anything else on TV right now.1020 Dark Tourist (TV series, one season, 2018–)New Zealand journalist David Farrier is an unlikely TV presenter in the same way that Louis Theroux is – in just about every scenario in which he finds himself, he’s a little bit awkward. But as with Theroux, Farrier’s weakness is actually his strength, allowing him to endear himself to the many unusual people he meets on his journey through the world’s most questionable tourist destinations. Farrier’s stops include the site of the Fukushima nuclear disaster, the road where JFK was assassinated, and the Milwaukee suburbs where serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer murdered his victims.1120 Sacred Games (TV series, one season, 2018–)Based on Vikram Chandra’s epic 2006 novel, Netflix’s first Indian original series is a slowly unfolding gem. The first season of Sacred Games – which follows a troubled police officer (Saif Ali Khan) who has 25 days to save his city thanks to a tip-off from a presumed dead gangster – only covered one quarter of Chandra’s 1,000-page novel. As the show itself declared when it announced the forthcoming second season, “the worst is yet to come”.When the trailer for Dumplin’ first landed, it seemed all the ingredients were in place for a film that was at worst tone-deaf, and at best vaguely patronising. Thank heavens, then, that the trailer did Dumplin’ such a disservice. Starring Danielle Macdonald (who broke out in the excellent 2017 film Patti Cake$) as Willowdean, a self-described “fat girl” who enters a local pageant to annoy her former beauty queen mother (Jennifer Aniston), Dumplin’ is as funny, warm and sensitive as its protagonist – and with a killer Dolly Parton-laden soundtrack to boot.1320 Dark (TV series, one season, 2017–)This sci-fi thriller – which features disappearing children, a mysterious local power plant, and scenes set in the Eighties – has, for obvious reasons, drawn comparisons to Stranger Things. But Dark is even more beguiling and (true to its name) less family-friendly than Stranger Things.1420 The Death and Life of Marsha P Johnson (Film, 2017)Though it’s been somewhat tarnished by claims that director David France appropriated the work and research of trans film-maker Reina Gossett, this documentary is nonetheless a loving, respectful tribute to gay rights activist Marsha P Johnson. One of the key figures in the Stonewall uprising (though her involvement was almost entirely eradicated in 2015’s critically hated Stonewall), Johnson modelled for Andy Warhol, performed onstage with drag group Hot Peaches, helped found the Gay Liberation Front, and then died under suspicious circumstances in 1992.1520 On My Block (TV series, one season, 2018–)This coming-of-age series might not have found as many eyeballs as it deserved last year, but those it did find were glued to the screen. In fact, it was the most-binged show of 2018 – meaning that it had the highest watch-time-per-viewing session of any Netflix original. Created by Awkward’s Lauren Iungerich, On My Block follows a group of Los Angeles teens as they navigate both the drama of high school and the danger of inner-city life.Two beleaguered assistants (Zoey Deutch and Glen Powell) conspire to get their over-demanding bosses (Taye Diggs and Lucy Liu) together in order to get their lives back in this winning romantic comedy. Set It Up is responsible not only for coining the term “over-dicking” (it’s much more innocent than it sounds), but for rejuvenating a tired genre.Martin Freeman stars as the father struggling to protect his young daughter from a zombie epidemic spreading across Australia. So far, so overdone. But this drama thriller, directed by Ben Howling and Yolanda Ramke and based on their 2013 short of the same name, throws a handful of unpredictable ners in the works.    1920 Godless (TV series, one season, 2017–)With shades of John Ford\u0027s The Searchers, this languorous western was critically acclaimed but swiftly forgotten after it landed on Netflix in 2016. Set in 1884, it\u0027s about Frank Griffin (Jeff Daniels) and his notoriously ruthless gang of outlaws’ pursuit of their injured former ally Roy Goode (Jack O’Connell), who is hiding out in a small town populated solely by women after a mining accident killed off all its men. A gun-toting Michelle Dockery, clearly relishing the change of scenery after years of Downton Abbey, and a taciturn Jack O’Connell, are on brilliant form.2020 Atypical (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)This coming-of-age series about a teenage boy with autism was sweet and well-intentioned from the start, but its first season was criticised for a handful of inaccuracies, and for its lack of autistic actors. Rather than drowning in a sea of defensiveness – as too many shows tend to do – it listened, and brought in autistic actors and writers for its excellent second season.120 American Vandal (TV series, two seasons, 2017–2018)Part satire of true crime documentaries such as Making a Murderer, part carefully observed portrayal of teenage life, American Vandal was criminally underappreciated during its two season run. It’s been cancelled now, but that doesn’t mean you can’t catch up with it, and then write Netflix a strongly worded email.220 Money Heist (TV series, one season, 2017–)Known as La Casa de Papel (House of Paper) in its native Spanish, Money Heist is Netflix’s most streamed non-English language show.

It measures only 3000 light-years across even at its longest point, making it just a fraction of the size of our own Milky Way.Repeated radio signals coming from galaxy 1.5 billion lightyears awayIt is dark as it is feint. Together, those porperties led astronomers to classify it as what is called a\u0026nbspdwarf spheroidal galaxy.Such galaxies are defined by their small size and dim light, as well as their lack of dust and old stellar populations. Reserchers have found 36 galaxies of this kind in our nearby area, 22 of which are satellite galaxies around our own Milky Way.Dwarf spheroidal galaxies are not uncommon, but the newly discovered one is strange in a number of ways. It is extremely isolated, about 30 million light-years from the Milky Way and two million light-years from its nearest possible host – making it the most isolated of any small dwarf galaxy ever found.From studying its stars, scientists found that the galaxy is around 13 billion years old, making it nearly as old as the entire universe. Because it is so distant from any other galaxies – and so has been left largely undisturbed – as well as its old age, the astronomers refer to Bedin 1 as a fossil from the beginning of th ecosmos.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Tom Petty’s performance is often omitted from rankings of the best Super Bowl halftime shows, but we’re including it here because he absolutely crushed it. Kicking things off with “American Girl”, he followed it up with “Won’t Back Down”, “Full Moon Fever” and the emotional “Free Fallin’”, rounding off with a stirring rendition of “Runnin’ Down a Dream”.U2 had the unenviable task of trying to raise everyone’s spirits just six months after the 911 attacks, but they did an admirable job, with performances of uplifting tracks like “Beautiful Day”.McCartney preceded the pop stars trying to outdo one another with extravagant stage designs and lavish costumes. Instead, he offered four beautifully played songs, of which the final one, “Hey Jude”, prompted an epic singalong with the crowd at Jacksonville’s EverBank Field Stadium.One of the few to outdo Katy Perry’s 2015 entrance was Madonna, three years earlier, who appeared on a giant golden chariot led by about a hundred buff men dressed as Roman soldiers. She brought out Nicki Minaj and MIA for “Give Me All Your Luvin’” and also performed hits “Like a Prayer”, “Music” and “Express Yourself”.There are few entrances as grand as standing on top of a giant golden lion with glowing eyes. Katy Perry went all out for her halftime show in 2015 with performances of “Roar”, “Dark Horse”, “California Gurls”, “Firework” and “Teenage Dream”. And who can forget the notorious Left Shark and his poor coordination?“Put the chicken fingers down and turn your television all the way up,” the Boss ordered. Springsteen’s 12-minute set started out with “Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out” and also included “Born to Run”, “Glory Days” and “Working on a Dream”.710 Janet Jackson and Justin Timberlake – 2004Janet Jackson delivered a blistering, brilliantly choreographed show that ended with “Rock Your Body”. But the moment Justin Timberlake ripped away her costume, and exposed her breast for approximately half a second, overshadowed all of that. The incident, dubbed “nipplegate”, even inspired the creation of YouTube. Jackson was turned into a scapegoat for the ensuing controversy, while Timberlake didn’t receive anywhere near as much scrutiny.One of the most outlandish halftime shows in recent memory, Lady Gaga began her performance by hurtling herself from the top of the stadium (attached to a harness, of course) – sparking a thousand memes. Once safely on the ground, she thrilled audiences with her biggest hits: “Poker Face”, “Born This Way”, “Telephone”, “Just Dance”, “Million Reasons” and “Bad Romance”.Beyonce basically ties with Prince for the greatest all-time Super Bowl performance. It was bold, it was fierce, it was virtually flawless. Bursting onto the stage with “Crazy in Love” after an a capella “Love on Top”, she threw down some of her best dance moves, before moving on to other hits including “End of Time” and “Baby Boy”. Lastly, there was a hysteria-inducing Destiny’s Child reunion with Michelle Williams and Kelly Rowland – a performance so powerful, the lights at the stadium cut out when it ended.The greatest. Of course, the Purple One wasn’t responsible for the rain that began to pour during his hair-raising 12-minute performance, which included covers of “We Will Rock You” and “All Along the Watchtower”. But the timing was so perfect, you wanted to believe he was. Following renditions of “1999Baby I’m a Star”, Prince closed on “Purple Rain” in what has to be ranked among one of his greatest live performances of that song.110 Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers  – 2008No frills, just good old-fashioned rock and roll.

The Super Bowl attracts huge audiences - last year, more than 100 million viewers tuned in to watch the game in the US and similar numbers are expected this year. For new brands, a Super Bowl ad can bring its products to the attention of millions of people instantly, which many would argue justifies the high fee. According to advertising consultancy, in 2018 some new brands raised brand awareness by 36.5 per cent after their Super Bowl ad aired. However, these days exposure can be achieved a lot more cheaply, and most of the brands snapping up space in the Super Bowl ad breaks are already well-known names, like Amazon, Pepsi and Budweiser.For companies like these, Super Bowl ads act as a signal to the world that their brand is doing well, and tells consumers that they can trust in their products.Super Bowl 2019: Odds, Vegas betting lines, moneyline and prop bets 10 Super Bowl commercials that have gone down in TV historyEverything you need to know about the 2019 Super BowlHow to watch Super Bowl 2019 It is virtually impossible to calculate the return on investment for a Super Bowl ad, but each year a handful of brands will win out in the battle to become a talking point long after the final whistle blows. And even if an ad goes viral for all the wrong reasons, it might not be a complete failure for the company behind it. “Even though a Super Bowl advertising campaign might not pay immediately in hard dollars and cents, if a business can afford to produce one of these stellar spots, they stand to earn new customers and build awareness on a scale unmatched by other outlets,” according to Peter Koeppel, founder and president of marketing agency Koeppel Direct.“Good or bad, though, impactful Super Bowl ads are the ones that are getting talked about. What a marketer can’t afford is an ad that completely fails to deliver. Because the Super Bowl is also sort of a Super Bowl of marketing, the competition is fierce – the commercials have to be memorable for them to pay off in the long run. “An ad that doesn’t give viewers something, for better or worse, won’t be a profitable one.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But when she took it back to Westminster,\u0026nbspMPs rejected it by the biggest margin of defeat for a government in the history of parliament.Subsequently, MPs narrowly backed a motion to call on the government to ditch the controversial “Irish backstop”\u0026nbsppart of the deal and replace it with “alternative arrangements” for avoiding a hard border in Ireland.Many MPs, especially Brexiteers and the DUP, think the backstop, which keeps the UK inside the EU customs area, is a breach of sovereignty because it treats Northern Ireland differently from Great Britain in some respects. Others also worry it will become a permanent customs union, which they do not want.Created with Sketch.Brexit and travel: all you need to know Show all 14Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.British passports that expire after 29 March 2019 will continue to be valid as UK travel documents, but will lose the power that comes with being a European Union passport – notably the right of free movement within the EU27.You will still be able to travel to the EU with your pet after Brexit, but it could well get more complicated depending on the status that the European Union decide to apply.

In theory, mobile phone firms can impose whatever fees they think the market will bear.What does the EU think about this?The EU has publicly, and repeatedly, come out very strongly against renegotiation.European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker said this week: “The withdrawal agreement is the best and only deal possible. The European Union said so in November, we said so in December, we said so after the first meaningful vote in the Commons in January. The debate and vote in the House of Commons do not change that.”In fact, less than 10 minutes after MPs voted to reject the backstop, a spokesperson for Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, said: “The backstop is part of the withdrawal agreement, and the withdrawal agreement is not open for renegotiation.”But could the UK bypass the Commission by appealing to member states?Could Germany’s domestic pain compel Berlin to soften its Brexit line?This seems unlikely at present.The UK strategy throughout the whole of the talks has been to try to peel off member states and disrupt EU unity. Even before the referendum, former Brexit secretary David Davis said his first stop would be to negotiate inidual deals with Berlin, or Paris.But it hasn’t worked out like that and there’s no obvious reason to think things will\u0026nbspchange – unless pressure somehow gets to the EU at the last minute.What’s more, the Commission’s positions are taken after talking to member states, and set by member states at European Council meetings. Donald Tusk, the first senior EU chief to intervene after the latest Westminster vote, is supposed to reflect the settled views of EU\u0026nbspmembers\u0026nbspwhen he makes public statements.Are there any signs of cracks in EU unity at all?At the start of the year, the Polish foreign minister suggested adding a time limit to the backstop. He was quickly shot down by Irish prime minister Leo Varadkar, who said this was not the EU’s position, and nothing more was heard of it.This is not the first time Poland has raised the issue – they’ve talked about it behind the scenes before – though it was the first time they’d\u0026nbspgone public.The truth is,\u0026nbspthe vast majority of countries are happy to follow Ireland’s lead on this question as a matter of principle. Ireland is adamant it will not accept a limited backstop.There are a few\u0026nbsprumours in Brussels that some states, such as Germany, are open to a pragmatic solution. But this doesn’t necessarily mean it has an answer that\u0026nbspthe UK could accept, and for now the balance of opinion among\u0026nbspmember states is to stand by Dublin.It’s entirely possible the balance of opinion could shift – Theresa May is said to be trying to convince capitals directly. Still,\u0026nbspshe has no history of success in this regard.Got an unanswered question about Brexit?

A Home Office spokesperson confirmed that a charter flight would be departing in the “coming weeks”.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialAll of those set to be removed on the flight are said to have criminal convictions, but all have served their sentences in UK jails and campaigners argue that their removal – which for many means returning alone to a country they left as young children – constitutes a “brutal double punishment”.The last charter flight to Jamaica was in March 2017. Another was scheduled to leave last April, days after the Windrush scandal broke, with a 63-year-old grandmother among the deportees, but it was cancelled for reasons the Home Office didn’t disclose.How the Windrush scandal forced Brexit off the front pagesThree Windrush victims flown back to live in UK after ‘urgent’ helpThe NAO’s Windrush report shows what our reporting points towardsOne man set to be removed next week, Owen Haisely, has lived in the UK for 41 years and has three young British children. The 45-year-old was convicted for a domestic abuse incident in 2015, for which he spent a year in jail. He\u0026nbspwas arrested and detained\u0026nbspwhile signing on with the Home Office last Friday.The Manchester resident, whose great aunt is part of the Windrush generation,\u0026nbspsaid he worried about the future of his sons – aged five and seven – without their father present.“I did wrong – I deserved to be locked up for that. And I’ve done my sentence.\u0026nbspI did all the rehabilitation classes, I did anger management,\u0026nbspI did restorative justice. I used my time positively and constructively,” he said.“I’m\u0026nbspworried for my boys. They say I can keep in contact with my children via Skype – how can you say that? Problems happen when families get split up or fathers get taken away. Children are more likely to get into trouble.“My ex-partner doesn’t want me to be deported. I go to school meetings,\u0026nbspnativity plays, I collect them from football. They are all going through a very rough time with my immigration issue hanging over them.”Mr Haisley, who spent 12 years as youth workshop leader at a music project in Manchester, said he was “terrified” to go back to a country he doesn’t know.UK residents threatened with deportation on charter flight to Jamaica“I let myself down in a big way, but while offenders with a British passport can go to prison, repeat offend and get given chance after chance, I’ve not even been given a second chance,” he added.Another man scheduled to be on the flight is Divonte Demetri Fyffe, 23, who has been in Britain since he was three. He committed a drug offence at the age of 18 for which he served a two-year sentence, and on his release\u0026nbspwas told he no longer had a right to remain in the UK.The Wolverhampton resident, who was detained last week, said: “I’m in shock at the moment. I’m scared. I don’t know anyone in Jamaica. Who will I stay with? How will I get income?“I made a stupid mistake when I was 18. I was in the wrong place at the wrong time. I was in the wrong crowd. I did my jail time.\u0026nbspI stopped hanging around with those people.\u0026nbspI haven’t reoffended. I wanted to make a change.“But\u0026nbspI was told I couldn’t work or study, and now this is happening. I made one mistake and I’m still paying for it.”A government commissioned report published in July stated the removal of people “who were more British than foreign” was “deeply troubling” and advised that routine deportations of people who had been brought up in the UK should end.Former prisons ombudsman Stephen Shaw, the author of the report, wrote: “For low-risk offenders, it seems entirely disproportionate to tear them away from their lives, families and friends in the UK, and send them to countries where they may not speak the language or have any ties.”Government ‘failed to act’ on warning signs of Windrush failingsResponding to the news of the impending charter flight, Diane Abbott MP, shadow home secretary, said “The Tories’ hostile environment policies continue to split up families, with the use of these brutal chartered flight deportations.\u0026nbsp“We need full transparency. Ministers need to quickly confirm whether these iniduals are British citizens. We should not deport our own citizens or deny their rights.”Information on those facing removal, gathered by campaign group Movement for Justice, indicates that seven of them came to the UK as children, eight have British-born children, and 11 have relatives in the Windrush generation.One woman set to be removed is said to be a grandmother to 10 British children, while another deportee reportedly has a grandfather who served in the British Army.Karen Doyle, national organiser of Movement for Justice, said: “Trying to restart mass deportations to Jamaica while the Windrush generation have yet to receive a penny, and many are still waiting months later for decisions, is a slap in the face for the Jamaican diaspora community in the UK.“These people are being subject to a brutal double punishment, many for crimes that the British public would not consider ‘serious’, drunken fights and driving offences.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Windrush generation: threat of deportation from UK Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The ex-troopship \u0027Empire Windrush\u0027 arriving at Tilbury Docks from Jamaica, with 482 Jamaicans on board, emigrating to Britain.Jamaican immigrants being welcomed by RAF officials from the Colonial Office after the ex-troopship \u0027Empire Windrush\u0027 landed them at Tilbury.

Now 60 and a grandfather, Bryan thought the issue could be resolved swiftly, as he legally moved to Britain with his family as part of the Windrush generation of Caribbean migrants after World War II. In 1948, the ship Windrush brought the first group of migrants from the West Indies to help rebuild post-war Britain, and many others followed from around the Commonwealth.

But if we are able to make progress sooner, then that might not be necessary.“We can’t know at this stage exactly which of those scenarios would happen.”There is\u0026nbspgrowing concern\u0026nbspamong ministers that there is not enough time to pass the necessary legislation before exit day,\u0026nbspamid reports that the February recess could be cancelled to give Ms May more time to win over the EU.Mr Hunt said a solution had “not been properly worked up” to replace the\u0026nbspIrish backstop – which aims to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland.\u0026nbspMPs backed a bid to\u0026nbspreplace it\u0026nbspwith “alternative arrangements” in a series of crunch votes on Tuesday.He said it was “difficult to know” if negotiations would run to the end of March, but added: “Whereas a week ago none of us really knew whether this was going to be possible, we are now in a situation where it clearly is possible.“There are lots and lots of hurdles –\u0026nbspno one is saying this isn’t going to be very challenging –\u0026nbspbut we do now have a consensus in parliament.“Providing we can do that, which I think we can, then I think there is a way through.”However his Austrian counterpart, Karin Kneissl, said it would be “very difficult” for the Brexit timeframe to be extended and warned that Britain could be heading for a no-deal exit.She said: “According to the Article 50 procedures, the deadline is 29 March,\u0026nbspso there is a time pressure because what couldn’t be reached by negotiation over the last years, it’s very difficult to imagine that there can be a tremendous breakthrough – a magic solution – in the next few days in order also to have this ratified in due time for the remaining EU members.”Created with Sketch.

There are rumours that you’ll have heard that one way out for her is to call a general election, hoping the public will like her deal more than parliament does.Racist and misogynistic letters sent to Diane Abbott“I think if the general election had gone on for a week longer, we might well have won. If we could make up 20 points last time, I believe we can\u0026nbspmake up 20 points this time and that means we’ll win.”Asked in her preparations for government whether she had held meetings with senior civil servants, Ms Abbott replied: “Well they are confidential meetings, it wouldn’t be appropriate to say, but we are meeting. Each shadow cabinet member is meeting with key members of their departments.BBC admits Fiona Bruce made ‘light-hearted’ comment about Diane Abbott“I think I’ve got one coming up soon actually,” she added. “Home Office officials – it’s all part of the preparing for government stuff.”But on the more immediate subject of Brexit – an issue she describes as “taking the oxygen out of the political atmosphere” – \u0026nbspMs Abbott warns MPs against accepting the prime minister’s cash in return for support for a UK-EU deal that could end up damaging MPs’ constituencies.She made the comments after it emerged that Downing Street is\u0026nbspconsidering injecting money into Leave constituencies as Ms May attempts to reach out for votes across the chamber before bringing her deal back to the Commons for a second vote later this month.“I think every MP must look at the overall consequences of Theresa May’s deal for their constituencies and the country as a whole.”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 51Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Dog walkers in Aston Rowant National Nature Reserve on the Chilterns escarpment, in Oxfordshire.

History will be brutal.” \u0026nbsp“And also it puts her in an impossible situation because\u0026nbspthe more she moves towards Labour, the more hostile some of her own MPs are going to be.

But what I always say of a second referendum is people should be careful what they wish for.“It’s by no means certain that if we had a second a referendum tomorrow that Remain would win, and that’s the problem. Or it might win by a very small margin and then where are you?“I just think a lot of people who are calling for a second referendum believe that it will just automatically reverse the first referendum and I don’t necessarily think that’s the case. However, I think that a second referendum remains on the table and if there was a second referendum I certainly think Remain should be on the ballot, and I would vote Remain.”Ms Abbott also poured cold water on the idea of a special Brexit conference of the Labour Party – something pro-referendum activists have been advocating in recent months to refine the party’s policy.The shadow home secretary, who has now represented Hackney for over 30 years as an MP, also referred to her recent appearance on BBC Question Time – and the resulting row.After participating in the show, Ms Abbott had complained the BBC had legitimised the “mistreatment, bias and abuse” she faces as a black woman in the public eye and her treatment could dissuade young women from black and ethnic minority groups from becoming involved in politics.She also objected to a clash over polling during the programme, when Fiona Bruce, the new presenter of the programme, interrupted her when she correctly claimed that recent opinion polls suggested Labour was on a level pegging with the Tories.Ms Abbott said she has still not received an apology from the broadcaster, but she rejected recent reports that she will no longer appear on the programme.Asked whether she will contribute again, she replied: “Well, we’ll have to see about that, but\u0026nbspI’m not boycotting them.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Now I have a lot of invitations from all over Africa.I wanted to go to dferent countries there and learn more and to decide which place is best for me to live.It’s the latest bizarre chapter in a story which started seven years ago when Martina, a former air steward, quit her job to pursue her dream of having an extravagant Barbie figure.Twenty-four surgeries followed all over her body, including increasing her natural D breasts to the N they are now, which she inflates using a saline pump.I hope to have them made even bigger soon, she says. I want the biggest breasts in Europe.Then in January , Martina, who had previously used sunbeds to boost her pale skin, had a series of tanning injections claiming at the time she was obsessed with darker skin.Now however she insists that the injections were in fact experimental medicine designed to boost the bodys resistance to skin cancer.I had three injections. Lots of people had the same treatment and everyone reacted dferently, she says. Some people had only a little change, but for me it changed me entirely.At first I could only see my skin tone changing from light to dark to really dark, then after a while I could see my eye colour change to darker, and my eyebrow and my hair changing too.It’s a change that is inside as well as out. These changes are not superficial but deep inside me.So deep in fact that last year Martina travelled to Kenya accompanied by her long-term partner and now husband Michael.I wanted to learn more about my history and black culture, she says. While there she was baptised by a Kenyan pastor and renamed Malaika.The African people loved me, she says. On the first day I wanted to go into downtown Nairobi to a tailor to get some new clothes and when I left in the car I had people surrounding me.In footage taken by Michael - who also received the same injections as Martina, but who is left with only slightly darker skin – Martina, clad in traditional tribal clothes is shown alongside a local tribe, carrying water from a well and cooking over a campfire.“It felt very natural, very normal to me, she says.Martina hasnt decided on a final location for her move but said the northern part of Kenya, in Isiolo,  near the equator was her favourite part.I like the dry hot climate. I was able to spend all day in the sun without sunscreen and did not get sunburned. I only got darker.She maintains she has effectively changed race in the face of understandable cynicism from some quarters of the black community.I have seen a few comments saying ‘you are still white whatever the colour of your skin on the surface’ – but they mainly come from places like America, she says.In reality I have made lots of African friends who understand who I am and that I am trying to learn.I think they see that I am genuine, that this is not just the surface, I want to understand more about their history.I spend most of my time with them now as it feels easier. Compared with my white friends I have more in common with them.Since she has ed to live in her native Trier, a German town near the border with Luxembourg, she has continued to embrace African tradition.My le has changed a lot since my transformation, she says. Now I mostly wear traditional African dresses and I cook African food.My favourite meal is cooked goat meat, ugali, which is boiled corn meal flour, and sukuma wiki which is a Kenyan vegetable.Embracing this new le alongside her meanwhile is Michael - a former pilot and Martina’s childhood sweetheart – who she insists is nothing but supportive of her new le.He also had the injections although they did not have the same effect. But he was and is very supportive, very relaxed about my body modications and so is his family, she says.Tragically, her father and mother and younger sister were killed in a car accident in .Given that Martina had her first surgery the year after they died, it’s hard not to wonderher extreme surgery and skin change is not some extreme reaction to her loss. She insists not.I had started wanting to change my body in . The next year was very hard for me obviously, but the next year I felt ready.It was not about not liking who I was. I liked the white person but it is like a boy with a car that he loves – he wants to change things here and there. It’s like fine tuning.Today that fine tuning is ongoing: Martina says her skin is continuing, naturally, to get darker, while she is also planning more surgery.I want to widen my nose, make my lips bigger and have butt implants, she says. I am still a work in progress.And there’s one further deep-seated change planned: Martina and Michael are hoping to start a family in the future - and Martina believes her babies will be black.My doctor has told me it is possible as I have changed myself internally, she claims.You only have to look at my old pictures: When you compare me now with who I was I am a completely dferent person. The age in which you have to stay the race you were born in is over.People use a iety of ways to express themselves and their identity. However, when it comes to race - and Martina saying shes able to have a black child - this is a biological issue that shes misinterpreted and may cause offence.She may be having a crisis of identity due to a deep feeling of insecurity about her appearance, and it could be her way of trying to gain some control, and fit in.Deep down, it would appear Martina isnt confident or happy with her own identity, and its manesting itself in a potentially unhealthy way.I would suggest anyone thinking about making drastic physical changes like this to seek professional help first to get to the bottom of any underlying issues, as often the issue isnt physical.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

That this time they back a motion preventing us leaving without a deal on March , setting up the potential reversal of Brexit.They must not. The cost to the country and their party will be catastrophic.The Sun does not want No Deal but the threat of it is our greatest leverage. We must not give it up.It is equally dangerousBrexiteers overplay their hand. They have pushed Theresa May in the right direction — but they must now be realistic. If the EU does finally offer some meaningful legal commitment on the backstop they must take it.The PM’s deal will be softer than they want. But hold out for more and Brexit could be lost. A Remainer-stuffed ­Parliament may see to that, however bullish eurosceptic MPs are today.Meanwhile, two things must happen: While No Deal is still possible we must turbo-charge our preparations for it.And Brussels must be left in no doubt . . . not one penny of our exit bill will be paidit happens.IRELAND’S naive PM Leo Varadkar will deserve much of the blame for the misery and chaos No Deal would unleash on his people and across Europe.“We could find ourselves in  or  weeks’ time needing to find a lot of money to save people’s jobs,” he admits.It is time, then, for him to stop posing as a hardman and do the right thing.It is absurd hyperbole to claim Ireland would be betrayed by giving us a legally binding escape option from the backstop at some hypothetical future point.A hard border will happen onlyEU obstinacy pushes us into No Deal. It will then be needed rapidly, as Brussels says.Varadkar’s continued posturing is suicidal. It’s time to be a real statesman.THERESA May needs her most experienced, hard-bitten negotiators in Brussels.The EU is now represented by Martin ­Selmayr, the bullying German eurocrat bent on punishing Britain. So it is vital we deploy the legal skills of Attorney General Geoffrey Cox alongside tough Kiwi trade expert Crawford Falconer.Forget the europhile civil servant Olly Robbins.We need heavier hitters.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The people who can’t get beds in our hospitals, or a place for their kids in the local school. All the while that £billion is being spent on fabulously berserk ­projects in the developing world.To her total credit, Mordaunt has said that our current level of spending on overseas aid is unsustainable. It’s been rising every year. Due to a law passed by the coalition government, we have to spend . per cent of our income on aid to the Third World each year.So right now we spend just under £billion. And where does this money go  No less than  per cent of it is siphoned off to global outfits like that most useless of organisations, the United Nations.This is the body which sent out some dimbo Australian envoy to tick off our Government about economic policy. An organisation which elected Saudi Arabia on to its Women’s Rights Commission. An anti-Western and rabidly anti-Israeli convocation of leftie Third World thugs with chips on their shoulders.The world would be enormously improvedthe UN was shut down tomorrow. And the rest of it  Some of the stuff you wouldn’t believe. A total of £, went to a project investigating Tibetan verbs. Nope, not kidding.I would assume that “climb” was one of the verbs they were investigating. They use that a lot, over there. Thanks to our overseas aid, someone, ­somewhere is now able to say in Tibetan: “F*** me, is that a yeti  Run away!”Then there’s the £, spent on a scheme to stop Indian schoolchildren imbibing sugary drinks. India itself gives overseas aid and has an income rather bigger than our own. Where is the point Another six-figure sum was spent ­persuading Chinese people not to smoke too much — China! The second richest country in the world.Another one was to help Indian workers cool their work­stations down — this in a country which has its own space programme, for Chrissakes. So much of our money is swallowed up by useless leftie quangos and charities to keep themselves in jobs.Still more is pocketed by despots in the horrible countries they run. It is a source of corruption and dependency. It makes things worse. And when we tried to ert our overseas aid to some of the Caribbean countries stricken by hurricanes we were told we couldn’t — they were too rich!It’s a nonsense and a racket. If I thought our overseas aid, in its current form, really alleviated misery and suffering I’d be all for it. That’s why I agreed with the last secretary of state, Priti Patel, who wanted to give a decent chunk to the Israel Defence Forces, which saves a lot of lives in Syria.So my recommendation would be to end it all NOW. Divert the money into our beleaguered and creaking infrastructure. And when a tragedy occurs overseas — sure, splash the cash.Anyway, Penny — hope I’ve helped by starting the conversation. Over to you, babes.SCOTTISH politician Ross Greer has already been called a “ginger turd” by Piers Morgan, and I don’t think I can improve on that. But it’s his ignorance and stupidity that staggers – rather than his hatred for Great Britain, which is something we’re used to from north of the border.Greer described Winston Churchill as a white supremacist, a mass murderer and a racist, and likened him to Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin. He says he is simply challenging the “myth” of Churchill. No, Ross, you’re not.You’re just pig ignorant, with a very poor grasp of history. Of course Churchill was racist. Just about everybody was of his age at that time.If you can’t see the importance of Churchill to winning the Second World War – against REAL racists, REAL mass murderers – when Britain stood alone, then you lack all sense of context and proportion.The more I think about it, the more I reckon “ginger turd” was an understatement.HERO of the week is the excellent Rachel Riley, who has been speaking out against anti-Semitism. As a consequence, she now needs greater security when she’s doing TV’s ­Countdown. The left-wing Jew-hating trolls have been after her.Rachel,  said: “The more I speak, the more abuse I get, and the more abuse I get, the more I speak. It’s got to the point where I can’t look at my Twitter feed any more. It’s just a constant stream.”She’s pretty clear who is behind it, too.  A lot of the abuse comes from people who sign off with the hashtag JCPM.SO, Labour MP Fiona Onasanya is off to prison. Found guilty in court of lying through her teeth.But the remarkable thing is she’s still going to be paid as an MP while she’s inside. She has refused to resign her seat and so her £, salary will continue to be paid by the rest of us.If you got sent to the nick, do you think your employers would continue to pay your wages  You’d be out on your ear. It’s kind of ­outrageous, no THIS cultural appropriation business is getting out of hand. Marks  Spencer has been slammed by leftie nutters with nothing better to do with their time. For selling a biryani wrap.They say it’s not authentic. Well of course it’s not bleedin’ authentic.  This is the UK, not Mumbai. Singer Katy Perry was attacked for wearing a kimono because she isn’t Japanese.White people in the US get criticised for wearing training shoes or sporting afros – that’s appropriating black culture, apparently. Though I think it was white folks who invented training shoes. Thing is, cultural appropriation is brilliant.It’s the way we have of sharing our respective cultures.  think it’s wonderful that countries outside Europe and the US have “culturally appropriated” democracy, sanitisation, railways, computers and so on. I wish more would do the same.SOMALIA is the most corrupt country in the world, according to a list compiled by a group called Transparency International.Not a great surprise, is it  Nor to see most of the rest of Africa hogging the bottom quarter of the world table.It’s bad governance and corruption that is keeping Africa poor – not colonialism. You can tell that the compilers of the report are lefties, though. Asked what countries were becoming more corrupt recently, they named the US, Hungary and Brazil. All three have elected right-wing governments.A NEW study says that women who wear short skirts are more likely to be ­promoted.The lesson I’d take from this,I were a women, is to wear a short skirt to work. But I don’t think that’s the lesson they mean us to take.I wonderwomen who wear short skirts but have the legs of an obese ­elephant also are more likely to get ­promoted I think that’s the next study for those researchers at the ­University of Surrey.I TOLD you last week that the reason we haven’t had a proper winter yet is that the people who run winter couldn’t agree on stuff.Such as whether it should be a hard winter, with lots of snow, no winter at all or a compromise deal with a backstop of some sleet for a bit.But I understand that on Tuesday the President of ­Winter won an astonishing ­victory and was able to push her deal through.Which was why it immediately snowed like hell.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

A ruse to keep us trapped indefinitely and hobble us as a newly independent trading nation.Plus, they believe Tory Remainers may bottle out before they do — and delay or halt Brexit. But that’s a huge gamble.No Deal won’t affect unelected, unaccountable, untouchable eurocrats with monstrous salaries and fat pension pots.But EU politicians should be terried.If the chaos finally tips the eurozone into recession, and hundreds of thousands lose their jobs in Ireland and across the continent, they won’t thank national leaders for sacricing them on the altar of the sacred backstop.They will join the clamour to escape the EU — and elect much less moderate politicians who will make it happen.THE day after the referendum, The Sun called for billions to be pumped into ­working-class communities ignored by London’s politicians.So Theresa May’s pledges to do just that in rundown coastal towns and Labour’s former mining heartlands are very welcome.Eventhey are decades late and a ploy to win votes for her deal.New infrastructure, NHS upgrades and skills training are just what’s needed.But we would go further, with radical regional tax breaks to lure employers.Rebalancing our economy towards Leave-voting areas and away from comfortably off Remain ones is what any Government should be doing.Labour’s “people’s vote” bores are hysterical about it, of course.The status quo suits them fine and Mrs May’s tactic could — shock, horror — secure Brexit.  THEY can’t help themselves, can they Remoaners, some in Cabinet, are itching to rubbish our chances of securing the legal assurances we need.They champ at the bit to “rule out No Deal”, to surrender every last scrap of our leverage, to ensure a meaningless, supersoft Brexit or even halt it.They cannot even keep a lid on it for two weeks while their Prime Minister and her negotiators try to secure a better deal in the national interest.If our mediocre Business Secretary Greg Clark — and others who will never reconcile themselves to the majority’s Brexit decision — are so keen to rebel, let them get on with it.Quit today, or back the PM and belt up. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

First, EU leaders are fed up with her.She signed off on a deal with them, assured them it could get through the Commons then lost by a record margin.They are now sceptical when the British indicate that this or that change could get the deal through Parliament.Despite the passing of the Brady amendment — saying the Commons would raty the withdrawal agreementthe so-called backstop was replaced by alternative arrangements to prevent a hard border — the EU remains doubtful as to whether this is really the case.No  acknowledges that things are not easy between Mrs May and EU leaders at the moment.One member of her circle tells me they are “waiting for the anger to subside” before they head to Brussels.A well-placed European source tells me there will be “nothing tangible in two weeks”.But there is another reason, beyond their irritation, why the EU are holding off from engaging with Mrs May.They want to see what happens when the Commons next votes on Brexit, on Valentine’s Day of all days.It is expected that Yvette Cooper will bring back her amendment which would force the Government to seek an extension to Article it can not agree a deal with the EU.If Cooper is passed, then the EU could be certain that Parliament would not allow the UK to leave the EU without a deal.At that point, the EU would have little reason to offer up a signicant concession.They would know there was no danger of either short-term No Deal disruption, which would be particularly badly timed for the EU given the slow-down in the eurozone economy, or of the UK ending up pursuing a radically dferent economic course after Brexit.However,the Cooper amendment failed again, the EU would have to confront the fact that this process really might result in No Deal.They could lose a withdrawal agreement that is good for them, and the backstop would have created the very thing it is meant to avoid — the need for a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic.In these circumstances, and with time ticking down, the EU would become more creative in its thinking.The hunt would be on for face-saving ways to try to salvage the agreement.This would not mean the EU would suddenly drop the backstop entirely.But it would be more open to, say, a time limit on it.With this change, the deal would stand a very decent chance of passing the Commons.I understand there is a growing body of opinion in the ERG, the most powerful Brexiteer bloc in the Tory party, that a three-year time limit for the backstop — which could be extended to five in exceptional circumstances — could be acceptable.Not all members of the ERG would take this.But enough of them probably would to make up the missing numbers with Labour MPs.Senior figures in the Government were encouraged by how many Labour MPs either abstained or voted against Cooper.They believe these MPs can be persuaded to back a deal.“There is a pool of Labour votes — and it is growing,” one Government source tells me.Getting  Labour votes for a deal now seems doable.Ministers and MPs must hang tight.Now would be the worst moment to weaken the UK’s negotiating position.“I DON’T know who has got any idea,” one leading Cabinet minister tells me when I ask what Theresa May’s plan is.The precise direction of the Government’s Brexit policy is still being debated. I am told “there is no set course”.Inside the Cabinet, the arguments are far from over.There are four Cabinet ministers – David Gauke, Amber Rudd, Greg Clark and Philip Hammond – who won’t even contemplate No Deal.They are becoming increasingly outspoken in their warnings about it.This group has no intention of piping down.However, another set of Cabinet ministers are more worried about no Brexit than No Deal.One of them tells me: “The most disastrous thing for us as a party isBrexit doesn’t happen.”Another minister tells me: “The battle is only going to intensy.”But this gang of four is not as influential as they once were.The key figure from the formerly Remain wing of the Cabinet is David Lidington, effectively May’s deputy.“Liders is in the engine room. Hammond and Rudd are shouting from the sidelines,” one Tory insider tells me.Lidington is, I understand, of the view that the cross-party talks could yield something on customs.The idea would be that the UK would leave the common commercial policy, allowing it to do its own trade deals, but seek to develop a customs arrangement with the EU that would replicate other parts of the customs union.If there is a deal, the big question is how does it get through the Commons One Cabinet minister tells me that they think Mrs May should make clear before the next vote thather deal is defeated she would request a six-month extension to Article .This Secretary of State believes it would squeeze the Tory Brexit ultras, making them choose between Mrs May’s deal and a Brexit delay.THE Labour Party is about to embark on a series of ideologically driven deselections – which is all the more reason for the Tories not to do the same.Political parties must be broad churches to succeed andthe Tories set about deselecting everyone who takes a dferent view on how to achieve Brexit, they will risk turning themselves into an overly narrow faction.For this reason, local Tories should stop thinking about deselecting Nick Boles.He is wrong on ruling out No Deal, but he is right on housing and a whole host of other issues the Conservatives need to do more on.TENSIONS are mounting inside Government about the role of Olly Robbins, the PM’s chief Brexit adviser.Robbins was, I’m told, deeply irritated by reports about potential changes to the UK negotiating team.But, as one insider points out to me, there is a problem with Robbins going back to Brussels.His professional pride means he is highly sceptical about whether there’s a better deal to be done.The second problem is that this is now all about what deal will get through Parliament.But Robbins, as a civil servant, understandably doesn’t have a finger-tip feel for that.Mrs May should be relying on politicians to do this most delicate of renegotiations.In response to a request from the Health Secretary Matt Hancock, the Chief Medical Officer has drawn up the first Government guidelines on social media usage.This advice is clearly sensible.If these social media companies want to demonstrate some responsibility, they should start introducing a two-hour cut-off for all users under .Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Instead, women tell themselves they should have been more attentive, or more ­attractive, or better in bed.This week the once queen of the TV jungle, Vicky Pattison, admitted she was wracked with self-doubt after her now former fiancé John Noble “cheated” on her.She even said sadly thatshe was “thinner” he might have remained faithful. This made my blood run cold.It’s typical that poor Vicky chose to shoulder the responsibility for his infidelity by not being “perfect” enough, instead of directing her anger at his betrayal. Noble was spotted with a string of young women on nights out and Vicky felt publicly humiliated and betrayed.One minute she was engaged to be married and planning her wedding. Then it all broke down and she was left in floods of tears. In order to salvage some pride, she decided to break up with Noble.Vicky really thought she had met her soulmate but, instead, it turned out he was just another man she couldn’t trust. She’s utterly devastated, but it’s infuriating her first ­reaction was not to think he’s a swine and cheat but that, somehow, she was the one to blame.Now, Vicky is a smart, feisty young woman and I’m sure she realises she was being very silly to imagine that being a few pounds lighter would have changed anything. But on some level she convinced herself she wasn’t good enough for Noble. Of course,it was the other way around it would be a dferent story.Noble proved he was a man-child, a commitment-phobe and clearly in no way ready to settle down. In these days of social media, he must surely have known thathe was chatting up other girls it would end up all over Twitter and Facebook and Vicky would discover what he was up to.Former Geordie Shore star Vicky says Noble claims he was set up in the photographs taken of him canoodling with a iety of young women, but he has expressed no remorse to her for his behaviour. He hasn’t apologised for breaking Vicky’s heart though he has been back in touch to ask for her engagement ring back.Vicky revealed that he hinted the split was actually her fault and, with her self-esteem and confidence at an all-time low, she actually believed him. His actions in those nightclubs would appear to be those of someone who wants to be found out, or perhaps he is just supremely arrogant.Anyway, I think Vicky has dodged a bullet. It’s painful and raw right now but, one day, she will realise she actually had a lucky escape. Whatthey had gone ahead with the wedding and a few years, and maybe a couple of kids down the line, he turned out to be a serial adulterer Vicky is a strong girl and will bounce back from this devastating experience. I hope her next ­relationship gives her a happy ever after ending. Butit goes awry again, she must not blame herself.And nor should any woman let down by her partner.ALL credit to Peter and Emily Andre, who have provided stability for their own children as well as Peter’s older son and daughter from his marriage to Katie Price.“The Pricey”, as Katie insists in calling herself, has been through tough times dealing with her mum’s terminal illness as well as some truly disastrous relationships.She might appear to be a cartoon character, but she should not be treated as a figure of ridicule. Despite the bold front, I reckon Katie is a mass of anxieties and insecurities and she is very vulnerable right now.I’m sure she is very grateful to her ex and especially to Emily for their support. I hope she takes time out of the public eye and gets her le back on track.I WAS heartened this week by the positive reaction to a married couple who are planning a family together, but whose circumstances mean that their only real option is surrogacy.So many wished trans couple Hannah and Jake Graf well in their quest – some even offered their services as a surrogate. They are a trailblazing man and we and role models who have helped young trans men and women in tough times.Hannah, was the highest ranking transgender soldier in the Army, and was awarded the MBE in the New Years Honours List.While actor and filmmaker Jake stars in Colette with Keira Knightley. Dominic West, who also stars in Colette, recommended that Hannah should take over from Daniel Craig as the first female James Bond.She thought this was flattering and hilarious, but reckons Jake would do a great job in the role. I am so very fond of both of them and in awe of their positivity. Their baby will be lucky to have such kind, loving parents.RIGHT everyone, you know what to do. Vote for Ernest Shackleton as the most influential person of the th century on Tuesday night’s BBC live show of Icons. My all-time hero is up against formidable opposition including Nelson Mandela, Dr Martin Luther King, Alan Turing, Pablo Picasso and David Bowie.Shackleton, the famous polar explorer also known as “The Boss”, was at his best when ­confronted by impossible odds, so I’m hopeful he can pull this off.When his ship, The Endurance, was crushed in the ice , Shackleton somehow ­managed to get all his men to ­Elephant Island in rowing boats.He then made the epic -mile voyage to South Georgia, where he climbed over uncharted mountains, to finally get his crew rescued. I was lucky enough to follow in his footsteps and re-enact that journey, then to pay my respects to The Boss at his graveside in South Georgia, right.If you don’t know his story then check out his book, South, or download the astonishingly good Channel  drama, Shackleton, starring Kenneth Branagh. And don’t forget to vote on Tuesday for this truly iconic ­British hero.BY all accounts, the Michael Jackson documentary Leaving Neverland, ­ which focuses on two men who say they were abused by the star as youngsters, is extremely disturbing and dficult to watch. If the allegations are true, then those who enabled such vile behaviour should be brought to account.Of course, Jackson is not here to defend himself, and he was found innocent of similar charges in a  court case, but the rumours have never gone away.No one wants to believe such actions could have been committed by the pop genius, whose music is still the songbook of many people’s lives. His fans remain loyal and will not entertain the thought that he might have committed any crimes.I feel sorry for his kids, especially daughter Paris, who is rumoured to have entered rehab again due to the stress and upset over the documentary.I can’t imagine how tough this is for a woman who loved her dad, but I suspect we will never really know what went on – and those on either side of the fence will never change their minds.TENNIS ace Andy Murray shared rather more than he meant to when he posted an X-ray of his hip after an operation to relieve the pain of an injury that has all but ended his career.The eagle-eyed ­– and mucky-minded – spotted there was an interestingappendage that drew the eye.Andy, above, might not be able to play tennis at the highest level any more, but he could easily take up snooker with that thing and become a world champion.IT emerged yesterday that all staff at the maternity hospital where Kate had her three babies have been told not to take any leave in April.That would suggest that after talking to her sister in law, Meghan has changed her mind about a home birth.So we will, after all, get that photo on the steps of the Lindo Wing of yet another proud royal mum looking as though she has just stepped off a catwalk.No wonder Meghan is hugging her baby bump so tightly.She knows the little one will be blinded by flashbulbs almost from the moment of emerging from the womb.   Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Tories need to show they’re above that.We don’t agree with much of Nick Boles’s plan for a Brexit so soft as to be barely Brexit at all. This week’s amendment, co-signed by Boles and Yvette Cooper, could have holed the whole operation below the waterline.But that does not mean he should be deselected. The Tory party has always been a broad church and it serves as a better party of government when pragmatism is its guiding force.For the first time in months, the Conservatives have shown the sort of professionalism and unity that the public expects of them.They must keep it together.IT is an outrage that speedboat killer Jack Shepherd continues to claim legal aid despite refusing toto Britain.Justice Secretary David Gauke cannot simply put his hands in the air and claim he’s powerless to do anything.Everybody has a right to a fair trial, and that often means help with legal costs.

So why lie Some people have been asking this weekjail is the best punishment for a speeding fine. But let’s be clear: She is not going to prison for speeding — she is going to prison for perverting the course of justice by lying about who was driving her car.That would be bad enough for an average citizen. But Onasanya is not an average citizen. She is a solicitor — and also an MP.An MP is known by the title ­“Honourable” for a reason: There is a code of conduct outlined for MPs which includes, among other things, integrity and honesty.Any MP has even more obligation than the average person to set a good example and to take responsibility for their actions — both of which she has failed, spectacularly, to do. She has acted asshe is above the law, which is simply not acceptable for someone whose job is to uphold the law.She no longer deserves the privilege of representing anyone in the legal or parliamentary system and it is clear to any right-thinking ­person that she should be struck off as a solicitor — and resign as an MP.It is her refusal to do this immediately which is the most astonishing thing about this story.That, plus Corbyn’s lack of ­leadership in not insisting she resign as soon as she was found guilty.By all accounts, it sounds like she was out of her depth as an MP from the get go. For a start, constituents complained she was uncontactable.She also spent £, of taxpayer’s money in seven months on “expenses” and was caught on video ­pretending to snort “cocaine”, which isn’t exactly a great look for an MP.The trial judge concluded the “truth comes a very distant second to your personal ambition, doesn’t it ”Whether or not that’s true, it is hard not to conclude, in the face of the evidence against her, that her refusal to resign as an MP is rooted in the £, salary it yields.But how is she going to help her constituents from prison One argument being made about her being sent to jail is that she is clearly not a danger to society, which is true. But the problem for the courts is thatyou take an oath to tell the truth, then fail to do so, it has to be considered a serious offence — and punished accordingly.Without a deterrent to stop people lying through their teeth, the justice system would collapse.Let’s face it, there is nothing about this story that makes Onasanya look good.She is going to have an ­electronic tag when she comes out.No doubt she is massively regretting not owning up to speeding in the first place — and taking the consequences.Her le is now in tatters.But resigning as an MP now might help her claw back a tiny bit of respect for finally doing the right thing. As a solicitor and an MP, she needs to take full responsibility for her actions.IT’S shocking that Bonita Baxter, a heavily pregnant woman with a serious heart condition, was forced to sit on an AE floor at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham for five hours after patients and visitors refused to give up their seats.Clearly, manners are no longer important to this nation.But the real issue is that the hospital was so overcrowded that, given the five-hour wait, no one was going to give up their seat.AE departments continue to be overcrowded in part because we continue to abuse the NHS, turning up to AE for anything from drunkenness to a broken fingernail.Anyone who has ever had to pay for their healthcare, as they do in North America, would respect our health service much, much more.In the meantime, we need to put measures in place to make sure that people start valuing what they have.There should be fines for people who don’t attend GP and hospital appointments.And AE should start turning away anything other than genuine emergencies.T’S heart-breaking, isn’t it, ­listening to Vicky Pattison blaming herself for the fact her fiancé, John Noble, had “grown close to” other women during a boys’ trip to Dubai “When something like this happens, you blame yourself and I did question myself. MaybeI was thinner he wouldn’t have done what he did,” she said on TV on Wednesday.Apparently, this charmer actually blamed her – and her size – saying that he was “set up” to cheat because of it. Vicky, darling,you are reading this: It’s not your fault he cheated. And no amount of dieting would have stopped him.A cheater’s always going to cheat.You need to take some time out to focus on yourself and decide not to be around people who make you feel bad about yourself. There is so much pressure on women today.There is so much emphasis on how they look and how other people see them, rather than a focus on real values, like the size of your brain.So I suppose it’s easy to understand how Vicky concluded that her appearance might be the “problem”.When the reality is just that she picked an a***hole to go out with.I ABHOR fat-shaming, and rudeness. And I have zero sympathy for the woman who refused to sit between two overweight passengers on a United Airlines flight from Las Vegas to New York.She caused a horrible scene and loudly called them “big pigs”, which is truly shocking.But luckily the shame was all hers, as her tirade went viral on social media – and she was thrown off the flight.It’s also true thatyou book a flight then you are entitled to the seat you’ve booked, andsomeone is taking up half of yours that’s not fair.But this issue should be dealt with by the airline, not passengers.Many airlines have an “obesity policy”. American Airlines, for example, requires passengers to purchase a second seatthey need a seatbelt extension and their body “extends more than one inch beyond the outermost edge of the arm rest”.I can imagine it’s a dficult and embarrassing rule to enforce – but it’s better than people taking matters into their ownhands.For once, I can say I did not stray, not even so much as once.THE Europeans screaming that the Irish backstop must remain are deluded.No Deal will affect Europe as much as – and in some cases, more than – the UK.And when the French farmers realise they can’t get their cheese across the border before it rots, and the Spanish – who sell more goods and services to the UK than it buys – are stranded with decaying goods, and when German car sales slump because tarfs make them too expensive, I predict riots across Europe.And then Michael Barnier will have a small dose of the pain he has inflicted on our PM.The reality is that citizens of these European countries, whose jobs will be under threat by No Deal, will not give a hootthere is or isn’t a hard border in Ireland.And frankly, all companies collect VAT for the Government and PAYE for them, so why not let them do the same for tarfs and be their own custom offices The Government can audit them once every three months, then the problem is solved.APPARENTLY, dog-walking in Tehran has been outlawed by the Islamic government in a crackdown against pet ownership.Dog owners will even face penaltiesspotted carrying their pets in a car.Tehran’s chief of police, Brigadier-General Hossein Rahimi, said the ban had been introduced because dogs “create fear and anxiety” among members of the public.Ironically, my experience is that dogs create exactly the opposite reaction.But what do you expect from a country that doesn’t allow women to initiate orce, dance or report a rape .Our country might be crazy at the moment, but let’s all breathe a sigh of relief we live here, rather than there.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Here, leading Conservative Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg offers his view:THE EU has taken an almost religious approach to Britain’s latest move towards securing a Brexit deal.The compromise put forward by my fellow MP Kit Malthouse has been immediately dismissed and any prospect of further negotiation turned away. The mighty EU has spoken and will not be gainsaid.In negotiating the compromise, both Leavers and Remainers made concessions. This has led to criticism from their supporters, as I found in my weekly radio show on LBC.Callers felt that I had become a “snowflake” in my willingness to see £billion of taxpayers’ money spent without giving us any advantage in future negotiations.The legal basis for the EU demanding money is weak. A House of Lords report came to the conclusion that while there could be a moral obligation, under UK, EU and international law there was no valid or forceful claim.The only motive for paying is to secure a good future deal, rather than to pay a ransom for our freedom.Yet I have come to the conclusion that leaving on March  is at risk and exiting the EU is a prize worth paying for and on which thewill be great.Unfortunately, in spite of the Referendum result, the majority of MPs are reluctant to see the UK part from the EU and at the least want terms that mirror our membership.This may well not be the view of most voters, who seem to welcome the clean break and are not fearful of the scare stories.It is, therefore, crucial to ensure the fears of those who are far from enthusiastic Brexiteers are assuaged. This is where the Malthouse Compromise comes in.By offering money and making the prospect of a No Deal Brexit unlikely, possible moderate former Remainers are willing to avoid Parliamentary tactics that would frustrate our departure.They can accept the replacement of the backstop, which could keep us tied in to the EU’s rules and courts forever, with a routine trade agreement based on existing processes commonly used around the world.This would not hamper the development of a future relationship which would be discussed once we have left. Although in these discussions we would lose the leverage of cash, we would not be squeezed by the backstop.The second stage of the compromise is that the implementation period could be extended by one year. Currently the withdrawal agreement proposes a maximum of two years.In this time we would remain subject to EU laws and what follows, but it makes the prospect of not finalising a future relationship less likely, which gives comfort to those who are determined to avoid No Deal.In my view, an extra  months of vassalage after  years is an unwelcome but not unaffordable price to pay. Critics may ask why Brexiteers want to lessen the chance of a No Deal departure — and the reason is simple.Regardless of the folly of Project Fear, which becomes more preposterous by the day, the Parliamentary arithmetic means we must either lessen the prospect by compromise or it will be done by sharp practice in the House of Commons.This could lead to delay or even no Brexit at all. This would destroy any remaining trust of politicians in our constitutional settlement, it would show reckless contempt for voters, yet the Brexit-denying amendment put forward by Yvette Cooper last week was only defeated by  votes.As with all compromises, Malthouse is not perfect but is enough for each side of the argument in the UK to accept.The question remains, will the EU response be positive  So far, it has not.This has always been at the heart of the debate, and in a way a compelling reason for going. Is the EU a Mafia-style organisation that has to punish countries that do not subscribe to its religion Their response to the Malthouse Compromise and the PM’s request to re-open the text will answer this question. It must be clear to the EU that the current withdrawal agreement will not do.Defeated in the Commons by the largest margin ever achieved in the lower house on Government business, it is simply too one-sided and allows too great a triumph to the EU.If the EU were to insist on its inalterability requiring the punishment of a recalcitrant, freedom-loving nation then it will reveal its true and barbarous colours. It would be evident on its own that we are right to leave.How much better it would bethis were wrong and that in fact the EU is the civilised organisation it claims to be — respecting democracy, the nation state and constitutional procedures.

According to Sky News, the company will confirm the move to cancel plans to build the new version of the SUV on Monday, just  days before Britain is scheduled to leave the EU. Unites assistant general secretary for manufacturing, Steve Turner, said the rumours are disturbing and many of the workforce will endure a very anxious weekend.Sunderland Central Labour MP Julie Elliott said Nissan is yet to officially announce the move, but that the inevitable role Brexit has played cannot be denied.The constant uncertainty, the chaotic government. None of it is conducive to encouraging business investment in this country, she added. While Labour MP for Houghton and Sunderland South, Bridget Phillipson, saidthe move is confirmed it would represent deeply troubling news for the North East economy. Tory Remainer Anna Soubry tweeted that it was dficult not to be angry at the reports, adding: This is Brexit reality. Nissan had voiced concerns about Brexit before finally committing to build the new Qashqai and X-Trail models in its North East factory in October , four months after the EU referendum. The Japanese company refused to shed light on the situation on Saturday and remained tight lipped. A spokesman said: Nissan does not comment on rumour or speculation. Mr Turner said it is beyond disappointing that Unite members heard about their futures and the holding back of planned Sunderland investments through the media and not directly from the company. These rumours are disturbing and will cause the workforce to have a very anxious weekend even though production of the X-Trail would have necessitated additional jobs on site, he said. We have a dedicated, world-class workforce in Sunderland, good jobs that support families and communities who deserve far better than this. He said Unite is working hard to establish the truth behind current speculation, adding that they will be meeting the company on Monday to establish the facts.   At the time, the decision to build its next-generation Qashqai and add production of the new X-Trail model at the site had eased concerns about the future of the North East factory after Brexit. It secured thousands of jobs in the Brexit-backing city, but prompted a volley of questions over whether a so-called sweetheart deal between the car-maker and the Government had been struck to protect the manufacturer from any post-Brexit EU tarf wall. Ministers strongly denied any financial incentives were offered and Chancellor Philip Hammond said any costs arising from the assurances would be small enough to be covered within the Department for Businesss existing spending limits. The Sunderland plant, which has been active since , employs almost , people, producing around , cars a day. Other Nissan models built at the site include the Qashqai, Juke, Q, Note and the zero-emission electric Leaf. Nissan is part-owned by French manufacturer Renault, which had led to concerns that production could be moved to France to avoid any tarfs which might be introduced on exports to the EUthe UK leaves the single market in a hard Brexit. According to Sky News, the firms decision is not expected to have a major impact on jobs. The U-turn comes as figures show car production slumped by almost a tenth last year, leaving the industry on red alert amid continued Brexit uncertainty.   A report by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traderssaid investment had effectively stalled amid fears over the UKs future trading prospects with the EU. Just over . million cars left UK factories in , a .% decline on the previous year, and the lowest for six years. Production of diesel cars was down by % to , last year. SMMT chief executive Mike Hawes said the fall in investment was deeply depressing and should send a strong signal to politicians to secure a Brexit trade deal. The reported decision by Nissan also comes just weeks after a triple jobs blow in the UK car industry. Earlier this month American car manufacturer Ford confirmed nearly  jobs would be lost at its engine manufacturing plant in Bridgend. It followed a similar move by Jaguar Land Rover to reduce its , workforce by , under plans to make pound. billion of cost savings - with most of the cuts in the UK. Japanese firm Honda also announced six non-production days in April under contingency plans to mitigate the risk of disruption to production at its Swindon factory after the UK leaves the EU.

He also claimed to have been told existing technology can be used to avoid a hard border in Northern Ireland, but again failed to explain what they were. Nor did he say why they had not been explained by Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay in Parliament last week, after MPs asked him repeatedly what they were. He told the BBCs Andrew Marr: In terms of an alternative arrangement, it can be done. In my own department I’ve got Border Force. And I asked Border Force months ago to advise me, to look at what alternative arrangements were possible. They’ve shown me quite clearly you can have no hard border on the Island of Ireland, and you can use existing technology. It’s perfectly possible. The only thing that’s missing is a bit of goodwill on the EU side.   Askedit was true that Britain would be less safe in a no-deal scenario, he said: “It is true thatwe have a no deal situation, there will be certain capabilities that we rely on for security, such as databases, arrest warrants, others, that will change. Of course that will change. He admitted that even though Britain will retain access to services provided by Interpol and the Council of Europe on extradition, it will not be “like for like.” “There will be a change in capability”, he said.

Number  strategists have reportedly discussed a plan to delay Article  beyond the March deadline, in order for the PM to win over MPs to back her deal in April. According to the Mail on Sunday, Mrs May would then call a snap election to take place on Thursday, June th - the th anniversary of D-Day.   The Tories opened up a seven point lead over Labour in a new poll, increasing their projected vote share by four points in two weeks.

Lib Dem Leader Sir Vince Cable said today that he would “quite probably” lead his party into a snap June election, despite speculation he was planning to step down.

My dad left when I was  months old, but my mum could not have done more for me and my brother.Then at , I started drinking. I was bullied at school, which triggered a mindset that I was fat and ugly, so by drinking I suddenly felt popular, like I fitted in, and it gave me confidence.Someone with fake ID would go and buy a load of bottles from the off-licence and we’d get drunk in the park or fields.My mum knew I was troubled and arranged counselling for me, but I didn’t see it as a problem. It was fun. As a student, drinking was part of the culture. It was acceptable to get absolutely smashed. I even chose my degree in hospitality management because there was wine tasting on a Friday.I drank the same as my friends, but while they’d be going out one night a week, I was going out every night and gradually my addictive nature turned on me.It started as binge drinking, then it became the first thing I’d do in the morning and last thing at night. It began to cloud my judgement, and as a result I ended up in an abusive relationship. After university, I went on holiday to Turkey, met a Turkish waiter and ended up staying for two years. I wasn’t thinking straight. I knew I was in trouble with my drinking and I thought meeting somebody abroad who was so dferent would change it. But he was very controlling. I was running a nightclub and he didn’t like the fact I wore make-up or spoke to men. Our cultures were dferent, and when I told him I wanted to end it and go back to England, he became aggressive.He said, ‘You’re not going anywhere.’ I had an apartment with metal bars on the windows and he locked me in. It was horrendous, but all I could think about was alcohol. He brought me alcohol and bread every day, then he was violent and used me. I was a mess. I didn’t knowI’d been in there two weeks, three weeks, or a month. I knew I had to get out and get some clarity, so I cut down my drinking and told him I would change.Finally, he let me out. I booked a ticket home and when he found out he flipped. He dragged me through the pub and beat me up, broke my ribs and left me black and blue.Somehow, I managed to get on the flight. My hands were shaking, I felt dizzy and sick.My body was crying out for alcohol and I realised I had a massive problem. I remember looking out of the window, thinking, ‘How has my le come to this ’I was broken – physically, emotionally and spiritually. It was chucking it down with rain when we took off and landed, but above the clouds the sun was shining and there was something about that moment that gave me hope.My mum collected me at the airport, she took one look and said, ‘Oh, my goodness,’ and took me straight to hospital. I felt empty. I didn’t know who I was any more. I moved in with Mum and she did everything to help me. I tried local services, but it didn’t work. I couldn’t live with drink and I couldn’t live without it.Then le got really dark. I moved into a flat on my own and I was drinking two litres of vodka a day. The only person I’d see would be the Tesco delivery man, or my mum checkingI was alive.I fell over, broke my arm, I had black eyes… I struggled to breathe. I could have blacked out any day and gone in my sleep.My mum was a respected pharmacist and in  The Pharmaceutical Society paid for me to go into a six-week residential treatment centre and I made it into recovery. It didn’t work and two years later I was in recovery again. Then in November , I had two weeks of absolute carnage. I ended up on probation for smashing my car while drunk. It was the second time I’d lost my licence and I was given a five-year ban. It was the best thing that could have happened to me. It brought me to a rock bottom I’d never experienced before. I was so empty and dead inside. I remember sitting in the police cell thinking, ‘I either carry on down this path, or I do something dferent.’ So I asked for help. I reconnected with my local church and went back to AA. I did everything I had to do and that’s when my recovery blossomed.Mum came down to Bournemouth from Wales to support me.I’d always planned to take her on holiday, but had never been well enough, so we went to Iceland to see the Northern Lights and had a great time. After we got home, Mum was getting ready to drive back to Wales when she suddenly collapsed. I thought she’d fallen at first, but then I realised there was something wrong. She was on the floor, out cold. She’d had a cardiac arrest.I dialled  and started doing chest compressions, trying to get her heart to re-start. I’d done basic First Aid with the Red Cross during my rehabilitation, but never thought I’d need to use it.I wasn’t fully trained, but remembered the ad on TV with Vinnie Jones. They said the ambulance would be eight minutes.It was the longest eight minutes of my le – then two ambulances turned up at the same time.  The paramedics shocked Mum’s heart six times, but there was nothing. One of them said, ‘We’re going to have to call it.’ I looked him in the eyes and said, ‘Please, try one more time.’ He still had the paddles in his hand – he tried one more time and her heart started beating. It was incredible.They rushed Mum to hospital, and although it was touch and go, she made a full recovery. If she’d collapsed six weeks earlier, I wouldn’t have been in a fit state to save her.Things continued to get better. I went back to court and when the judge saw how much I’d turned my le around, he gave me my licence back two and a half years early, which I never expected. I’ve been sober for six years now and pioneered an initiative called The Recovery Course, which has helped over  people in Bournemouth in four years and is spreading nationwide.I’ve met amazing people who have encouraged me to become a better person, and I’ve had more fun in recovery than I had when I was drinking. I don’t think you’re ever cured, though.I have to actively try to stay on track. I still meet friends in restaurants, but I don’t go clubbing or places that are going to be triggers. I despised myself, butI hadn’t gone through all that I wouldn’t be able to help people today. I turned my battles into blessings. In any broken situation, there is always light and hope. HOW TO SAVE A LIFE ●If you witness a cardiac arrest, call  and start CPR immediately. ●Place the heel of your hand on the breastbone at the centre of the person’s chest.

Nearly  presenters on radio and TV got a one-off payment of around pound, in their January wage packet. The cash was handed to highly paid staff such as Question Time host Fiona Bruce and University Challenge shyquizmaster Jeremy Paxman. All had been wrongly told to register as self-employed. Meanwhile viewers now have to fork out pound. for the latest TV licence – up by pound from the year before.  Last night Tory MP Andrew Bridgen told us: “It’s always the same with the BBC. They make a mistake and it is the taxpayer who pays.” The Sunday People first revealed how the BBC faced losing some shyleading names who had been told by the taxman to pay back big sums under new rules. This week BBC director general Tony Hall said it was wrong many presenters had been told they would only have a career with the BBCthey set themselves up as self-employed. This meant their salaries were routed through personal service companies, shyallowing them to be taxed as a company rather than as an inidual. That meant they paid only  per cent corporation tax.  But under HMRC’s crackdown it became the responsibility of all public bodies, including the BBC, to get shypeople’s employment status correct for the purposes of tax collection. The shake-up left many stars facing backdated payments of tax running into hundreds of thousands of pounds. The BBC is now trying to reach a deal with HMRC to settle all cases. Lord Hall told the House of Commons public accounts committee on Wednesday he had apologised to the affected presenters in person. He said: “The meetings we’ve had with people who have been affected have allowed me to apologise. “I’m very happy to repeat that again today. We’ve had some very tough and hard meetings with some of the people who are affected.” A BBC spokesman said: “This one-off payment was not a bonus but was given to shyaffected iniduals instead of shyexpenses they were shyunable to claim while we worked through the shychanges to their employment status as a result of the new legislation.” "},{"url":null,"title":"meghan markle hires birthing partner","story":"NewsMeghan Markle hires own birthing partner to help her and Harry during pregnancyThe Duchess of Sussex is said to have hired the specialist - known as a doula - alongside a midwe for her deliveryShareCommentsByToby Meyjes:,  FEB Updated:,  FEB NewsThe Duchess of Sussex has reportedly hired a doula in a break from royal tradition \"Get Royal Family updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailPregnant Meghan Markle has reportedly hired a specialist hand holder to support her for her big day, The Duchess of Sussex is said to be on the brink of breaking royal tradition by hiring the birth partner - known as a doula.

The monarch, the Duke of Edinburgh and other senior royals will move out of the palace and head to an unrevealed location, it has emerged. The arrangement was originally devised to be put in action in the event of a nuclear attack from the Soviet Union. Whitehall contingency planners have included among their ‘worst case’ scenarios the need to move the Royals to safe locations away from the capital, the Mail on Sunday reported. Officials in the Civil Contingencies Secretariat, the Government department responsible for emergency planning, have ‘repurposed’ a secret operation under which the Royals could have been accommodated in ious country houses to protect them from enemy forces during the Cold War.  The revival of the plan was ridiculed by leading Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg, who described it as a ‘wartime fantasy’ dreamt up by mandarins who had watched too many news clips of helicopters landing on the US Embassy roof in Saigon –now Ho Chi Minh City – at the end of the Vietnam War.

I thought I was going to die. Dad had come with me and he grabbed my hand, trying to reassure me. He told me Id be fine, but I couldnt really hear him. It was horrible, like a nightmare.  I hugged my baby tighter as tears flooded my eyes, skewing my vision as much as the news had skewed my thoughts. All I could think of were my babies, Oscar, , and Oliver who is now , and how theyd have to grow up without a mother. How Id never get to see them grow-up.  Over the next few weeks Id cry over everything. And I kept staring blankly at things just thinking, Im going to die. I remembered how a mole on my stomach had become stupidly itchy when I was six months pregnant with Oliver. My skin is very fair and I have lots of moles and freckles but they had never itched like that before.  And whenever I showered, the rest of my skin would turn pink from the heat but there would always be a white ring around the mole on my belly. But I ignored it because I thought it was just a symptom of my belly stretching and changing with pregnancy. I gravely regret that decision to ignore it now. Most dermatologists recommend a skin self-exam every month to detect unusual growths or changes early.It is important to look closely at the entire body including the scalp, buttocks and genitalia, palms and soles including the spaces between the fingers and toes.The acronym ABCDE can be extremely helpful in evaluating moles. If a mole shows any of these features, it warrants review by a dermatologist to exclude melanoma, the most serious type of skin cancer. Asymmetry: one half of the mole is dferent to the other Border: irregular, scalloped or poorly defined edge Colour: uneven colour or iable colours within a mole Diameter: the mole is bigger than mm in size Evolving: the mole is changing in its size, shape or colour Other signs to look out for include any new moles, a mole that looks signicantly dferent to the others , or any skin lesion that bleeds or fails to heal. Source: British Skin Foundation  But luckily I did not ignore it forever. Months after having Oliver, the itching had not stopped and it still had a white ring around the area whenever I showered. Then I started to worry. I knew then that it wasnt normal. I went to my GP, they looked at it through the microscope and said, well take it off. They carved and scraped it off that day but then I had to wait two weeks for the results.   When the results arrived, my GP rang and told me to come in straight away which brought me to the surgery that day. He told me I had cancer as soon as I sat down. But we caught it when it was still a superficial melanoma. My doctor told me I could have saved my own le by walking into the surgery that day. If I had ignored the warning signs, five years down the line it probably would have gone deeper into my body and spread to my bones. My dad had malignant melanoma which luckily he caught too before it had spread.   He always told me to check my moles, and get them checked by a doctorI ever noticed any changes to them. Im glad he told me because otherwise I may not have gone to the doctor when I did. Ive had six moles removed so far, and I have to go back for regular check-ups and I was told Ill probably need to get more off. But Id rather have , scars than cancer.  Now I dont ever want to go on holidays too far from home in Birkenhead again. Id rather go camping in the woods. I have very fair skin and when I was younger I used sunbeds a lot and oil when I was on holidays. I majorly regret doing that now. Ill use factor  and wear a hatI ever have to be in the sun again. Now, I really want to warn other people thatyou ever notice a change in your moles, please go and see your doctor. Early detection is vital and that trip to your doctor could save your le.  Skin cancer deaths are preventable, warns dermatologist Dr Juber Hafiji, consultant dermatologist,specialist dermatologicsurgeon andBritish Skin Foundationspokesperson, said that although skin cancer isa commoncancer in the UK, it can be cureddetected early. Dr Hafiji told the Sunday Mirror: “Skin cancer deaths are entirely preventableyetover, people dieannuallyfrommelanoma in the UK, which is one of the deadliest forms of skin cancer that I see.” “When it comes to Melanoma,millimetresof spread into the skin canmake a dferenceregarding the prognosis of an inidual. “Look out for any changes in the size, shape and colour of moles, especiallythese changes happen suddenly. “Itching, bleeding or changes in sensationcanalso bethe earlysymptomsand signsof skin cancer.” If you are concerned, or have a family history of skin cancer, thenDr Hafiji recommends getting a full-body examinationtodetect any early signs of skin cancer or precancerous growths. He said: “Although we haveseen an exponential rise inthe rates ofskin cancerover the yearsin theUK, there is still more that needs to be done to educate the public regarding what to look out for. “If you have lots of moles,howcan youtell you have a melanoma on your backno one looks for it  “There are a number of risk factors for developing skin cancer.If you work outside, have fair skin, havebeenbadlyburntpreviously,have afamily history of skin cancer,oryoure onimmunosuppressantmedication, thenyoure at increased risk. “Like peopleare used to having checks for cancers of the prostate and breast, so, skin checks to detect skin cancer early should also be recommended.” “Annual skin checks could prevent the heartbreaking scenes I see in my clinic every week where people hear for the first time that they have cancer. “Early detection is vital, soin doubt, get it checked out.” “Surgeryremainsthe gold standard treatment forthe majority ofskin cancersthat I seethe aim is curing of the disease.” “But preventionis better than cure, andtherefore adoptingsensible sun protectionmeasures will help reduce your risk of developing skin cancer.

Melissa Calladine, , went into shyanaphylactic shock after taking one tablet promoted by model and bodybuilder Jodie’s online health programme. Single mum-of-two Melissa claims her health has been ruined after she suffered five more anaphylactic episodes her doctor has said may be related to the pills. She said: “I almost died. I used to be an out-going, happy person. Now I suffer from extreme anxiety, shyterried that having shyanother attack will kill me and leave my children without their mum.” She spoke out after NHS Medical Director Professor Stephen Powis warned of the dangers of celebrity-endorsed products on social media.  He said: “Highly influential celebrities are letting down the very people who look up to them by peddling products which are at best ineffective and at worst harmful.” Melissa, of Bridgend, South Wales, ordered a detox programme including an pound. nutritional supplement – called JST Jodie Marsh JFlext Joint Care – after reading Jodie’s posts about her JST Nutrition range on Instagram. She was so impressed with -year-old model Jodie’s body transformation that she bought the pills in an attempt to replicate it. But iodine – which she is severely allergic to – was NOT listed in the ingredients section of the product’s website, despite being contained in the pills. Jodie said that while it is not listed under ingredients on the website, iodine is shymentioned on the site and in the small print on the bottle.  She said: “The product does say under ‘nutritional information’ on the website that it contains iodine – and it does say it on the bottle. If someone with a known iodine allergy takes it, there is nothing I can do about that.” But Melissa, whose kids are Keira, nine, and Lewis, eight, claimed the inconsistency of labelling could have been fatal. She called on celebrities to thoroughly check products they are selling before shyendorsing them.

The GP was concerned enough to sent her to hospital by ambulance. She said: “You read about people dying like this. “I felt so out of control. All I could think about was that my kids could be left without their mum.” It took THREE adrenaline shots to keep her alive and anti-histamine and steroids to keep her stable. Melissa contacted customer services at JST Nutrition. She said: “Although iodine was listed on the ingredients it was so tiny that even when doctors first looked at it, they couldn’t find anything about iodine on it. “Customer services said they would investigate the matter further.” She added: “When you follow a celebrity on social media, you feel you can trust them. “I felt happier buying supplements from Jodie Marsh because it was her, rather than some company I knew nothing about.

Now his ex is determined to honour his last wish and meet the youngsters. Alan Kilshaw, , died last month after a long battle against lung disease. His dying hope was that his former we Judith would be reunited with girls they paid pound, to adopt but had to give up. The couple were at the centre of a cash-for-babies outcry that gripped the world in  and . Talking of Alan’s last hours, Judith, , told the Sunday People: “He was in and out of shyconsciousness but we were able to have some conversations before the end.   “He told me he had always regarded the twins as ours and his last wish was for me to go to America and try to make contact with them. I don’t knowthis will be possible but I will do everything I can to honour his dying request.” Neither had seen twins Kiara and Keyara Wecker – who they had renamed Kimberly and Belinda – since they lived with the couple for just three weeks at their home in Buckley, Flintshire. The Kilshaws had given the money to the six-month-olds’ American mum Tranda in . But a custody fight caused uproar on both sides of the Atlantic. British social services stepped in tothe babies to the US, where they were adopted by a loving family. Alan was by Judith’s side as they tried to prevent the youngsters being taken into care and ed to America. At the height of the court battle for the twins, Judith was branded the most hated shywoman in Britain.   Mum-of-four Judith, who had two sons James, , and Rupert, , with Alan, and two older daughters, looked into international adoption after being told they were unable to have more children. They brought the girls to Britain on six-month tourist visas in December  planning to live in the couple’s seven-bedroom farmhouse. They shared the house with Judith’s younger daughter, their two sons, six dogs, more than a dozen cats, two ferrets, a horse, a pony and two pot-bellied pigs. In January  then-Prime Minister Tony Blair said action would be taken to stop the “deplorable” trading of babies to the shyhighest bidder, and a shake-up in the rules followed. On January , , Flintshire social services and North Wales Police removed the twins from the Beaufort Park Hotel, near Mold, where they had been staying with the Kilshaws. The girls were ed to the US in April  and placed in foster care. Another set of parents eventually raised them. Last August it emerged the girls had both started shyuniversity in the US and were studying shysocial sciences. Judith said: “He had fond shymemories of them and said they had grown into nice girls. He was pleased at their success but made the point that they would have achieved the samethey had stayed in Britain. “He never regretted that we bought the twins and neither do I. “But he did regret the way Flintshire county council social services intervened. It is possible that all that stress around the adoption might in some way have contributed to his condition, without us knowing it at the time.”  Former solicitor Alan became ill with breathing problems in February last year and was treated first in Leighton Hospital, Crewe, and then in the Countess of Chester Hospital. Judith thought he would be out quickly but he was in a coma within two days. She said: “He developed sepsis and it was frightening, I thought he was dying.” Doctors diagnosed scarring of the lungs. He had a tracheostomy in March he and seemed to be fighting back but his muscles began to atrophy. In December Alan died from idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, the same chronic lung disease which also killed TV star Keith Chegwin, . Judith and Alan who married in , and split in  but remained on good terms. Alan even walked her down the aisle when she married Stephen Sillett, her third husband, three years later. She said: “Despite our shyorce I hadn’t fallen out with Alan and he was still my best friend. It is like a chunk of my le has gone. I told him he was a good man. “He was always kind, shygenerous and respectful. We met through a lonely hearts ad in the Chester Chronicle. “If I had a problem I could always go to him, we never lost that friendship. We had become like brother and sister.”   Judith visited him in hospital every day and left Stephen in February because Alan was in need. She thought it would only be for a month or so but when she realised the severity of his illness she gave up her job as a cleaner in the Co-op. His funeral was in St Helens, Merseyside and Judith plans to scatter his ashes at historic Llanthony Priory in Monmouthshire. She said it would be a “fascinating” to meet and talk to the twins again: “I’d like to know how their lives went, what they’ve done, where they’ve been. I’d want to tell them about my le. I do think about them. Do they know about me and Alan, do they think about what happened to us  “It would be a good, fascinating shyconversation. At least the girls have come out good. I’m pleased about that.” Judith is living on her own and said it has its benefits. She said: “I now want to find my own le and find myself. My le has been a roller coaster but I think it is my time now.” Judith has bought a dog, a three-year-old shyfemale French bulldog called Roxy but was shyconsidering adopting a street dog from Romania.   She said: “The dogs are shyliving in terrible shyconditions over there, they put them in death shelters. I am friends with some of the dogs on Facebook, and every night I look at them.” Judith said she and Alan had several heartfelt conversations in his final days and weeks. Alan told her he never shyregretted trying to adopt the twins, despite the shyinternational outcry it caused. Talking about the girls’ lives in America Judith said: “All we ever wanted was for them to have a good le. “I still think they should have stayed with me and Alan.” She still keeps faded photos of the girls from the brief time they spent with the couple in Britain. Judith added: “I wonderthey’ve been told about what happened to them and about us  “I’m glad they are doing so well, I only hope they do well.

After owning four Great Danes, Jessica Williams, , noticed that strangers were often frightened of the dogs because of their size. So in a bid to make her dog look less scary, Jessica had an idea about how to make her five-month-old puppy Drama appear more approachable. Seeing that her dog-groomer friend had recently dyed her own pooch, Jessica decided to follow suit - by dying Drama bright pink and purple, and even painting her nails.   The mother-of-one from Fort Campbell in Kentucky, USA, has since observed that her dog attracts more positive attention now. Jessica said: People are generally scared of big dogs, and Ive noticed that some people might not approach my dogs as much as little ones. With them being dyed it makes it easier to socialise them, because not nearly as many people are afraid - especially when theyre pink and purple. It also means that Drama can be the reason someone smiles, and they would be more eager to walk up to us and ask to pet them. And alongside her short, pink nails, it makes it clear to people that she isnt going to do any harm! Jessica decided to dye Drama for the first time on January , and forked out  [pound] for the procedure.   However, she believes it is fully worth the money to allow her puppy to be more accepted when in public. She said: Even though Drama has only been dyed once, I am definitely hooked! We make sure that a safe dye is being used on her and she loves the experience - its like shes having her own spa day. Unfortunately, Drama is colour-blind, so cant see just how fabulous she looks, but everyone  definitely thinks she is! As soon as her dye starts to fade I will definitely be taking her back to the groomers to have it done again, she looks great. Despite loving how her dog looks, Jessica admits that she has received backlash from people who believe its cruel.   She said: Most people love it, but others hate it and think shes embarrassed. A lot of people dont realise that the dye being used is really safe so start to think its cruel, so I make sure I tell everyone that its a safe dye and doesnt harm Drama at all. Ive had complaints about painting and trimming her nails too, but I always make sure Drama is comfortable and a good dog owner should always take care of their pooches feet. Ive even received death threats about the fact I dye my dog - but in reality all of my dogs are spoiled more than most adults!

Vladimir Putin seized the shymoment to mock Donald Trump, and vowed to go ahead with new hypersonic nukes which could be impossible to intercept. Putin pledged to remove Russia from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces treaty after it was ditched by the US President. The deal, struck in  by Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev, kept missiles out of Europe and was seen as key in ending the Cold War.But it shycollapsed in October when Trump accused Russia of developing missiles that broke the rules. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo confirmed on Friday it was suspending the treaty.  He said in a tweet: “For + years we pressed Russia to comply with the INF treaty.Russia shyremains in material breach and is fielding illegal missiles. Time has run out. Tomorrow, the United States will suspend its INF obligations and noty all parties of US intent to withdraw in six months.” Russia has previously denied breaking the treaty by developing deadly new weapons that travel at five times the speed of sound. Yesterday Russian president Putin said they would now begin their development. He also accused Trump of being too immature for talks, saying: “We will wait until our partners have matured enough to conduct an equal, meaningful dialogue with us on this important topic.” Putin said Russia would seek to develop the medium-range weapons because America was already developing its own. But he said he would only base nuclear weapons in Europethe US did first.  The INF treaty bans ground-launched missiles with a range of  miles to , miles, and bans either country from stationing land-based missiles in Europe.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13926204.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_18355078.jpg","title":"ayr united 2 inverness 3","story":"NewsAyr United  Inverness : John Roberston hails Somerset Park among best grounds in worldThe Inverness gaffer was full of praise for the old fashioned surroundings as his side clung on in the face of a stirring fightback.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN NewsNathan Austin puts Caley - up \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailJohn Robertson hailed Somerset Park as one of the best grounds in the WORLD after Caley held off a storming Ayr fightback. Inverness were three up and on easy street after a crazy opening  minutes which saw United gt-wrap the game.

Somerset Park is one of these grounds that sucks you inyou give them a snf. Its a good throwback and their fans make it intimidating and a good atmosphere for teams when you lose a goal. Its brilliant...one of the best grounds in the world to come and play your football. In the past we might have lost a game like this so Im delighted.  Ayr knew a win here would take them top of the Championship and started well with Robbie Crawford missing a good chance in the first minute. But they soon hit the self destruct button as their defence went AWOL to allow Nathan Austin in for a double before Liam Polworth rammed home a third. The game looked over with barely  minutes on the clock and shellshocked Ayr took time to regroup. Coventry-bound Michael Rose rocked the post with a header before Michael Moffat drew a fingertip save from Cammy Mackay. McCall turned to the bench at half time and introduced top gun Shankland who immediately turned the tide. He set up Declan McDaid to haul Ayr back into the contest with a close range finish eight minutes after the restart. And a resurgent Ayr thought they had a penalty when Carl Tremarco appeared to handle in the box but ref Nick Walsh waved away loud protests. United continued to pour forward as the clock ticked down and Shankland set up a grandstand finish when slamming home a  yard free kick with five minutes left.  But their comeback proved too little too late as Inverness clung on. Ayr boss McCall said: Im just gutted. Weve conceded three goals and at least two of them were gted with just crazy defending.

Quick-thinking Lewis, along with pal Lauren Kennedy, sounded the alarm, got Nan to safety and dampened the fire with towels before the fire brigade arrived at the scene.Lewis told the Ayrshire Post : “The whole night was a blur.“We were driving back from work and I saw a fire in the window. “I was chapping on the door and ringing the doorbell. “The full house was covered in black smoke. “I couldn’t see anything. “I didn’t know how long the firemen were going to take and the house was still on fire so I thought I needed to do something. “Nan was shook up about it. “I was trying to get into the kitchen because Nan said there were towels at the washing machine. “They were pretty damp so I just threw them over it. “After we put the fire out, we sat on the wall and waited for thefiremen.

Mark Kirkby, , almost killed passenger Kerrie Anne Monaghan when he finally crashed into a wall. Miss Monaghan was in Ayr Sherf Court on crutches to hear the sentence on her partner, who she is standing by. The court heard Kirkby did not even have a driving licence and Sherf John Montgomery banned him from holding one for four years. Depute fiscal Lindsay Bain told the court police spotted a silver Volvo being driven erratically from Barassie Street into Portland Street. The police car’s blue lights went on and Kirkby initially slowed down before increasing speed. He was hitting mph in Templehill before heading into Harbour Road. And Kirkby’s car was said to have taken off as he drove across a mini roundabout into Port Ranald Drive. He hit mph in North Shore Road, eventually crashing into a wall at the Beach Road Kilmarnock Road junction in Barassie. During the whole episode, which began around .am on October  last year, Kirkby drove dangerously through junctions and swerved round corners.  When the crash occurred the car’s airbags were deployed but this did not prevent Ms Monaghan’s horric injuries. She had to be cut out of the car by firefighters and suffered numerous fractures to her face, head, body and limbs. “Kerrie Anne Monaghan is very lucky to be alive,” said fiscal Ms Bain. The court also heard of offences committed by Kirkbywhose address was given as Barlinnie Prison, on June . This time he was in a grey Ford Mondeo around .am when police spotted the car stationary on the A near the Pennyburn Roundabout. Kirkby was unsteady on his feet and slurring his speech, although a breath test proved negative. A a blood test found substances identied as cocaine and benzocaine. Defence lawyer Hugh Duncan said Kirkby’s relationship with Ms Monaghan was still ongoing. “He accepts full responsibility,” said the lawyer. “He comes across as remorseful to the injuries his partner suffered and to potential harm he could have done to others.” Mr Duncan said Kirkby had been remanded in custody since October , had undergone a detox programme, and had come to a realisation of his mental health issues. Sherf John Montgomery told Kirkby: “You drove dangerously at high speed for an extended period. I see no option but a custodial sentence.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnHMP BarlinnieVolvoAyrCourtsJusticeTroon"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article11461688.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/ymr_ayp_141112Elliots_02.jpg","title":"elliots prestwick evolve rebrand vics","story":"NewsElliots in Prestwick to \"evolve\" with rebrand as Vics  The VineBosses at Buzzworks say the bar and restaurant must \"evolve\" as part of its transformation.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  FEB NewsBuzzworks managing director, Kenny Blair, is promising bold changes at Elliots \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailOne of Ayrshire’s biggest hospitality venues has closed for a “complete transformation”.

Danielle Smith, , used a metal pole to shatter windows of a home on Ness Glen Road, Dalmellington on November , . But she didn’t act alone as Smith was spotted alongside a male when the pair terried their targets inside. Ayr Sherf Court heard he appeared to be carrying a black air rle. But Smith, of Castle Croft, Dalmellington, admitted shoving the barrel of the rle into the home. And the victims inside cowered in fear as they could hear Smith shouting “Get out here, get our here.” CCTV footage captured the pair on their threatening violent spree. Almost every window in the home had been smashed and holes in the windows were consistent with shots of the rle. Blood smears were spotted on the living room window. Police were called and discovered the metal pole used by Smith the following morning. A search warrant in Smith’s home uncovered pellets for an air rle in a box within her bedroom. But she told officers that the other person had been carrying the gun and she had never seen the gun before. She also stated that she threw the metal pole away as she believed the other person would have used it. Solicitor Steven Maxwell told the court he had viewed the footage. The lawyer commented: “It’s quite clear that she was quite literally in his stead and following him. “She cannot provide the court any reasonable explanation of how she managed to get herself in this situation but she was using and abusing drink and illegal substances. “At the time she would have followed this man where-ever he went. “If you fly with the crows, you get shot with them. Mr Maxwell said that Smith has “managed to turn her le around”.

They have at their disposal expensive advertising and marketing which hugely influence our choices and purchasing habits.,params: .pushHowever, Galashiels councillor Harry Scott felt the proposals amounted to unwelcome government meddling with personal choice, saying: ldquoIrsquom not in agreement with any of the proposals in this paper. I appreciate the problem, but this is typical nanny state, dictating to us how we should live our lives.ldquoIt will cause unnecessary restrictions on business, specialist retailers will find it hard to market themselves, and I doubt very much whether it will have any impact on the groups it is targeting.ldquoWhilst Irsquom very much in favour of labelling food to make clearer to the consumers whatrsquos in it, in principle I am against compulsion. People have to take responsibility for their own lives and lestyle choices, and as long as you keep within the law, the state should have no place in telling you what you can eat or drink.A motion put forward by Mr Scott called for the response to be completely rejected, but it was not supported by his fellow councillors.Instead, they opted to vote to submit the consultation response in full, albeit as a council officer response not as a political response.According to NHS Health Scotland, in , % of Scotlandrsquos children were at risk of becoming overweight and % were at risk of becoming obese.

others are believed to use a practice commonly referred to as ldquogrannying, to attend school in Northern Ireland.Parents living close to the border are braced for the re-emergence of ldquounapproved roads like those used during the Troubles, to take their children to school.While the UK and Irish governments have maintained that the free movement of people between the two jurisdictions will not be affected, queues of traffic affecting thousands of people are anticipatedcustoms checks are reintroduced on the border after March .A reciprocal agreement exists between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland whereby children living on one side of the border are able to access an education on the other side of the border.The caveat is that schools in Northern Ireland may only consider a child who is resident in the Republic of Ireland for admission after all resident children who have applied to the school have been considered.A practice known as ldquogrannying involves residents who move to the Republic presenting schools in Northern Ireland with proof of address at a grandmother or relativersquos house to avoid being left out.One Londonderry mother, who admits to using the unauthorised practice, has expressed concern.The woman, who has lived in Donegal for more than  years and has two children attending school in Northern Ireland, said the idea of sending her children to school in the Republic of Ireland never crossed her mind.ldquoIrsquom from Derry originally, I work and pay tax in Derry, it made sense for the children to go to school there, she said.ldquoIf there was an emergency, or they were sick and had to leave school immediately, itrsquos not practical for them to be in Donegal and Irsquom driving to work in the morning anyway so it makes sense with the school run.The Troubles saw many smaller cross-border roads become unauthorised border crossings known officially as ldquounapproved roads, which local people used to avoid customs officials and security services.ldquoIn my village alone, a tiny village, therersquos four back roads into Derry city, the mother of two added.ldquoI could confidently say % of my neighbours in this housing estate are from Derry city originally and still working there, or have children attend school there.ldquoTherersquos no way they would have the manpower to guard the border and stop every car, and therersquos no way people will wait in queues of traffic in the morning, theyrsquoll find another way to get there, theyrsquoll take back roads or roads that canrsquot be manned.Marguerite Hamilton, a former principal of Thornhill College, a girlsrsquo grammar school in the Culmore area of Derry, one mile from the Derry Donegal border, said it is ldquoinconceivable that children could be prevented or delayed from going to schoolcustoms posts were installed.Ms Hamilton said schools across Northern Ireland are aware of ldquogrannying students living over the border.ldquoWhen a child applies for school, we ask for a veriable proof of address, a bank statement or letter from a doctor for example,they can supply the proof, it is not the schoolrsquos place to go around investigatingthe child actually resides there or not, she said.ldquoAlso,circumstances change for instance,they start school living in Derry, and move even just one mile away to the south, should they be forced to leave the school and educational system they know ldquoWhatrsquos clear is that those arguing about the border in London will not have their lives affected by the consequences.Statistics on how often the practice is used are unveriable, but Ms Hamilton estimates that there are hundreds of children attending school in Northern Ireland who reside in the Republic.The Department of Education and Skills in the Republic of Ireland said it is confident the Common Travel Area will facilitate existing arrangements for cross-border pupils.Minister for education Joe McHugh said: ldquoThe school communities along the border, both in the north and in the south, have done tremendous work over the last  years in cementing the peace process and they deserve enormous credit for that.ldquoIrsquove talked about

continue to play.Likewise, the Department of Education in Northern Ireland said it is aware of the issue, but has faith that the Common Travel Area between the two jurisdictions will safeguard access to education.ldquoThe issue of the provision of  information on an application is not limited to the home address of a pupil and the department has provided guidance to schools on their duty to very

most money was declared Candlemas King or Queen and they ruled for six weeks.They had the power to make one whole afternoon a week a playtime and to excuse anyone they wished from any form of

It was a cold day but my friend, who is skilled in bushcraft, had brought his portable fire pit with him.We searched for drtwood and sat by the fire, roasting marshmallows and warming our hands. It was a short walk but dramatic rock formations loomed above us, making it feel like a real adventure. The kids climbed them and explored the rocky beach, where once there had been an open-air bathing pool.On our , we went through a small tunnel-like arch. I stopped for a moment, suddenly taken by the view. The ruins of Dunbar Castle were beautully framed by the archway. Locals call this archway the keyhole and I reflected that the term is a perfect name.When we look through a keyhole, our vision is narrowly focussed. Such was the effect here. It cast a visual spotlight on what is left of what was once a mighty fortress.The kids trundled on before me, noticing smaller wonders: a frozen worm on the path, a sea shell and interesting-looking stones. But I stood for some moments, taking in the view beyond and thinking of what stories those old stones of the castle could tell.Many people pass this way every day, both locals and visitors. Itrsquos a section of the John Muir Way. I have often been with my family to Dunbar Leisure Pool and the harbour and town. But somehow I had missed this short but spectacular nearby walk until this day.Dunbar Castle is now but a fallen-down ruin. Indeed, itrsquos dficult to imagine what it once was. But the weathered sandstone castles on the shoreline built by nature still stand defiant, somehow reminding us of their greater permanence in the face of human transience. But as I stood looking at the ruins, the keyhole focussed my thoughts as well as my vision.History is also viewed through a keyhole, a very narrow one. The lives and events of the castle were lived in most part unrecorded by it. The spotlight of history has illuminated only brief moments, and even then the characters have been only those deemed lsquoimportantrsquo.There are moments where the view through the narrow keyhole of history has included insights to untold stories. The bravery of Black Agnes, as she defied the siege in , is one of those. With her husband away, she was in charge of this important fortress during war with England. She refused to give up the castle, even in the face of bombardment and attempts to starve her small garrison into submission. Her mocking of her besiegers by dusting down the battlements with her maids after a bombardment is an image seared in legend.But itrsquos a chink of light on a huge untold story we are led to believe by historyrsquos silence that women were insignicant players in events. For sure they were oppressed and put down by a system that centred on male power, but they are half of humanity and at least half the story.As the actions of Black Agnes reveal, even with such constraints put on them, women were there, part of events and often refusing to accept their assigned role.The le of Mary Queen of Scots has always been for me an example of this. Yes, she was privileged and powerful by birth, but because of this history took notice of her.Despite all the political and religious challenges she faced, it was her womanhood which men deemed her main failing. And so she was judged by dferent standards. Had she behaved with the morals of her father she would not have lasted five minutes in power. But no one raised an eyebrow because he was a man.But more than this, even though Mary was the monarch, her royal authority was deemed diluted and even less legitimate merely because she was a woman.So she understood she needed to find a husband to bring her royal authority to full strength in a country full of powerful and bullying misogynist men.She chose the dashing young Darnley, and the fact that he turned out to be dross was not, in my opinion, Maryrsquos fault. How easy it is to blame a woman for a manrsquos failings. She was taken in by him it was he who was the failure, not her.Thatrsquos what Irsquove always maintained, despite the protestations of my tutors at university. And her third husband Bothwell, well he was a disappointment as well.It is the stones of Dunbar,they could speak, who could tell us of the truth of his forced union with Mary. She had been taken there by him in April . The circumstances of this still remain debated. Was she abducted by him as later claimed, or did she go willingly It was also claimed she was raped and forced to marry Bothwell soon afterwards to save her honour . This idea has been disputed by some because Mary is said to have miscarried with twins while imprisoned at Lochleven Castle some months after, suggesting a relationship with Bothwell even before Darnleyrsquos murder. So a woman cannot be abused by a man she has had a relationship with  Really If they could talk, the stones of Dunbar would whisper the truths of those events in , and the despair and desperation of a strong and clever woman whose destiny was stolen mainly because of her sex.These were my thoughts as I stood looking through the keyhole towards Dunbar Castle. Suddenly, my daughter Manja broke my trance by wiggling the frozen worm in front of me. I smiled and thought to myself that thankfully times have changed since the days when the castle was a fortress.But sometimes, I fear, not as much as we think they have."},{"url":null,"title":"new-fidra-gin-hoping-for-east-lothian-base","story":"Fidra Gin is the brainchild of Emma Bouglet and Jo Brydie and is currently based at Ballencrieff and Aviemore.The duo came together to create the juniper berry-based drink and have already enjoyed immediate success, with the product already available in a number of Edinburgh restaurants.Now they are hoping to make it  per cent based in the county, with plans under way to find suitable premises.Emma said: ldquoWe pick all the botanicals in East Lothian and, at the moment, we use a still in Aviemore.ldquoA friend has lent us his still for the time being so we can get enough momentum behind us and bring the whole operation to East Lothian.ldquoWe have potentially secured a premise in East Lothian.

It will also advise on any further, long-term solution to the issues at the beach.The groyne at the northern end of the beach will provide protection over part of the northern section of the seawall, with the potential to develop a higher beach in front of the wall.Finally, armour stones will be put in place along Lamer Street to protect the seawall.Discussions on how to revitalise the East Beach, which was once a popular tourist attraction, have been ongoing for more than five years.Pippa Swan, chairwoman of the townrsquos community council, has been heavily involved in the talks to find a solution.She was hopeful the latest measure would help and told community councillors: ldquoThe rock breakwater, the design has been worked on for more than two years.ldquoIt is now the preferred design solution and is the subject of a planning application.ldquoThere has been a lot of chatter about the East Beach and I wanted you all to be aware of what is going on and to be able to speak with some authority.Stones weighing anywhere between three and six tonnes will be used as part of the project, with work expected to take place throughout the summer and into the autumn.Mrs Swan was expecting heavy machinery to be on the site and said: ldquoIt will require big machines, at least -tonne trucks, moving these rocks around.ldquoThe East Beach will be the site of quite a lot of activity over the summer and we are bound to get some negative comments.

originally, I work and pay tax in Derry, it made sense for the children to go to school there, she said.ldquoIf there was an emergency, or they were sick and had to leave school immediately, itrsquos not practical for them to be in Donegal and Irsquom driving to work in the morning anyway so it makes sense with the school run.The Troubles saw many smaller cross-border roads become unauthorised border crossings known officially as ldquounapproved roads, which local people used to avoid customs officials and security services.ldquoIn my village alone, a tiny village, therersquos four back roads into Derry city, the mother of two added.ldquoI could confidently say % of my neighbours in this housing estate are from Derry city originally and still working there, or have children attend school there.ldquoTherersquos no way they would have the manpower to guard the border and stop every car, and therersquos no way people will wait in queues of traffic in the morning, theyrsquoll find another way to get there, theyrsquoll take back roads or roads that canrsquot be manned.Marguerite Hamilton, a former principal of Thornhill College, a girlsrsquo grammar school in the Culmore area of Derry, one mile from the Derry Donegal border, said it is ldquoinconceivable that children could be prevented or delayed from going to schoolcustoms posts were installed.Ms Hamilton said schools across Northern Ireland are aware of ldquogrannying students living over the border.ldquoWhen a child applies for school, we ask for a veriable proof of address, a bank statement or letter from a doctor for example,they can supply the proof, it is not the schoolrsquos place to go around investigatingthe child actually resides there or not, she said.ldquoAlso,circumstances change for instance,they start school living in Derry, and move even just one mile away to the south, should they be forced to leave the school and educational system they know ldquoWhatrsquos clear is that those arguing about the border in London will not have their lives affected by the consequences.Statistics on how often the practice is used are unveriable, but Ms Hamilton estimates that there are hundreds of children attending school in Northern Ireland who reside in the Republic.The Department of Education and Skills in the Republic of Ireland said it is confident the Common Travel Area will facilitate existing arrangements for cross-border pupils.Minister for education Joe McHugh said: ldquoThe school communities along the border, both in the north and in the south, have done tremendous work over the last  years in cementing the peace process and they deserve enormous credit for that.ldquoIrsquove talked about this issue in recent days with the heads of the department and the need to better understand the important role that these schools, their staff, pupils and parents have played in that and will continue to play.Likewise, the Department of Education in Northern Ireland said it is aware of the issue, but has faith that the Common Travel Area between the two jurisdictions will safeguard access to education.ldquoThe issue of the provision of  information on an application is not limited to the home address of a pupil and the department has provided guidance to schools on their duty to very application information, a spokeswoman said.ldquoA parent providing information that is found to be  may have the offer of a place for their child withdrawn.ldquoIn relation to the impact of Brexit, the British and Irish governments have agreed that the rights flowing from the Common Travel Area should be maintained.ldquoThe Common Travel Area provides citizens of the UK and Republic of Ireland with the right to access services, including education, in the other jurisdiction."},{"url":null,"title":"drop-in-labour-membership-part-of-natural-cycle-of-politics-mp-says","story":"Glasgow North East MP Paul Sweeney spoke out after the Herald on Sunday reported ,

I marvelled at the food that came out through that impossibly cramped serving place on the ground floor and envisaged a kitchen hotter than Tabasco, either behind or below, filled with world travellers who knew genuine Mexican food and were capable of serving up a respectful representation of it.Now the second El Cartel in Teviot Place, haunt of students, has left me wondering was the original El Cartel actually not as good as I remember, or is this one letting it down  A quick straw poll of those who accompanied me on El Cartel trips suggests the latter.Where the original El Cartel was electric, exciting, this one is monotonous, mundane. Itrsquos asits vivacity has been replaced by a tick box exercise, the dutul copying of the inspiring original dishes, gradually losing most of its sparkle in the process. Like Chinese Whispers, El Cartelrsquos founding message has become distorted somewhat in the telling.Guacamole, I used to think it quite special at El Cartel, is missing several tricks. Its greenness has an unpleasantly all-pervasive onion undertow, and is, by my standards, underpowered on lime, coriander and chilli. By the way, no need to order it as a dish because it turns up over and over again in other dishes, as does tedious shredded Chinese cabbage.Our pick of the daily specials, a vegetarian taco based on squash, sets the tone. The sweet vegetable is partnered with eye-wateringly vinegary pickled onions mixed with a brown salsa that might possibly have a connection with chocolate, but with bossy cinnamon in overdrive and enough chilli- and I like a lot of chilli- to ride rampantly over other flavours and reduce them to mere textures. Itrsquos one of those peppery chillis that sets up residence on the back of your tongue. I take a big slug of my rather medicinal lime Margarita and am grateful for it, even though it leaves freezer burn on my lips.Al Pastor pork ribs manage to be dull, with a lingering taste I associate with reheating. Theyrsquore in ldquocumin, garlic and pineapple glaze, a furiously fiery, fruity coating that makes us sweat and clocks in too high up the sweetness scale, but yet it canrsquot quite cover an underlying bitterness that Irsquom not actively relishing. Cashew and cabbage slaw accompanies it, but its dressing is also too sweet.We fancy a clean, refreshing ceviche, but the only fish getting this treatment is salmon, presumably farmed, which I never eat on environmental grounds. So itrsquos more meat, this time carne asado, flash-grilled flat iron steak, slicked with a salsa of grassy, slightly acidic Arbol chillis, avocado, spring onion.The tacos here are flexibly flabby, irregularly formed, hand pressed in-house daily using proper Masa Harina corn meal. Theyrsquore one of the best things about El Cartel. Duck carnitas are probably the star dish, fatty, crisp-skinned mouthfuls lightened with pineapple, brightened by hot Jalapentildeo chillis, everything calmed down by an emollient pecan salsa.On paper, this second El Cartel definitely outshines the original one. More space, an eye-catching giant mural, which looks like an Aztec wrestling an armadillo, bottles back-lit and lined up behind three stain glass windows that echo the Gothic architecture of the old medical school opposite. It takes bookings. But cramped and cobbled together as it is, I miss the original El Cartel. I leave this one sticky-fingered, with my mouth on fire. Irsquom not getting the same buzz as before, that subtlety of flavour. Itrsquos asthe impresario left before the apprentices learned all the tricks.El Cartel, - Teviot Place, Edinburgh   Food:  Decor:  Service:  Value:  "},{"url":null,"title":"power-plant-whats-behind-the-irresistible-rise-of-veganism","story":"Power plant: what#s behind the irresistible rise of veganism The Hug and PintThese days taking the pledge means something a little dferent. Starting your day with a bowl of cardamom and peach quinoa porridge instead of a bacon roll, or ending it with a curried tofu wrap in place of mince and tatties and cheesy beans.Thatrsquos because these days ndash and in particular this time of year ndash the pledge involves abstaining from meat, fish, dairy and eggs, and buying into a movement gaining fast in popularity: Veganuary, the month in which everyone from unabashed carnivores to pescatarians, vegetarians and reducetariansare asked to try going vegan. For a whole  days. Or  mealsyou want it in terms your stomach can understand.Founded by Jane Land and Matthew Glover in , Veganuary launched in  with  pledgers and that number has at least doubled every year. Last year , people took part and to date there have been a quarter of a million participants in  countries. Pointing to a poll by IPSOS Mori about actual take-up, the organisers have also identied what they call ldquothe Veganuary Effect, which suggests that around  times that number take part without signing the pledge.The core principles turn on animal welfare and always have. As well as campaigning against killing animals and fish, vegan organisations, pressure groups and activists have long fought to shine a light on the more unsavoury practices of the dairy and egg-production industries.Those issues remain valid but increasingly veganism is becoming an attractive proposition for those concerned with other subjects, from the environment and ecological sustainability to allergies, food additives and gut microbes. Itrsquos that which in large part is accounting for the rise in veganism. Moreover, while discussions of veganism have always taken in theology, philosophy and politics therersquos now a feminist angleand pop culture is coming around, too. Alert vegans enjoying Oscar-nominated superhero blockbuster Black Panther wonrsquot have missed the line about how the Jabari tribe are vegetarian ndash but those who did because they were too busy looking at the phones probably already know that mega-influencers Ellie Goulding, Miley Cyrus and Ariana Grande, who have a cool  million Instagram followers between them, are vegan.Figures for the number of pledgers singing up to the  Veganuary campaign were announced last week and reveal that , people signed up, making it the most popular ever. Adjusted for the Veganuary Effect that means a cool two and a half million people around the world may have tried veganism for the first time last month.Kay Steven was one of them. A part-time student who lives in Edinburgh and runs a consultancy business, she took the Veganuary pledge. ldquoIt took two friends signing up to Veganuary to give me the push to do it. Irsquove been pleasantly surprised at how easy Irsquove found it and how much support Irsquove had from friends and family.For Rich Hardy, Veganuaryrsquos Head of Campaigns, that sort of testimony shows that veganism has shaken off its reputation as a sort of culinary counter-culture and gone mainstream.ldquolsquoVeganrsquo is now a word we see and hear everywhere ndash in shops and restaurants, in peoplersquos conversations on the streets, and in newspapers and magazines, he says. ldquoItrsquos not hype or a short-term trend. Any movement has to reach critical mass to succeed. We think veganism has reached that point and is firmly on its way to the mainstream.Social media and smartphones have helped spread the message, he adds. ldquoAll of us can view footage of an undercover animal rights exposeacutewe so choose. With material like that so available, itrsquos helped get more people questioning whatrsquos been hidden from them.The mainstream has certainly taken notice. Last month restaurant chain TGI Fridays launched its ldquobleeding vegan burger. Not in the best taste, perhaps, but the oozing blood came from the addition of beetroot and the rest of the burger was formed from a mixture of coconut oil, mushrooms, herbs and spices. Last week, pizza chain Papa Johnrsquos launched three new pizzas featuring Sheese, a vegan cheese manufactured by Rothesays Bute Island Foods. And even McDonalds has muscled in with a Spicy Veggie Patty and a vegan-friendly Happy Meal.Therersquos no doubting the pace of change. Research by The Vegan Society in  found that just over half a million Britons described themselves as vegan and research two years later found the number had surged to three and a half million. In Scotland, according to  figures, there are , vegans, about twice the population of Dundee.No doubt some of them even live there, but itrsquos Edinburgh and Glasgow that are at the centre of the scene here. Edinburgh punches well above its weight. A list of the most vegan-friendly cities in Europe by pressure group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animalsput the capital third after Amsterdam and Berlin, well ahead of London.Scan a UK list such as the one published by magazine Vegan Le in  and you find Glasgow and Edinburgh safely in the top five.Scientists: red meat and sugar consumption must halve by  to save planetGlasgow has had popular vegan cafeacute-bars for over  years, notably city institutions such as Mono and its offshoot Stereo. A relative newcomer at just four years of age is The Hug And Pint on Great Western Road, and like those two it offers a vegan menu and doubles as a gig venue. With three other new vegan cafes operating just a couple of minutesrsquo walk from the Hug, as itrsquos known, co-owner and co-founder Colin Campbell is in no doubt the cityrsquos vegan scene is thriving. Itrsquos doing so in part because there are more vegans, but also because there are more non-vegans who are happy to eat vegan food ndash especiallyalso includes live music.ldquoYou can look at reviews online and actually a great number of our reviews start with lsquoIrsquom not vegan but helliprsquo and theyrsquore five star reviews, he says. ldquo[So] we have a lot of people coming in who arenrsquot vegan.As proof of that growing popularity and acceptance, Campbell and his head chef Jake Martell have launched a three-month residency at Glad Cafeacute in Glasgowrsquos Southside. They already run a brunch service there but now evening diners can enjoy dishes such as Jackfruit Curry or Sweet Soy and Coconut Tempeh. Theyrsquore also in the process of writing a Hug And Pint vegan cook book.Leaving aside the issue of morality and animal welfare, one complaint against veganism is that the palette of available foodstuffs is necessarily limited. But Campbell flips that idea on its head. To him, those arenrsquot limitations at all. The beauty of vegan fare, he thinks, is that ldquoitrsquos food thatrsquos suitable for everyone. Itrsquos the widest, most accessible menu we can do. If yoursquore a meat eater you can eat it,yoursquore vegetarian you can eat it,yoursquore vegan you can eat it.So why does he think the popularity of veganism is on the rise  ldquoI think itrsquos linked into a wider discussion, he says. ldquoItrsquos about things like the environment, thatrsquos a big thing for me and a big thing for people who arenrsquot maybe fully vegan or fully vegetarian but who are reducetarian.Vicky Allan: We build this future on sausage rolls Remember that word. Championed by the US-based Reducetarian Foundation, it promotes eating less meat, dairy and eggs but values pragmatism over an all-or-nothing approach. In other words you can still have full fat milk in your tea and, yes, the occasional bacon roll or plate of mince and tatties. The Foundation hosts at annual Reducetarian Summit , publishes a cookbook and like Veganuary asks potential converts to take a pledge.

Veganism ldquodoes seem to have gone mainstream, he says. ldquoWe get a lot more enquiries for it than we used to.

But, he adds, ldquoI donrsquot like to put food on that only vegans will like. Itrsquos important to me that everyone will enjoy it. The important thing is for the food to have mainstream appeal. ldquoPeople who would normally eat meat have to enjoy what they have here and itrsquos exactly the same with vegan food.Bann is vegetarian and has been serving vegetarian and vegan food to Edinburghers for a quarter of a century. But even he thinks itrsquos too early to saythe rise in veganism and the increased awareness around environmental sustainability, animal welfare and food production are a short-live trend or show a cultural and societal sht.ldquoThe recent upsurge might be a fad, but I would like to think itrsquos a direction of travel, he says. ldquoI think it would be a healthy way to go. A lot of people are not going totally vegan but theyrsquore looking for more vegan options. Most of our customers are not even vegetarian but theyrsquore eating less meat and they want to try dferent things. And I think the same thing is happening with vegan food: people are more open to it.Bannrsquos restaurant manager, Ruben Iglesias, came to Scotland from Spain  years ago and became vegan two years after arriving. He has seen veganism move from the fringes to commonplace lestyle choice. He agrees that social media and the internet has much to do with the increase in and acceptance of veganism, and like Bann he has seen the proof of it in the number of vegans coming into the restaurant.When Iglesias started at the restaurant in , vegan customers were uncommon. ldquoYou might get two or three an evening, he says. ldquoNow Irsquod say at least  per cent of our customers are vegan. Wersquove always been able to adapt the menu to be vegan but at some points last year  per cent of our menu was vegan, or we could adapt it to be vegan.Heres the big question, though: how many of those who sign up to Veganuary will still be off meat, fish, eggs and dairy come Shrove Tuesday which, as the pancake lovers among you will know, falls on March  this year ldquoWersquoll need a few yearsrsquo more data to get a better feel about the longer term conversion rates of people taking the pledge and remaining vegan, says Simon Winch, Veganuaryrsquos CEO. ldquoBut the signs are very encouraging that the campaign is really effective at helping people stay vegan for the long term.For her part, Kay Steven is aiming to at least make it to Pancake Day. ldquoIt feels lovely to have made the leap and Irsquom planning on keeping going for at least another few months, but to be honest I canrsquot imagine going back. Irsquom definitely feeling healthier and not deprived in the slightest.So is the future vegan ndash or will it only look like it every time Veganuary rolls around ldquoI wouldnrsquot go as far as to say itrsquos the future, says David Bann. ldquoBut I think it is another cuisine that is opening peoplersquos minds a little bit to what is available, and it just gives people another option so they can steer away from meat for a while. Irsquove never had the idea of changing the world, I just want to give people the option of something dferent from what they were brought up with or what theyrsquore used to.

The comforting creaminess of cashews is countered with sharp and fiery sambal oelek and balanced with the freshness of peas and coriander.

Meanwhile, in a food processor or a large pestle and mortar, blitz the onions, garlic, chillies and ginger, adding a little of the oil to achieve a thick paste consistency. Heat the majority of the rest of the oil in a large saucepan. When hot but not smoking, add the paste and cook, stirring often, for  minutes until it softens and gets some colour. In a frying pan or wok, heat a glug of oil and fry the button mushrooms in two batches until each batch is well coloured all over. It helps to keep the mushrooms a similar size, so cut any larger ones in half, keeping the smaller ones whole. When the mushrooms are cooked, using the same pan cook half of the cashews over a medium heat until brown, being careful not to burn them.

Whisky and beer, of course, gin ndash a relatively new product thats gaining a global reputation ndash and then theres the cider, and the vodka, and the wine. And, just when you think youre getting a bit too spoilt for choice, Scottish rum rears its head.Its enough to make your head spin.In , the Scottish drinks industry has never been in a better place, racking up a string of record-breaking successes in the last decade.The brewing sector has increased by % since , according to a paper published in October by the Scottish Parliament Information Centre . This boost was mainly driven by micro-breweries, which represent % of Scotlands brewing business base.The same survey found that distilling-related ventures have grown by % since  and now number . The growth doesnt seem to be slowing either, with new distilleries apparently popping up like mushrooms after a rain shower.Leading the boom both at home and abroad is, unsurprisingly, the king of them all ndash whisky. According to the Scotch Whisky Association, in  the value of exports reached a record pound. billion, representing % of all UK food and drink exports.The main Scotch whisky export destinations by value are the USA , France , Singapore , Germany and Spain. India is in the top three in terms of volume of product imported, after France and the USA.It might surprise you to know that the United Kingdom wins is the worldrsquos largest exporter of spirit ... and % of that success is due to Scotch whisky.And one of the by-products of that success is now developing a global reputation in its own right.Over the past few years, a string new whisky distilleries have opened, keen to cash in on the earning power of Scotch whisky. There was only one problem ndash the spirit must me aged in oak casks for at least three years before it can even be called whisky, and most fans wont even look at it until its  or  years old.This creates some obvious cash-flow problems for the new ventures so, to keep the money coming in while they waited, many began producing gin, which can be bottled and sold on the day it is distilled. Many of these brands have gone global ndash think Harris gin and Eden Mill - and have added an extra impressive bow to Scotlands drink credentials.Although England holds a higher count of gin distilleries, it is estimated that around two-thirds of UK gin is made in Scotland, and there are around  gin distilleries north of the Border.To put that into perspective, there are  whisky distilleries.This golden period for Scotlands drink industry may have its roots in the traditions of whisky and beer, but as its expertise expands into other areas it is developing a reputation to rival global drinks giants such as the US or other European countries, in a way that only a few years ago could never have been imagined.But can Scotland be considered a superpower on the international drinking scene Distill gameScotlands whisky industry boasts some of the best-loved drinks brands in the world, and new distilleries are at ious stages of growth all over the country.For instance, later this year, Ardnahoe ndash the latest distillery on Islay ndash is expected to begin production. Glasgow distillery, which released its first single malt last June, should complete a further expansion plan by the end of the year, and crowdfunding has just started for a new distillery on Barra.However, while traditional whisky is, as ever, leading the way, innovation and experimentation are driving a new wave of growth. Aqua Vitae and the Lindores Abbey distillery is a case in point.In Edinburgh, Port of Leith Distillery is ringing the changes with more than its alcohol. Its Lind  Lime Gin is being made at its Tower Street Stillhouse ndash the first vertical distillery which wants to become a centre for research, innovation and learning.ldquoOur country is very lucky right now to have Scotch whisky. Its the worldrsquos premium spirit but there is no reason to suppose that this will continue for decades to come,\" said Port of Leith co-founder, Ian Stirling.ldquoOther countries are stealing a march in terms of exciting products that are being created. We think that itrsquos for everyonersquos benefit for the industry that Scotland remains an exciting place and, yes, we have a wonderful heritage to back look upon, but we need continue innovating to create excitement and for the eyes to look back at Scotland for something new and exciting.According to Ian, the Scotch whisky industry, however successful, faces a ldquogenerational sht and has to pace up with realities around the world:ldquoGoing back  years, when Paddy and I were first engaged with whisky, everything that was exciting in the whisky world was happening outside of Scotland. Some distillers here were doing interesting things, but the majority of excitement was in America, South East Asia, Australia.ldquoWhat we need is to see the same vibrance in Scotch whisky as we see in the other sectors, which is a huge challenge.The distillery received funding to create a Knowledge Transfer Partnership with world-renowned Heriot-Watt International Centre for Brewing and Distillingto develop a research scheme that will focus on fermentation and yeasts, but that will also allow the transfer of knowledge to students from the institute and, at the same time, nurturing and having access to skilled workforce on their doorstep.Sharing the knowledgeScotland has traditionally been a hub for people seeking to learn more about the national drink, in turn expanding the scope of Scottish influence abroad in the drinks industry. One notable example is the fathers of Japanese whisky, Mazataka Taketsuru and Shijiro Torii.The tradition lives on and Edinburgh is home to one of the industrys most important education centres worldwide ndash the ICBD at Heriot-Watt University. Providing the worldrsquos only degree in brewing and distilling , it attracts students from all over the world ndash especially for its postgraduate courses, also available as distance learning.Javin Chia, , from Singapore is a third-year undergraduate student in brewing and distilling. He was a home brewer and worked for the industry in his home country before moving to Scotland for study.ldquoHeriot-Watt was recommended to me by one of the guys who used to brew beer back in Singapore. He told me that it was a really good course: from the moment he graduated he was never out of the job, as this degree is highly regarded.ldquoThere are many people in the brewing and whisky industry who have done this particular course. I once met Shinji Fukuyo, master blender for Suntory [a Japanese drinks giant], and he told me he graduated from it, which really surprised me. This shows you the reputability it has.Javin has experienced the effect of the Scottish alcohol industry surge: ldquoSingapore had one of the highest growths in whisky imports in the last few years, and not because everyone drinks ndash Singapore is quite a small country, but it has become one of the most important distribution spots for South-East Asia. We have a lot of good specialist bars and people who are really passionate about whisky.ldquoGin is becoming very popular as well, brands like the Botanist are well known ndash and Brewdog, for craft beers. They are the ones who converted me to craft beer!High HopsBeyond distillation, Scotland excels on a global scale in the production of beer, and the intention is for it to grow even further. In December, Scotland Food and Drink published an industry strategy that aims to make Scottish brewing a pound billion industry by , allowing the creation of new jobs all over the country.Hilary Jones, chair of the Brewing Industry Leadership Group ndash in charge of the research on which the report is based ndash explained: ldquoIf you look back to less than two centuries ago, Scotland was one of the few great brewing nations. We were inventive, bringing technologists and chemists into our breweries.\"We created new beer types and brewed Porters, Stouts, IPAs and small batch beers, added botanicals and flavourings. We exported to the USA, Asia, Australia and Africa. Scotland now has over  operating breweries supporting over , jobs.\"Even though we have an unrivalled track record producing great beer and centuries of history behind us, the rising popularity of global craft beer means that Scotland needs to sharpen its gameit is to remain an international leader.Scotland has had a number of global brewing successes, especially in the realm of craft beers. Innis  Gunn and Stewart Brewing boast Scottish products that appear all over the world.However, the company that truly brought Scotland to the world stage in craft brewing is Brewdog. Founded in  in Ellon by James Watt and Martin Dickies, itrsquos now exported to more than  countries, has premises all over the world and has been listed in the Sunday Times Fast Track  for six years running.Its innovative approach to both production and business expansion has been a role model for the whole craft beer scene in the last few years. In  it started a new adventure with LoneWolf, expanding to the spirits scene ndash launching experimental products with vodkas, gins and whiskies at the core of their production.The futureThe expansion in Scotlands alcohol industry in the last decade has been incredibly fast and erse, and has brought global attention to the quality of production and the quest for innovation. But to stay ahead of the pack, there are many challenges to be addressed.Huge work has been done to give legal protection for the Scottish name and the provenance of its products, and to ensure the highest standards of production are met, but with other countries often throwing away the rule books and fully embraced new ideas, its important sure rules are not too rigid and producers are able to experiment and focus on research.In addition, the image of Scotlands premium products must not be allowed to stagnate. Drinks such as craft beer and gin are attracting younger fans, while Scotch whisky is often seen as a drink for older men.Its price tag ndash often unaffordable for younger drinkers ndash and its image for stuffy tradition can make it feel like the fuddy-duddy older cousin of new products such as gin and craft beer, where experimentation and fun are making the products feel fresh and accessible.There was a day, no so long ago, when beer suffered a similar image problem, but all it took was some creative thinking, some products of serious quality and innovative producers like Brewdog and a global transformation began.There is no doubt that, across the drinks industry in Scotland, the quality is there. Were still a world leader, and pass on our expertise to new generations of brewers and distillers all over the world.While a commitment to tradition will always be essential, whether the Scotland keeps its place at the top table of the global drinks industry will surely depend on whether it can take its own advice and push its own boundaries."},{"url":null,"title":"government-money-to-help-deliver-eight-new-works-by-eight-scottish-composers","story":"AS this yearrsquos excellent Celtic Connections Festival draws to a close, itrsquos timely to reflect on the benefits of such a ied and exciting cultural calendar in Scotland.Festivals and events bring people together.

The Festival Expo Fund provides an important opportunity to maximise innovation and creativity across the festival calendar and to provide for the international promotion of talented Scottish artists.This is the first year an event outside Edinburgh Festivals has received support from Expo Fund. In recognition of Celtic Connections excellent international reputation, the Festival received pound, from Expo to fund this yearrsquos lsquoAbove the Surfacersquo series of concerts, two of which I have just had the pleasure of attending this past week. Above the Surface promotes new strands of music evolving from the Scottish music scene.Building on the use of Expo funding by the innovative Celtic Connections for lsquoAbove the Surfacersquo this year, Irsquom very pleased to announce the funding they will receive for next yearrsquos edition of the festival.Celtic Connections is to receive pound,, subject to budgetary approval for the coming year, from the Festival Expo Fund for their proposal to deliver eight new works by eight Scottish composers. This work will then be developed by composer Greg Lawson into one Symphonic piece to be performed by the excellent GRIT Orchestra.This piece of work will be entitled lsquoThe Declarationrsquo ndash a reference to the th Anniversary of the Declaration of Arbroath. This musical masterpiece has potential to tour internationally post Celtic Connections , which is essential as we work to project Scottish culture and heritage to the world during these politically turbulent times.Over the past  years, Celtic Connections has grown into one of the worldrsquos largest winter music festivals with positive cultural and economic impacts on Glasgow and the rest of Scotland. The Festival brings talented Scottish artists with those from overseas across a range of genres of music together in a celebration of culture and music that transcends borders. Celtic Connections enables us to enhance our strong cultural relationships with other nations by increasing our understanding of each other through creative expression and traditions.We only need to look at the recent tourism statistics to see, tourists are still flocking to Scotland to see our beautul country.No doubt many of these tourists are engaging with our culture by attending a festival, whether it be warming up at a cosy Celtic Connections folk show in the depths of the Glasgow winter, or dancing through Edinburgh in the summer sun at a silent disco.It is during these uncertain times that the power of culture and the arts illustrate how we can come together and project Scotland as an inclusive and outward looking nation. It is essential that we support these efforts to ensure international visitors continue to choose Scotland as their preferred destination.We all benefit from a thriving cultural calendar that showcases our nation. The UK Governmentsrsquo plan to leave the EU is a threat to our cultural calendar and global reputation as an outward-looking nation. As the UK government insists on hostile immigration and visa policies, we in Scotland must work even harder to ensure our well known hospitality, warmth and welcome projects out to the world, ensuring Scotland remains attractive for both festival goers and performers."},{"url":null,"title":"calls-for-review-after-couple-sought-help-eight-times-before-north-lanarkshire-man-took-his-own-life","story":"Karen McKeowns partner Luke Henderson was found dead in their Bellshill home in December , after the couple had begged for urgent treatment for his mental health dficulties eight times in the previous week.They spoke to  dferent medical professionals at NHS , GP surgeries, AE units and support services around North Lanarkshire before father-of-two Luke killed himself, and were either turned away or referred where.Karen is now calling for a complete review of mental health service provision across the NHS in Scotland and believes a Fatal Accident inquiryshould be held into her partners death.She has been supported by Dundee campaigner Gillian Murray, whose uncle David Ramsay also took his own le after being twice turned away from hospital.David was told to get some fresh air after being refused admittance to the Carseview unit in Dundee in .This week the pairs petition will be launched at the Scottish Parliament, which they hope will help highlight the problems with current services and prevent further ldquounnecessary deaths.It will also call for an automatic FAI into the death of anyone who dies by suicide and has engaged with mental health services in the three months prior to their death.Karen said: ldquoIt has taken a long time to get this far but I am confident this will help to start the conversation and help politicians, and members of the public who dont know about this, see there is something drastically wrong with our mental health services in Scotland.ldquoLuke shouldnt have died. We tried everything we could to get him help and he was still failed.ldquoI wasnt listened to by doctors who kept telling me he was not suicidal. He hadnt slept for days and was behaving abnormally, yet they seemed to think he was fine.ldquoI have to do everything I can to make sure this will not happen to anyone . It needs to change, and people need to be able to access help when they need it, immediately.Karen, , has asked for an inquiry into her partners death, but has been refused by the Crown Office.She has also met the mental health minister Clare Haughey, but said she felt let down by the politicians lack of understanding of the seriousness of the problem facing people across the country.NHS Lanarkshire have previously denied any wrongdoing following a review of the circumstances surrounding Lukes death, and say their staff acted appropriately.Karen, said: ldquoIf we cannot get people the help they need urgently, when they are in the most vulnerable state, then what chance do we have of stopping this happening again  I know this isnt just a problem where I live. It is happening all over Scotland and its about time mental illness is treated the same way as a physical problem.Gillian, , said: ldquoThis petition is vital because it has been apparent that mental health failings are not unique to NHS Tayside . The same failings are happening up and down the country.\"The culture of secrecy and denial in the NHS needs to stop no lessons will ever truly be learnt until we have genuinely independent and transparent investigations.\"It is wrong that a prisoner who dies in custody will get an automatic FAI yet those who die in hospital or, in Davidrsquos Ramsay and Luke Hendersonrsquos cases contact with the NHS in the days leading up to their deaths yet were turned away. We have to fight for an FAI to find out why these failings happened \"Something needs to change and quickly too many people are dying. There are too many of us saying the same thing for this to be a coincidence.Following the death of fellow campaigner Gillians uncle David, an inquiry was launched into the Carseview unit at Ninewells hospital in Dundee.Relatives of at least  people who have died by suicide claim the deaths could have been avoided.Another man, Dale Thompson also took his own le days after being discharged from Carseview in .His distraught mother previously told MSPs that his son was informed there was ldquonothing wrong with him.The health board admitted in  that Dales ldquocare and treatment fell below the standard.It is the latest in a series of concerns raised about psychiatric facility, which is also at the centre of abuse allegations."},{"url":null,"title":"eilean-donan-castle-why-iconic-scottish-landmark-is-actually-only-100-years-old","story":"But for many years Eilean Donan castle did not look as it does now, and this year marks  years since the fateful battle which left the castle in ruins after destruction by the British during the Jacobite rising.Two hundred years later work began on restoring Eilean Donan to its former glory by John MacRae-Gilstrap of Clan MacRae.Sitting between the three sea lochs of Loch Long, Loch Alsh, and Loch Duich, the castle was used as a stronghold by Spanish invaders during the uprising in a bid to restore James Stuart, son of James IV of Scotland, to the throne.The castle was under heavy bombardment from British naval ships for several days and, eventually, after barrels of gunpowder were set alight, the Eilean Donan was demolished and would not be lived in for over  years.Dr Iain MacInnes is an expert in medieval Scotland from the University of the Highlands and Islands. He spoke about how the castle has had a long history of importance to Scotland:ldquoIt is perhaps its location that makes it special, on the road to Skye, and regularly voted as one of Scotlandrsquos most picturesque castles. There is little doubting its romantic location and its general setting.ldquoThe fact that a castle appears to have existed in some form on this site from the very early middle ages suggests that it was situated at an important strategic location.ldquoIts access to the sea meant it would likely have acted not just as a castle, but also as a harbour for ships connected to the ruling families in the area, from which they could project their sea power over the region.ldquoThis was an important part of lordship in this region, where travel by water was probably more important than travel by land. Its likely th-century origins also relate to providing defence in depth against Scandinavian raids and incursions in a period when Scoto-Norse relations were not good.Dr MacInnes also says that, as with many of Scotlandrsquos Castles, Robert the Bruce may have paid a visit as part of his conquest of Scotland.ldquoClan history suggests that Robert the Bruce stayed at Eilean Donan in - on his flight westwards following his defeat at the battle of Methven, he said.ldquoThere is no corroborative evidence for this, however, and the temptation to be associated with the warrior king is quite a strong one in many clan histories, so this might well come under the heading of myth.ldquoAnd, as with many Scottish castles, there is the ghost of a mysterious lady also associated with it. Scottish folklore has a lot to answer for.\"There is even a suggestion of a Mathesonbeing able to speak to birds. Make of that what you will.ldquoIts last hurrah in the Jacobite uprising of  is a pretty spectacular way to go out!Between  and , work began on the rebuilding of Eilean Donan by Lieutenant-Colonel John MacRae-Gilstrap. As well as adding the famous footbridge to connect the island to the mainland, the castle itself was restored to stand just as it had done for hundreds of years before its destruction.Now, visitors from all over Scotland and the world come to visit it, take pictures and even marry there, cementing its status as a Scottish cultural icon.Clan Mackenzie, along with Clan Macrae, has a special affinity with the castle, as it was the stronghold of the Clan for many years. A committee member of the Clan Mackenzie Society spoke about the clans long association with the fortress: ldquoIt seems reasonably clear that the Mackenzies had lost control of Eilean Donan in the first half of the th century, they said.ldquoThen, following a long exile on the part of the chief, Murdoch Dubh, he finally seems likely to have recovered the familyrsquos power base in a purported Royal Charter of  ndash which was purported to have been further confirmed in  to his son in a grant from the Exchequer.ldquoBecause of the Mackenzies power-base in this region it was chosen as the landing place for the Jacobite invasion, which was aided by Spanish troops but defeated in the glen near the castle by the English General Wightman.ldquoThe Mackenzie chief, William Dubh , the th Earl and nd Jacobite Marquis of Seaforth, played a heroic role in this rising before being wounded and carried across the mountainsto exile and safety.ldquoThe MacRaes also played an important role in the history of the castle, since they are a local clan who were the traditional bodyguards of the Mackenzie chief and their own chiefs had been the hereditary constables of Eilean Donan and were consequently dubbed lsquoMackenziersquos Shirt-of-Mailrsquo."},{"url":null,"title":"happy-birthday-facebook-or-is-it","story":"The back story is as rich and seemingly as unlikely as a movie script and was the nub of the narrative in the  Oscar-winning film The Social Network.It all began in  when Mark Zuckerberg and friends created an online programme called Facemash in a dorm room in Kirkland House on the Hard campus.It was created as a  to connect students,only to rate each otherrsquos attractiveness, and Zuckerberg almost faced expulsion. There were other online directories but none which cover the entire student body.Overnight successOn February , , the first version of Facebook ndash then known as thefacebook ndash was unveiled for students.

Celebrities clicked on that this was an unspun, unadulterated way of reaching fans. And previous unknowns became newborn stars on Facebook.

And for only a fraction of conventional advertising.

Her Instagram, account contained horric material about depression and suicide.Russell said: ldquoThe more I looked, the more there was that chill horror that I was getting a glimpse into something that had such profound effects on my lovely daughter.This prompted the Childrenrsquos Commissioner for England to write an open letter to all social media s, accusing them of losing control of the content they carried. Anne Longfield called for the creation of a ldquodigital ombudsman to ensure that companies were protecting young children and the vulnerable and to quicken the removal of disturbing material.UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock also warned that he would use the lawthey donrsquot clean their act.Social media has also been blamed for soaring of kne crime, particularly among young people. politan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick claimed trivial disputes could escalate into violence ldquowithin minutes when rivals goaded each other online.In July last year Facebookrsquos value on the stock market dropped by a record  billion in just two hours.

It logs every action by you and your friends and also substantial offsite browsing through its share button. It also co-ordinates and collates information provided by friends.There have also been repeated claims that the app eavesdrops on your conversations and then targets advertisements tailored to you.One freelance journalist once claimed that after a conversation with her partner about urination devices for their camper-van that next day an ad for them popped up on her timeline.A later discussion about a stabbing brought an ad for a stab-proof vest, she said.Facebook denies spying and ascribes events like this to part of a long-standing conspiracy theory, but therersquos no denying that its apps often include an agreement giving permission to access your camera and microphone because people film video and take pictures for Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and its Messenger service.Last year Facebook became embroiled in the controversy over the British company Cambridge Analytica and the targeting of political ads during the  US presidential elections and the UK referendum.Facebook shared the data from  million accounts with the company which then used the information to convince potential Trump voters to turn out to vote, and Leavers to do the same.Zuckerberg was asked three times to testy before a UK parliamentary committee investigating the Cambridge data-harvesting scam but refused, nominating deputies in his stead."},{"url":null,"title":"two-decades-of-glasgay-how-the-legendary-festival-helped-shape-lgbt-scotland","story":"Now more than  years since it launched, the Glasgay! Festival may no longer exist, but its legacy remains.Launched just  years after homosexuality was decriminalised in Scotland, Glasgay was the first of its kind and gave mainly lesbian and gay artists a much-needed  to showcase their talents.Later producers expanded the concept to include commissions from LGBT artists including makar Jackie Kay and the late performer Diane Torr.Legendary film maker John Waters, comedian Alan Carr and actor Sir Ian McKellen were also among the line-up.Founded with a backdrop of Section  legislation ndash when UK local authorities were banned from publishing material about, or promoting, homosexuality ndash Glasgay! wasnrsquot without controversy.Articles from the time stated that the ldquoarty farty festival for homosexuals was ldquobeyond a joke while others decried organisers, saying it was a waste of public money.Cordelia Ditton, co-founder of Glasgay!, explained: ldquoIt was kind of bonkers ndash so outlandish.ldquoOne of the articles I remember reading literally talked about lsquothe twilight world of the homosexualrsquo. I thought lsquoyou cannot have a paper like this, talking about gay people like that.ldquoDue to Section  [brought in ] a lot of people were very politicised about lesbian and gay rights and how we were seen.ldquoWhen I moved to Glasgow in  I was amazed as there was very little visibility. There were certainly things going on below the surface and people doing some amazing work, but it was largely invisible. I found it strange and thought there had to be something we could do.ldquoI thought it wasnrsquot fair. We wanted to make the argument that we pay our taxes and we disproportionately contribute to the arts, so itrsquos about time we had something for, and about, us as well.Cordelia teamed up with freelance arts administrator Dominic DrsquoAngelo and put on the first Glasgay! in , with more than  events running between October  and November .However funding, which was a long-running issue for the event over its  years, forced a blackout in  and again in  before the organisers stepped down and a new team took over.Steven Thomson, producer from  until , said his focus was on not only curating a festival but commissioning artists who were under-represented.He said: ldquoIn  we had got this award from an American travel guide which listed Glasgow as the fourth top gay destination in the world. There were people in the world looking at what we were doing and they thought it was great. There was, however, constant backlash on our own doorstep.ldquoWe still had the camp stereotypes of Julian Clarey mincing about on TV or Gimme Gimme Gimme where there was constant boyfriend issues.ldquoI recognised I had to change that. I began to talk about the idea that Glasgay! should commission its own work. There was a wealth of female writers out there, particularly Jackie Kay and Louise Welsh, Zoe Strachan and Stef Smith who were just not getting the chance from the mainstream theatres, which were mainly led by English men.By , LGBT rights in Scotland had changed drastically since the first festival  years earlier.Section  had been repealed, and employment law prohibiting discrimination based onsexuality was introduced in . Civil partnerships for same-sex couples was legalised in , and same-sex marriages were approved in .The TIE campaign, which has successfully campaigned for LGBT issues to be taught in Scottish schools, was just getting off the ground following the Independence Referendum in September .However, with austerity cuts, the festival failed to secure long-term funding in  and was forced to close. The event, which burst on to the scene with such controversy in  fizzled away with an uncharacteristic lack of drama.The decision to keep quiet about what had happened was hard, explained Steven.He said: ldquoWe didnrsquot really make a big deal of it, but when Creative Scotland changed the whole funding process, we applied to be a regularly funded client as we had been before.ldquoIn  we didnrsquot get through.ldquoI had seen many years of people and organisations going down.

Although all things from ants to elephants hear vastly dfering frequencies, the objective reality of sound existed long before sensory organs evolved to detect it. Trees will continue to fall with a crack and thud long after our brief, torrid stewardship of this planet is over.Yet, whatthe person who observed that falling tree lacked the ability to form memories  Certainly, theyrsquod have no frame of reference to comprehend a tree. And without memory, stuck inside an eternal millisecond, that person would also have zero awareness of their own conciousness. Time would simply cease to exist, melting away like a Dali clock. A perceivable reality would simply not exist. Le would be indistinguishable from death. No trees would ever fall.Itrsquos a truth staggering in its obviousness. That each creature on this planet ndash in the universe, perhaps ndash is only able to exist,and evolve due to their brainrsquos ability to store information. And thanks to a revelatory new discovery, many scientists now believe cerebral stickiness didnrsquot actually co-evolve with the brain, as once presumed.It now looks likely that all consciousness is simply the result of an ancient viral infection ndash one we, thankfully, canrsquot shake off. And although this mysterious affliction remains incurable, it is no longer undetectable.Great story, ArcGENETICISTS recently studying lsquoArcrsquondash a gene active within our neurons and understood to be responsible for forming and retaining memory ndash werenrsquot quite prepared for what they discovered. It seems special proteins created by Arc do something astonishing ndash they shape themselves into the unmistakable Hellraiser ldquoPinhead shape of a virus.The genetic evidence strongly suggests this mysterious organism first infected a common ancestor of ours around  million years ago and, apparently, completely altered its primitive brain.By transmitting genetic code through its RNA, the virus actually gave this pre-dinosaur organism and its descendants the same gt I got on Christmas morning  on VHS ndash Total Recall. Over millions of years, this new ability gave rise to consciousness itself. And, eventually, you and I.Itrsquos certainly a disturbing and novel spin on the origin of our acute self-awareness, perhaps confirming once and for all that we are not sospecial as a species. Itrsquos quite likely we are simply durable skin bags, built by nature to safely incubate and transport viruses. If we are indeed just drone mules gted a small degree of universal awareness by the viral occupants of our brains, at least we mutually benefit by such co-dependence by being aware of our three score and ten blink-in-the-eye-of-infinity wee existences.Itrsquos certainly unarguable that the evolutionary advantage of being able to form memories eventually led some curious apes to launch steel phalluses towards the moon ndash and also creating the medium yoursquore reading these words on. It also allowed these apes to work out they were on a spherical rock that was spinning around a nuclear furnace in the middle of infinity.That said, itrsquos possible that human scientic endeavour itself is simply the ancient virus attempting to understand itself by evolving brains of the organisms it has infected. It did come first, after all.An enlightened voiceIF memory is indeed a virus, what does this mean for we egotistical humans who have historically believed ourselves a cut above the rest of the species on this planet  Certainly, many enlightened members of our tribe have tried to tell us over the years that the miracle of memory is key to solving the mysteries of consciousness and the human condition.The first known study of memory was Aristotlersquos treatise ldquoOn The Soul, the title of which might also be the first known instance of irony. The philosopherrsquos then-heretical musings suggested wehumans are simply blank slates, not animated by any magical eternal soul, there was no afterle and we are simply the sum of our experiences. Aristotle wasnrsquot invited to many parties.Although countless philosophers and intellectuals have come and gone since his death  years ago, few humans have advanced Aristotlersquos studious musings on the enigma of memory and true nature of reality more than Irish singer Daniel OrsquoDonnell.Although his work is often dismissed by accepted mainstream perception as offensively featherweight easy-listening, serious academic study of OrsquoDonnellrsquos remarkable oeuvre exposes a rich wealth of philosophical truisms and florid accounts of how memory has the power to set us free yet, ultimately, cages us.On record, the Irishmanrsquos towering intellect and acute sensitivity to the human condition hides in plain sight. Perhaps only upon his passing will be realise we were blessed to exist in the same spacetime as this scientist of the human heart ndash one who dedicated his le to exploring the enigma of memory.ldquoRemember Yoursquore Mine, ldquoRemember Me, ldquoLast Thing On My Mind, ldquoDonrsquot Forget to Remember and the ingenious ldquoI Forgot To Remember To Forget are clearly all evergreen roadmaps for the soul, yet, such an obvious obsession with memory suggests that the Arc gene may be stronger in luminaries such as OrsquoDonnell and Aristotle than the rest of us ndash the virus perhaps using such enlightened vessels to elevate the entire human collective consciousness and evolve us all into transdimensional orbs madeof pure light.Perhaps instead of a tree falling, the classic thought experiment should ask: does a Daniel OrsquoDonnell album make a soundno-one is around to hear it play  And, this time, the answer would certainly be no.For surely, only human ears could ever empathise with the great truths exposed by OrsquoDonnell, whose entire -album body of work exists as one long bittersweet ode to mortality and the imprint of memories upon our finite existence. The singer often falls back upon the truism that wersquore only truly gone when those who remember us die themselves, but therersquos surely room within OrsquoDonnellrsquos defiant optimism to also consider one other possibilty ndash that the immortal virus that granted us conciousness may also be capable of remembering its long lineage of mortal hosts. And thus, we live on forever.And finally ...APPLICATION of the scientic method may not always be immediately apparent within OrsquoDonnellrsquos lyrics, yet repeated listening reveals an abiding obsession with the processes of the natural world. His hymn to the epic scope of geological time, ldquoMy Donegal Shore perfectly illustrates this infatuation, an evocative work inspired by the wealth of ancient bioersity on the western Irish coastline, where the Atlantic has thrown up many exotic fossils, flora and fauna.That OrsquoDonnell has found a meeting point between intellectual prowess and strong religious faith is to his credit. Not many believers in ine creation are sympathetic to suggestions that their inner worlds are simply illusions projected by a  million year old virus burrowed deep inside their brains.Yet, mere secular laymen can perhaps never truly understand what quells the contradictions warring within such a unique, quicksilver mind as OrsquoDonnellrsquos.All answers are perhaps found within the work itself, abundant with analogy for OrsquoDonnellrsquos highwire balancing act on the tightrope between faith and science.Certainly, ldquoThe Time That God Sends lends itself better to a chorus than ldquoA Prehistoric Virus Infected Us With A Limited Frequency Of Consciousness Within A Finite Slice Of Spacetime.Follow Bill on Twitter: futureshockbb"},{"url":null,"title":"sinn-feins-mcdonald-suggests-westminster-has-no-interest-in-scotland","story":"Sinn Feins seven elected MPs do not take their seats in the House of Commons, despite repeated calls to do so during key Brexit votes.On whether Sinn Fein would ever take their seats, Ms McDonald told the BBCrsquos Andrew Marr on Sunday programme that the seven votes would be ineffective and her party was resolute in their stance.\"I have no business in Westminster, we have no business in your parliament,\" declared the partyrsquos leader.\"Westminster, correctly, advances and protects what it regards to be British interests.

We are also very aware there needs to be some internal structural alterations.Given the urgency, the board is using its capital reserves to order the new air handling unit which is should be installed in March.ldquoIf the equipment breaks down between now and then, the pool will have to close, Mrs Manson said. ldquoSome people attend the pool on a weekly basis and that is what keeps them going. If it has to close for a number of weeks, it can make a real dference to their mobility and pain control.Retired GP Helen Charley, board chairman, said:ldquoHaving been a GP in Cromarty for  years, and having needed both hips and knees replaced, I am all too aware of how vital the Puffin Pool is to the good health and wellbeing of so many patients like me, she said.Established in  by Dr Malcolm Stevens, the pool has provided an average , sessions each year over the past four years. They are supervised by qualied supervisors and leguards.The majority of income is from its charity shop In Tulloch Street and the fees which are kept affordable for those on benefits, pensions and low incomes although these have increased by  per cent.Supporters are rallying to support the appeal and staff plan a -mile sponsored walk from Tain to Dingwall.To donate, see www.puffinpool or pop in to the pool or shop.Sunday  Feb  : PMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

We have worked with local volunteers, school groups, young offenders, dementia groups, local walking groups and adult learners.In tune with the sustainable development ethos of the group, logs for Mags Wood build have been sourced locally and dragged to the site by Tarzan, a French-bred horse trained for forestry operations ndash and something of a visitor attraction in himself, hugely popular with the school groups who visit the site from time to time.The building project has been able to call on the expertise of local log building expert Henry Fosbrooke, project co-ordinator David Smith and a local volunteer, Don Fraser, who previously worked on the new Queensferry next to the Forth Road Bridge.Mr Harry said that such expertise ldquohas meant that all the measurements done are near perfect.The project has been funded by the Forestry Commission through a community grant amongst ious other sources.Mr Harry said: ldquoThis will be something special for the area and is involving many iniduals and groups in its building ndash truly a community project and something that will last a very, very long time.He is still hoping to find a supplier willing to help with the timber roof cladding required to complete the project, hopefully by the end of March.

The Knockroon development, endorsed by the Scottish Government as an “ambitious and inspiring” design exemplar, has been billed as Scotland’s rival to Poundbury in Dorset as a showcase for the heir to the throne’s passion for heritage-led regeneration. But eight years after construction began on the site in East Ayrshire, a fraction of the development has been completed, with no homes built in the past three years. The charitable subsidiary responsible for Knockroon’s construction has run up losses of more than half a million pounds for the second successive year, while the stock value of its landholdings is now worth a little over a third of what it stood at two years ago. Now, the Prince’s Foundation has said the entire project will be “reviewed and evaluated” over the next year, leading one of Scotland’s leading architects to describe it as little more than a “construction site”.The uncertainty surrounding Knockroon’s scope represents the latest blow to Prince Charles’s vision to regenerate one of the most deprived areas in Scotland by creating “a vibrant, sustainable community.” Situated between Cumnock and Auchinleck, the plans for the village grew out of a -acre site secured as part of the £m rescue package spearheaded by the prince for Dumfries House, the th century Palladian mansion. When Knockroon’s blueprint was granted outline planning permission by East Ayrshire Council in , it laid out a vision for  houses,  of which were to have been built by . However, nearly a decade on from the plans being submitted, just  homes have been built to date.In the most recent annual accounts of the Prince’s Foundation, published by Companies House earlier this month, the charity said it was taking time to pause and consider Knockroon’s evolution. It states: “The development company continues to work towards making good defects and developing the infrastructure for the roads and pavements. “Over the next year the Knockroon project will be reviewed and evaluated. Following review, a comprehensive plan of development will be presented for consideration before the next phase of work commences.” Meanwhile, the latest accounts for Dumfries Farming and Land Limited – a subsidiary of the Prince’s Foundation responsible for building Knockroon – show it employs just three people and is mired in the red. The company incurred losses of £, in the  months to March , the steepest annual loss posted since its incorporation in . It also endured another troubled year in the  months to March  when it lost £,. The accounts also reveal that land held as stock was revalued on an open market basis by Stanley Wright, a Sanquhar-based rural property consultancy and chartered surveyors. It slashed the land’s value from £m to just £,. The award-winning architect, Professor Alan Dunlop, described the prince’s vision for Knockroon as an “imported pastiche” which sat ill at ease in an area “blighted by industrial decline”. He said: “The development is a curious mix of relatively expensive, faux Georgian homes dropped into a bucolic setting. The first homes were completed in , and as I predicted in , there is clearly limited appeal. “There is a dearth of infrastructure and major capital work seems slow to arrive. The enterprise is reported to be incurring signicant losses is struggling to find new home buyers, and has existing purchasers apparently stuck on a building site.”Dunlop, a fellow of the Royal Incorporation of Architects in Scotland and the Royal Society of Arts, added: “The original marketing promised heritage-led regeneration and the delivery of both a new community and improved quality of le. It has not delivered on these ambitions and its ersatz Georgian and mock Scottish vernacular creations have done little to attract industry or to inspire other volume house builders.“This area surely cries out for authentic investment in good quality housing, which local people can relate to \u2028and can afford. Imported pastiche from past centuries is not the appropriate response.”Gordon Neil, deputy executive director of the Prince’s Foundation, said: “The Prince’s Foundation remains fully committed to realising its vision for Knockroon. A decade has passed since the creation of the masterplan for the site, and much has changed in that time in terms of the local and wider economy. “As in all long-term construction projects, it is incumbent on us, the developers, to remain flexible and adaptable to changing conditions throughout the build, and we will conduct a review that allows us to ensure we create a development that meets the needs of the community.He added: “During the first two years of the second phase of the development, we will look to make signicant investment into the project. The project will use the local supply chain, demonstrating investment into the local community as well as minimising environmental impact through shorter transportation times of materials“In line with The Prince’s Foundation’s commitment to offering education and training opportunities where possible, modern apprenticeships will be offered across all trades on the development.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4866670.1549142075!/image/image.jpg","title":"andy wightman reset local democracy to end budget feud","story":"Consultation and council tax reform are essential to give Scots the political empowerment devolution was supposed to deliver, says local government spokesperson for the Scottish Greens Andy Wightman. The Stage One debate on the budget last week was bad-tempered with unparliamentary language and frustration to the fore. But it also had its share of first class pantomime and humour. A cabinet secretary fell off her seat in the gales of laughter that followed a bad joke from Murdo Fraser. But that was topped by an intervention by Derek Mackay on Neil Findlay when the Finance Secretary revealed that the Lothian MSP had accidentally emailed a copy of his speech to the Scottish Government and he promptly began quoting from it.Behind the drama of the events in the chamber lay the serious matter of the Scottish Budget. Parliament now has responsibility for new policies such as social security and for raising substantial amounts of devolved taxes to support the £ billion budget voted for on Thursday. This poses new risks in terms of the public finances to add to wider uncertainties around Brexit.In a parliament where no party has a majority, a coalition has to be built to secure support. Greens have done a deal in the past two years but this year we argued that we could no longer do a deal to plug funding gaps in local government without meaningful progress on local tax reform. This posed challenges to the government as we were negotiating future commitments as well as numbers in a budget. Talks broke down the week before as both parties ran out of road.For a small party to support the government is a risk. If we get it wrong, we can suffer signicant political damage. If we get it right, government can too easily claim the credit. Negotiations are also exhausting for a small party without access to the kind of official support available to government.As a group of MSPs we had genuine dficulty in deciding whether we could back the deal that emerged only  minutes before the debate. This wasn’t some carefully orchestrated drama for the media but a consequence of our substantial reservations about the risks involved. None of this was helped by the fact that we were the only group at the negotiating table.We agreed in the immediate aftermath of last year’s budget to attempt to secure reforms that could begin the process of empowering local councils to enable them to properly reflect the wishes of their electorate. Greens want our local democracy to be like that you can find in any normal European country – smaller in scale, more autonomous, with greater fiscal freedom and a relationship with national government based on a quasi-constitutional, rules-based framework.Following years of failure to scrap the regressive council tax, we have secured a commitment to negotiate legislation that will be published this session. This will be hard work but I believe that it is possible. Parties will have to work togetherthey wish to influence the outcome and we will need to create a process based on collaboration, respect and trust. Such reforms should be a shared endeavour since they are about the powers available to local democratic institutions.Twenty years of devolution have been dominated by trying to micro-manage councils through ring-fencing funds and adopting strong-arm tactics to constrain their fiscal freedom. If the UK Chancellor were to attempt to freeze the Scottish rate of income tax by threatening to reduce the block grant unless Scottish ministers complied, there would be outrage from all parties.That, however, is precisely what too many political parties and MSPs have engineered through council tax freezes and caps in a calculated and subversive attempt to hijack the local state. If Angela Merkel were to try and do the equivalent in Germany, she would be found guilty of an illegal appropriation of powers under Article  of the German constitution.In , the First Minister appointed Naomi Eisenstadt to advise her on how to best tackle poverty and inequality. In her initial report, “Shting The Curve”, she recommended that ministers should be bold on local tax reform and that “this is a central moment of political decision, an opportunity to introduce a much more progressive system, one that will have important implications, particularly for working households at or just above the poverty line”. Four years later, on the morning of the Budget, the Poverty and Inequality Commission reviewed progress and found that this one recommendation was the only one not to have been delivered.Scotland’s parliament has achieved much in its  years, but its failure to match the evolution of its own fiscal autonomy with that of local government is a badge of shame that has led us to a crisis in public services, local democracy, and the trust and hope that the electorate should be able to place in their locally-elected representatives.At the heart of this is a debate about political power and about how parties should do business in a proportionally elected parliament. As the budget process has demonstrated, there is no shortage of outrage and opposition and no lack of colourful rhetoric of rescue deal, capitulation and betrayal.In future I hope that we can do things better. Government should provide leadership in convening roundtable talks in September to be followed by further detailed discussion and negotiation following the UK budget when the financial envelope is known. Such talks can then inform the draft budget published in December. Detailed negotiations can then follow leading to the Budget Bill being considered in parliament.Such a process would ease tensions, build trust, allow red lines and aspirations to be properly assessed and tested and, ultimately, increase the chances of a budget for Scotland built on a shared collaborative endeavour.In February , I walked into the chamber of the Scottish Parliament to debate the budget for the forthcoming year. I was greeted by shouts of “Judas” and “sell out”. Politics is a rough trade but I don’t think our constituents are best served by the kind of oppositional and confrontational posturing that now accompanies the budget. It is time for a reset and the meaningful collaborative endeavour that I think most constituents expect and deserve.• Andy Wightman is local government spokesperson for the Scottish Greens and MSP for Lothian©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4865210.1548919873!/image/image.jpg","title":"key snp figures told by nicola sturgeon to prepare for possible election","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...SNP parliamentarians have been told by Nicola Sturgeon to prepare for a possible Scottish electionthe government at Holyrood fails to pass its budget today.The Scottish Government heads into today’s vote without a deal to secure a majority, risking defeat on its spending plans for the coming year.During a meeting of the SNP group at Westminster attended by the First Minister on Monday, Ms Sturgeon warned her MPs that they should prepare for a possible Scottish election campaignthe government fails to get its budget through, The Scotsman understands.However the move comes amid speculation that Ms Sturgeon may need a fresh mandate from the electorate to secure another referendum on independence, as she prepares to reveal her plans on the issue. Publicly, the government has stated that it is focused on getting its spending plans passed and is confident of reaching a compromise.In , when an SNP minority government had its budget defeated by the Scottish Parliament, then-First Minister Alex Salmond threatened a snap election before the deadlock was broken.The current SNP minority has struck a more conciliatory tone and sought to calm speculation about an election, with Finance Secretary Derek Mackay last night appealing for MSPs to “act responsibly”.Last ditch talks are set to continue today in the final hours before a vote, with the Green Party holding out for concessions on local government spending and council tax reform.Mr Mackay must secure the support of the six Green MSPs to pass his budget, with all other opposition parties committed to voting against it.Green Party co-convener Patrick Harvie has dismissed suggestions his party could bring down the government by rejecting the SNP’s budget as a “myth”.But senior Nationalist figures were openly speculating about the possibility of an election earlier in the week, with SNP committee convener Gillian Martin warning Green MSP Andy Wightman on social media that voting down the budget could force an election and put a second Scottish independence referendum at risk.“You’ve seen the way the other parties coalesce against us to try and bring down the government,” Ms Martin posted on Twitter. “Since  everything for them is about defeating the pro-Indy Parliament.”She added: “We are at risk of an election that might see pro Indy parties lose seats and put us in a weaker position.”Polls show the SNP remains in the lead in Scottish Parliament voting intention, but that the nationalists have lost ground compared with their performance in the  Holyrood election where they narrowly lost their majority.Scottish Conservative shadow finance secretary Murdo Fraser claimed uncertainty around the budget showed the SNP were “unfit” for government.“The SNP has neglected the day job so badly that it’s now struggling to get the single-biggest responsibility taken care of. Nicola Sturgeon is so resigned to the weakness of her own administration, she’s been forced to rally the troops for another election.“Hers would be the first government in the history of the Scottish Parliament to call an election because it couldn’t pass a budget.“That would be a shameful legacy, and shows just how unfit the Nationalists are for government of any kind.”Scottish Liberal Democrat campaign chair Alex Cole-Hamilton MSP said: “We’ve made clear to the SNP that we want a budget that focuses on education, mental health and local government funding.“If their inability to get a budget through necessitates a new Scottish Parliament election then I have every hope that people in Scotland will want to use that to eject the Nationalists.”A Labour spokesman said “no credible anti-austerity party would propose” the draft budget put forward by the SNP.With no deal last night, Mr Mackay said: “Our spending plans for the coming year contain additional money for schools and hospitals, protecting vital public services and investing in our economy, while also providing stability amid the ongoing uncertainty caused by Brexit. “With that backdrop in mind, there has never been more need for MSPs, of all parties, to act responsibly and not add to that uncertainty.”Mr Mackay added: “We are open to compromise in order to ensure we deliver the Budget that the country expects.” ©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"kalfordhame sandness shetland","story":"Offers over £,- bed bungalow for sale in Sandness.

He was, in the GBS abbreviated subheading, a #printmaker, etcher and gallery owner, Chieftain of Skye Highland Games, boat race devotee, tug-of-war revivalist, shinty enthusiast, and half-marathon runner.#That just about covers it, as a dictionary of biography is forbidden to indulge itself and cannot add that for very many people, Tommy Mackenzie was the face and personality of modern Portree.These volumes, these hefty Great Books of Skye, are a leisurely parade along Wentworth Street and then out to the peninsulas, pausing to wave at or pass the time of day with Victorian land reformers, clan chiefs, bards, teachers, surgeons, fishermen, and climbers. It#s a verbal Skye equivalent of the cover of #Sergeant Pepper#s Lonely Hearts Club Band#.Sir Harold Boulton was not a Sgiathanach. He came from Hertfordshire and was educated at Harrow and Oxford.In  he married into the Highland quality via a Dingwall military family. Boulton already had an interest in Gaelic song and music.He enters the Great Book of Skye because, in the late th century, Boulton seems to have heard a Gaelic rowing song and put his own, English, words to the tune.Those lyrics and that tune have become internationally known as #The Skye Boat Song#. Norman Macdonald digresses wonderfully on Boulton#s creation of a supposed Jacobite anthem.We are still left with the dilemma of the bonnie boat#s journey. The original Gaelic version may have celebrated a voyage from Torrin to Loch Coruisk. For most of the th century, it was assumed to refer to Charles Edward Stuart#s post-Culloden flight by sea from the mainland to Skye.As Charles never made such a journey directly by sea, pedants have more recently suggested that Boulton must have been referring to the Pretender#s actual sea voyage It really, really, does not matter. We are in the realms of mythology. Charles may as well have been sailing from Papua New Guinea. Harold Boulton invented the whole damn thing — the misty isle#s most famous song is a Victorian concoction — and in recognition of that, he deserves his entry in the Great Book of Skye Three.And finally, here we are back in Portree. William Cowie was born in Kiltarlity in  and became an agricultural advisor in Skye in the s. The brother of a professional footballer, Cowie devoted himself to shinty and became one of the greatest players of his era.Fittingly, he married in  a grand-daughter of the captain of the Skye shinty team which had won the inaugural MacTavish Cup in .William and Margaret Cowie had two sons, Ross and William. He died too young, at the age of  years, while playing badminton in Portree Drill Hall.William Cowie would, therefore, have been shy of his th birthday had he led his natural course to June  and a day in Fort William which would have caused him, more even than the rest of Skye, unimaginable pride.It is tempting to say of all three Great Books of Skye that they are for dipping in and out rather than reading as a single narrative. The trouble with that suggestion is that once you#ve dipped in, it is very hard to dip out again.As a trilogy, they are a phenomenal publishing achievement. They should take their place, alongside the inevitable Tommy Mackenzie print, in every home in Skye."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/INDOOR-SHINTY-19-P4-7-FINAL-2.jpg","title":"skye schools indoor shinty competition all the action in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineYoung shinty players fromthroughout Skye gathered to take part in two indoor tournaments for primary school teams last weekend.Portree High’s Fingal Centre hosted competitions for P-P and for P-and-under teams.On a fast and furious day of excellent shinty action teams fromBun-sgoil Ghàidhlig Phort Rìgh won both competitions.Broadford were runners up in the P- competition, with North West taking second spot in the P-under tournament following an epic final."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/web-ad-sales-large.jpg","title":"skye charities work to be showcased at skeabost","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineA multi-charity event will be held in Skeabost on Saturdayto highlight the work of several good causes across Skye.The event will be held at Skeabost Memorial Hall from  am until  pm and will provide information on the work carried out by a iety of charities in the area, as well as insight into the costs and challenges they face.to raise awareness of the event, which will support Skye and Lochalsh Young Carers the Skye and Lochalsh Foodbank Crossroads Care # Skye and Lochalsh Macmillan Cancer Support Skye Dance Bloodwise, and Rotjanas Hands, which Mr Williams set up with his we nearly  years ago.He said: “I have been an independent fundraiser for many years – I am a trustee of Rotjanas Hands – formally known as Hands Across the Water – which I set up alongside my we following the Indonesian Tsunami .”He added: “For me, it has always been important to share particularly when we are so fortunate and others not so.

The film is a nature study that follows a young girl and her encounters in the woods over one night, having lost her way from her family campsite. It is a lyrical and delightful portrait of a child’s perspective of the natural world.Last year ATLAS installed it in the south wing of Dunvegan Castle and ran an educational workshop programme with Portree Primary School and Portree High School.This year they are hosting cross-generational screenings with primary aged girls, similar age to the young girl in the film and the elderly generation. The aim is to encourage conversation and share experiences and knowledge about their own encounters with nature.Suzy Lee, ATLAS Arts film programmer, commented: “We are really excited about working with both Portree Primary and Budhmor House to offer this screening that encourages sharing and discussion.We’ve had a great response to the film and to our extended programme, so we look forward to showing the film in a new environment.”Centre with the primary seven girls from Portree Primary.Angus Beaton, a care worker at the centre praised the event for bridging the generational gap. He said: “It was wonderful to see the younger generation interact with their regular group and to enjoy watching a film together that connected with both age groups.”Sara Matheson, Portree Primary Head Teacher said: #Our pupils have been very fortunate to benefit from the work of ATLAS Arts. Most recently our primary seven girls have taken part in film screenings of Eglantine, both at Dunvegan Castle where they were able to hear directly from Margaret Salmon, and more recently at Home Farm and Tigh Na Drochaid, where they have been able to enjoy the film in a cross-generational context.She added: #As with all projects we have been involved in with ATLAS Arts, our pupils have been impacted very positively by these experiences. We look forward to working with ATLAS Arts on some new and equally exciting future projects.#"},{"url":null,"title":"this apple iphone facetime bug lets people eavesdrop on you without your consent","story":"In some circumstances users were able to see video footage through the unsuspecting persons phone without them knowing or answering.window.twttr [],t  window.twttr tjs  djs.id  idjs.src  \"https: \"fjs t._e  t t.tweetyApple was made aware of the issue bynewspaper and the bug was first reported by tomacApple suspended the Group FaceTimeon Tuesday.Apples latest software update, iOS ., is due to be released later this week and the tech-giant says it will include a bug fix for the Group FaceTime issue.An Apple spokesperson said: ldquoWersquore aware of this issue and we have identied a fix that will be released in a software update later this week.Residents ‘a priority’ says Islandmagee gas project firm Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"CFER | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"CFER | Article Teaser\"try catch "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1408261.jpg--.jpg?1548410228000\n","title":"internationally known engineer and innovator hailed in his home town","story":" BALLYMENA’S globally recognised engineer and industrialist, Sir William Wright CBE, was honoured in his home town on Friday when he was awarded the Freedom of the Borough of Mid and East Antrim.The award pays tribute to iniduals or organisations who have made an outstanding contribution to public le.The businessman and co-founder of Wrightbus was honoured at a special ceremony in front of family, friends, colleagues and special guests.Councillors proposed and agreed the award in recognition of Sir William’s contribution to global business and the local economy.Sir William Wright CBE said: “To receive the Freedom of the Borough is a great honour, particularly as it is bestowed from my birthplace, the area where my business is based, and a place I am proud to call home.“Over my letime I have had the privilege to take part in some memorable occasions and this event sits alongside the best of them.”Mayor of Mid and East Antrim, Councillor Lindsay Millar said the occasion was befitting as the work Sir William had carried out in the local economy was inspirational: “I am delighted to see so many people here today to recognise the outstanding work that Sir William has carried out over his illustrious career.“His contribution to global business and the local economy is exceptional. An entrepreneur and pioneer in his field, Sir William, despite his worldwide success, has never forgotten his strong ties to Ballymena.“His vision and dedication has put our borough firmly on the map as an area of manufacturing excellence and innovation.”Mid and East Antrim Borough Council agreed to bestow the Honorary Freedom of the Borough of Mid and East Antrim on the Wrightbus founder in February . It followed a motion proposed by the previous Mayor, Councillor Paul Reid, and seconded by Councillor Audrey Wales MBE.Among those who paid special tributes to Sir William was former Mayor of Ballymena, P.J. McAvoy, who, as a long standing SDLP representative was poles apart on constitutional issues from the ardent unionist. On Friday, however, he told the audience of the personal bond that had grown between the pair during their service on Council.“I well remember Sir William giving me a lt in that great big car of his many times when going or coming from council meetings! “I’m happy to be here today to pay tribute to the man I call my friend,” he said. Further tributes came from North Antrim MP, Ian Paisley who remarked on Sir William’s political activism at a time when many in the business community ‘kept their heads below the parapet’. And he recalled nights in the harsh days of the troubles when his late father would receive ‘phone calls from the man he codenamed ‘Ahoghill’. Mr. Paisley said Sir William was a rare breed in today’s society: “He is a character. If anyone wants to see what makes a real Ballymena man they need only look at Sir William Wright.” Lauren Christie, speaking on behalf of the extended Wright family, thanked all who attended for the honour conferred on her grandfather and paid special tribute to Mrs. Ruby Wright, who, she described as ‘the great woman behind the great man’.

The  album release ‘Up Among The Heather, The Scottish Album’, reflects the Scots influence on their Northern Irish roots - the album will be released on tour. Last year, their previous album ‘The Unicorn, the Continuing Story’ gave the long-awaited sequel to their famed Unicorn song.BRAID DATEBand leader, George Millar says: “In some ways it seems like yesterday, in other ways it seems a million years ago when I first met and played with Jimmy . “Neither of us had any idea what could possibly be ahead of us. Tohome and play after all these years, will be a highlight of our career and one we’re looking forward to immensely. Like the famous Bushmills Irish Whiskey, The Irish Rovers continue to improve with age and The Braid Arts Centre and Mid  East Antrim Borough Council are delighted that the boys are making a visit home to be applauded for all they have done over the years for the music industry, and for promoting this part of the world across North America and beyond. Thursday March  will see the Rovers will be performing at The Braid and they will be guests of honour at a reception where the Mid  East Antrim will welcome them home.AIR AMBULANCEAll proceeds from tickets will be donated by The Irish Rovers to the Mayors Charity Northern Ireland Air Ambulance.Another great honour for the band this year was being recognized as one of these islands greatest eacutemigreacutes by Ireland’s newest and most state of the art museum in Dublin, EPIC Ireland. Museum Director Mervyn Greene says: “The Irish Rovers are iconic, world class and with very a long career. “That’s important to us in Ireland. “They’ve truly taken Ireland with them and shown the world.As it happens, The Unicorn album is part of EPIC’s Irish Rovers installation. As young immigrants, the Rovers emigrated to Canada and became so much a part of the Canadian culture that Canada’s Prime Minister Trudeau personally asked them to become full citizens so they could officially represent Canada around the world.In , The Irish Rovers had a breakout hit with their second album, The Unicorn.That album and the ‘lucky little ditty’ of a title track written by Shel Silverstein, took them from folk clubs of America to concert halls and television sets worldwide.LAST MINUTE“The Unicorn, which was in fact a last minute add to the original album, left us all with a tear or two, plus the unanswered question, ‘Whatever happened to the Unicorns when the ark left them stranded on the shore ” says George. Since that first big hit, the band ed to the charts  more times with other songs, nevertheless, the magic of ‘The Unicorn’ remains.To pay appropriate tribute on its Gold Anniversary, the Rovers are releasing ‘The Unicorn, The Continuing Story’.It includes all new recordings, plus the sequel to the original song, which answers the question of the last fty years.A new music video also tells the story.The World Wildle Fund, and wildle cinematographer Adam Ravetch assisted in the production. Since the s, the Celtic super-group have travelled the world as musical ambassadors - with performances from as far apart as the Arctic Circle, Japan, and Germany, with regular tours to Australia, New Zealand, and the US.The Rovers first became known in the US in the s on shows like The Tonight Show, The Smothers Brothers, Mike Douglas Show, The Dating Game , and even starring in The Virginian.In the s they hosted their first of three international television series, ‘The Irish Rovers Show’ and throughout the next  years their weekly television shows brought Ireland into living rooms of America and the rest of the world.More recently, their  Drunken Sailor album went viral on YouTube, made news headlines back home in Belfast and put them back on radio across North America with a new younger generation audience.A Canadian CBC producer saw the Belfast news articles about the Rovers new song and video and asked George Millar to sing his new song ‘The Titanic’ to help their telling of the th Anniversary of Titanic. The   Years triple CD broke tour sales records, while the lads ed to the small screen with three North American television specials, ‘The Irish Rovers Home In Ireland’, ‘The Irish Rovers Christmas’, ‘The Irish Rovers LIVE on St. Patrick’s Day  th Anniversary Special’, all produced in the last few years.The days of the long tours are finally coming to an end for these Irish lads as they are now completing one last world tour.

Squinter’s been running his eye over the top-performing personalities as we hurtle towards the ration book, conscription, petrol riots and raffling oranges. Jacob Rees Mogg’s rocky road to DublinArch remainer Lord Snooty has made a fortune from providing financial services through his company, Somerset Capital Management . Thoughhe will be luxuriously insulated from the worst effects of a no-deal Brexit evenhe never worked another day in his le, he is a leading light in the fanatically anti-EU European Research Group , which makes UKIP look like the Alliance Party and which sees a Brexit crash-out as pretty much an ideal scenario. But as the Brexit negotiations descended into chaos and then high comedy, SMG decided that it was time to open two new funds in, ah, Ireland. Although Jacob is a co-founder of the company and is paid £, a month for doing eight hours work a week for the company , he said the decision to set up business in Irelandwas nothing to do with him. Asthat’s not bad enough, the company’s prospectus for the coming financial identies among the key ‘risks’ facing the business in the coming financial year is ‘Brexit’. Simply spfing, old bean.Boris and his zig-zag BrexitBack in  when Boris Johnson was still considering what outcome in the Brexit referendum would be best for him – sorry, for the country – his close pal Sir Nicholas Soamestweeted this: “Whatever my great friend Boris decides to do I know that he is NOT an outer.” But regardless of where his heart and or his head is, Boris is certainly shoulder-to-shoulder with Jacob in the vanguard of the hard Brexit storm troops. ’Twas not always thus, truth to tell. Pre-referendum Boris famously came out for Brexit in his Dailycolumn. But what people didn’t know until some time later was that Boris had written two columns that week for the : one pro-Brexit and one pro-Remain. In the pro-Remain column, which was never published in the paper, he wrote: “Shut your eyes. Hold your breath. Think of Britain. Think of the rest of the EU. Think of the future. Think of the desire of your children and your grandchildren to live and work in other European countries to sell things there, to make friends and perhaps to find partners there.” Cue soaring violins. Boris’s most recent comment on the single market was that it is “useless” In  he said in Paris: “Personally, I would like to stay in the single market. We need to stay in the council of ministers of the internal market. In my view, the British have done good things for Europe.” Google Boris’s stunned reaction when the referendum vote was announced and then remember what Nick Soames tweeted.Nigel glad to be rid of the EU Former UKIP leader and Brexit poster boy Nigel Farage has two children by his German we, Kirsten Mehr. He has told journalists that both of them support England at the football, so that’s alright then. Except they both have German passports and so, thrillingly, unlike their English neighbours, will continue to enjoy free movement throughout the EU post-Brexit. And, of course, Nigel will continue to draw his £, per year EU pension – no-one hates the EU that much, not even our Nige. Squinter was particularly moved by Nigel’s claim in the weeks leading up to the referendum that staying in Europe would “spell the end of the steel industry in this country”. But Nige and his UKIP colleagues were in  among a tiny number of MEPs to vote against a move to tighten up rules on the import of cheap non-EU steel. Business, as they say, is business. The Man from the Daily MailFormer Daily Mail editor Paul Dacre was the man responsible for all those headlines that frightened the horses during the referendum campaign and, subsequently, the attacks on Parliament and the judiciary as the political and legal implications were fought out. So he’s the Brexiter’s Brexiter. But it’s estimated that as a landowner Dacre benefited to the tune of around £, a year in EU subsidies. The veteran journalist was on over £m a year towards the end of his time with the Mail, so he’ll not be begging outside the Red Lion in his local villagethe UK leaves the EU. Brexit-voting and Mail-reading Farmer Browns, however, may be left sucking thoughtfully on a wheat stalk as they contemplate their own looming subsidy deficit, which may not be so lightly borne.Bordering on the ridiculousThe DUP’s singular focus as we hurtle towards Brexit D-Day is to block any deal that involves regulatory ergence with the mother ship – in other words: we must be treated exactly the same as Britain by the EU. Whether that’s a gentle wave goodbye with best wishes, or a massive, eye-watering boot in the ging-gangs matters not. We’re all in this together . The DUP’s insistence on alignment with the ‘mainland’ may be extremely touching, but it is an entirely new concept, for this little corner of empire long ago gave up any pretence of a claim to be as British as Finchley. Presumably, the party will continue to lobby for a dferent VAT and Passenger Duty regime post-Brexit, for they were white-hot on those ideas before the EU balloon went up. They’ll continue to block defamation law reform, keeping loyal Ulster as a magnet for libel tourists . Most famously, the DUP remains the bulwark against the equal marriage and abortion rights that are accorded to every other part of these two islands. Luckily, the party stood firm and insisted that Are Wee Country has to have exactly the same RHI regime as across the water, avoiding the possibility of widespread and catastrophically expensive abuse of the boiler scheme*Sub-editors: please check this last line for accuracy. Thanks, SquintPapers, pleaseAndrew Bridgen, Tory MP for West Leicestershireis another European Research Group charmer, without the profile of Jacob Rees Mogg but with the same level of warmth and likeability. Andy’s most notable brush with fame before Brexit thrust him into the public eye alongside Boris and Jacob was his posting of a raunchy video on a WhatsApp group composed of Tory MPs, some of them ministers. Suffice to say that the video included a scantily clad woman, a man and a sports car. A suitably repentant Andy explained to colleagues that it had been a terrible error caused by “fat fingers”. In October past he said in a radio interview that all English people are entitled to an Irish passport, a claim that nearly caused Twitter to explode and was the impetus for more jokes than Ian Paisley’s summer holidays.In response to a question on free movement between Britain and Ireland post-Brexit, Andy said: “As an English person, I do have the right to go over to Ireland and I believe that I can ask for a passport. Can’t I ” No, Andy, mate, you can’t. We’ve enough West Brits on this island, ta very much.Doctor Jekyll and Mr SnideThat Michael Gove’s a reasonable bloke, ain’t he  There he’s been for the past few months, urging cool heads and common sense, quietly and assiduously working to help Prime Minister Theresa may with a withdrawal agreement that’s harder to sell than a Northern Ireland shirt in O’Neills. While those nasty Brexit nutjobs in the ERG snarl and threaten, Michael’s been a model of loyalty and stf upper-lipped British discretion. But wait. Wasn’t it a bloke who looked exactly like him who said during the campaign that Turkey was about to join the EU, opening the gates to allow five million-plus Turks to come cascading into the UK.Yes, indeed: it was Michael Gove who made that claim. He has subsequently admitted that it was baloney and should not have been made. So them Turks stay in the mess they’re in.

An SDLP conference is scheduled to take place on February  in Newry where the party membership is set to vote on the plans.Speaking exclusively to the Andersonstown News. West Belfast Councillor Tim Attwood said he was “not an advocate of the SDLP and Fianna Fáil partnership”. It’s known that South Belfast MLA Claire Hanna is also at odds with the party leadership over its move to link up with Fianna Fáil.“I recognise that the political landscape of this island has been changed utterly given the failure of the DUP and Sinn Féin to bring back the power-sharing Executive, the catastrophic consequences of Brexit and the emerging debate about Irish unity,” said Cllr Attwood.Cllr Attwood continued: “I have the greatest respect for the leadership of the SDLP and recognise that in a post-conflict situation there is a natural and wider debate about political realignment on this island,” he said. “The reality is my politics is steadfastly rooted in the social democratic and labour traditions embodied by the SDLP and parties of the Party of European Socialists.”Mr Attwood, who has served as a West Belfast councillor these past  years, said that over the coming days he would be speaking to his family and SDLP members in his constituency area about the proposal for a new partnership between the SDLP and Fianna Fáil. “I will make a further statement after these discussions,” he added.Meanwhile, SDLP Lagan Valley MLA Pat Catney is supporting the party leadership in entering into a partnership with Fianna Fáil.Mr Catney said: “Northern Ireland is crying out for a response to the fast changing and signicant challenges across these islands as a result of Brexit. “Twenty years after the Good Friday Agreement, people here must be offered something new, credible and forward-looking in its approach.”The Lagan Valley MLA added: “Brexit has shted the political sands dramatically. It poses many challenges that sit outside the boundaries of local devolution. Our politics in the past two years, a politics of ision, of deadlock and of repetition is frighteningly at odds with the vast challenges that now face us. Old solutions to new challenges can no longer cut it.“It has always been the SDLP’s vision to unite our people. To seek an Ireland, befitting of the st century, where opportunity and prosperity are more than slogans on a placard but a way of le whether you are Catholic, Protestant or Dissenter. That will never change.“I am all too aware of the uneasiness some of my unionist neighbours may feel about this new partnership. Neighbours who have put their trust in me in countless elections. But let me be crystal clear a new Ireland, one without the full inclusivity of unionism is not one I want to be part of let alone build. You are part of the fabric of this island, woven into history every bit as much as any nationalist and you are a critical part of its future.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"fundraiser in memory of limestone mother","story":"A FUNDRAISING night will be held this Saturdayin memory of a North Belfast woman who died suddenly just two weeks after she became a grandmother for the first time.Marie Branfdied suddenly at her Limestone Road home on St Patrick’s Day  after suffering a heart attack and going into cardiac arrest. Despite efforts by her family to perform CPR, they were unable to resuscitate her.This Saturday, the mother of four’s family are holding a charity night in St Malachy’s Old Boys’ Club to raise money for British Heart Foundation Northern Ireland in her memory. The charity funds research into heart and circulatory diseases including the prevention and treatment of heart attacks.Marie’s daughter Zara said her mum had been delighted to have become a granny for the first time just two weeks before she died.“Mummy’s death came as such a shock to us all. We knew that heart disease ran in our family and my grandparents had had heart attacks at a young age but we didn’t expect this to happen,” she said. “Just two weeks before she died my wee nephew was born and she became a granny for the first time. She couldn’t wait for the baby to be born and had everything all in for him coming. She just doted on him but she only got two weeks with him before she died.”The charity night in St Malachy’s Old Boy’s Club will raise funds to power research into heart and circulatory diseases.“We don’t want another family to suffer like we have,” added Zara.“My wee brother found mummy in the house and between us we tried to resuscitate her but it was too late. We want to raise money to help fund research and stop this happening to other people. So many people loved and miss her. Her husband David, her children and her four brothers and all her friends. The night will be a lovely tribute to her.“Saturday will be a really good night and so many businesses and local people have been really generous with ballot prizes. It would be greatpeople could come along and enjoy a great night.”Órla Clarke, fundraising manager for BHF NI said: “Thanks to Zara and the Branf family for organising the charity night which will raise much needed funds for research. Our research has saved thousands of lives. Before the mid-s, nobody fully understood the cause of heart attacks and  per cent of people here who suffered a heart attack didn’t survive.“Our research has meant that today  per cent of people do survive a heart attack. But stories like Marie’s story show there is still so much to do.“ No family should lose their mummy at just .

After noticing smoke billowing from the property, the brave pair sprang into action, racing towards the fire to bring the people inside to safety.Recounting the dramatic ordeal, Antoin told us: “I couldn’t see the fire, so I thought it was the end house on my street. As soon as we got to the end of the street we could see the flames through the back windows – the whole lot was on fire.“Nobody lives in the house next door so I kicked in that door thinking somebody had broken in and set it on fire. Then I came round and hit the other door a boot and the fire nearly blew me off my feet.“I started smashing windows to let the smoke out. I smashed the front window and then climbed up and smashed one of the top windows and shouted at the top of my lungs, ‘Is anybody there ’“We found out there were people at the back of the house. We couldn’t get in the front because the flames were too big, so we went to the old couple next door, got them settled, and then my mate Terence started breaking down the fence with his shovel to get into the house. He got in the back way and lted the two people out of the house and out through the broken fence.“The smoke was all over the place so I thought all the houses were going to go up. I went to the houses on the other side and got them up. My neighbour had one of the kids and I had to bring the other one up the street to get them away from the smoke – I was trying to keep my hand over the child’s face to stop them breathing in the smoke. The black smoke was following us the whole way up.”Antoin added: “I think most people would have done it. I just did it because it was my own neighbours.

bpanews_fee-dd-ae-ef-dff_EmailParents have warned that thousands of pupils in Irish border communities could face disrupted journeys to schoola hard border is implemented post-Brexit..pushWhile many students attend schools on the opposite side of the border through schemes approved by authorities, countless others are believed to use a practice commonly referred to as “grannying”, to attend school in Northern Ireland.Parents living close to the border are braced for the re-emergence of “unapproved roads” like those used during the Troubles, to take their children to school.While the UK and Irish governments have maintained that the free movement of people between the two jurisdictions will not be affected, queues of traffic affecting thousands of people are anticipatedcustoms checks are reintroduced on the border after March .\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  A reciprocal agreement exists between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland whereby children living on one side of the border are able to access an education on the other side of the border.The caveat is that schools in Northern Ireland may only consider a child who is resident in the Republic of Ireland for admission after all resident children who have applied to the school have been considered.A practice known as “grannying” involves residents who move to the Republic presenting schools in Northern Ireland with proof of address at a grandmother or relative’s house to avoid being left out.One Londonderry mother, who admits to using the unauthorised practice, has expressed concern.The woman, who has lived in Donegal for more than  years and has two children attending school in Northern Ireland, said the idea of sending her children to school in the Republic of Ireland never crossed her mind.“I’m from Derry originally, I work and pay tax in Derry, it made sense for the children to go to school there,” she said.“If there was an emergency, or they were sick and had to leave school immediately, it’s not practical for them to be in Donegal and I’m driving to work in the morning anyway so it makes sense with the school run.”The Troubles saw many smaller cross-border roads become unauthorised border crossings known officially as “unapproved roads”, which local people used to avoid customs officials and security services.“In my village alone, a tiny village, there’s four back roads into Derry city,” the mother of two added.“I could confidently say % of my neighbours in this housing estate are from Derry city originally and still working there, or have children attend school there.“There’s no way they would have the manpower to guard the border and stop every car, and there’s no way people will wait in queues of traffic in the morning, they’ll find another way to get there, they’ll take back roads or roads that can’t be manned.”Marguerite Hamilton, a former principal of Thornhill College, a girls’ grammar school in the Culmore area of Derry, one mile from the Derry Donegal border, said it is “inconceivable” that children could be prevented or delayed from going to schoolcustoms posts were installed.Ms Hamilton said schools across Northern Ireland are aware of “grannying” students living over the border.“When a child applies for school, we ask for a veriable proof of address, a bank statement or letter from a doctor for example,they can supply the proof, it is not the school’s place to go around investigatingthe child actually resides there or not,” she said.“Also,circumstances change for instance,they start school living in Derry, and move even just one mile away to the south, should they be forced to leave the school and educational system they know “What’s clear is that those arguing about the border in London will not have their lives affected by the consequences.”Statistics on how often the practice is used are unveriable, but Ms Hamilton estimates that there are hundreds of children attending school in Northern Ireland who reside in the Republic.The Department of Education and Skills in the Republic of Ireland said it is confident the Common Travel Area will facilitate existing arrangements for cross-border pupils.Minister for education Joe McHugh said: “The school communities along the border, both in the north and in the south, have done tremendous work over the last  years in cementing the peace process and they deserve enormous credit for that.“I’ve talked about this issue in recent days with the heads of the department and the need to better understand the important role that these schools, their staff, pupils and parents have played in that and will continue to play.”Likewise, the Department of Education in Northern Ireland said it is aware of the issue, but has faith that the Common Travel Area between the two jurisdictions will safeguard access to education.“The issue of the provision of  information on an application is not limited to the home address of a pupil and the department has provided guidance to schools on their duty to very application information,” a spokeswoman said.“A parent providing information that is found to be  may have the offer of a place for their child withdrawn.“In relation to the impact of Brexit, the British and Irish governments have agreed that the rights flowing from the Common Travel Area should be maintained.  “The Common Travel Area provides citizens of the UK and Republic of Ireland with the right to access services, including education, in the other jurisdiction.”"},{"url":null,"title":"eu needs a dose of reality if we are to get a sensible deal

Mrs Foster conceded that the EU are \"tough negotiators\". \"I dont expect them to roll over within hours,\" she said.\"But they must face up to reality. \"The blockage to getting a deal is the backstop, therefore there must be sensible engagement and a pragmatic approach.\"Here in Kesh we are within walking distance of the border. \"Local people travel to and fro across the border multiple times every day. \"It is quite disgraceful for some in Brussels to exploit genuine fears by spinning tales of border posts, troops and queues.\"No one is building border checkpoints. No one is sending troops to the border either.\"Such talk is foolish and careless. \"Lets focus on getting a sensible deal which works for Brussels, Dublin and London.\"Speaking from Brussels yesterday, Ulster Unionist MEP Jim Nicholson also called for a dferent approach from the EU in order to reach a workable deal.The MEP, who was first elected to the European Parliament in , said: \"There are real dangers of a no-deal situation, so with less than  days before the UKs departure from the EU I would urge a more constructive and positive approach from the EU leaders in the coming days and weeks.\"I have been clear, there is a problem with the backstop, not least that it is in direct contradiction to the principle of consent as enshrined within the Belfast Agreement. That needs to be fixed.\"But I am firmly of the view that no problem is insurmountable, and I believe that the EU wants to agree a workable deal.\"Mr Nicholson said he had detected a change in tone from European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker.\"Although time is running out, nothing is insurmountable and common sense must prevail,\" the veteran politician said.Meanwhile, a Cabinet minister warned MPs that they may not be re-elected to Parliamentthey block Theresa Mays Brexit agreement and force the UK to crash out of the EU without a deal. Liam Fox said politicians would have \"little cover when they next face the voters\"their actions led to a no-deal exit.Mr Fox became the latest frontbencher to suggest Britains withdrawal may have to be delayed. The International Trade Secretary said Downing Streets insistence that the UK will leave the EU on March , and suggestions by Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt and Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom that the exit date could be pushed back, were not \"incompatible\" stances. \"There would be a huge dference between an extension to Article  because we hadnt reached an agreement, or a short delay because we had reached an agreement and needed the legislation to implement it,\" he said after a speech in London.

She has taught on yachts, mid-air, chauffeur-driven cars and by luxury pools.Earning between £,-£, a year with her tutoring gig, Valerie knows the pressure is on to prove herself and get results on each assignment.\"If you cant deliver then they will find someone ,\" the Lisburn woman told the Daily Mail.\"I have years of experience, I can guarantee to get them up to the level needed, and I know I can do it.\"Its an interesting lestyle to step in and out of. \"It can be very glamorous, people are paying you big money and you have to live up to what you say you can do.\"Valerie, who gained many years experience as a teacher in north Wales before ing to her native Northern Ireland to help care for her father, switched to tutoring the super rich in .She signed up to two agencies in London - the Duke and Duchess International and The London Governess Agency - who both cater specically to royals, millionaires and billionaires.She explained that they negotiate the teaching packages with the families before the tutors are informed, so the prices y from client to client depending on the intensity of the studies.

Callers came out both to criticise and support the presenter after he said Northern Ireland was not in Ireland.\"Thats right,\" he said, \"It is a statement of fact Northern Ireland is part of the UK.

It is situated at Belvedere Pl, Mountjoy, in Dublin which is a short five-minute walk to Temple Street Children’s University Hospital and close to other hospitals in the city.Whilst at Hugh’s House, parents are also able to share their own experiences which helps build an important support network at what is a very distressing time.‘Lesaver’googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshCllr Donnelly said the fundraising event at Creggan Community Collective on January  exceeded all expectations with people throughout the city supporting it.  The sponsored spin cycle covered  miles - the distance from Derry to Dublin.He commented: “We had a huge response, a lot of people took part in the cycle.  It was a km cycle and all sorts of people did shts, organisations, women’s groups and we well exceeded what we expected.“There is still some money coming in, UNISON just donated £ today and parent and toddler groups helped us out too.  When me and Paul Gallagher went down the Lord Mayor of Dublin was running afor Hugh’s House and there was another gentleman.  We were lucky enough that we met Ade and Martin who took us a tour around.“And whilst we were there we actually met two families from Letterkenny, but there have been a number of families from the council district who have been using it over the last while that we know of.”Speaking about local families who have availed of the service, he added: “I know a family who was supported by Hugh’s House in recent weeks, the mother was rushed to hospital in Dublin because there were no beds in the north.  The father was upset and they were stranded in the middle of Dublin with no contacts and had to find somewhere to sleep.“So it was through that that we phoned Hugh’s House and they were very helpful.  They then go through a social worker and visit the people in hospital, and they were lucky that two rooms had become available at the time.  The father was moved in and then when the mother got out of hospital she was able to use it as a base from which to visit the baby in hospital on a daily basis.“We talked to one of the families from Letterkenny who have three other children and, they said to us, ‘without this service we don’t know what we would have done.’  If you put yourself in that position, the hotels in Dublin are expensive, a child can be in for weeks, months or even a year in some cases then you couldn’t survive, people have bills to pay – it’s a lesaver for some people.”Photo: Cllr Paul Gallagher, Maria Kirby-BrennanAde Stack, Martin Curleyand Cllr Gary Donnelly."},{"url":null,"title":"newly acquired duncreggan road land may provide student parking solution","story":"The Ulster University Vice Chancellor has been urged to make available newly acquired lands at the old Foyle College for student parking in order to ease congestion in the Duncreggan area.SDLP MLA Mark H.

However, councillors subsequently switched attention to the former St. Maryrsquos Girlsrsquo Primary School campus at Shanslieve Drive.Despite a number of protracted attempts to secure the site and hopes that a deal could be agreed, it was bought by supermarket giant Lidl.While widely regarded as one of Northern Irelandrsquos premier tourist resorts, Newcastle does not have a modern indoor leisure facility and while there are some politicians who would like a swimming pool as part of any new development in the resort, this seems unlikely given there are local authority pools in Downpatrick, Kilkeel and Newry.It was previously suggested that the sale of the Annesley Buildings would free up the site for a new hotel and, signicantly, generate funds to help provide new leisure provision in the resort. But that now looks unlikely.As part of the drive to signicantly enhance leisure provision in the resort, council officials are continuing to work alongside education officials to develop a major new sports hub.Shimna Integrated College is planning to redevelop its King Street site which would include the creation of additional sports facilities at nearby Donard Park.It has been suggested that the proposed sports facilities could potentially be developed by the Department of Education in partnership with Newry, Mourne and Down Council with pitches and a sports pavilion forming the new sports hub which could also used by the community.While discussions are ongoing, the local authority still has to address the issue of no meaningful indoor sports facility in the resort to cater for both residents and visitors and is turning its attention to the Annesley Buildings site.Senior council officials have admitted that their initial thoughts about using the location for a town centre hotel have changed, confirming they are working to make a final decision on the way forward. It is also being suggested that the most likely outcome is developing a new leisure-cum-community facility at the Central Promenade site.A feasibility study on the redevelopment of the town centre site for a new hotel was completed several years ago which suggested a two or three-storey extension extension would be acceptable.The new hotel was viewed as a key ingredient in the plan to deliver highly ambitious proposals outlined in the Mournes Gateway proposals aimed at shaping future tourist provision in Newcastle.Other proposals include a gondola ride into the heart of the Mournes and a visitor centre at the site of the old quarry at Thomasrsquo Mountain.It has emerged that work on the high profile tourism project is progressing with moves to establish a board to deliver its ious elements, with membership including representatives from the local council, Tourism NI, Forest Service, Mourne Heritage Trust and National Trust.Over the next month, work is scheduled to start on tendering for consultancy and architectural services, alongside the recruitment of environmental and traffic management services.

Scrum half Conor Gibson was on hand to move the ball quickly to Hutley, who put Luka Walsh in space for the first score of the game.Omagh bounced back well, again using the wind effectively, and their pressure gave way to a penalty which they successfully struck to close the gap.As they continued to apply pressure, the home side had a chance to take the lead on the  minute mark, but their kick drted to the right hand side of the posts.With  minutes left in the half, Down High extended their lead. Having forced Omagh deep into their own half, Luka Walsh capitalised on Omaghrsquos decision to play out from their own quarters when he intercepted the ball to score his second of the day. Hutley slotted over the conversion. Down carried a - lead into half-time.With the strong wind now on their tails and a reasonable points buffer, Down High controlled the game well. Omagh continued to apply plenty of pressure, but the Down defence was hungry and with the exception of a few indiscretions they soaked up the Omagh onslaughts.With  minutes left the game took a critical turn when Hutley slotted agoal to take the Down lead to -.As would be expected from the men from the west, they didnrsquot lie down, but they were forced to chase the game.

However, the book kept me from thinking dark thoughts. Soon, all I wanted was to hold a copy of the book in my hand.Maureenrsquos dream came true in the autumn of  when her haunting story was finally published.Maureen, who is the mother of five grown-up children, explained some of the background as to why she put pen to paper.She added: ldquoI was initially setting out to piece together my family tree and the computer screen flashed up information on my great aunt Brigid. I was so fascinated with what I read that I could see the story unfold in a book and in turn I felt the plot would work well on screen too.Research took Maureen to the Presentation Convent in Co Kildare, which Brigid entered at the age of .Maureen said: ldquoI met with such a warm and friendly welcome from the community of sisters, that it gave me the desire to pursue Brigidrsquos story further. I travelled to Australia shortly after and I received the same, warm and friendly welcome from the sisters of the Presentation of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Wagga Wagga.On herMaureen set about sting through a mountain of information and carefully crafted the remarkable story of her great aunt. The book was published in July  and was officially launched a few months later to a rapturous reception in Murphyrsquos Bar in Downpatrick.A chance meeting which her web designer, Michael McLaughlin, had had a year later led to a further development.She said: ldquoMichael was working on a display in Eclipse Cinema in Downpatrick for another movie when he struck up a random conversation with Colin McIvor.ldquoAs they chatted Michael mentioned that he had recently read a book written by a Downpatrick woman which he thought might make a great movie.ldquoWithin days Colin, with the backing of Northern Ireland Screen, was in my house and we were signing contracts on a movie deal. That was in July last year and since then the whole thing has snowballed.ldquoIt has been a pleasure putting the whole thing together. I wrote it like a novel which makes it easy for the reader to follow the story. My story is entirely based on fact.As Maureen describes the plot her face lights up. She believes her great aunt would be delighted at her revealing the long-lost tale to a new generation.ldquoBrigid had trained as a teacher and in  there was a great demand for priests and nuns with skilled trades in Australia and so she was shipped off to the mother house in Wagga Wagga.ldquoBrigid proved herself capable and popular with the children she taught for six years. But a bad day in front of a teaching inspector led the convent demoting her to refectory duties.ldquoTwo weeks turned into two years of hard labour that took their toll physically and mentally on poor Brigid. Requests toto her former duties were denied and feeling she had no real means of complaint, it left Brigid desperate.ldquoOne day she wandered outside the convent walls. Tears welled up in her eyes as she called at a strangerrsquos home. Her afternoon of tea and warm company by the fire ended all too soon and Brigid was sent back to the convent, seen by a doctor and put to bed, Maureen added.The story really begins in earnest at this crossroads in Brigidrsquos le. Drawing on every ounce of courage she had, Brigid leapt from her bed that night and made a hasty escape barefoot in her nightgown on a foggy winterrsquos night in .This night set the scene for a religious storm unprecedented in Australiarsquos history. Brigid found refuge in the home of Protestants who refuse to disclose her whereabouts to the Catholic authorities.A bishop swore before a magistrate that Brigid was insane and a warrant was issued for her arrest. She was hunted down like an outlaw and the local media attention created a level of sectarian tension rarely unseen in that part of the world.Later, when there was no apology from the bishop for the arrest and slur on her character, Brigid turned to the courts for redress. But taking on the bishop meant taking on the Catholic Church.Maureen had a challenging time presenting Brigidrsquos story.She said: ldquoIt was a scandal at the time but I had to be careful to write it from both sides and let people judge for themselves. Itrsquos all I can do.Maureen says she is looking forward to the filmrsquos premiere.She added: ldquoIt will be the culmination of not just my five years of writing and telling the story, but all the hard work and effort that my family have put into supporting and helping me and, of course, the efforts of the film company, the director and the actors.Colin spoke of his enthusiasm over Maureenrsquos forthcoming film.ldquoI am thoroughly delighted to have optioned such an amazingly powerful book and to have met the inspirational Maureen and her family through the process, he said.He is currently adapting the book into a screenplay. ldquoI believe the film will offer a fantastic role for a strong female lead and supporting cast, he said. ldquoTo be able to bring this beautully written, dramatic and deserved piece to the silver screen some day would be just fantastic.Log on to Maureenrsquos website toon the forthcoming movie premiere at www.theextraordinarycaseofsisterliguori..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C January 30%2C 1979  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK mdash A Strangford man had a narrow escape from death when he turned up for work on Monday morning at the new Abbey Lodge Hotel, outside Downpatrick.A muffled explosion during the night had ripped apart a section of the hotel mdash which was due to open in three weeksrsquo time mdash but no alarm was raised and workmen were unaware of the danger when they reported for work.One of the men, Mr Francis Black, from Strangford, passed through the lounge and noticed a black bag and two yellow tins.

He put it down and it was discovered later that the contents were competence for a lethal fire-type bomb.By then Mr Blackrsquos colleagues had discovered the damage caused by another bomb and a warning was raised. Police and firemen rushed to the scene and the main Downpatrick-Crossgar Road, beside the hotel, was sealed off as army bomb disposal experts raced from Lisburn.An army officer successfully defused the second bomb and workmen moved in to assess the damage, which was confined that bedroom section of the hotel.The hotel owner, Mr William Polly, said: ldquoDoors, windows, the gable and the roof have all been damaged and this includes a total of eight bedrooms.

These premises will be our new premises with dedicated areas for Lowden acoustic guitars and new electric guitar ranges, said George.ldquoWe are currently planning out the logistics of our move from Down Business Park. This will require attention to detail and be orchestrated stage by stage to minimise any disruption to our ability to complete and ship our guitars to waiting customers.Lowden Guitars successfully managed to keep news that it was working with Sheeran mdash one of the worldrsquos biggest music artist, who has sold  million albums and has had more than  billion streams mdash under wraps for considerable time.

But a starting price for a Lowden was three grand. When yoursquore , three grand may as well be a million pounds.ldquoThe dream of any kid who likes music is to have a guitar and the dream of any musician is to have a signature guitar.George realised that he needed to make a range that was something special and revealed that he sought inspiration from the North Coast.ldquoEvery guitar that I design and make I have to feel afterwards proud of it, I have to feel that I have achieved something with it. That itrsquos not just a normal guitar, he explained.ldquoThe main aim was to design and make a guitar here at an affordable price noticeably better than anything  at that price range. So I went up to the North Coast and spent a week at the Giants Causeway walking and thinking and drawing. Then having designed it, of course I sent it off to Ed and the rest is history.Sheeran has previously bemoaned that fewer youngsters seem to be interested in guitar-playing these days.ldquoThere are fewer guitar bands and fewer artists using guitars now, and not as many kids picking up guitars, he added.ldquoThat is something I would like to change by getting these great quality guitars, made in Ireland, into kidsrsquo hands and encouraging them to learn and progress.The Sheeran by Lowden acoustic guitar range features eight inidual models across two small body sizes familiar from the Lowden range, known as the S and the Wee Lowden.The guitars have been designed for uncompromising tone and playability and are made using sustainably-sourced wood including naturally fallen trees and reclaimed spruce.George says that the new range combines years of hand-crafting and traditional luthier methods with new construction technology.ldquoItrsquos taking everything I have learnt over the last  years, cherry-picking from that a few traditional methods of working by hand and introducing those into a whole series of new groundbreaking procedures for guitar making so that the end result is a guitar made in Ireland but one which really sings and which I hope inspires many young musicians and older ones as well, he added.The first orders should be shipped in March.

There will be two weekend closures in the Lurgan area between February - and March - before a four week line closure between  July and  August.Bus substitutions will be in place. This is preparation work for the Lurgan Area Track Renewal Project. This is a substantial scheme to enhance and improve the railway line.Translink will implement a four-week closure this summer of the railway line at Lurgan to fully relay over .km of track, running from the William St level crossing to beyond Bell’s Row level crossing. This closure will be in place between Friday  July and Friday  August inclusive.Some preliminary drainage and level crossing work will be undertaken during engineering line closures on the weekends of - February and - March, with further preparatory work being carried out in the area, outside of normal working hours and overnight, between April and July. This will be a major project, increasing the railway operational line speed in the area and improving safety and efficiency for rail users. The project will also include relaying the three level crossings in the area and renewing the  metres of existing  structures at the station.John Glass, Translink’s Director of Infrastructure and Projects, said: ‘‘Numbers of passengers choosing the train have grown strongly in recent years.Lurgan is now a key station for commuters, with over . million passengers using the Portadown Line every year, and nearly  million passengers using the cross-border, Belfast – Dublin Enterprise service annually. “This work will see us remove current speed restrictions, providing more efficient journeys while maintaining overall performance and high safety standards.The investment also secures the long-term sustainability of this line and maintains vital cross-border connectivity on this important corridor, in line with our Enterprise Strategic Development Plan.Longer-term, the work will also reduce the level of maintenance on the line. “Representing a signicant capital investment, the works will also help contribute to the continued economic growth of the town and the surrounding area.The work represents the first phase of a number of planned strategic improvements within the area over the coming years, including signalling redesign works and an enhanced station, subject to appropriate funding and permissions.“As plans progress, we are prioritising engagement with local elected representatives and other stakeholders, including sports and community organisations, so that local people are made fully aware of the planned upgrade. This engagement will continue between now and the main upgrade works this summer. “We will be working closely with our contractors to complete the works as quickly as possible and keep disruption to a minimum.Young Whitehead ‘Wombles’ awarded sum for sea creature creation Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“Translink is committed to investing in our infrastructure and improving services, ensuring that we progress our journey to being ‘your first choice for travel in Northern Ireland.”try catch  TrendingIN PICTURES:  things you should never EVER say or do to someone from Northern IrelandHas PSNI officer Bobby Singleton become an unwitting sex symbol Snow, ice and fallen debris could make your morning drive dficult - as Roads Service confirm salting of roads network underwayIan Ogle daughter: UVF gang that murdered Dad are still planning to kill my brotherP.S.N.I. shutdown N.I. road after car crash - N.I.

He decided to put together a calendar of his work together to help raise money for the Alzheimers Society, as his father died from the disease in .The -year-old was encouraged to put together the calendar after posting some of his pictures in a local Facebook group.He said: \"I was surprised by the positive response and all the encouraging comments my first set of photos received, said Phil, ldquoWhen I posted another set of photos people started suggesting putting them together in a book or a calendar.\"Mr Lewis said the idea stuck and he asked the group to vote for their favourite photos which would be included in the calendar, before working with local graphic designer Ceri Legg who designed the layout and Beacon Printers, who printed the calendars.Around  calendars were printed altogether which were on sale in shops throughout the town, but have now fully sold out.ldquoI was really worried at first as the number  was suggested to me by the printers, and as soon as I picked them up I start feeling anxious about how exactly I was going to sell  calendars,\" said Mr Lewis.\"I thought that  would have been a more realistic number. I was completely taken aback by the huge response.\"I had people contacting me from all over the world ndash Australia, Spain, Texas, askingI would post calendars to them. This is on top of the response from local people.\"I spent most of my evenings in that first week doing deliveries all over Penarth,\" Mr Lewis added.Through the sales, Mr Lewis has raised more than pound, for the Alzheimers Society.He said: \"It seemed like the right thing to do really, as Penarth is a very community-oriented town so doing a calendar for charity fits with the outlook of the people of Penarth.\"Now, Mr Lewis is looking at printing more calendars this year to help raise further funds for the charity.\"If the idea of this calendar had never been suggested then my photos would have ended up just sitting on my computer,\" he said.\"Irsquom just glad that this hobby that I really like has ended up being put to good use by raising this money for charity.To get in touch with Mr Lewis about purchasing a calendar, email philip.lewis@live article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The site will potentially generate up to  new work positions across management, supervisory, warehousing staff and apprenticeship roles.Speaking of the new facility and what it will bring, Mr Rattenbury said: ldquoWe are delighted that our vision of a lsquoone stop shoprsquo for our customers is being realised and having a  hour, seven day a week co-packing facility in the heart of Wales, is a game changer for our industry. We can now offer our customers a streamlined product supply chain package by integrating their co-packing requirements with the grouprsquos warehouse and transport subsidiary companies.ldquoLogistically, this works out to be more cost effective overall, but also lowers the carbon footprint on the transportation of food products, which is something we are passionate about.Wild Water Group has a current annual turnover of poundm and Mr Rattenbury believes the company can increase that figure by a further poundm within  months and then reach poundm within two to three years.The project is backed by a pound. million investment from Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking and the Development Bank of Wales and has secured Welsh Government funding under the new economic contract.Using a similar business model to the grouprsquos other three sites in Merthyr Tydfil, Llanishen and Cardf Bay, the first phase of development will be the conversion of available space into a large ambient open plan co-packing facility, which will be operational early November  to meet festive season demand.During the first quarter of , Wild Water Group will move the entire Cardf Bay co-packing facility to Aberbargoed, once freezer facilities, production lines and machinery are in place.The company will then continue services such as frozen to frozen storage, bagging, over wrapping, sleeving and tray sealing, as well as the full spectrum of print labelling applications required under the Food Safety Technicalspecications.Economy Secretary Ken Skates said: ldquoThis project will not only see a successful, growing Welsh business create an additional  jobs, it will also create a new strategic hub and facility for both large and small food and drink businesses across the region to pack or store products themselves. This could, in turn, open up new markets for those businesses ndash so Irsquom excited about what this means not only for Wild Water Group and Aberbargoed, but for the region more widely.ldquoIt shows that both our Economic and Food and Drink Action plans are delivering what we had hoped ndash jobs, prosperity and sustainable growth. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

There is no requirement to complete any spending on this project by the end of this financial year.ldquoIt is very dficult to please everyone with highway improvement schemes but I very much hope that this option provides the active travel benefits we are seeking and is viewed by residents and visitors to Penarth as being the most appropriate. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was made with willow grown in the grounds of Cogan Primary School.More than  people attended the hill rolling ceremony down Clf Hill towards Penarth Esplanade - with the school pupils from Cogan and pupils and families from Ysgol Pen Y Garth helping to roll it along.The head was accompanied by a wooden frame from the Mabinogion stories called the Window of Sorrows made by Tony Simms, and the artist Ifor Davies undertook the ritual sawing of the Window of Sorrows on the clftops and read the Bendigeidfran story from the Mabinogion tales before the rolling went ahead.The head of Bendigeidfran and the Window of Sorrows was accompanied by Penarths Mari Lwyd which is a symbol of hosting, and negotiating hospitality through song and teasing. Richard Parry led the Mari Lwyd this year, and on arriving at the bottom of the hill the celebration visited local shops and resaurants along the sea front wishing the proprietors and customers a Happy New Year. We sang for Romeo Italian restaurant, The Fig Tree, James Sommerin, The Crazy Cafe and Hamptons seaside shop. After reaching the bottom of the hill the head was carried by the children along with the Mari Lwyd to the shops and cafes along the seafront where dferent New Year songs - called Calenig - were sung in each venue and led by local opera singer Richard Parry.Speaking about the event, artist Haf Weighton said: \"I loved working with Cogan School. Itrsquos a hidden gem in Penarth with very enthusiastic staff who were happy to jump in to get involved in this project at short notice. Richard Parry and the schools deputy head Tom Lewis, ran a assembly to the whole school on the new year traditions. Then children from across the school came to see me working on the piece. \"It was lovely to hear children who donrsquot come from homes where Welsh is spoken enthusing about the mabinogi tales and Welsh traditions. Children from Pen y Garth joined in after the head was created. They helped us roll it down the hill from the clf tops.\"Richard Parry, who helped to organise the event and led the Mari Lwyd, said: \"It was great to see so many people come together to celebrate Hen Galan in Penarth. The giant Bendegeidfran got his name because he was the Blessed Bran - the best friend anyone could ever want - and in the stories of the Mabinogion he was loved by those who knew him. He is a symbol of friendship and celebrating together. \"The community celebration on the clftops was thoroughly enjoyed by children and adults alike, and even though its a bit chilly it was wonderful to see so many people out of doors, celebrating, singing and enjoying wishing everyone we met Blwyddyn Newydd Dda and Happy New Year.\"The head will now go on display at a iety of places, including Pen y Garth School, Cogan Primary School, Penarth Library and The Hearth Gallery Llandough Hospital. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

emergence of unapproved roads for school run","story":"While many students attend schools on the opposite side of the border through schemes approved by authorities, countless others are believed to use a practice commonly referred to as ldquogrannying, to attend school in Northern Ireland.Parents living close to the border are braced for the re-emergence of ldquounapproved roads like those used during the Troubles, to take their children to school.While the UK and Irish governments have maintained that the free movement of people between the two jurisdictions will not be affected, queues of traffic affecting thousands of people are anticipatedcustoms checks are reintroduced on the border after March .A reciprocal agreement exists between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland whereby children living on one side of the border are able to access an education on the other side of the border.The caveat is that schools in Northern Ireland may only consider a child who is resident in the Republic of Ireland for admission after all resident children who have applied to the school have been considered.A practice known as ldquogrannying involves residents who move to the Republic presenting schools in Northern Ireland with proof of address at a grandmother or relativersquos house to avoid being left out.One Londonderry mother, who admits to using the unauthorised practice, has expressed concern.The woman, who has lived in Donegal for more than  years and has two children attending school in Northern Ireland, said the idea of sending her children to school in the Republic of Ireland never crossed her mind.ldquoIrsquom from Derry originally, I work and pay tax in Derry, it made sense for the children to go to school there, she said.ldquoIf there was an emergency, or they were sick and had to leave school immediately, itrsquos not practical for them to be in Donegal and Irsquom driving to work in the morning anyway so it makes sense with the school run.The Troubles saw many smaller cross-border roads become unauthorised border crossings known officially as ldquounapproved roads, which local people used to avoid customs officials and security services.ldquoIn my village alone, a tiny village, therersquos four back roads into Derry city, the mother of two added.ldquoI could confidently say % of my neighbours in this housing estate are from Derry city originally and still working there, or have children attend school there.ldquoTherersquos no way they would have the manpower to guard the border and stop every car, and therersquos no way people will wait in queues of traffic in the morning, theyrsquoll find another way to get there, theyrsquoll take back roads or roads that canrsquot be manned.Marguerite Hamilton, a former principal of Thornhill College, a girlsrsquo grammar school in the Culmore area of Derry, one mile from the Derry Donegal border, said it is ldquoinconceivable that children could be prevented or delayed from going to schoolcustoms posts were installed.Ms Hamilton said schools across Northern Ireland are aware of ldquogrannying students living over the border.ldquoWhen a child applies for school, we ask for a veriable proof of address, a bank statement or letter from a doctor for example,they can supply the proof, it is not the schoolrsquos place to go around investigatingthe child actually resides there or not, she said.ldquoAlso,circumstances change for instance,they start school living in Derry, and move even just one mile away to the south, should they be forced to leave the school and educational system they know ldquoWhatrsquos clear is that those arguing about the border in London will not have their lives affected by the consequences.Statistics on how often the practice is used are unveriable, but Ms Hamilton estimates that there are hundreds of children attending school in Northern Ireland who reside in the Republic.The Department of Education and Skills in the Republic of Ireland said it is confident the Common Travel Area will facilitate existing arrangements for cross-border pupils.Minister for education Joe McHugh said: ldquoThe school communities along the border, both in the north and in the south, have done tremendous work over the last  years in cementing the peace process and they deserve enormous credit for that.ldquoIrsquove talked about this issue in recent days with the heads of the department and the need to better understand the important role that these schools, their staff, pupils and parents have played in that and will continue to play.Likewise, the Department of Education in Northern Ireland said it is aware of the issue, but has faith that the Common Travel Area between the two jurisdictions will safeguard access to education.ldquoThe issue of the provision of  information on an application is not limited to the home address of a pupil and the department has provided guidance to schools on their duty to very application information, a spokeswoman said.ldquoA parent providing information that is found to be  may have the offer of a place for their child withdrawn.ldquoIn relation to the impact of Brexit, the British and Irish governments have agreed that the rights flowing from the Common Travel Area should be maintained.ldquoThe Common Travel Area provides citizens of the UK and Republic of Ireland with the right to access services, including education, in the other jurisdiction..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Border communities braced for re-emergence of

He’s just taken over at the helm of the internationally renowned next generation science park which is home to  innovative knowledge based companies, who are employing more than , engineers, researchers, entrepreneurs and executives, across four locations – and has his sights firmly set on making Northern Ireland a leader in two key innovative areas of tech business.Taking on the role as chief executive of Catalyst from stalwart Professor Norman Apsley OBE, just two months ago, plans are under way to build on the foundations of an organisation which has an estate of , sq ft of agile workspace filled with innovative companies. Catalyst leads the way in innovation and entrepreneurship by supporting the creation and growth of innovation companies in Northern Ireland.“We have a rightful place in leading the world. We aren’t going to follow anybody. Let’s get back to leading the world,” Steve tells Ulster Business.“I am going to take the foundation that Norman left and look at how we leverage that by a signicant factor – in terms of economic activity and dynamism for Northern Ireland.“We need deeper, more strategic partnerships with key institutions. It is through collaboration we can do something to scale and put Northern Ireland on a world map.”Catalyst is the thriving, beating heart of Northern Ireland’s booming technology sector and leading the way in educating and preparing companies and young people for the changing world of work through the impact of the ‘Fourth Industrial Revolution, which is seeing the impact of new technologies impacting on le, work and society.Formerly known as the Northern Ireland Science Park, Catalyst is an independent not-for-profit organisation operating across the region. It provides agile workspace across four locations – the main site in Belfast’s Titanic Quarter, the Innovation centres in Londonderry, and Ballymena and most recently opened Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub, a co-working space dedicated to the fintech sector in Belfast city centre, which is a partnership with Danske Bank.“The business model we have had for the first  years was the perfect model for that period. We need a new model for the next. We are identying a simple, but ambitious strategy – building on the existing foundation.”Part of the strength of Catalyst is in attracting big international firms, such as Citi, in close proximity to businesses at the very birth of existence. Steve says as a result, “accidental encounters” lead to relationships and outcomes which otherwise, would not have happened.It also plays host to Queen’s University’s leading research body, ECITwhich itself is home to CSIT .Some of the leading thinkers based at the site include ECIT’s Professor Maire O’Neill – one of the youngest ever engineering professors at Queen’s, one-time UK Female Inventor of the Year and a leading researcher. “You have US companies looking at why would they want to move to Northern Ireland – they want to meet Professor O’Neill. She’s amazing,” Steve says.“Then there are cyber companies, like B-Secur. The firm specialises in technology which can read your ECG heartbeat as a unique biometric identy verication.“There are other indigenous companies, like Titan IC in cyber-security, Displaynote and ProAxsis. We have great companies that are now making a dent in the world.”And pushing forward with what his predecessor Norman Apsley built, plans are under way to expand and redevelop Catalyst further still.That includes another new building, Pierpont  – which will provide another , sq ft of space – and a revamp and refurbishment of Catalyst’s Innovation Centre, as part of an addition £m investment.“We want to make this the best place to work – improving the environment, the flow around the campus, the accessibility, and the experience, so that you love being here.“We want to refresh some of the buildings on the site. The Innovation Centre will be modernised by March and we will freshen-up our identity.”His big goal is to lead the way in two areas of technology and business at Catalyst – putting Northern Ireland front and centre.“We want to help to incubate two clusters where Northern Ireland leads the world.“How do we build on what ECIT is doing  We take the start-up capability, and ecosystem we have in Northern Ireland and leverage that further.“We want to make it easier for corporations to set up in Belfast and Northern Ireland in order to access amazing research talent. They want to define what the next big breakthrough is.“We can develop something for global companies that they can’t find where in the world. We want to create clusters, that will act as a magnet to attract hundreds of companies.”One of the unique elements of Catalyst is Connect – a network of experienced entrepreneurs, business professionals, top research talent and potential investors who provide their time and experience pro bono to help foster and develop the next generation of entrepreneurs.“It’s helping entrepreneurs to figure out how to build a company around their product idea and providing the support to validate and access the marketplace, capital, investment and or talent,” Steve says.“With the Connect network, we had  early stage companies or entrepreneurs engaged in our programmes last year. There is a lot of exciting and vibrant activity going on at the moment.”And it was Connect, which Steve founded and developed at Catalyst, which first drew him back home to his native Northern Ireland, following years of running and founding tech firms in the West Coast of the US.“I was an entrepreneur in Calornia for a number of years, in San Francisco and San Diego. I was there for the peak of the dot coms,” he said.That included his own start-up business, Kineticom, as well as other tech companies. It was his time in San Diego which resonated strongly with Steve.“Personally, I became obsessed with the San Diego story and the parallels to Northern Ireland. When they started on their journey in , San Diego had a population of . million people, % of their economy was dependent on the public sector. They have an ocean to one side, a mountain range around them and another country to the bottom of them.”San Diego went from the bottom of every league table to the top – with the collaboration of top universities, research and development and entrepreneurship, building the city into the tech stalwart it is now.The Connect  emanated from San Diego – a concept which help shaped the programme in Northern Ireland.“Meeting Norman Apsley at the Science Park was just the most beautul thing ever,” Steve says.The financial and economic impact and contribution that Catalyst has is hard to ignore. It’s estimated the businesses which operate there contribute around £m in GVA each year.“Everything we do is based on the simple belief that innovation has the power to transform our economy. People around the world are all innovating quickly, adapting new technologies, articial intelligence, for example. In Northern Ireland,people are producing goods and services, but are behind in adopting those new technologies, our economy is going to be in trouble as we will not be competitive.“The question is, how does innovation become the foundation on which everything is based ”And as a result of Catalyst’s research into the NI Knowledge Economy, an annual report published later this month, which acknowledges the huge changes to the workplace in the coming year, Catalyst is hosting their second Future of Work summit in May  – aimed at demystying how roles and traditional jobs are changing, right across the Knowledge Economy sectors.Of course, Brexit is still on the horizon. For Steve, the main concern is around the availability of talent. “The tech sector is hungry for talent, but with the uncertainty in the last couple of years, fewer people have been willing to consider moving to Northern Ireland. That places a lot of pressure on the existing employees in the sector.”“Long-term, we have to be optimistic and look at the opportunities which can come out of Brexit. The businesses within the Knowledge Economy are export driven, representing over % of all NI exports. With % of these exports outside the EU, the Knowledge Economy is the sector least dependent on Europe and should be the key for driving growth at this time of uncertainty.”So, for Steve, his level of optimism and dynamism is clear in his new role, one which he says he is “very fortunate” to have.“It’s a position which comes around so rarely, and whoever gets the opportunity is so blessed and fortunate to have the opportunity to lead. We have a talented team of people who are all passionate about what is possible. It’s so exciting. The opportunities and possibilities are endless.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"no deal brexit could cost ni economy bn by ","story":"Posted on Monday  January  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland’s economy could suffer a £bn drop in output by  in the event of a ‘no deal’ Brexit, it’s been claimed.

The CBI calculates this could amount to an annual loss of output worth almost £bn by , based on today’s prices. It says “manufacturing activity is particularly important in Northern Ireland, and the agri-food sector, which employs thousands, is likely to be severely impacted as it is particularly exposed to the risk of higher tarfs and trade costs”. Angela McGowan, Northern Ireland director of the CBI, said: “CBI members across Northern Ireland are clear:the new approach to finding a Brexit deal continues to be a game of who blinks first, the Northern Irish economy will pay the price. “The deadlock will only be broken by a genuine attempt by all MPs to find consensus and compromise, not stick to rusting red lines and political conditions. Like the rest of the UK, Northern Ireland is not – and cannot be – ready for no deal. “The projected impact on our economy would be devastating and while business will do all it can to reduce some of the worst aspects, a no deal scenario is unmanageable. “The message from the CBI to our politicians is clear – we must see compromise or the whole country faces the unforgivable prospect of a disorderly Brexit which will affect jobs and livelihoods in Northern Ireland for decades to come. It’s time to put prosperity before party politics and dogma.”  View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Air-1.jpg","title":"eight part belfast made airbus passenger jets delivered","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by John Mulgrew Eight part-Belfast made Bombardier Airbus passenger jets were delivered at the end of last year – bringing the total number to  during .

We tell client’s stories through engaging content written by former journalists – grab their customers’ attention with stunning design, maximise conversions by using the latest digital marketing expertise, and develop websites which are living, breathing, online stores or shop windows. As content director, my role is to bring almost  years’ experience in journalism, political communications, corporate PR, crisis management and digital content crafting to Grofuse. How did the business start and how has it grown The business was created by a fusion of expertise to achieve sales growth, including experienced digital marketers, PR consultants, web developers, software developers, graphic designers, illustrators and motion designers. I co-founded the company with expert digital marketer Denis Finnegan who has spent  years fuelling online lead generation for businesses. Growth has been swt over the last  months. We’ve employed an effective combination of marketing efforts and created fans of our existing clients.What is your background I’m a seasoned hack, having worked in print journalism for almost  years followed by a few years as a political communications adviser. I spent a brief period teaching English and history at secondary level before entering a newsroom. The working environments were poles apart in terms pace, excitement and... language choices. As a school pupil and university student, I worked on building sites, supermarkets, farms, bars, bread delivery vans, a bakery and even a bacon factory kill-line. However, I had never encountered such flurries of expletives as I did in newsrooms. Great places to work. High pressure, tight deadlines and great target-setting – a superb way to fuel productivity in any work environment.What do you do dferently from your competition and what are your strengths Clear communication with our clients is our greatest strength. We listen intently to what our clients’ goals are, take time to learn about their products and gain full understanding of their ideal customers. We start with a blank canvass and devise bespoke digital strategies to fuel each client’s business growth by engaging their target market effectively and delivering genuine sales leads that are easily quantiable.Who are your main customers Our customers operate across a wide range of sectors. We are currently working with clients across the UK and Ireland, US, France and Spain. Do you have a target in mind in terms of where you want the business to grow We are currently focusing the bulk of our efforts on the island of Ireland with a particular focus on Dublin and Belfast. What challenges have you faced The somewhat ‘snake-oil industry’ reputation of digital marketing sometimes poses a barrier to speaking with decision makers who in the past have invested with little . However, once we’re given an opportunity, we like to let the results do the talking. Who most inspires you Those who thrive in the face of adversity and have strong growth mind-sets. The type of person with the right measure of accountability, skill and relentlessness to inspire their teams to achieve targets. It’s a mind-set akin to that of a top athlete whose body is screaming ‘slow down’ in the business end of a race but whose mind interprets that as a cue to go faster. My we Martina – a former operations manager with Lidl Ireland who co-founded and runs leading human resources consultancy, HR Team – has these qualities in abundance. She inspires me in everything I do.Where do you see yourself in the next few years I love living and working in the North West. Whatever people like to call Derry or Londonderry, it’s a very special place with a lot of talent and a big future in driving the cross-border regional economy. With our headquarters at Catalyst Inc and plans underway for satellite offices in Dublin and the UK, we want to ensure our agency plays a part in shaping that economic prosperity with the provision of more high-quality jobs for the area.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
