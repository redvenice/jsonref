The rest of his property empire is located in his home town of Haverhilll, Suffolk, some of which he has already sold off. He also bought two record stores there, but closed them as he planned to up sticks and move Down Under.           Abandoned: Aerial images of the Horseheath Lodge estate show the fields, barns and cottages with no sign of life, alongside empty stables, paddocks and a horse ring         Where the farm was once bustling with animals and farmhands, there is now just an old caravan (pictured) sat in the yard         Photos show Mr Bayford still has an enviable fleet of expensive cars on the driveway of his secluded property away from the farm        His friends have claimed his fortune has left him feeling increasingly isolated and he no longer feels comfortable even going out for a beer. He told The Sun late last year that everyone \u0027wants a piece of him\u0027 now he is a multi-millionaire. The lottery winner has reportedly fallen out with friends, including the director of Cambridge Rock festival which he hosted on his lawn in 2017.         Adrian Bayford, 48, bought his Georgian Grade II-listed manor house and sprawling country estate in Linton, Cambridgeshire shortly after he and his then-wife Gillian won £148million on the EuroMillions game in 2012 (pair are pictured celebrating) He also said to feel hassled by residents of the 38 properties he owns because they feel as a wealthy landlord he should pay for everything.Mr Bayford bought a local village pub The Rose and Crown for £375,000 but has reportedly fallen out with bar staff and now barely sets foot in it. Villagers in Suffolk, on the other hand, believe Mr Bayford is getting fed up with all the hard work needed to maintain the mansion and all his land.A friend said: \u0027Basically Adrian has had enough and he has the money to change his life - so he is. He woke up and found himself in this life that he didn\u0027t want.\u0027Adrian was never about Range Rovers, horses, sheep, chickens and paddocks and stables. He\u0027s a rocker for goodness sake. He\u0027s probably more interested in biting the heads of chickens rather than feeding them. \u0027Then when his ex-wife remarried earlier this year I think he realised he needed to do something.\u0027 He was still with ex-wife Gillian when he moved to the house, just seven miles from their former three bedroom home in a cul-de-sac in Haverhill.It was reported at the time that Adrian may have delivered letters to the mansion when he worked as a postman before setting up his own business selling second hand records and CDs.But he and Gillian, a former care assistant, split up 15 months after their big win and later orced, citing the stress of dealing with their massive windfall.He remained in the house which dates back to 1815 and stamped his fun-loving personality on the property, installing statues of knights in shining armour in the grounds.    In January last year he was left heartbroken when his fiancee Samantha Burbidge, 30, walked out on him.  His \u0027move\u0027 to Australia would free him of a past filled with bad relationships, he claimed last year.           An aerial view of Mr Bayford\u0027s Cambridgeshire farm shows the fields empty, barns closed and a single white van in the yard         The sprawling Cambridgeshire estate is surrounded by fields and stretches for 189 acres (pictured from above) "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/02/15/000D655100000C1D-6019689-image-a-36_1533221933419.jpg","title":"Tesla obsessed boys family hires red Model S ninth birthday surprise","story":" \u0027Is it ours?\u0027 he excitedly asks as they approach the car. \u0027How did you buy a Tesla?\u0027 \u0027Wait is this?

Here are our highlights across fiction, poetry, non-fiction and children’s booksHailed as “the black Bridget Jones”, this moving and entertaining portrait of a south London millennial sees her wrestling with mental health problems, race hatred and gentrification.What we said: This is an important, timely and disarming novel, thirst-quenching and long overdue: one that will be treasured by “any type of black girl” and hordes of other readers besides.Read the full reviewA gothic novel that charts one woman’s life, from her childhood as a slave in a horrifying Jamaican plantation called Paradise to her eventual escape to England, where we find her on trial for a murder she cannot remember.What we said: Collins hasn’t just written an authentic gothic novel: she rugby tackles the notion of the saintly girl who emerges from suffering rather improved by it … Between her historical research, Frannie’s voice and a plot that never slows to a walk, the novel pulls the gothic into new territory and links it back to its origins.Read the full reviewRecovering from the physical and mental after-affects of a brutal attack in his own home, a man retreats to his family’s ancestral estate before a grisly discovery is made in the garden.What we said: The novel works brilliantly as a twisty page-turner, but it is far deeper and more nuanced than that. French’s theme throughout is the bruised relationship between the world and the self: whether our personalities are remade by trauma, or revealed what is concealed by privilege, and what is exposed.Read the full reviewIn this ode to the power of storytelling, Haddon weaves together multiple strands to take on Shakespeare’s Pericles, which sees an incestuous king challenged by an adventuring hero, from behind the walls of today’s European super-rich to the grime of Jacobean London.What we said: A helix, a mirrorball, a literary box of tricks … take your pick: this is a full-spectrum pleasure, mixing metafictional razzmatazz with pulse-racing action and a prose style to die for. I’ll be staggered if it’s not spoken of whenever prizes are mentioned this year.Read the full reviewOne of several recent novels to retell Greek classics from a female perspective, Calliope, muse of epic poetry, answers Homer’s famous invocation – “Sing, Muse” – to flesh out the stories of women who only fleetingly appear in epic myth.What we said: A bold choral retelling of the Iliad that’s panoramic and playful yet makes a serious comment on war and its true cost.Read the full reviewYears after leaving her poisonous and privileged family behind, a woman and her husband are forced to meet with her Trump-esque father and socialite mother. Horror ensues.What we said: The Snakes asks serious questions about human nature, avarice and justice, wrapped in the fast-paced rhythms of a thriller. It is written with Jones’s trademark economy and a fierce attention to the nuances of familial cruelty.Read the full reviewA few years into the Syrian civil war, three siblings come together to honour their father’s last wish – to be buried in the family’s ancestral village hundreds of kilometres away, on a diabolical road trip filled with checkpoints, snipers and bombs.What we said: A civil war is a national tragedy, but it is also, and perhaps most poignantly, a personal trial. The most amazing thing about this book is that it managed to exist, that it came to us out of the fire with its pages intact. It is robust in its doubts, humane in its gaze and gentle in its persistence.Read the full reviewThe Capital author’s take on the climate emergency imagines a fortress UK walled in concrete and patrolled by young conscripts in the not too distant future. Kavanagh, who is standing watch over an unforgiving stretch of the wall in north Devon, attempts to work his way up through the system.What we said: It’s a calculated extrapolation of our present anxieties with a clever, clairvoyant concept. Lanchester reveals with slow, steady control the cruelties of his strange new world and then socks you with their philosophical implications.Read the full reviewDedicated to the memory of her own son, who killed himself aged 16, Li’s book takes the form of a dialogue between a grieving writer and her son after his suicide.What we said: The tone is both astringent and faintly mischievous, recalling the dialogue in a JM Coetzee novel or the wordplay of Ali Smith. On any given page, the back and forth draws you in, yet you almost wince to recall the context, which intrudes in detail both tragic and bittersweet.Read the full reviewKazu, a Fukushima-born labourer, spends his life working away from his family, harvesting in northern Hokkaido and building in Tokyo. After missing seeing his children grow up, he only begins a daily life with his wife when he retires – which is soon cut short by tragedy.What we said: This novel most effectively conveys its concerns through dense layers of narrative, through ambiguity rather than specific fates. It is an urgent reminder of the radical ide between rich and poor in postwar Japan.Read the full reviewIn an early noughties, utopian version of New York, Ben and Kate meet at a party and fall in love. But when Kate falls asleep, she wakes up in London, in 1593, in the body of Emilia, the “Dark Lady” of Shakespeare’s sonnets. KateEmilia’s actions begin to alter her present reality.What we said: It’s one heck of a pitch, and in the hands of any other writer could wind up gimmicky, but Newman’s genius lies in balancing these timelines and worlds so finely that the whole thing is seamless – not to mention lots of fun.Read the full reviewSet around the disappearance of a small boy after he summons a strange presence to his commuter village, Porter’s second novel experiments with voices and typography to tap into the strangeness of English folklore.What we said: Lanny is simultaneously a fable, a collage, a dramatic chorus, a joyously stirred cauldron of words, and remarkable for its simultaneous spareness and extravagance. Porter takes risks – and one couldn’t ask him to rein in a strangeness that is so often triumphant.Read the full reviewThe third in Smith’s ambitious and rapid-response Seasonal Quartet, Spring takes on everything from Katherine Mansfield to Shakespeare to cast a keen eye on a very recognisable Britain, on the precipice of Brexit.What we said: This is a novel that contains multitudes, and the wonder is that Smith folds so much in, from visionary nature writing to Twitter obscenities, in prose that is so deceptively relaxed.Read the full reviewAn examination of how the Bible came to be constructed, what we can and cannot know about its authors and their meanings, and how it has been interpreted across the millennia.What we said: An Anglican priest and Oxford professor, Barton brings the Good Book splendidly back to life … It is an exhilarating achievement, freeing a vast, heterogeneous body of work from the dead hand of religious authorities who had turned it into “a paper dictator”.Read the full reviewThe feminist campaigner analyses the biased data that excludes women in a world designed by men, for men – everything from medical research to phone screen sizes and speech-recognition software.What we said: We already know that women are paid less, that we do far more unpaid labour at home, that the queues for our loos are longer, that we are the disproportionate victims of domestic violence. But it’s nevertheless useful and sobering to have numbers to quantify our pain and misery.Read the full reviewA narrative study of schizophrenia (once known as the “heartland” of psychiatry) by the award-winning novelist and former mental health nurse, that unpicks ostensible causes, stigma, and past and current treatments.What we said: Filer’s selection of quotes, facts and detail had me raising my eyebrows in exclamation, circling a phrase in recognition, mentally filing away an intrigue or twitching in distress … this is a book that everyone should read.Read the full reviewAn investigation into how the global elite use philanthropy to disguise their own refusal to pay taxes, and exposes the alibis and strategies used by those at the top to justify inertia.What we said: A spirited examination of the hubris and hypocrisy of the super-rich who claim they are helping the world … His one-liners and storytelling zest make Giridharadas the guy who you want to hang out with on the sidelines of that earnest cocktail party.Read the full reviewThe author of The Lost Words travels to the world below the ground, from the depths of Greenland’s glaciers to a bronze age burial chamber.What we said: At one point, a taciturn potholer in the Carso, Sergio, offers up a halting explanation of why he seeks to map the underland: “Here in the abyss we make … romantic science.” It’s a fitting description of this extraordinary book, at once learned and readable, thrilling and beautifully written.Read the full reviewA collection of essays, speeches and meditations from the American Nobel literature laureate, ning four decades and topics from gender to race and globalisation.What we said: Widely, ardently considered to be one of the world’s best writers, Morrison’s thoughts and arguments about politics, art and writing are all here. It’s a large, rich, heterogeneous book, and hallelujah.Read the full reviewPitts, a black British TV presenter, photographer and writer, sets out to document the areas of Europe inhabited by people of African descent, to see if there is an “Afropean” community: “A continent of Algerian flea markets, Surinamese shamanism, German reggae and Moorish castles. Yes, all this was part of Europe too.”What we said: By the end of the book we’re not certain that he has found his tribe. What is clear is that Afropean announces the arrival of an impassioned author able to deftly navigate and illuminate a black world that for many would otherwise have remained unseen.Read the full reviewThe professor of cognitive neuroimaging sets out to shatter the myth of the female brain, laying out how the gendered messages with which we are bombarded daily from birth shape our brains, and urging us to move beyond these views.What we said: The Gendered Brain is one of those books that should be essential reading before anyone is allowed to be a teacher, or buy a child a present, or comment on anything on Twitter, ever again.Read the full reviewAn overview of where we are in the climate crisis, that lays out the terrors of what lies ahead. “It is worse, much worse, than you think,” warns the author.What we said: For a relatively short book, The Uninhabitable Earth covers a great deal of cursed ground – drought, floods, wildfires, economic crises, political instability, the collapse of the myth of progress – and reading it can feel like taking a hop-on hop-off tour of the future’s sprawling hellscape. But it’s not without its hopeful notes.Read the full reviewAn exploration of modern food and how it has changed our lives, from meal replacements to the rise of veganism. Wilson also lays out how we can have a better relationship with what we eat.What we said: Fascinating … Wilson sets out to examine all the ways in which, in a world of seeming abundance and choice, our food is becoming degraded to the point where it makes us ill – and to unpick our current strategies for coping with this toxic environment.Read the full reviewAn argument that humanity is at a crossroads, where we still have the power to decide on the world we want to live in. Zuboff analyses how powerful corporations are trying to predict and control us – then sell our private lives to advertisers.What we said: A bold, important book that identifies our new era of capitalism, where tech companies attempt to control every aspect of what we do, for profit.Read the full reviewA dark and surreal debut set in a world of tragedies and travesties, where you can find a “monstrous double horse”, a “many bird roast” with “as many eyes as a spider”, and violence around every corner – especially if you are a woman.What we said: Disturbing, unnerving and aware, these poems linger through effective image-making, where a girl watches “a haunted old body, the one she’ll inhabit  that drags up and down the coast.”Read the full reviewThe first half turns to Greek mythology to explore misogyny, casting Zeus as he-man, ace swimmer and serial rapist. The second is more personal and shocking in a different way, when Benson reveals her experiences with depression.What we said: An extraordinarily moving, dark, brave and unsettling collection and a bold confrontation of violence against women.Read the full reviewA retrospective collection of the late poet’s best works, covering 10 collections written over four decades, as well as some previously unpublished poems.What we said: Like polished pebbles worn true with time’s passing, the strongest poems confirm a gift for the hauntingly exact yet humane lyric … Dunmore can draw on poetry’s power to distil an entire lifetime into a moment.Read the full reviewBrimming with a kooky insouciance, the author of Submarine and The Adulterants uses poetry to play with child-thieving owls, deranged hypnotists and melodramatic actors.What we said: At its self-knowing best, O Positive entertains and challenges, but it is also content to impress, “forever calculating  how to present myself”.Read the full reviewThe young gay poet’s brilliantly uncensored voice is back for a second collection to follow up Physical – now taking on the most disturbing aspects of adolescence.What we said: The overall sense is of an unobstructed exploration of an important subject. McMillan is writing not only see-through but see-beyond poetry.Read the full reviewFierce, playful and political, Parker’s poems celebrate the everyday just as they tackle ancestral hurt, attempting a poetic escape act to reclaim “the history of black people, adapted from white people”.What we said: At times bluntly declarative, but always holding history and the contemporary to account, Magical Negro meets prejudice with an unwavering eye.Read the full reviewYeh approaches identity as performance, from tragic tales of drag artists “living in an escape room no one has solved”, to a sinister silencing where “all the clocks are turned off and the mirrors  don’t work”.What we said: Yeh can evoke a feeling or concept with alarming exactitude, and, like the paintings of Kirsten Glass that inspire the title poem, she shows that the elegant and the macabre are never far apart.Read the full reviewIn a sequel to her bestselling debut Beautiful Broken Things, Barnard follows up on friends Caddy, Rosie and Suzanne as they part ways for university and independent life for the first time.

Four hours. Incongruous person sporting dark clothes, clenched teeth and sensible scarf, carrying notebook and noise-cancelling headphones? That’d be me.What’s the attraction of spending four hours partying on a boat travelling up and down the Thames, I ask a hen party guest wearing a pink stetson. “Great views. Booze. Dancing. Dressing up. What’s not to like?” I make my excuses and disembark before we cast off.The 111-year-old Viscount, whose many ordeals prior to this evening included rescuing British troops from Dunkirk, is among a growing number of vessels offering night-time revels on Britain’s rivers. Such “party boats” are a feature of many UK cities – York’s City Cruises specialises in hen parties on the River Ouse, complete with balloons, buffets and the chance to unleash your inner Beyoncé – but it is on the Thames that the rebranding of our waterways is most intense.Party boats are a common sight on the Thames – Martin Garside of the Port of London Authority says there are probably about 40 passenger boats in regular use on the tidal Thames in London for charter activities such as family celebrations, parties and corporate events.But these craft are about to be eclipsed by the biggest party boat Britain has ever seen, if a Dutch company has its way. It wants to reinstate Swan Lane Pier near London Bridge, once the home of the Regalia floating pub, to accommodate a mega-boat called the Ocean Diva.What does the Ocean Diva look like? Imagine, if you will, that Mariah Carey was a boat. And not just a boat, but a craft three storeys high and the length of a football pitch that was capable of hosting 1,500 passengers, with glitzy interiors, well-stocked bars, and lots of open deck space and dance floors. And a helipad. Of course.The company’s first two ships, the original Ocean Diva and the Futura, have already hosted dozens of river events in the Netherlands, Germany and Belgium. Now it wants to bring its lucrative business model to the heart of London.Edwin Petersen, chief executive, recently told the London Evening Standard: “I have always been surprised by the low quality of party boats on the Thames. What we will do is high-end corporate events, not just parties. Nobody does that on the Thames.” Petersen’s aim is that guests for the Ocean Diva will embark and disembark at Swan Lane Pier twice weekly, while the boat’s permanent mooring will be at east London’s Royal Docks.The Ocean Diva’s website suggests it will give “every customer a unique and unforgettable experience”, be that “dinner on the outside deck, while enjoying the skyline of your own city” or creating “an inspiring and immersive brand event”.However the prospect of the Ocean Diva getting a central London berth has outraged many local residents. Amir Eden, chair of the Living Bankside group, which represents over 13,000 residents along the river from the Oxo Tower to City Hall, says the boat’s presence would be detrimental to both people and river: “It will ruin views for thousands of people when it’s moored. It will be a real eyesore blocking views for thousands of people when it’s stationary and a safety risk when it’s afloat.”He also calls it a “bitter coincidence” that the new boat is planned to arrive near the 30th anniversary of the sinking of the Marchioness pleasure steamer, which was hit by a dredger on 20 August 1989, leading to the death of 51 people. The collision happened between Cannon Street and Southwark bridges – not far from Swan Lane.Eden is also worried about Ocean Diva’s evacuation plans: “We know from the London Bridge attacks how hard it is to clear an area near the Thames in an emergency fast when there are so many tourists and people going out for the evening. How difficult will it be for 1,500 people to disembark in an emergency on to an already congested foreshore?”All passenger ships operating on UK inland waterways are required to be certified by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency and have to meet strict safety standards.Objections have also been raised from everyone from the Church of England, which said the increase in party boats “has had a detrimental effect upon the life of the communities around the river”, to the Environment Agency, which said the new pontoon would destroy bird habitats and contribute to erosion, and that dredging work would release high levels of contamination from the sediment into the water.Bradley L Garrett, a cultural and social geographer, and author of Explore Everything: Place-Hacking the City, goes further. He argues that the Ocean Diva plan marks a new and unprecedentedly dismal turn in the commercial exploitation of London’s public spaces, and says it would see the city follow the likes of the Netherlands in “turning working rivers into amusement parks for drunks”.“Anyone who has visited Amsterdam has seen the effects of the rampant privatisation of a city’s waterways,” Garrett says. “When I was there a few months ago, you could almost walk across the canals on the private tour boats. It came as little surprise that this proposal for a 282-foot floating nightclub came from a Dutch company.“If this proposal is approved, the gaudy architectural turn that the city has taken in recent years will not only be reflected in the Thames, it will be moved on to it. Why don’t they just turn Tower Bridge into a nightclub too, while they’re at it?” Garrett has previously argued that the public spaces of London were being sold to corporations – in the biggest sell-off of common space since the enclosures of the 17th and 18th century.Many British cities’ public spaces, he contended, were becoming pseudo-public spaces – large squares, parks and thoroughfares that appear to be public but are actually owned and controlled by developers and their private backers, as local authorities argue they cannot afford to create or maintain such spaces themselves.The fear now is that the Thames is poised to be similarly plundered. “It’s a public asset, something for everybody, but we worry that it will effectively become privatised by the arrival of the Ocean Diva,” says Eden. “We’re not nimbys at Living Bankside. We’re fighting against Ocean Diva for all Londoners.”“The Thames foreshore has been an important public space offering counter-balance to the rampant privatisation of the South Bank,” says Garrett. “If this proposal goes through, the tiny slice of public space could be squeezed between shore development and a three-deck party boat the size of a football pitch cruising back and forth.”Greg Lawson, the chief executive of Smart Group, which wants to operate Ocean Diva in London, has sought to allay residents’ fears. “London is still the business hub of Europe and a major tourist destination and we are confident that despite these times of uncertainty the vessel will be very popular,” he told the .“We are totally cognisant that we must operate without causing local difficulties. The acoustics are fantastic and the design means that we are able to operate with very little sound escaping from inside the vessel. It is designed to work on the Thames without causing problems to local residents.”Documents submitted with the planning application state events would start between 6.30 and 7pm and end at 1am, and that noise would be “well contained within the boat”, and the boat’s owners recently announced the Ocean Diva will have a hybrid engine, thus reducing pollution and noise. Lawson of Smart Group says it will be “the first ship in London to be carbon-neutral and to clean and recycle all water on board, with zero waste going into the Thames”.On the other hand, the planning process is still under way. The application to reinstate Swan Lane Pier will be considered by the City of London Corporation’s planning and transportation committee this month. If it gets the go-ahead, then the Port of London Authority will consider the plan and look to make a decision on whether to grant the project a river works licence this summer. Then the plan will be referred to Khan and he will have a two-week window to make a decision.So far, the authority has received 10 objections from members of the public to the plan, the mayor’s office claims to have received no comments either for or against, and the City of London has received nearly 70 objections to the Ocean Diva mooring at the pier.What are our urban waterways for now London’s docks are dead and we live in a post-industrial, post-containerisation age? Eden argues that the Thames is London’s biggest public space and needs protecting: “It’s a public asset, free for the people, just like any commons, just like any public good. I suppose if you look at it another way, it’s London’s biggest unexploited asset, ripe for the taking.

Or take cheap shots about how they’re so crap that they’ve rehabilitated the Lib Dems, like a political version of a frat-boy wingman deliberately making themselves look rubbish in order to let Vince Cable look “bang-worthy”. Or mock the fact that the new party is now called – and I’m not even remotely kidding, Continuity Change UK – like a kids’ rock band thinking it’s cool to name themselves Hot Ice.But this split isn’t anything to be happy or smug about. It’s especially not a time for gloating from other parties. Laughing at Change UK from a position of being affiliated with another party at the moment is like a trouserless clown laughing at a second clown because their trousers fell down. Nobody is coming out of this looking dignified.Mocking a party that’s already a fragment for fragmenting again isn’t going to unfuck the dire political situation we’re in.Shortly after the party forms, former Labour MP Angela Smith is heavily criticised for referring to people from minority backgrounds as having a funny tingeAfter renaming itself Change UK, the party gets into a row with petition site Change.org, who release a statement warning it will be seeking guidance over the imitation of its brandTwo election candidates are forced to resign within 24 hours of each other after offensive tweets emerge, including Joseph Russo, the party\u0027s top Scotland candidate, writing \u0027black women scare me\u0027Lead Scottish candidate defects to the Lib Dems a week before European electionsMP Joan Ryan implores the audience at the party\u0027s Bath rally to look at their palms: \u0027It\u0027s there, the future is in your hands\u0027In the week before the European parliamentary elections it emerges that Change UK spent £87,000 on Facebook adverts, becoming the\u0026nbspbiggest single political advertiser on Facebook - including spending at least £1,300 promoting Facebook adverts saying it was campaigning to \u0027remain in the UK\u0027Six of Change UK’s 11 MPs, including its spokesman\u0026nbspChuka Umunna\u0026nbspand interim leader Heidi Allen, abandon the fledgling party. Former Conservative business minister and anti-Brexit campaigner Anna Soubry becomes leader.And the party that had more names than it did months, funny though that objectively is, did start from a position of principle. Whether you agree with it or not, their decision to leave both parties was a bold move, and you have to respect them at least a tiny bit for that.But it did sort of go downhill from there. For people who thought they were going to save us from Brexit, these months must have been like watching a version of Star Wars where Luke shows up to fight and finally defeat Vader only to watch him slip, accidentally shit himself, and then run away from the fight desperately trying mop up the mess with a spare Ewok while blurting out embarrassing secrets.Let’s take a look at some of their highlights and over-analyse where they might have gone wrong.Fair play, they said they were going to do it differently, and they did. Most parties standing on the platform of being anti-racist would probably leave it a few weeks before doing a racism. This bunch of spritely young go-getters knocked that it of the park on day one, when Angela Smith appeared to refer to people from BAME backgrounds as having a “funny tinge” just two hours after the new, non-racist party officially launched.Granted, in the era of Johnson and Trump, this is positively governmental.With strong competition, the most cringeworthy moment came when Joan Ryan MP asked a rally of adults to look at their hands.“You’re really good, you’re doing that ever so well,” she told them, complimenting the way, to reiterate, a crowd of grown adults were looking at their own hands. “That’s the best I’ve seen it done, brilliant.”Five centrists in the audience are believed to have cringed to death.What every new party needs is brand recognition. Labour has the rose, Tories have the tree. Ukip has a lion that looks like it’s overcome with worry that the more xenophobic Ukip members will find out that as a lion he’s not as “from Kent”, as he implied on his CV.Change UK commissioned designers and eventually thought: “Yep, what we need is a big barcode. When people think of CHUK I want them subconsciously thinking of how much of a ball-ache it is to scan stuff in Tesco.”When it comes to names, quantity has never been a problem for Change UK, originally called The Independent Group (TIG), aka the Tiggers.Keen to avoid the accusation that the whole thing was an ego project, it quickly got changed to Change UK or CHUK, which by wild coincidence is the first four-fifths of Chuka Umuna’s first name.Problems not over, the petition site Change.org sought legal guidance, believing that the name was too similar to its own and infringed on its brand. This was sort of backed up a bit when Anna Soubry accidentally (and passionately) announced “we call ourselves change.org” when she announced the new name to the House of Commons.The surviving members of the split have saved the situation by renaming themselves Continuity Change UK (CCUK), clearly wanting their first act as a renewed political party to be a bitter fight for a name with a charity, say Crohn’s and Colitis UK who also go by the acronym of CCUK.Due to constant name changes, they had trouble keeping up with their own admin. When they changed their Twitter handle, their old handle got hijacked by a pro-Brexit group that tweeted out messages like “I’d like to apologise to the British people for the absolute fucking state of me and my views” under pictures of Soubry’s face.On a big list of political no-nos, telling people to vote for a party other than your own is up there with (allegedly) recording a pee tape in Russia, but that’s what Change UK did during the first election it ever fought.One MP spent the last week in the run-up to the EU elections spreading a message to the effect of “Hi, I’m Heidi Allen of the Independent Group or Change UK, or whatever the shit we’re calling ourselves these days. Anyway, as I was saying, please vote Lib Dem.”Though it was probably the right move for the remain cause during the EU elections, campaigning for a different party isn’t great for party cohesion and was one of the reasons that seems to have caused the split.Unfortunately, analysis shows that if they hadn’t existed at all, maybe remain parties would have got another crucial seat. Their main problem, if they want to achieve the goal of remaining in the EU, may just be one of existing in the first place – rather than skipping to the part where they regenerate into Lib Dems.• James Felton is a TV and radio comedy writer"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dadd09a476cda922ada30f3c687da71c3b1a415a/0_293_4680_2808/master/4680.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dc1d5a124ce4f123def57bd602e22ee4","title":"madonna age music female singers","story":"Like many female artists, the singer has to put up with constant references to how old she is. It’s a double standardMusic critics tend not to pass comment on a musician’s appearance – to do so would undermine the seriousness of their endeavour. But the assessments of Madonna’s 14th album, Madame X, have nonetheless brought more subtle kind of disparagement. “Perhaps the erstwhile Queen of Pop should be content with the role of Queen Mother of Pop now,” said the Daily ’s critic, going on to note that a woman who has shifted 350m units and broken every record for a female artist going hasn’t had a Top 10 hit in a decade. Even in the ’s review, which was mostly positive, the theme of her age was never far away.Madonna is not alone in being seen through the prism of age. In 2014, looking ahead to Kate Bush’s live shows at Hammersmith Apollo, a (male) critic at the Independent cringed at the idea that she might start dancing. “However beneficial any yoga regime she might follow,” he said, “it’s simply unbecoming for a woman of a certain age to be prancing about, and certainly not in the leotard and leg-warmers of the 1979 shows.”In fighting to do her job at 60, Madonna is, as ever, blazing a trail. Do we really think that Beyoncé, Lady Gaga and Taylor Swift will simply down tools when they reach 45 and take up knitting? The fact she is still annoying people by doing the job she has been doing for 35 years would suggest she’s a long way from being irrelevant. In the minds of her most vicious detractors – the ones that jeered with hilarity as “grandma” fell off the stage at the 2015 Brits – she would be better off binning the fishnets, putting on a nice cardie and waiting for death.Even the more moderate language used in relation to her is revealing. “Dignity” crops up a lot, as does “appropriate” and “growing old gracefully”. When men talk about women ageing gracefully, they are not acting out of concern. They’re telling them to know their station, to sit down and shut up. “People have always been trying to silence me for one reason or another, whether it’s that I’m not pretty enough, I don’t sing well enough, I’m not talented enough, I’m not married enough – and now it’s that I’m not young enough,” Madonna told Vogue recently. “Now I’m being punished for turning 60.”Tracey Thorn, the Everything but the Girl singer-turned-solo artist and author, last year shared her objections to being described as “a 55-year-old wife and mother” in a review by the American music writer Robert Christgau. “The more I think about it the crosser I’m getting,” she said on Twitter. “‘55-year-old husband and father.’ I’m trying to imagine it as a description in an album review. Nope. Can’t do it.” I have no right to throw stones here. In 2003 I interviewed Siouxsie Sioux, an artist I’d admired for as long as I could remember. Near the end of our chat I asked blithely if musical retirement was on the cards. She was 45. She gave me a proper bollocking, and pointed out – rightly – that I would never have asked a man that question.Ultimately it all boils down to what society deems alluring and acceptable. Older men, with their silver hair and laughter lines, are seen as stately and wise. Women of the same age are past it and embarrassing. Today, Iggy Pop (72) gets to run around shirtless during live performances. Nick Cave (61) dyes his hair and wears his shirts slashed to the waist Elton John (72), who this year spoils us with a film, a memoir and a farewell tour, gads about in shades and diamante-encrusted suits. What links them, beyond their occupation, is that they get to decide how they conduct themselves and, crucially, when they stop working. And they get to do this without fear of criticism or vitriol.

That will no longer apply, but larger firms will only be authorised in areas that are more “exposed, more remote, deep-water locations with strong tides”, said Sepa.Deeper open seas should lead to their waste – medicines and chemicals used to control disease and lice, fish faeces, and uneaten food – being much more quickly dispersed and less likely to pollute the seabed. However, deep sea sites are at much greater risk of storm damage and of bad weather preventing visits by fish farm workers.Fergus Ewing, the Scottish rural affairs minister, told Holyrood on Wednesday he would introduce legislation next year that would require fish farms to report sea lice levels every week, and for those figures to be published.At the same time, the trigger for reporting sea lice incidents will be progressively lowered, first from three lice per fish down to an average of two, with the trigger for enforcement action falling from eight lice per fish down to four.This would allow earlier intervention and enforcement action, Ewing said. “These new measures signal a major shift from self- to statutory regulation,” he told MSPs.Conservationists and anglers say fish farms act as factories for sea lice, which in turn feed on wild Atlantic salmon swimming past, with many calling for a ban on new farms. The number of wild salmon caught by Scottish anglers last year plunged to the lowest in 70 years.The Scottish salmon farming industry, which is largely owned by Norwegian multi-national companies who are under investigation by the European commission for alleged price fixing, want to double production by 2030, by up to 400,000 tonnes.Holyrood’s environment committee warned last year that goal would be “unsustainable and may cause irrecoverable damage to the environment” unless pollution and parasite controls significantly improved.Mark Ruskell, the Scottish Green party’s environment spokesman, called for an urgent review of existing fish farms to make sure they met Sepa’s new standards, with greater emphasis on animal welfare.“There are real fears that the industry’s plans to double annual production will cause needless suffering to millions of fish,” he said.Julie Hesketh-Laird, chief executive of the Scottish Salmon Producers Organisation, said the new Sepa policy would help much larger farms develop in deeper waters but admitted to fears inshore that farms could be forced out.“However, the SSPO is also adamant that no farm that is performing well in an inshore location should be forced to move to a deeper, offshore site. The new regime should be flexible enough to accommodate best practice everywhere,” she added."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b8462e1f971b2a45ad91e328e152e0197734241a/0_128_4337_2602/master/4337.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9a81cab9d58b739e7f41218340897e1d","title":"wranglers new denim process eliminates water waste dye","story":"The US jeans brand has been working on the Indigood technology for the past decadeDenim manufacturing doesn’t have a good reputation when it comes to creating excessive levels of waste, but an innovative process spearheaded by the US jeans brand Wrangler may change that.The company has partnered with Texas Tech University (TTU) and the Valencia-based fabric mill Tejidos Royo to create a foam-dyed, water-free process, eliminating the waste generated from the traditional dyeing processes.To put this in perspective, the usual way to dye denim that traditional James Dean blue uses a repetitive dip-and-dry method to transfer indigo on to yarn. Multiple vats of water – up to 12, each containing thousands of litres of water – are used and then discarded. By the time they reach a shop, one pair of jeans can have used gallons of water.Under the new process, Indigood, foam that is created from a chemical-free soap agent will transfer indigo dye on to yarns in an oxygen-deprived environment sealed by a nitrogen hood.“Sustainability is a journey to making improvement – you can have a small initiative that is seen as a key priority,” he says.While initially used for the brand’s autumnwinter 2019 Icons collection, priced between £80 and £130, the technology will be rolled out across the brand’s cheaper ranges so that “sustainable products aren’t a choice between basic needs and doing the right thing”, says Atwood. There are also plans for Lee Jeans, also owned by Kontoor, to release Indigood collections later this year.The announcement comes as the fashion industry is having a major reassessment of processes throughout the often complex supply chain after intense scrutiny of past exploitation and polluting practices. Atwood says that Wrangler conforms to the “buy less, buy better” school of thought. “We will have to clothe ourselves, but at the same time be mindful of how we do that,” he says.“The fashion industry must do far more to reduce its huge environmental impact – which includes vast water usage and chemical and micro​-​plastic pollution,” says Emma Priestland, a Friends of the Earth campaigner. “Innovation and new technology have an important role to play – and it’s encouraging to see a number of firms looking for ways to reduce their eco-footprint, but we also need government intervention to ensure that the whole industry reduces its impact on the environment. We can all play our part too by rejecting the fast-fashion, throwaway culture and the damage, pollution and waste it causes.”Atwood says that “durability is by far the No 1 sustainable tenet” when it comes to being a retailer. “If you have a jean jacket for 30 years, that’s a real testament to its construction. If something blows out in eight months, it increases the need for continuous consumption. At the same time we have to mitigate the very real impacts happening up and down the supply chain.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/54cd66aea6c7f478505d734116f75bb9283f81dc/43_773_1835_1101/master/1835.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9c8f4f4d57db1751474a8b78bf62e523","title":"what to wear in june five looks for five days in pictures","story":"As we continue towards midsummer’s day, things can become a little sticky.

Transfer to a wire rack to cool.While cooling, make the buttercream. Cream together the butter and icing sugar until light and fluffy. Add milk to lighten the texture, and vanilla bean paste to flavour. Place a third of the batter in a separate bowl, and colour this yellow. Colour the larger amount of buttercream blue. Transfer the two colours to separate small piping bags, and cut a medium opening on both.Place both piping bags side by side in a larger piping bag, with a decorative nozzle tip attached.

Despite nobody involved, least of all its host – erstwhile Football Weekly stand-in Rob Curling – appearing to have any idea what on earth was going on in its Sphere, Palindrome, Star or About Turn games, the show ran for 239 episodes across eight series and all involved seemed to have a very nice time. More recently, in their own attempt to put an end to the kind of meaningless friendlies that have long been the scourge of international football, Uefa introduced its own similarly complicated competition and called it the Nations League. Since its inception last year, England have played four games and advanced to this week’s finals and now stand on the brink of winning their first trophy since 1966 without, one suspects, many of their fans and possibly even players having even the foggiest idea why or how.Not that any of that matters as we approach the business end of the competition, as things couldn’t really be simpler. It’s semi-final time with Switzerland taking on Portugal in Porto on Wednesday, before England face the Netherlands in Guimaraes on Thursday, before Sunday’s final and third-place play-off.

Ronaldo scored his first international goal in that tournament, heading in a last-minute consolation in a 2-1 defeat to eventual winners Greece in the group stage. Ronaldo is now 34, a reigning European champion, the country’s most capped player and their all-time leading goalscorer. If he lines up alongside João Félix this week, he will also have the perfect view of another promising 19-year-old making a big entrance at a tournament on home soil.Portugal are the the bookmakers’ favourites to win the Nations League. They have home advantage – and Ronaldo – but they also have an exciting crop of young players. Bernardo Silva, still just 24, has emerged as a genuine world class talent and he will carry the hopes of a nation in the years to come, but Félix is the hot property of Portuguese football right now.The teenager has been given his first call-up to the national side after a stunning breakthrough campaign with Primeira Liga champions Benfica. He scored 15 goals and registered seven assists in 26 league appearances this season, with a direct hand in a goal every 80 minutes ensuring he has become one of the most sought after youngsters in Europe.Kevin Mbabu is also preparing to take over from a veteran of international football. The right-back has the far more favourable task of replacing 35-year-old Stephan Lichtsteiner, who has been dropped from the national team after he was released by Arsenal. Lichtsteiner had a pretty dismal season, but Mbabu is on the up. He has already made an £8m move from Young Boys to Wolfsburg this summer and he could prove a steal at that price.The 24-year-old started two of Switzerland’s four group games in the Nations League – a 6-0 thrashing of Iceland and a 5-2 win over Belgium – and he looks set to be a regular fixture at full-back. He also performed admirably for Young Boys against strong opposition in the Champions League this season, completing twice as many chances as any of his teammates (12 in five appearances). His attacking endeavour down the flank will be pivotal if Switzerland are to pull off an upset against Portugal.Donny van de Beek did not begin the season as a guaranteed starter for Ajax but he ended it as a mainstay in a side that thrilled Europe and regained their Ereisie crown. The 22-year-old has been used sparingly by Ronald Koeman to date but could be an important player for the Dutch this week, with Champions League winner Georginio Wijnaldum only linking up with the squad late on Monday night.Van de Beek will most likely be competing with the Liverpool player for the No 8 role in the Netherlands’ 4-3-3 formation, playing a key role in breaking the lines and finding pockets of space in the final third. Van de Beek did that for Ajax over the course of the season, scoring 16 goals for the club en route to a domestic double and Champions League semi-final.He also used his intelligent movement and vision to pick up 10 assists in the league, meaning he had a direct hand in a goal every 128.5 minutes. It helps that Van de Beek has developed an understanding with Frenkie de Jong at Ajax. De Jong is off to Barcelona after the Nations League and Van de Beek may soon follows his teammate in making his own big move.Given that Jordan Henderson, Dele Alli and Eric Dier have also joined up with the squad late following the Champions League final – and Harry Winks was not called up given the timing of the game in Madrid – Rice could be crucial to England’s prospects this week. Up against a Netherlands side that move the ball quickly through midfield, the West Ham youngster has an important role in breaking up play.The 20-year-old did this superbly for the Hammers this season, with his timing in the tackle very impressive. He committed just 17 fouls in the whole campaign, despite ranking among the top 10 players in the Premier League for tackles (98).• Visit WhoScored for more statistics and ratings• Follow WhoScored on Twitter and Facebook• Follow Martin Laurence on Twitter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/141bea0fc8da43b694b6c8dcfea87d7e5eb0ea49/72_0_2941_1765/master/2941.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a443b9aab46136e1e4981daa3bdc7fa3","title":"the internet of things the importance of staying connected","story":"We expect our electricity to be in constant working order but, in an era when demand for digital connectivity is at an all-time high, why don’t we require the same service from our wifi connection? Have you ever had to wait for a much-needed cup of tea because your mug needed an update first? During the interminable minutes while said update downloads, installs, and reboots itself, you have plenty of time to think about what our future homes will look like.Like it or not, most people’s houses are already full of internet-connected devices, and the number is only going to rise. In a few years, your washing machine will talk to your air quality sensor to find out the weather, then automatically switch on the drying cycle because it’s raining outside, before WhatsApping you to let you know your clothes are ready (and you just know it’ll use a load of emojis because some guy in the marketing office thought it was cool).The internet of things (IoT) is pretty good for all of us when it works. It means your devices can talk to each other – and you – to keep your home running just the way you like it. Until the wifi goes down, at which point you wonder what was so wrong with good old-fashioned light switches while you sit in the dark.As our knick-knacks get ever more connected, stable wifi is going to become as important as electricity. But while power cuts are blessedly rare, wifi outages are much more common, and we even put up with parts of our homes having no signal. Can you imagine saying: “Oh sorry, that room doesn’t have electricity”? So why is it OK when it comes to wifi?Neil Illingworth, head of innovation at Virgin Media, reckons things can only get smarter. “Our homes are filling with more and more connected devices such as smart lightbulbs, thermostats, speakers, smoke alarms, movement sensors, vacuum cleaners, and a whole lot more in the near future.”Of course, every internet-connected device is another thing that won’t work if the wifi fails, as Illingworth explains: “It’s not just humans who enjoy good wifi speeds, our devices like them, too.” It’s bad enough having to call a locksmith, but ignoring the peals of laughter down the phone when you try to explain you’re locked out because the wifi is down isn’t anyone’s idea of a good time.One upside of the rampant technological progress we’re experiencing at the moment, though, is Intelligent WiFi. Rather than requiring technical knowhow or multiple phone calls, Virgin Media’s new product is a home wifi network that fixes itself.Combining the Hub 3 router, Virgin Media Connect app and artificial intelligence of the non-scary type, Intelligent WiFi constantly scans your home internet to find areas with interference, and frequencies that your devices are connected to. Whenever it finds something that’s less than perfect, it automatically adjusts the settings to bring it up to speed – literally.While you won’t be interrupted by the daily tweaks Intelligent WiFi makes to your network, you’ll definitely notice the overall effect: a smart home running smoothly. So this means we’re on the road to the end of weak signals and blackspots around the home, inexplicitly slow loading times, or greedy devices hogging all the data.Intelligent WiFi oversees every last gizmo, making sure they not only get the signal they need, but that no device is left behind. You can even go in to the Connect app and see all the devices using the wifi, and pause inidual gadgets if you want to – such as when the kids are playing Xbox when they’re supposed to be doing homework.While you’re in the Connect app, you can also easily share your wifi details with friends who’ve come over for a cuppa and a chat. Do make sure you have a few non-smart mugs in the house, though – just in case of an apocalypse …Looking for faster connectivity? Or just fed up of losing connection halfway through your favourite TV series?

Writer Sarah Pyper shares some handy tips and the best apps to help you stay on top of everythingLike 4.2m others in the UK – and a further 1.8m who’d like to – I often work from home. Once a euphemism for staying in bed and watching hours of daytime TV, working from home is now an everyday occurrence for those developing businesses, working flexible hours around the care of loved ones, or just avoiding spending time jammed into the armpits of their fellow commuters. All you need is a laptop, a reliable wifi connection and you’re set.But if you don’t have reliable wifi, it doesn’t matter how organised you are, how snazzy your tech is, or which shiny new game you’ve got to occupy your kids with, it will all fall apart. Thick walls, mirrors and even windows can create wifi blackspots that turn your home-working dream into a nightmare. However, Virgin Media’s new Intelligent WiFi with Hub 3, WiFi boosters and Connect app can be relied on to save the day. While the Intelligent WiFi system is designed to deliver the best wifi signal across your home, the Connect app also allows you to pause specific devices – which comes in particularly handy when you need to put the kids to bed.As someone who juggles writing and editing with social media side projects and caring for two children, my home isn’t just my castle, it’s my office, my gym, my laundry and my sanctuary – so I rely on home tech and some key apps to get it all done.Digital helpWith digital assistants such as Amazon’s Alexa, Google’s Assistant or Apple’s Siri, you can delegate domestic tasks while you work. They can turn up your heating, adjust the lighting using smart bulbs, feed your pet with devices such as Feed and go Smart Pet Feeder, or control a video doorbell such as Nest Hello so you don’t have to get up to see who’s interrupting you. If it’s time for a break, your smart kettle can start making a cuppa, while your smart toaster warms a slice. Even better, you can link your assistant to a robot vacuum cleaner such as Roomba to clean your carpet, or iRobot Braava, which will mop your floor, meaning you can ace your deadlines and complete your chores at the same time.Keep the kids occupiedA bored child trying to join in your conference call, especially at a tricky moment, has the potential to shatter that illusion of professionalism you’ve been carefully cultivating– just ask Prof Robert Kelly, whose four-year-old daughter interrupted a live TV interview with BBC News. My deadlines and reputation have often been saved by a well-timed gaming app for the kids. Minecraft is a long-time family favourite where you can build entire worlds, and Roblox sees the kids connecting with their friends in a bid to run a pizza parlour, adopt a baby or take care of a pet kitten. If emergency strikes, relinquish your phone and let them take selfies with special effects filters until you’re done. Works every single time.Seek inspirationWhen I need to feel more productive, I listen to the How I Built This podcast’s interviews with successful business owners such as Bobbi Brown for inspiration. Or, for a quick energy boost, the 7 Minute Workout app gets you moving with a set of 30-second exercises. If all else fails, ask Siri to play an upbeat playlist on Spotify at top volume, and thank your lucky stars you’re not in a communal office.Beat the working-from-home bluesThe downsides of working at home can be the domestic distractions (the kettle needs descaling) and feeling isolated (there are only so many conversations you can have with the cat). If things get a little quiet, I switch on Coffitivity or Noisli, which provide background noise so you can pretend you’re strolling through woodland or a Parisian street while you sort out your accounts. To avoid procrastination, I turn to Forest or Tomato Timer. Plant a virtual tree on Forest and it will grow – but only as long as you focus on your work and don’t check any other apps. Tomato Timer helps you follow the Pomodoro Technique where you work intensely for 25 minutes then take a five-minute break when you’ve finished your task.Looking for faster connectivity?

But Hutchinson said her remarks were indefensible and refused to “provide a stage for these vile people”.He tweeted: “Took no time in immediately cancelling her planned ‘evening with’ event at one of our Selladoor venues.”He told the Stage that the show was booked before Widdecombe announced she would stand as an MEP for the Brexit party.He said: “Following her disgusting gay therapy comments over the weekend, my programming team and I immediately decided to cancel the scheduled event as we flatly refuse to offer a stage to someone who wishes to promote such vile opinion.”He added: “We welcome everyone in the community to our theatres, and operate a fully inclusive and respectful approach to programming. We don’t seek to prevent discussions where there might be differences in opinion – but in this case, there is no discussion to be had. Ann’s comments are isive, disrespectful and foolishly ignorant.”Widdecombe has not commented since her widely criticised remarks on Sunday. She told Sky’s Sophy Ridge: “The fact that we think it is now quite impossible for people to switch sexuality doesn’t mean that science might not be able to produce an answer at some stage.”Hutchinson said statements like that “promote and fuel discrimination” and added: “We will not be complicit in providing a stage to air such views.”Widdecombe’s next performances of her one-woman show, Strictly Ann: An Evening With Ann Widdecombe, are due to go ahead in Lytham St Annes, Lancashire, next Tuesday and in Altrincham next Wednesday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1da0c714ea4e7e5396141d11ae5db047f95befdb/0_165_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=894a3282a04735df983f445958306ff4","title":"scientists reveal secrets of dragonfishs invisible fangs","story":"Deep-sea creature’s teeth are made of similar material to ours, but heavily adapted for stealthThe dragonfish, a dweller of the dark ocean depths, would slot nicely into any horror movie, with virtually transparent fangs and bioluminescent barbel that help it thrive in its extreme environment.The nature of its teeth had been a mystery until Wednesday, when scientists revealed they are made of the same basic material as human teeth but with a different microscopic structure.The researchers studied the dragonfish species called Aristostomias scintillans, which is caught at depths of up to 1,000 metres (3,000 ft) off the Californian coast and can grow to 25 cm (10 in) in length.It has a black, elongated body, with a long, fleshy filament called a barbel hanging from its lower jaw with a bioluminescent organ called a photophore on the end to lure prey. It also has two rows of photophores along the length of its body. Its long, sharp teeth are big relative to its body size. Its teeth, like ours, are made up of an outer layer of enamel and an inner layer of dense bony tissue called dentine, but there are nanoscale crystals in the enamel that prevent any light that exists in the near blackness from reflecting off the tooth surface.“Thus, the mouth is invisible and the prey is caught more easily,” said materials scientist Marc André Meyers of the University of California, San Diego, who led the research published in the journal Matter.“Initially, we thought the teeth were made of another, unknown material,. However, we discovered that they are made of the same materials as our human teeth: hydroxyapatite and collagen,” he said.“However, their organisation is significantly different from that of other fish and mammals. This was a surprise for us: same building blocks, different scales and hierarchies. Nature is amazing in its ingeniosity.”A small number of other fish such as the anglerfish and hatchetfish have transparent teeth. “These have not been investigated yet, but I suspect they have a similar structure,” Meyers said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1f2d1c335016bf07a8b4dd619dc0e232223b16a8/0_174_2987_1793/master/2987.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5b9d83d66a5b8affa6bce01090a63be3","title":"bangladesh v new zealand cricket world cup 2019 live","story":"I’m not sure the other match is much of a thriller, with India basically needing a run a ball off the last 60 with plenty of wickets in hand, but it has certainly had its moments. We’ll see if this one earns that status, but fingers crossed.Hello world! It’s 13 years since a team successfully defended a score below 300 at the Oval, and 244 is quite a long way below 300. Add No2, No9 and No13 in the ODI batting rankings, and it is clear which team will be the most chuffed at this point. A neutral, I think, always quite likes a first-innings total which can only win the game if the team commits fully to attacking when it’s their turn to bowl. The signposts are clear, and all directions lead to fun.That’s all from me. It’s over to Simon Burnton to guide you gently through the New Zealand innings. Direct your emails to him here, or tweet @Simon_Burnton. This is about The Other Sport, but Ben Fisher has written about the Bangladesh football team, and the Englishman in charge of them. Ah, the old cardinal sin of not batting out the overs. Might be slightly harsh to blame Bangladesh too much for all of that, because New Zealand were absolutely terrific with the ball, particularly Santner, Ferguson in spells and Boult. You’d expect them to knock these off, but it will be interesting to see how they cope with the extra spin options from Bangladesh. Shaifuddin, knowing he has five balls to swing from his toes and get this total up, does indeed swing from those toes but alas misses the ball entirely, and he’s knocked over. Boult had spent the time between over frantically waving at his captain and bowler asking where he needed to be, but found exactly the right spot eventually, pouching down at third man after Mortaza gets a big, thick outside edge up in the air. 49th over: Bangladesh 244-8 (Shaifuddin 29, Mortaza 1) Boult tries another slowie but gets it wrong, and it flicks off Shaifuddin’s knees and down for four leg-byes. He then tries a yorker, gets it absolutely right but Shaifuddin digs it out and it deflects down for another boundary to the same spot. Mehidy tries to come down the track, Boult drops one short and at his body, he swings himself off his toes trying for a big hook, but gets a faint nick through to the keeper. 48th over: Bangladesh 235-7 (Shaifuddin 25, Mehidy 7) Henry is on to bowl. The batsmen scamper through for a couple of twos, Mehidy tries to get funky by stepping about three feet outside off stump and clipping one to short fine-leg, Shaifuddin slaps one to point but they can’t get the boundaries they badly need at this stage. 47th over: Bangladesh 228-7 (Shaifuddin 24, Mehidy 2) A series of leg-glanced singles completes the over from Boult. Five runs from it in total, which isn’t enough, you’d imagine. Here’s Trent Boult, who has two overs left in the bank. Mosaddek tries to hit him over the Thames, but sends it vertical and Guptill settles ‘neath it and takes the catch in the calm manner of someone you’d trust to catch your baby if you had to throw it from a burning building. 46th over: Bangladesh 223-6 (Mosaddek 11, Shaifuddin 21) Ferguson mixes up his pace, some quick ones and a slower ball bouncer, but Shaifuddin takes one of them downtown, a big slap over cow corner for four. They’re starting to get a wriggle on now, but you suspect it’s too little, too late. 45th over: Bangladesh 215-6 (Mosaddek 9, Shaifuddin 16) Having survived the review, Shaifuddin celebrates by sticking the last ball of Santner’s spell way over cow corner for six gratefully received runs. There was the featheriest of feather edges on the ball before it reached the pad, and in any case it was probably missing off stump. Santner’s in for his last over, and Shaifuddin takes a big hoik across the line, then goes down on one knee to try a fine sweep but misses. It hits the pad, the umpire says no lbw but the take it upstairs...44th over: Bangladesh 205-6 (Mosaddek 8, Shaifuddin 7) Ferguson takes the pace off one to Mosaddek, who jabs an edge just, just, just short of Latham behind the stumps. Another tight over though, three from it and Bangladesh’s expectations are dropping by the minute.43rd over: Bangladesh 202-6 (Mosaddek 7, Shaifuddin 5) Four runs for Shaifuddin and it’s thanks to a rare bit of iffy fielding, as he back cuts, Henry chases, reaches the ball but can only scoop it onto the boundary marker. Lovely bowling from Santner, who has got most of his success by angling things in on a tight line, but switches things up with a slower, looping, wide ball that Mahmudullah has to reach for, but can only toe-end the thing to Williamson in the covers. 42nd over: Bangladesh 195-5 (Mahmadullah 19, Mosaddek 6) Mahmadullah backs away and exposes his stumps to Ferguson, which is a bold strategy, and only gets a single from it, carved through the covers. Mosaddek tries the same and doesn’t even get one thanks to some spiffing fielding by Santner. 41st over: Bangladesh 192-5 (Mahmadullah 17, Mosaddek 5) Santner’s back, from the Vauxhall end this time when his previous seven overs had all been from the Pavilion. He gets a bit of turn and induces an edge, but an edge through a vacant slip region and Mosaddek picks up two. 40th over: Bangladesh 188-5 (Mahmadullah 14, Mosaddek 4) Bowling change, as Ferguson gets another blast. His first spell was terrific, his second ropey: which will we get here? The answer is lots of stuff outside off, and most of the shots are directed towards Guptill at point, which he broadly deals with, one smacking him rather painfully on the forearm. Just two runs from the over, though. 39th over: Bangladesh 186-5 (Mahmadullah 13, Mosaddek 3) They need to push things somehow here, and one option is to go for rapid singles. They do just that twice, possibly saved by a couple of just askew throws by Guptill. Just. 38th over: Bangladesh 182-5 (Mahmadullah 11, Mosaddek 1) Bit of a pickle for Bangladesh. They’ll be doing well to get 250 from here.Ooof: ugly. Mithun takes a step or two down the track, Henry sees him coming and bowls short, Mithun tries the hook anyway but sends it high, high into the south London air and de Grandhomme casually pouches the steepler. 37th over: Bangladesh 179-4 (Mithun 26, Mahmadullah 10) Boult keeps things relatively tight for three balls, then concedes a leg-bye, a wide, then Mithun plays the most delicate dab through what would have been about third slip for a boundary, then a less delicate hook that might have got more than a single had it been a yard or two wide of the fielder. A good over for Bangladesh, in the scheme of things. 35th over: Bangladesh 166-4 (Mithun 15, Mahmadullah 10) Oh look, it’s Trent Boult back into the attack, for the first time since the 10th over. Two runs from the over, exactly the same as the number of eyebrow-shaving bouncers that Boult sent down at serious pace. 34th over: Bangladesh 164-4 (Mithun 14, Mahmadullah 9) Tricky situation for Bangladesh here. They can’t really afford to take too many more risks, but equally they need to get the run rate above five, and it’s currently below. Three runs from that over, delivered by Santner. 33rd over: Bangladesh 161-4 (Mithun 13, Mahmadullah 7) If de Grandhomme was a club cricketer he’d probably be nicknamed ‘toothache’. His deliveries aren’t much more than dobbers, but they’re accurate dobbers and Bangladesh struggle to get them away, three runs this time, all to Mahmadullah. 32nd over: Bangladesh 158-4 (Mithun 13, Mahmadullah 4) Mahmadullah goes this close to chopping onto his stumps off Santner, but it misses. Another terrific over from the left-armer, who Bangladesh are finding very difficult to pick up. 31st over: Bangladesh 155-4 (Mithun 12, Mahmadullah 2) De Grandhomme looks a bit like a Hollywood leading man from the 50s, all broad shoulders and strong jaw and swept, black hair. Would Cary Grant be able to take a crucial wicket and concede a relatively economical four runs from an over at a crucial stage of the game? Not likely. Huge. De Grandhomme might have been lucky to stay on after his last over, but stay on he does and Shakib rocks back, tries to cut and feathers one through to Latham. He looks thoroughly vexed as he stalks off the field. 30th over: Bangladesh 151-3 (Shakib 64, Mithun 11) Santner back to the economical stuff as the batsmen nudge him around for three singles. This really is a terrific match: really good bowling and some excellent counter-attacking batting. 29th over: Bangladesh 148-3 (Shakib 62, Mithun 10) Ferguson is given the hook, de Grandhomme in his place, but he drops down a lovely gentle long hop that Shakib gives the treatment, out to deep mid-wicket. Another is slashed just - just - over short third man and Shakib is on a one-man mission to get this total up. He’s on 62 from 62 balls now, and the run rate is up above five. 28th over: Bangladesh 137-3 (Shakib 51, Mithun 10) Shakib does the seemingly implausible and gets Santner off the square, going to his half century with a cut that Ferguson dashes around to third man and keeps them to three. Seven runs from that Santner over, nearly double what they got from his previous three. 27th over: Bangladesh 130-3 (Shakib 46, Mithun 8) Ferguson hasn’t looked quite as spicy since returning: Shakib deals with him reasonably well, taking three simple runs before he sends three down Mithun’s leg side for wides, the last being a touch harsh given how far he’d stepped across his stumps. Mithun then gets every little bit of a pull and sends it flying to the square leg fence for a boundary. 26th over: Bangladesh 120-3 (Shakib 43, Mithun 4) More watertight bowling from Santner, the only runs being a dabbededged two by Mithun from his first ball. He’s conceded four runs from three overs. 25th over: Bangladesh 118-3 (Shakib 43, Mithun 2) With a new man in Williamson goes for the throat: probably quite literally, given the pace and lengths Ferguson has been bowling. BUT WAIT: Bangladesh actually deal with it pretty well, pushing some singles (which the batsmen almost run into each other completing) and then Shakib tickles a four off his hip, down to fine leg.His fastest has been 148.3 kph apparently, with an average of 143.6 - that’s about 9288 mph. Rapid. 24th over: Bangladesh 110-3 (Shakib 37, Mithun 0) Another terrific over from Santner, just two runs coming from it and the pressure from his bowling probably contributing to the ludicrous run-out. Oh boy. Mushfiqur pushes one between extra cover and point for what looks for a sharp but relatively straightforward single, but Shakib rather bafflingly decides against it, sends him back but far too late, and he’s not even in the frame as Latham completes the formalities from Guptill’s throw. 23rd over: Bangladesh 108-2 (Shakib 36, Mushfiqur 18) Neesham comes back for a second over, and it might well just be one more as Bangladesh - and in fairness have no choice here - target him. Shakib takes his first three balls for four, the first a pull in front of square and the other two slashes between deep point and third man. A wide, two singles and a two caps a Bangladesh’s best over of the match, 17 runs coming from it. 22nd over: Bangladesh 91-2 (Shakib 21, Mushfiqur 17) The Neesham Experiment lasted one over, and it’s a complete change of pace with Mitchell Santner’s left arm spin into the attack. There’s not much actual spin, but Santner’s angle from round the wicket and bounce from his height proves tricky to shift off the square. Shakib sets off for a single but is immediately sent from whence he came, and requires a little treatment after taking some skin off his elbow with the e that got him home safely. A maiden over is completed, a rare, rare thing these days, smart captaincy from KW. 21st over: Bangladesh 91-2 (Shakib 21, Mushfiqur 17) Now then. After a barren run Mushfiqur is getting the taste for it, wandering outside off stump to ramp de Grandhomme over the keeper’s head for four. Some singles, and a clip off Shakib’s pads for a couple means it’s nine from that over, meaning they have now scored more in the last two overs than they did in the previous five. 20th over: Bangladesh 82-2 (Shakib 18, Mushfiqur 11) Huh. A bowling change, which I wasn’t exactly expecting, as Jimmy Neesham replaces Ferguson. Maybe Williamson is keeping him fresh with short spells and bring him back for some wickets later, but there is a danger of relieving the pressure they’ve built up over the last few overs. And sure enough, Shakib spins on a long hop and sends it to the deep backward square boundary, topping up the three relatively straightforward singles they’d picked up earlier in the over.

After four dots, Dhoni cuts for two and pulls for one. India need 57 off the last ten, which should be a piece of cake for these two.Here’s Dave Brown. “I can totally understand why a player would choose money over their country of birth,” he says, “but it is their pretence of loyalty to their new home that gets me. KP having a Three Lions tattoo springs to mind. I’ve got an Eye of Horus tattoo but it doesn’t mean I’m a sodding pharaoh!!”39th over: India 168-3 (Sharma 97, Dhoni 14) Phehlukwayo concedes four singles. South Africa will insist on being respectable when they need to be explosive.Still, there’s a nice retweet from my colleague Ali Martin here.38th over: India 164-3 (Sharma 95, Dhoni 12) Now it’s no spin at all as Morris returns. His extra bounce makes Sharma think a bit, and a fuller ball brings an LBW shout against Dhoni, but du Plessis doesn’t review. Dhoni cashes in with a flick-pull for four.37th over: India 158-3 (Sharma 94, Dhoni 7) The spin-twin phase of the innings comes to an end as Faf brings back Phehlukwayo. Whether or not he bothers the batsmen, he will definitely slow down the OBO. After doing well to string together four dots, he tries a short one and Sharma sees it so early that his pull goes straight back past the bowler. Sharma has shown why he is the second-highest-scoring ODI batsman since the last World Cup, deferring only to Kohli.36th over: India 154-3 (Sharma 90, Dhoni 7) Shamsi pushes one through and gets it past Dhoni’s attempted cut.“South African here,” says Andrew Gladwin. Excellent. “I think the biggest factor in the decline is simply money – players with a choice (like KP) can make more money playing for England, and other can make more money (with more security) being Kolpak or playing in T20 leagues (AB de Villiers). Quotas have played some role, but possibly more in reinforcing money-based decisions. Poor administration of cricket in SA doesn’t help.“The fear is that we are going to end up with money driving India, Australia and England to be the only competitive nations, with clear second and third tiers below them. The hope is that this is a World Cup too far for a fading great generation of SA cricketers, as was 2003 –and that the nucleus of the next generation is there for another great SA cricket team – Markram, de Kock, Ngidi, Rabada.” The OBO at its best.35th over: India 150-3 (Sharma 88, Dhoni 5) Yet another over from Tahir, who concedes the regulation five. India’s 150 comes up off 207 balls. Slip sliding away.34th over: India 145-3 (Sharma 86, Dhoni 2) Seeing that his spinners have amassed no wickets in 13 overs betwen them, du Plessis decides to bowl them in tandem. Dhoni sends for his cap, giving us a better view of the flinty look on his face. Shamsi bowls a tidy over, for just two, but tidiness won’t get the tigers out of the corner.And now a word from our fashion editor. “I disagree with OB Jato about the kit,” says Damian Burns. “In fact all the teams seem to have gone for some kind of vintage throwback style (i.e. England 92 which looks horrible by the way), and they really don’t have the same razzmatazz as some of the usual ODI kits. Definitely wouldn’t spend fifty quid on any of these shirts.”33nd over: India 143-3 (Sharma 86, Dhoni 1) Tahir continues and I’m just thinking “well that’s one way to ensure we don’t get another wicket” when Dhoni and Sharma have a misunderstanding about a run. Both of them might have been out, had there not been another fumble in the field. Oh dear. Sharma celebrates with a late cut, so late that he almost pinches the ball out of de Kock’s gloves. India need 85 off 17, so still bang on five. South Africa need two quick wickets – these two.32nd over: India 139-3 (Sharma 83, Dhoni 0) A well-deserved wicket for Rabada, who is ready and raring to get at old man Dhoni. Dhoni has other ideas, making a point of fiddling and fidgeting, desperate to be the big guy in the room. He doesn’t need to do that. Playing from the crease, he sees off three balls, so that’s a wicket-maiden.Breakthrough at last! Rabada bowls what seems a fairly standard ball, seam-up, but Rahul gets his timing all wrong and pops a catch to Faf at mid-off. Is there still some life in this?31st over: India 139-2 (Sharma 83, Rahul 26) Tahir continues – why, I cannot tell you. Sharma celebrates by square-driving him for four and rubs it in with a couple of twos. Ten off the over.“At least,” says OB Jato, “the Proteas’ kit is one of the most beautiful I’ve ever seen. Aesthetic consolation?”30th over: India 128-2 (Sharma 73, Rahul 25) Now even Rabada is bearing gifts – a juicy short one, despatched by Sharma with a lordly pull.And here’s Gangesh. “Great to feast on your memes from England.” Er, thanks. “SA’s displays so far have been dismal. They have done little of note. Saddened, indeed. How is their decline to be explained? The quota system prevalent in sports there, or is it England playing the villain by poaching the cream of their talents? What is your take, gentlemen?” I’m going to throw that out in the hope that someone reading this knows more than me.29th over: India 123-2 (Sharma 69, Rahul 24) Sure enough, Shamsi comes off, but it’s Tahir who comes on. Maybe Faf thinks he can get wickets here just by keeping the runs down. But the Indians have other ideas: Rahul somehow plays a flick for three from the off bail to fine leg’s right, and Sharma cuts for four. India need 105 more from 21 overs, at the very straightforward rate of five. 28th over: India 115-2 (Sharma 64, Rahul 21) Rabada returns and instantly finds the edge as Rahul brings a crooked bat down from somewhere near his right shoulder. It flies to second slip, where ... there’s only empty space. Next ball, Rabada beats Sharma. He is in danger of putting in one of the great non-winning World Cup performances here. 27th over: India 113-2 (Sharma 63, Rahul 20) Every boundary counts today and now Shamsi hands one to Sharma, who swats a bit of filth off his legs to bring up the fifty partnership – 53 off 65 balls. To twist the knife, Sharma plays a delicate late cut for four more. Eleven off the over, and that’s surely the last we see of poor Shamsi. 26th over: India 102-2 (Sharma 54, Rahul 18) After that daisy-chain of dots, Morris bowls a wide, of all things, as a bouncer goes too high. By the end of the over, Morris is conceding a four, as a paddle-pull from Rahul races through Shamsi’s half-hearted attempt to stop it at long leg. India’s hundred came up off 155 balls, epitomising this episode of period drama.“After a pretty disheartening performance in the first innings,” says Richard Mansell, “at least SA are managing to make a decent fist of it now. The game is not yet out of our reach, although we need a wicket or two, and fast.” Spot-on.25th over: India 95-2 (Sharma 53, Rahul 13) Shamsi continues – it’s almost as if Faf isn’t reading the OBO. He concedes only three and has a minor moral victory as Sharma charges him, meets the ball on the full and miscues into the deep.24th over: India 91-2 (Sharma 50, Rahul 13) Morris has been even better in this spell than his first one. After tying down Rahul, he befuddles Sharma: an edge, a fend, another edge – held at first slip by Amla, but on the half-volley. That’s another maiden and the veteran Morris has the magnificently retro figures of 6-3-10-0.23rd over: India 91-2 (Sharma 50, Rahul 13) After a run of dots, Sharma gets fed up, dances down the track and lofts Shamsi over long-on for six. He then goes to fifty, off 70 balls, with a more sedate single: aftre a streaky start, he’s played very well. Faf needs to do something: get Shamsi off, bring Rabada back and post five slips, before it’s too late. Does the tiger know when it’s cornered?22nd over: India 82-2 (Sharma 43, Rahul 11) Phehlukwayo is taken off, after that wobbly fifth over, and Chris Morris returns. First ball back, he beats Rahul with a classic seamer’s delivery, holding its line outside off. And that’s a maiden.“With reference to Mr Fuller’s point (16th over),” says Gary Naylor, “What A Wonderful World... Cup.” Absolutely.21st over: India 82-2 (Sharma 43, Rahul 11) A few more singles off Shamsi. This partnership is worth 28 already, off 33 balls: purposeful stuff.“After watching the opening spells of Bumrah and Rabada,” says Abhu, “I don’t want to hear any more from old farts who think that fast bowling is dead’.” Fair point – it’s been a fast bowler’s World Cup so far.20th over: India 77-2 (Sharma 41, Rahul 9) Rahul sees a mere hint of a half-volley from Phehlukwayo and plays a straight drive for four. That’s the shot of the afternoon. Pulling his length back, Phehlukwayo offers Sharma a long hop. The Indians are beginning to cut loose.19th over: India 68-2 (Sharma 37, Rahul 4) Tahir does come off, but he gives way to another spinner, the left-arm wristie Tabraiz Shamsi. He makes a solid start. 18th over: India 65-2 (Sharma 35, Rahul 3) Phehlukwayo continues, and again he is comfortably pulled, this time by Sharma for two. But the Indians are having to work for nearly all of their runs. It’s been a fine performance by South Africa’s bowlers, with the ball as well as the bat.17th over: India 62-2 (Sharma 33, Rahul 2) Sharma grabs the wheel by pulling Tahir for four, first ball of the over, and then there are a few singles. The most interesting thing about Tahir’s spell has been that, at 40, he is older than the umpire – Michael Gough, who is 39. And that’s drinks, with India on top but not having it all their own way. 16th over: India 54-2 (Sharma 27, Rahul 0) Finally, a four from Kohli. Phehlukwayo drops short and Kohli sees it so early that he can pull on the front foot. That’s almost dismissive – but it leads to his dismissal, as Phehlukwayo, helped by de Kock, gets the wicket South Africa most wanted. He jumps for joy, as well he may.“With reference to the great Mr Armstrong,” says John Fuller (13th over), “a quick flurry of wickets and we’re looking at Hello Dhoni!” Let’s hope so.Goddim!! A rising ball outside off, an uncharacteristic waft, a thick edge, and a stunning catch by Quentin de Kock. Put that on the news.15th over: India 50-1 (Sharma 27, Kohli 14) Tahir continues, and Kohli brings out a hockey shot, whipping a push to mid-on. He’s warming to the task, and Tahir is only keeping it tight, not really threatening.“After Afghanistan and Sri Lanka yesterday and now this,” wonders Daniel Howell, “what happened to ‘the modern game favours the batsmen, no total is too high to chase’? Gower, Gooch, Stewart and co. would have been at home with these scores.” Very true.14th over: India 47-1 (Sharma 26, Kohli 12) Another moral victory for Phehlukwayo, who lures Kohli into a classic edge, only to see it elude the man at gully. Come on Faf, go for broke and give us the full cordon. You know Steve Waugh would. 13th over: India 44-1 (Sharma 25, Kohli 9) Five singles off Tahir. It’s still tense, but the pendulum is moving, like the hand of a clock, towards India.“All the time in the World Cup,” echoes Andrew Benton (9th over). “The great Louis Armstrong’s just missing Cup off the end...”12th over: India 39-1 (Sharma 23, Kohli 7) So, a good start from Phehlukwayo, another bowler who batted well today. But not quite good enough, and both batsmen are finding the singles.It was Phehlukwayo’s second ball, it was angled in, it was hitting the leg bail – umpire’s call, so Sharma escapes. The game could have done with a wicket there.11th over: India 34-1 (Sharma 21, Kohli 4) Tahir returns and concedes only two singles.10th over: India 34-1 (Sharma 21, Kohli 4) Kohli plays a Harrow cut! And nearly edges into leg stump. End of the powerplay, which was riveting.“Cricket,” says Andrew Benton firmly. “It’s a bowler’s game. Protect your wicket and you’re more than halfway there. Slogs for six and blasts for four make for popular telly, but the patience and skill of the bowlers makes the game, any game. And for that, there can surely be no contest.” Discuss!Something else to read here, about the only England team who have a 50-over World Cup win on their CVs.9th over: India 31-1 (Sharma 19, Kohli 3) Back to Morris v Kohli, to allow everyone to calm down. Five more dots, then a tuck for two in one of the gaps caused by having slips. Kohli knows that India have all the time in the World Cup. Faf knows he has to take early wickets.8th over: India 29-1 (Sharma 19, Kohli 1) Rabada produces another beauty to beat Sharma, who responds with a nonchalant six, just helping a bouncer on its way. Next ball, a simple forward prod goes for four through the vacant fourth slip. Another bouncer, more wayward, brings a spectacular goalkeeper’s save from de Kock. And then Sharma cuts for four more. Who needs Kohli?7th over: India 14-1 (Sharma 5, Kohli 1) Facing Morris, Kohli continues his YouTube demonstration of the forward-defensive, mixed in with the odd exaggerated leave. He has only one off ten balls, but he looks so alert, it’s alarming.6th over: India 14-1 (Sharma 5, Kohli 1) Kohli is greeted by three slips, quite rightly, and a bouncer from Rabada, to follow up his suggestion that Kohli was “immature”. The great man is standing outside his crease, as he did when he conquered English conditions last summer. He gets well forward and it gets him off the mark as he spots a quick single to mid-off. Rabada, though: he has figures of 3-0-3-1, and they don’t flatter him. Justice is done. Another textbook length ball from Rabada, and Dhawan can only feather it to the keeper. Three more like that and it’s game on. But here comes Kohli...5th over: India 13-0 (Dhawan 8, Sharma 5) Tidy from Morris. This, kids, is what one-day cricket used to be like. “If India can get past the new ball against Rabada and co,” says Rohit Singh, “they will back themselves for a comfortable win.” And his email was sent straight after the first over, before the seamers got going.4th over: India 11-0 (Dhawan 8, Sharma 3) Rabada is so hungry he’s ready to start the over before the openers have had time to notice that they’re in England, where the ball sometimes moves off the seam. Every ball is testing, mostly line and length but ending with a crisp yorker, which breaks Dhawan’s bat. Another superb over.If all this is too much and you feel like a wander through the pages of history, try this on the day Kapil Dev made 175. 3rd over: India 10-0 (Dhawan 8, Sharma 2) Faf takes Tahir off and turns to Chris Morris, who should be buzzing after top-scoring with 42. He too beats the edge and then finds it, as Sharma pops over gully. India could be four down – as well as all the edges and misses, there was a run-out chance off the first ball of that over, when Dhawan tipped and ran, rather desperately. He recovers some poise with a whip for the first four of the innings. Breathless stuff.2nd over: India 4-0 (Dhawan 3, Sharma 1) Kagiso Rabada is up for this. After making a handy 30, he begins by beating Dhawan with a jaffa, then finding an edge off the shoulder that just pops over gully. Faced with the right-handed Sharma, Rabada does it all again in reverse – a looping edge, agonisingly short of second slip, and a play-and-miss. That may well be the over of the day, and it didn’t yield a wicket. 1st over: India 3-0 (Dhawan 2, Sharma 1) Imran Tahir takes the new ball, as at the very beginning of this World Cup. He starts with a couple of dots, only for a misfield at cover to get the board ticking. And another, off the last ball. If SA are going to be sloppy in the field, they might as well concede now.“Protears,” says a punning email from Sandile Xaso. “I’d like to welcome you by saying it’s been a good day, but for any Proteas fan, it’s been miserable. Our team looks undercooked, with no clear plan. Also seems we don’t have the stomach for the fight! Our batting has failed to fire, looking outmoded and lacking any sort of thrust. Bowling has been wayward and fielding shoddy. Basically, we’re having England’s 2015 campaign.” Not that bad, surely. ”I’ve found a good pillow that I’m now going to cry into as Dhawan and Kohli flay our bowling attack.”Time for action. The South Africans are having a huddle, the fans are returning to their seats (looking a bit chilly), and here come Messrs Sharma and Dhawan, perhaps eyeing an early finish.Thanks Adam and afternoon everyone. That was a hell of a performance from India: no rust, no messing, no mercy. Bumrah surgically removed the openers, then Chahal destroyed the middle order. But South Africa’s tail, once so strong, rolled back the years to turn 89-5 into 227 and give them just a glimmer of hope. Half their attack is missing, so it will be the tallest of orders, but it’s not impossible. Their score is 14 more than either side made in the famous tied semi-final of 1999.What do we need to keep the excitement bubbling during the lunch break? Someone at Sky reckons it’s a chance to see that semi-final again, which could be just what Faf du Plessis needs to fire his team up. Our man Abhijato Sensarma reckons it’s another change of structure for the World Cup.“I would like to present my (rather radical) World Cup format:“Top ten teams according to ODI rankings will be ided into two groups of five teams each. Teams ranked 1-5 occupy G1 and teams ranked 5-10 occupy G2. Top five teams from Qualifying Tournament occupy G3.“Each team plays others in its group once. All teams of G1 will qualify for the Knockouts (a reward for overall excellent form over the last four years), top two will qualify from G2, and the group winner from G3.“The quarter-finals happen after the round-robin. QF1: G1 winner v G3 winner. QF2: G1 first runners-up v G2 first runners-up. QF3: G1 second runners-up v G2 winner. QF4: G1 third runners-up v G2 fourth runners-up. Semis: QF1 winner v QF4 winner, Q2 winner v Q3 winner. Final as per usual.“This format does what the ODI Championship seeks to do in a more concrete manner - make all matches played in the four-year-cycle relevant. Teams will be motivated to perform since being in G1 gives secure qualification to the Knockouts. 37 matches played overall, with Big Three getting 5 guaranteed matches. Your thoughts?” Ingenious, but complicated. Formats have to be simple, especially in cricket. Right, that’s enough from me. Tim de Lisle is here to guide you through the rest of the break and India’s chase of 227-8. Bumrah and Chahal were the stars of the morning, two fantastic bowlers. Talk to you at Trent Bridge tomorrow. Bye!Speaking of crowds, as soon as I am off the blog I will try and find out why at least a quarter of the seats have nobody in them here today. A bit odd, isn’t it?On a more positive note, I am sure The Oval will be packed with Bangladesh fans, as it was on Sunday. They have picked up eight per cent of all tickets to this tournament, I read on the weekend. Through another project I am working on, looking at the 1999 World Cup two decades later, we spoke to the trailblazing captain of Bangladesh’s first World Cup team, the great Aminul “Bulbul” Islam. Great piece from Andy Bull to keep you entertained through the interval. He went for a wander at Trent Bridge the other day and learned a few things about the composition of crowds at this World Cup. A far from ideal final over for the Proteas, only able to take three from it. After losing Morris, Rabada got a couple away to cover but gave the strike to Tahir from the next ball, leaving the tailender two balls to score off. He couldn’t, skying the final delivery of the innings to Jadhav, giving Bhuvi a second late wicket. India’s target is 228. Morris skies the second ball of the final over high in the air towards Kohli at long-off, who does it with ease. The crowd behind him, cameras at the ready, love it.49th over: South Africa 224-7 (Morris 42, Rabada 28) Dot ball to start from Bumrah, his slower ball so hard to hit when he lands it in the channel at a left-hander. Rabada hacks one from the next, giving the strike to Morris. Can he launch long? Not this time, Bumrah doing the fielding off his own bowling after successfully cramping him up. He tries to go back over his head from the next but doesn’t get much of it at all, the ball coming off the splice and landing just over Bumrah’s head running back with the flight. Rabada now, who plays a lovely drive past mid-off up inside the circle, his second four. Last ball, penultimate over, and he misses the slower ball. Had he made contact, it was going to Portsmouth. Not to be. Fantastic from Bumrah, six taken from the 49th his final set. The attack-leader will walk off with 235 to his name, claiming both openers in his super first spell. 48th over: South Africa 218-7 (Morris 41, Rabada 23) Bhuvi vs Rabada, who whacks a full toss into the gap at mid-off for two to begin, then heaves another to long-on to give Morris his chance. He’s not able to find the rope though, picking out point. Rabada again, and it’s a fat top edge landing safely at fine leg, coming back for two. Morris gets a chance against the final ball. It isn’t timed well but they do race back hard for two. Good batting to grab nine off it without a boundary."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c446b81092ba1240b7172862d3c222997d1af39a/0_179_5389_3234/master/5389.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d26ba84d01e9bca7b1134806956cad1b","title":"diabetes dads michael barrymore ipswich pulse festival","story":"Three shows in Ipswich reflect on childhood and innocence lost – including a tribute to the 90s TV star that recalls a vanished era of light entertainmentJade Byrne gives us glasses that will blur our vision. She wants us to understand what it feels like to experience a diabetic hypo. Hugh Hughes is passing around a notebook. He wants feedback on his show about his father. Nick Cassenbaum is getting us to do just about everything: sing, holler and heckle. He wants us to fall back in love with his all-time hero, the impressionist and entertainer Michael Barrymore.All three of their shows – part of Ipswich’s Pulse festival – ask the audience to share in real-life childhood experiences and reflect on innocence lost, fractured relationships, and the inspiring figures that carry us into adulthood.The title of Byrne’s show, Pricks (★★★☆☆), refers to her constant need to check her blood sugar level with a pinprick to the finger in order to manage her type 1 diabetes. Byrne did her first finger-prick test aged four, convinced she was going to die of “die-of-betes”. These days her insulin levels are regulated with the help of an app on her phone, but it’s a condition that demands constant attention, even if all Byrne wants to do sometimes is forget.Pricks is a little insular in places – more therapy than theatre – but it’s also honest, informative and lit up by the deep affection that Byrne feels for her family, her protectors and her champions. We hear about her sister’s patience and good humour, her mother’s unwavering support, and her dad’s mad dash to the hospital as his “baby” experiences her first hypo – car abandoned in front of the hospital, keys still in the ignition and doors left wide open.Fathers haunt Hoipoilloi’s new show The Ladder (★★☆☆☆), too, although this time it’s their absence that makes an impact. Shôn Dale-Jones’s alter ego, an emerging artist called Hugh Hughes, returns to the stage with a story about his dad and the rippling sense of loss that runs through his family. The show starts at the top of a ladder, where Hughes’s father suffers a heart attack. It ends at the bottom, after dad’s life has flashed before his eyes. Dale-Jones is a natural comic and his deadpan delivery and offbeat clowning with dad (Julian Spooner) can be very funny. But there’s little shape or purpose to The Ladder, as we grind through oblique images and moments from his life.Michael Barrymore may not seem an obvious father figure but for Nick Cassenbaum, growing up during Barrymore’s heyday in the 90s, this stratospherically popular TV star was everything. My Kind of Michael (★★★★☆) is Cassenbaum’s homage to Barrymore’s brand of entertainment in his heyday – before the 2001 death of Stuart Lubbock in his swimming pool.It is a hopeful, funny and palpably affectionate show. With the help of his pop-eyed pianist, Andy Kelly, Cassenbaum rattles through Barrymore’s greatest hits and barmiest impressions. Buoyed by Cassenbaum’s natural charisma and enthusiasm, the audience cheer wildly and, with amazingly little cynicism, join in with Cassenbaum’s on-stage clowning. That cloying sense of suspicion and seediness that has set in around Britain’s entertainment industry after the revelations about Jimmy Savile and others, momentarily seeps away. Just for a moment, we’re young again."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb058b4c84b60a1947ab2b4e1f4b9e57f7a8fa59/0_232_5274_3164/master/5274.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=947395587c347ddc8592c14028d2ed40","title":"share your experiences of lost footpaths","story":"More than 10,000 miles of footpath are estimated to have been lost from maps.

Volunteers have been working tirelessly to rediscover them and put in legal applications for the recovery of lost paths before a government deadline in 2026 after which claims will no longer be accepted.If you have already found a lost footpath, how did you find and identify it? If you put in an application for a path to be recovered we’d also like to hear about it.Below are some tips on how to rediscover a lost footpath:1. The first port of call is the Ramblers, whose website gives clear advice on how to identify a lost path and make an application. The method involves comparing new and old maps, plus examination of historical sources. Walking and exploration is involved, but don’t forget that a lost path has to be proven before you can use it, otherwise you are trespassing.2. It is also important to be sure you are not replicating work already underway. This government website can give you information on current applications.3. You may also know of paths that are used regularly, but are not on the definitive map (you can ask your local council to see that map). Any footpath walked by the public for 20 years without any attempt by the landowner to prevent access can be made a right of way.

It was an essential part of my new friends’ lives. Without a stable home, they needed clean water, a place to charge a phone, a place to get free wifi. McDonald’s had all of those, and it also had good cheap food.They started their day in the McDonald’s, often around noon, cleaning up and sometimes shooting up in the bathrooms and, since the bathrooms didn’t have mirrors, putting on makeup in the sideview mirrors of cars in the parking lot. Then they spent hours off and on hanging at a table, escaping the heat or the cold.McDonald’s was a space where they could be themselves on their own terms. It was a place to momentarily escape the drama and chaos of the streets, a place that allowed them to rejoin society on the same terms as everyone else. They needed and appreciated that far more than I did. McDonald’s wasn’t just central to my friends, it was important to everyone in the neighborhood.McDonald’s was one of the few spaces in Hunts Point open to the public that worked. While wonderful and well-intentioned nonprofits serve Hunts Point, whenever I asked anyone where they wanted to meet or grab a meal, it was almost always McDonald’s.When I asked why not the nonprofits or the public parks, the answer would be some variation of “What is that?” or “They’re always telling you what to do.” The nonprofits came with lots of rules and lectures about behavior, with a quiet or not-so-quiet judgment.By the end of my three years in Hunts Point, I’d been spending part of each day in the McDonald’s. It had become central to me because it was central to the neighborhood. McDonald’s was Hunts Point’s de facto community center, and if I wanted to understand Hunts Point, I had to spend time in the McDonald’s.Three years after I left Hunts Point, after driving 150,000 miles back and forth across the country, I pulled into Portsmouth, Ohio, looking for another McDonald’s. There wasn’t one in the historic downtown, where a series of 20ft high murals on the floodwall against the Ohio River depict past scenes of Portsmouth.Portsmouth has suffered dramatically since its peak in the 1940s, when it was home to 40,000 people who manufactured steel, shoes, and bricks. Now the factories are mostly gone, and with them the jobs, and it is a town half the size, filling with drugs.As the factories, jobs, and many of the people left, those remaining in Portsmouth have done their best to keep the city together, hold tightly to the past, and stay proud. That pride is reflected in the murals, a well- intentioned attempt to sell Portsmouth as a quaint place to visit, but they are also a distraction masking a larger decline. The bulk of the downtown area is mostly empty, beyond county and city services, and a few local businesses holding on.Portsmouth is part of the other world – the world of Hunts Point, where the stories told are about wrongs endured, frustrations that seem truly insurmountable, and a longing for what once was. The anxieties here come from having limited options: My company changed ownership, and there are rumors it will move to another state. With my sisters gone, there will be nobody to take care of my parents if I move. I’ve got symptoms that scare me, but I don’t have the money for the doctor. I can’t apply for school because I’ve got an outstanding charge and don’t want to be found.In this world the energy is found outside of downtown, and in Portsmouth that is where I find the McDonald’s. It is on a busy road heading out of town, one lined with fast-food franchises, shopping malls, vape stores, check-cashing stores, and auto shops. Anchoring the area is a massive Walmart, surrounded by acres of parking and next to a railway filled with cars of coal. This is where the steel mill once was. Now only a tall, slender smokestack at the edge of the parking lot remains.It’s a Sunday evening, and I find a quiet spot toward the back of the McDonald’s parking lot to sit and rest from the drive.In the morning, the McDonald’s is busy, and not just with families getting food. There are regulars who take over a corner table and booths nearby. Some collection of them are there all day, although it is busiest in the morning. They are mostly retired men born in Portsmouth who spent their lives working union jobs as firefighters, ironworkers, construction workers, and truck drivers, providing for their families.They gossip about politics and one another and note each passing siren, often prompting speculation about where it is going and if it is another overdose. There are lots of sirens passing by and lots of shaking heads.While Gary, Indiana, is larger (population 80,000) than most communities I visited, and only 40 minutes from Chicago, it has the feel and warmth of a small town. That warmth isn’t obvious at first because of the shocking visuals: while there are scattered clusters of neighborhoods with simple, well-kept homes, much of Gary is devastated, home mainly to rusted factories and overgrown lots.Along with massive job loss, Gary has suffered from another big problem: racism. Gary is overwhelming African American and has been since the factories left, when most whites also left. Leaving to chase a stable job, or getting a loan to buy a better home, was an option few blacks had. Since then it has been endlessly studied, stigmatized, preached at, and finally dismissed as an example of “what was wrong with inner-city blacks”.Yet despite the one-two punch that has hit Gary, leaving it in a seemingly endless state of decline, despite the devastation, despite the initial skepticism, there was still a warm community in Gary. Much of it was happening in one of the few places always busy – two McDonald’s – one downtown near the old factories, the other farther out. Both have morning groups that occupy a corner, taking over more and more tables as other regulars arrive. They are mostly older men, many arriving very early, having spent a life working the morning shifts. Many were born and raised in Gary and have known one another almost their entire lives.Two regulars, Walter, 78, and Ruben, 85, sit at their table a little after noon in the McDonald’s of a largely empty shopping center. They are the last of their morning group still lingering. They grew up just one block from each other. As a child, Walter looked up to Ruben, the cool older kid. “He pretty much raised me.”Ruben says, “I am proud of Gary because it is the only place I know. I have been to other places in the service – Japan, Europe – but I came right back to Gary. Thing is, Gary has changed. First the workforce in the steel mills went down, and then in 1967 they nominated a black mayor, and the white flight started. We once had a ‘thriving downtown’ back in the day, as they say. People used to come here to shop from all over. It was the second largest city in Indiana, and we were damn proud of it. Damn proud. The drugs really started in late 60s. That is when the snake started showing its head. Have you been downtown now? It is a shame. A damn shame.”It isn’t just the morning groups that fill the McDonald’s. In the downtown McDonald’s, there are people playing dominoes (“Been getting together for a few afternoons each week for a while”), people sitting quietly reading the Bible, younger people on their phones watching videos, or playing online video games with their headsets on, or reading Harry Potter, or just sitting for hours at a time listening to music and watching the world go by. It isn’t just Gary’s community center it is Gary’s town square.Gary, like other poor communities, is dealing with serious problems, including drugs and homelessness, problems reflected in the McDonald’s. Inside the bathroom Rudy is wearing an old St Paddy’s hat, slowly and purposefully holding his clothes under the hot air from the hand dryer after washing them in the sink. His bike is out in the parking lot, with bags of cans, bottles, and clothes attached to it. He smiles and apologizes for the mess, saying he would like to talk and I should come visit him where he stays: “I don’t rightfully have a home right now, but you can find me at the intersection of Fourth and Broadway. I spend my time there.”Waiting outside the bathroom is an older man, dressed in an all-blue mishmash of clothes from various eras of varying cleanliness. He is holding four stuffed plastic bags, patiently waiting for Rudy to finish up. When Rudy does leave, as he goes in, an employee walks by and yells: “No taking a bath in there. No taking a bath in the bathroom. You hear?”On the other side of the McDonald’s, a young woman, Imani, 23, is watching a video on her phone, earphones in. We have been sitting across from each other for a while, and I eventually approach her, tell her I am writing about Gary, and ask if I can talk to her.She moved to Gary with her mother a few years earlier to escape the crime and cost of Chicago. Today is her day off work, and she is waiting for her sister, using the free wifi. She says she hangs in the McDonald’s because it is a safe spot. “It is still violent here in Gary. Not as bad as Chicago, but still bad. There are just so many abandoned buildings here. It scares me to walk by them. I don’t want to end up a body lost in one of them.”We talk for a while about her hopes and dreams, and then I ask her about the rest of her family.Her dad is in and out of jail and not much in her life, she says. I ask what he’s in for.“First time for drugs, the next few times for domestic.” Domestic?“He doesn’t have a problem putting his hand on females.” She pauses. “Like my mom and myself.”Sylvester sits in a booth, looking out the window, sipping coffee. Born in Belzoni, Mississippi, where his grandparents worked picking cotton, he moved to Gary when he was in his teens in the early 60s. “Why Gary? Race situation down south wasn’t appropriate. Part of why we moved is because I hit a white kid in the eye with a piece of coal, when we were just playing. We had to leave.”At another table is an older man about Sylvester’s age, dressed entirely in white except for a black Stetson. He introduces himself as Jesus Christ, without any hint of craziness. He is friendly and in the mood to chat, talking about his past, talking about his work.“I grew up here, only went away to do two years in the army, then worked for Ford Motors for 18.9 years.” Like Sylvester, he talks about how Gary was when he was younger, about the bars, the clubs, the gambling. When he is done, I ask him if he is religious. He stops.“Well, I believe in reading the Bible.”I ask him why he goes by Jesus Christ, and he pulls out his wallet and shows me his driver’s license and bank card – both with the name Jesus Christ.Before I leave, I ask him one last question: “I don’t mean to be rude, but you ever been mixed up with drugs?”“Not much. I quit all that. Just do cocaine now.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f5b2b5e8c7483a72cde8f703ddf5bebe9038a3a2/0_416_6240_3744/master/6240.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7ba6b17b9c1d7daeadec7fa25c52b475","title":"eric garner trial nypd daniel pantaleo","story":"Five years on, after protests around the country and millions of dollars paid to the family, no one has been held liable for Garner’s deathGwen Carr bowed her head and turned away from the screen as her son’s last words rang out across the trial room.To her left, a few feet away, sat the NYPD officer Daniel Pantaleo, who almost five years ago had placed her son, Eric Garner, in an alleged chokehold that led to his death. He too stared at the ground as his actions on that humid day on Staten Island in 2014 were broadcast to the packed trial room.Three rows behind her, sat Garner’s widow, Esaw Snipes, whose sobs could be heard almost as loudly as the videotaped evidence. As the video rolled and Garner cried “I can’t breathe” for the first of 11 times, Snipes, overcome, had to be escorted from the room.The video had already been played countless times over the past two weeks at Pantaleo’s disciplinary hearing on the fourth floor of NYPD headquarters. It has been broadcast in all corners of the world, described as crystal-clear evidence of the sort of fatal police misconduct that disproportionately affects black men.And yet, for all the years that have elapsed, the protests around the country, the millions of dollars paid to the Garner family in compensation, and the tragedy that has beset them in the aftermath, no one has been held liable for Eric Garner’s death.Although a federal criminal investigation remains open, it seems likely this administrative hearing, set to conclude next week, could be the only time Pantaleo, who remains an NYPD officer earning in excess of $100,000 a year, will face charges. The highest penalty he faces is losing his job. A punishment that hinges on the ability of prosecutors from New York’s Criminal Complaints Review Board (CCRB) to prove the officer used a banned chokehold as he restrained Garner at the neck.“There is no justice at all for Eric,” Carr told the  one recent day as she sat outside police headquarters in the dappled shade.“The harshest punishment is firing. They murdered him and if there was going to be justice, it would have been at the point when he said ‘I can’t breathe’. ”The trial represents one of the most significant episodes in recent NYPD history, but the process itself is shrouded in secrecy and inaccessibility that has angered the Garner family and civil rights groups around the city.None of the evidence presented during the hearing will be placed in the public record. Transcripts of the proceedings will not see the light of day. The judge’s recommendation, forwarded to the NYPD commissioner, James O’Neill, will not be seen. O’Neill, who will make the final decision on Pantaleo’s fate, is under no obligation to announce what he decides.For Gwen Carr, the daily routine of queueing outside the institution responsible for her son’s death is a mixture of sadness and frustration. It is coupled with the fact the trial room holds only enough space for a few dozen people, meaning many attendees and some media organizations (including the ), have been turned away from viewing the proceedings inside on certain days.“It’s very emotional to have to come here and then have such a small courtroom so everybody can’t get in,” Carr said. “I know it is what it is. We have to deal with that they give us, and I’m just thankful, at this point, that we did get a hearing and we did get a trial.”The NYPD did not respond to specific questions about the process, but spokeswoman Detective Sophia Mason issued a statement saying: “NYPD administrative trials are held at One Police Plaza and are open to the public. Seating is limited. Rules governing administrative trials are the Rules of the City of New York, Title 38, Chapter 15.”But those familiar with NYPD trials argue it was entirely within the power of the department to make this process more accessible.“They had a lot of leeway,” said Christopher Dunn, the legal director of the New York Civil Liberties Union. “It’s quite common for courts to arrange for backup spaces so that people can watch from another room. The department could have and should have predicted that was what was going to happen here. It’s particularly important when there’s not a transcript available.”There is little doubt that what has been heard so far, before administrative judge Rosemarie Maldonado, has shed important light on the circumstances of Garner’s death, starting with the relative mundanity that led up to his fatal encounter with police, and ending with the perceived callous behavior of NYPD officers in the aftermath.The 43 year-old was arrested under suspicion of selling untaxed cigarettes in July 2014. He had been known to police before, arrested at least twice for this misdemeanor offense that carries no prison time punishment.Pantaleo and his partner Justin Damico were dispatched to surveil the group of men. Although they observed them from 328ft away, using only their own eyesight, Damico told the trial he was able to observe Garner selling cigarettes. And so the officers swooped in to arrest him.Much of what happened next has been viewed millions of times on the video capturing Garner’s arrest and death. But Damico told the hearing that even as he uttered his infamous last words, he suspected Garner of “playing possum” to get out of the arrest.The officer also revealed that he processed Garner’s arrest back at the precinct, even after knowing that Garner was dead. He initially charged him with an inflated felony that suggested Garner had sold 10,000 untaxed cigarettes even though he was found with just two packets of Newports in his pocket.Upon learning of Garner’s death Lieutenant Bannon texted his sergeant: “Not a big deal. We were effecting a lawful arrest.”The trial has also heard how Pantaleo’s restraint has long been viewed by the NYPD’s internal investigators as a breach of protocol. In 2015 investigators recommended Pantaleo face internal charges, which never manifested.The revelations sparked instant criticism for New York City’s mayor, Bill de Blasio, who, days later, announced his run for the Democratic nomination for president in 2020. De Blasio has long maintained that any internal discipline for Pantaleo would have to wait until federal investigators had concluded their own investigation.It is an assertion that looks increasingly preposterous now, according to onlookers.“The police department could have prosecuted this case in August of 2014, one month after Eric Garner was killed,” said Dunn of the NYCLU. “It was reasonable to wait a little bit of time to see if there would be a criminal prosecution, but after a year or two the city should have moved forward, there is absolutely no excuse for them having waited five years.”De Blasio too, has stalled in his promises to push for revisions to restrictive state laws, which means Pantatelo’s disciplinary records cannot be entered as evidence during the trial.Pantaleo’s administrative hearing has been adjourned since 21 May, after his defense lawyers told the trial room they were unable to bring their next witness, a medical examiner in St Louis, until 5 June.Those familiar with proceedings have suggested there could be just two days left of the trial, unless Pantaleo himself testifies.But the continued delays drew the ire of Garner’s family who see it as yet another example of Pantaleo postponing any form of consequence for his actions.Despite the international significance of this case, past precedent suggests there is an extremely high bar to yield any sort of disciplinary action. According to the CCRB, just 182 complaints made to the board have resulted in a trial that has led to disciplinary action since April 2013. None of these resulted in an officer losing their job. In that time the CCRB received 1,135 complaints related to alleged use of chokeholds by an NYPD officer. Only 10 resulted in any disciplinary action.As the trial wrapped for the day back in May, Pantaleo could be seen, among a mass of broad-shouldered police union officials and defence attorneys, flicking a brief smile to his attorney, the veteran police defense lawyer Stuart London.Those in the public gallery were led out of the trial room, row by row, and made to stand single file by a wall next to the fourth-floor elevator, watched by a phalanx of uniformed NYPD officers. They were then escorted from the building.“It all takes a toll,” Carr said. “It keeps reminding me of everything I’ve gone through, of what I’m going through and what I will still have to go through.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0e5ed0d46d8c7cd4fc8ec364fa5684719fb0da82/0_4_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=34add9ff3bb43660e37e444ea49aac0f","title":"china launches rocket from yellow sea platform for first time","story":"Blast-off makes China the third country after US and Russia to master sea launch technologyChina has launched a rocket from a mobile platform at sea for the first time, sending five commercial satellites and two others containing experimental technology into space.The Long March 11 rocket blasted off from a launch pad onboard a commercial ship in the Yellow Sea off the coast of Shandong province – the 306th Long March rocket launch, but the first one at sea.China is the third country after the US and Russia to master sea launch technology.Sea launches offer advantages such as the ability to position closer to the equator, requiring less fuel to reach orbit and thereby lowering overall launch costs. It also reduces the possibility of damage on the ground from falling rocket debris.The official Xinhua News Agency cited experts as saying seaborne launch technology would meet the growing demand for launches of low inclination satellites.China’s space programme has developed rapidly, especially since it conducted its first crewed mission in 2003, becoming just the third country after Russia and the US to put humans into space using its own technology.It has put two space stations into orbit and plans to launch a Mars rover in the mid-2020s.

John Jenkins, 99, from Portsmouth, was a platoon sergeant with the Royal Pioneer Corps when he landed on D-Day.He said: “I was terrified I think everyone was. You don’t show it, but it was there. I look back on it as a big part of my life. It changed me in a way. I was a small part in a big machine. You never forget your comrades, because we were all in it together. We must never forget.”Video recordings were played of other men who were at D-day. Bob Roberts, a Canadian veteran, recalled: “They said: ‘We are going to give you live ammunition and this is the real thing.’ That was the first we knew we were in action. I thought ‘My God, I was never brought up to be killing people’. There were so many cases where I could have lost my life. Thinking back now, I don’t know how I survived.”Trump read a prayer written by the then US president, Franklin D Roosevelt, and originally delivered on the evening of D-day – 6 June 1944.The Queen said the fate of the world had depended on the success of the operation. “The heroism, courage and sacrifice of those who lost their lives will never be forgotten,” she said. “It is with humility and pleasure on behalf of the entire country, indeed the whole free world, that I say to you all – thank you.”May read a letter from Capt Norman Skinner of the Royal Army Service Corps, written to his wife, Gladys, on 3 June 1944. The letter was still in his pocket when he landed on Sword Beach on 6 June. Skinner was killed the day after, leaving his wife and two young daughters.The letter read: “Although I would give anything to be back with you, I have not yet had any wish at all to back down from the job we have to do.”The French president, Emmanuel Macron, read the final letter of Henri Fertet, a resistance fighter executed aged 16. “The soldiers are coming to get me. I must hurry. My handwriting may look wobbly, but it is just because I am using a small pencil. I am not afraid of death, my conscience is completely clear … A thousand kisses. Long live France,” he wrote.There had been some complaints from locals that they felt excluded because of the huge security effort. But there was a festival atmosphere in the public viewing area on Southsea Common, where visitors could watch the official ceremony on giant screens.People brought deckchairs and picnics, and grabbed spots in front of the screens. There were burger stands and beer tents, and merchandise stalls selling everything from souvenir mugs to fridge magnets and tea towels.In the centre of Portsmouth, scuffles broke out after groups of football casuals marched through a protest against Trump.A few dozen men marching behind a banner with the Portsmouth FC crest at the centre of a union flag chanted “Scum, scum, scum” as they arrived midway through speeches by trade unionists and others who had organised a gathering of a few hundred people in Guildhall Square.Police stepped in as the men scattered and tried to square up to those in the protest, who broke into chants of “Nazi scum, off our streets”.Amid some pushing and shoving, one man with a US flag wrapped around his waist grabbed one of the protest placards and snapped it.Ahead of the event, the 16 nations involved in the commemorations agreed a proclamation to mark the anniversary. The statement, coordinated by the UK, recognises the sacrifice of those who took part in the second world war and salutes the surviving D-day veterans.In the proclamation, the countries undertake to work together to find common ground and recommit to the shared values of democracy, tolerance and the rule of law.The text was agreed by Australia, Belgium, Canada, the Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, New Zealand, Poland, Slovakia, the UK and the US.After a reception with veterans, the world leaders who attended the ceremony met to discuss Nato and security.Later, from the deck of the aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth, May was to wave off the hundreds of veterans who are to retrace the journey they made across the Channel, this time onboard a cruise ship, the MV Boudicca."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/67bdf947e2ff0d07fe8bc67da78137dbf4baa78e/0_56_4189_2514/master/4189.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8f3b2a1fb169af5cc0670df2221a148d","title":"high heels at work are necessary says japan labour minister","story":"Ministry responds to #KuToo petition calling for end to women having to wear heels at workJapan’s health and labour minister has defended workplaces that require women to wear high heels to work, arguing it is “necessary and appropriate” after a petition was filed against the practice.The remark came when Takumi Nemoto was asked to comment on a petition by a group of women who want the government to ban workplaces from requiring female jobseekers and employees to wear high heels.“It is socially accepted as something that falls within the realm of being occupationally necessary and appropriate,” Nemoto told a legislative committee on Wednesday.The petition was submitted to the labour ministry on Tuesday. The campaign has been dubbed \u001d#KuToo, a play on words from the Japanese word “kutsu”, meaning shoes, and “kutsuu”, meaning “pain”. It is also a reference to the global \u001d#MeToo movement against sexual abuse.The movement was launched by the actor and freelance writer Yumi Ishikawa and quickly won support from thousands of people online.Campaigners say wearing high heels in Japan is near-obligatory when job hunting or working in many Japanese companies.Some campaigners describe high heels as akin to modern-day foot-binding, while others have urged a broader loosening of dress codes in Japan, where business suits for men are ubiquitous in the workplace.In 2015, the director of the Cannes film festival apologised after a controversy blew up over women being denied access to the red carpet for not wearing high heels. But Cannes kept the dress code, despite a protest by the Hollywood superstar Julia Roberts who went barefoot the next year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/47681622fa58330a3d8fde28d26a6d69ada2c729/0_198_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d1c838c3628b7bb4e3bdce5734d48cf2","title":"north koreas mass games suspended after kim jong un criticism","story":"Country’s leader reportedly criticised producers of event for their ‘wrong spirit’North Korea’s mass games propaganda displays are to be put on hold – possibly for weeks – after the country’s leader, Kim Jong-un, criticised the producers of the most recent event for their “wrong spirit”, according to foreign tour groups.Kim said he was unhappy with the event, titled “The Land of the People”, after attending Monday’s opening night at the 150,000-seat May Day Stadium in Pyongyang with his wife, Ri Sol-ju, and his influential younger sister, Kim Yo-jong.She had not been seen in public for weeks amid speculation her brother had ordered her to keep a low profile following the failure of his second nuclear summit with Donald Trump.State news agency KCNA said Kim had “extended warm greetings” to the performers, many whom are children, but later called the event’s producers and “seriously criticised them for their wrong spirit of creation and irresponsible work attitude”.Noting that artists “have a very important duty in socialist cultural construction”, Kim “set forth important tasks for correctly implementing the revolutionary policy of our party on literature and art,” KCNA added.Simon Cockerell, general manager of Beijing-based Koryo Tours, said it had been told by its North Korean partners that the show, which features mass gymnastic displays, would be suspended for days or weeks from next Monday to allow its creators to make adjustments.The firm tweeted that “there will be a pause for some daysweeks while the show is adjusted before being launched again – we wait to see what will change and when it will restart”.Young Pioneers Tours, another travel company that arranges trips to North Korea, tweeted that the suspension was due to Kim’s “dissatisfaction with the opening performance”, adding that no dates had been given for the show’s resumption.It isn’t clear what irritated Kim, but some observers noted that his portrait appeared at the event alongside those of his grandfather, North Korea’s founder Kim Il-sung, and his father, Kim Jong-il, whom he succeeded as leader in late 2011.It is rare for portraits of Kim Jong-un to be shown in public, and unlike his predecessors, no statues of him are known to exist.The mass games were held last September for the first time in five years as part of the regime’s attempts to improve its international image after years of condemnation over its missile and nuclear weapons programme. The games are also popular with tourists – a source of much-needed foreign currency.But last month Thae Yong-ho, the former deputy ambassador to the UK, who defected in 2016, called on travel companies and tourists to boycott the games, describing them as “inhumane”.“You should know that it means the children, aged from six to nine, cannot go to school for six months – it’s a forced exercise,” Thae told the Oslo Freedom Forum.“And who are the audience for this? Europeans, and there are many European tour companies who organise trips. We should argue this with the European companies – these are inhumane displays.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7eac5a984e00881f3f81a5b39750bf93cf02eab0/0_330_4951_2971/master/4951.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=22cc8c4c4603bab2f8da4d4493dc25f1","title":"washington urges riyadh to end military crackdown in sudan","story":"Washington takes unusual step of calling on kingdom to bring about end to military crackdownThe thorny question of Saudi Arabian political influence across the Middle East and Africa is back in the spotlight again with Washington taking the unusual step of effectively telling Riyadh to end Sudan’s military crackdown.In an unusual public statement the US state department revealed that its undersecretary for political affairs, the diplomat David Hale, had phoned the Saudi deputy defence minister, Khaled bin Salman, to ask him to use the country’s influence to end the brutal repression against peaceful protesters by the Sudanese Transitional Military Council (TMC) in Sudan.It has hardly been a secret that Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have gained influence in Sudan following the overthrow of the dictator Omar al-Bashir in April. Critics of Saudi Arabia will see a pattern of behaviour, evident in Libya and Yemen, in which Saudi Arabia moves to marginalise rivals Iran and Qatar, as well as to install autocratic regimes built on repression.But it is rare for the Americans, normally so close to Saudi Arabia on regional issues, to make so public their representations to Riyadh on the need for civilian rule and for democracy to run its course.Saudi Arabia may claim the Sudanese crackdown was an independent judgment by the interim leader, Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, but the army general has in recent weeks paid visits to Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Egypt.More importantly the deputy president of the council, Mohamed Hamdan Dagolo, the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) militia leader known as Hemedti, met the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, in Jeddah on 24 May, and pledged to stand with the kingdom against all threats, including Iran. He vowed Sudanese troops would continue fighting alongside Saudi Arabia against the Houthi rebels in Yemen.Dagolo is widely seen as the true decision-maker in Khartoum, and the figure behind moves to stall negotiations about the transition to democracy and resist protesters’ demands that they be included in the transitional body.That Dagolo chose Riyadh for his first overseas trip since the fall of Bashir was hardly surprising. In April Saudi Arabia pledged to provide $3bn in funds to Khartoum, a move designed to stabilise the exchange rate and strengthen the military.Until recently there was no sign that the US disapproved of its great ally gaining influence in Sudan. The US made no complaint when, on 30 May, Sudanese security officers notified al-Jazeera’s office in Khartoum saying the military council had decided to withdraw the Qatari state-owned TV network’s work permits without providing an official reason. The shutdown came as the authorities began a clampdown against a protest camp in the capital.But the scale of the bloody assault on the Khartoum protesters this week led to a change in tone in Washington, and an irritation if not exasperation with Saudi foreign policy.The US national security adviser, John Bolton, tweeted: “The unprovoked violence of Sudan’s security forces against peaceful demonstrators in Khartoum is abhorrent. The TMC must respect the right to peaceful demonstration and speed transition to a civilian-led government, which the Sudanese people have rightfully demanded.” The tweet was followed by the publicised call between Hale and bin Salman.Yet the involvement of Saudi and the UAE, the leading Sunni “counter revolutionary” states, is part of a wider pattern of jostling for influence across the mainly Muslim Horn of Africa. Between 2000 and 2017, Gulf states invested $13bn in the region, mainly in Sudan and Ethiopia, according to a study by the Clingendael Institute, a thinktank in the Netherlands.Broadly, on one side lies Qatar and Turkey, and on the other the counter-revolutionary states opposed to Islamism. At stake is the capture of strategic ports, improved maritime security, and privileged access to the rapidly emerging economies.Saudi has been particularly active across the Horn of Africa and instrumental last autumn in negotiating a peace treaty between Ethiopia and Eritrea. Abiy Ahmed, Ethiopia’s prime minister, was given $3bn in aid and investments from the UAE upon taking office in April 2018, including a $1bn deposit in the country’s central bank. In Yemen again it is the UAE and Saudi Arabia that head a coalition that has led to a four-year civil war aimed at reinstalling Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, as leader. Hadi spends most of his time in Riyadh and is no poster boy for democracy but Saudi will not abandon the war, regardless of the casualties, because it regards Iranian-backed Houthis as a permanent security threat.Equally in Libya, where a bloody military stalemate persists in Tripoli, Marshall Khalifa Haftar by most accounts would not have tried to seize the capital in defiance of a UN peace plan without UAE military hardware, and Saudi political backing.The question now is whether in Sudan, unlike Libya and Yemen, the US government is prepared to do more than simply dial Riyadh once."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3915756.1559749715!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"what we learned from today s exams","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThis year’s ordinary level Leaving Cert English exam focused  on the selfie and social media. Photograph: iStockState exams body is down with the kidsYou might not assume that the suits who devise Leaving Cert exams have their finger on the pulse of cutting-edge youth culture.You’d be wrong.This year’s ordinary level English paper shows a team of exam-setters well and truly surfing the Irish cultural zeitgeist.The exam focused on the selfie and how new words have been invented to describe variations of it.They include “helfie” (a picture of one’s hair), “melfie” (a selfie taken using a mirror) and “drelfie” (drunken selfie).It’s all news to us. So, parents, if you don’t understand your kids anymore, then you know what to do.Take a closer look at what kind of exam papers the young people are reading these days. It’s not like it was in our day.Quote of the day“Ach, so proud, and I hope that whatever the f**k exams are - as I’ve never done one - the bit with me in it was super-easy, you all got A BILLION POINTS and a pay-rise. They pay you for exams, right? Cos if not, that’s kinda harsh.”Tweet from journalist and author Caitlin Moran, on hearing her essay featured in the English Leaving Cert paper one.Poxes vs idiots“Is there anything worse than the poxes you share the bus with in rush-hour traffic to and from work? No matter how many times you travel on public transport you never get used to it.”So wrote Aoife Dooley in The  in November 2017. Her article popped up on this year’s Junior Cert (higher level) English paper but, peculiarly, the examiners saw fit to change “poxes” to “idiots”.It is, perhaps, an understandable change, but it’s nonetheless a real shame to lose one of Hiberno-English’s most glorious insults to the very generic term “idiot”.In the strict sense of the term, a pox is a particular viral disease, but it’s long since been used in Ireland to refer to a “shitehawk” or “langer”.More particularly, it refers to a particularly annoying and unwanted person, who is about as welcome as a pox. It is a gorgeous, hateful word. Today’s students are all the poorer for its absence in the exam.Number of the day:47.7 million- Number of A4 pages printed in this year’s exam booklets Exam weather gets an ‘F’Leaving Cert weather might not be as predictable as we like to think, but the annual conversation about it certainly is.“People have this idea that it’s warm and sunny during the Leaving Cert,” she replied.So what, then, explains the widespread belief that Ireland has made a pact with the weather gods, sacrificing our young to the horrors of the Leaving Cert in return for a drop of sunshine?“When the sun comes out, it is warm and people remember it,” said Cusack. “Doing the Leaving Cert is very traumatic and so we always remember the weather during our Leaving Cert.”I made the paper!“Woke up to find that I was on the junior cert English paper today, what the hell,” the author Aoife Dooley wrote on Twitter.“I’m now getting messages from 15-year-olds asking why I hate the bus. Just want to make it clear, I don’t: I just hate people.”Dooley’s article immediately sparked a series of memes from teenagers.One tweeter suggested that she ask for royalties from the Department of Education, to which she replied (also jokingly): “I’ll be asking them to pay for my f—-king counselling when this is over!”Engineering (9.30am), English paper two (2pm)Irish paper one (9.30am), Irish paper two (2pm -higher only)Spill out everything you know poetic techniques, imagerysymbols, characters, etc,and back everything up with a relevant example and quote.Most importantly,answer the question asked. Many students lose marks by writing a really good answer for a question that they wanted to see.Be careful about timing. Fora higher level student, try spending 25 minutes on the short questions, 10 minutes reading the long questions and 30 minutes on each long question write a timing plan with times on the front of the exam paper.Students should be familiar with the concept of a SRP:single relevant point: this is how the corrector will mark your paper.A typical essay-type long question will be worth 30 marks at higher level,so students are required to write at least 15 inidual points to gain full marks."},{"url":null,"title":"a baby born today the climate and their future","story":"Life-support systems that nature provides – an intertwined web that sustains humans, plants and animals – are at risk of unravelling in a matter of decades.Deforestation, intensive agriculture, overfishing, development and other human activities are breaking the bonds that combine to make a healthy planet. Their destruction, fuelled by rampant consumption and obsession with economic growth, is accelerating.“The evidence is crystal clear: nature is in trouble. Therefore we are in trouble,” declared Sandra Díaz, who co-chaired the completion of a global assessment of bioersity published this week.There is a dual threat to life on Earth: species loss and climate change. The Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Bioersity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) ranked the main factors causing species loss: changes in land and sea use exploitation of organisms climate change pollution and invasive alien species.These are “eroding the foundations of our economies, livelihoods, food security, health and quality of life worldwide”, and climate breakdown could soon become the main driver.Nature is being destroyed at such a rate that a million species are at risk. On the day the IPBES report made headlines, Dr Allan Mee of the Golden Eagle Trust checked for sightings of the Ring Ouzel in the MacGillycuddy’s Reeks in Co Kerry, one of just two of its remaining habitats in Ireland. “No birds located. Sad but likely witnessing local extinction of the species, once found in 28 Irish counties,” he tweeted. Pádraic Fogarty of the Irish Wildlife Trust replied: “This is mass extinction unfolding before our eyes.”How is the potentially lethal cocktail of bioersity loss and climate disruption going to impact on coming generations in contrasting parts of the globe? Equally, what does it mean for an animal that dominates the Irish landscape (the cow), and the majestic lion, not critically endangered yet rapidly disappearing?The baby born in IrelandConscious of what the next generation is facing, Australian Jim Scheer helped set up the FridaysForFuture climate action movement in Ireland, which is driven by young people. As for the babies of today, “their freedom is limited”, he believes. As a child, “the most I had to worry about was, ‘is there air in the tyres of my bike?’” he says.They are facing a whole different world of realities, a place where the First World problem of “where will I go on my holidays?” may be replaced by “where is my next meal coming from?”The issues weigh heavily on the current generation of young people, he believes, which is why “coming together to grieve” – a feature of recent protests – matters, and is part of telling the truth. There is much frustration too at the inaction of elders.“Uncertain” is the future of that child, says climate activist Dr Lorna Gold. Hope is emerging through the climate movement but, looking at the timelines required for transformational shift, there is “more and more uncertainty”.Children growing up in Ireland will be relatively protected, by location, wealth and assets they will have access to, “but even in the best-case scenario, it will be a diminished world.”This will be due to loss of species and a more complicated world, disrupted by climate and associated conflict, where Dr Gold fears the freedom to explore and travel in relative peace is undermined. It’s a place of learning from the internet rather than real life. The pluses will be better local connectedness with “their own earth” and nearby food production.That Irish child will never hear the corncrake or the curlew, says climatologist Prof John Sweeney, and, as they grow, they will be confronted with hard choices on lifestyle and mobility. The fossil fuel-driven car will be forced out by regulation, he says, but different ways of getting off the island, for example, will be needed if aviation does not overcome its emissions issues.By mid-century, most will live in green cities with an almost total absence of the private car. The transport revolution will be in urban areas but slower to come to the countryside until battery technology improves, Sweeney notes.A near zero-carbon world will mean less air pollution. Clean energy in their home and workplace will mainly come from offshore wind.A downside will be more extreme weather events attributable to climate change more intense storms and rainfall, increased flooding with sea level rises – and yet water shortages in summer.The child born today in Ireland – and the adult they become – will cope far better than their counterpart elsewhere.The developing world babyA baby born today in a developing country, on the other hand, will be at the frontline of climate disruption, says Christian Aid Ireland policy and advocacy adviser Jennifer Higgins. They will have to contend with stronger cyclones, warmer days and nights, more unpredictable rains and longer heatwaves.“Here in Ireland we will have the resources and ability to adapt and deal with these unprecedented weather events, but in many parts of the world, going to Tesco to stock up on sliced pan won’t be a possibility.”They will be the ones who will suffer the worst consequences of our inaction on climate change. “Sustained periods of unseasonably heavy rain can have a damaging impact on agriculture, causing the loss of topsoil and serious nutrient leaching,” says Higgins.In Ireland, save for the odd hosepipe ban, water is always on tap for domestic, industrial and agricultural use. “But in the developing world, where most people depend on agriculture to earn a living or just stay alive, it’s a scarce and precious resource.”Those living in coastal regions will suffer a loss of coral reefs, which half a billion people rely on for fish. For those born among indigenous communities in tropical rainforests, not only will they lose their homeland – already being eroded by increasing industrialisation – but there will be loss of habitat that acts as the lungs of the earth and regulates rainfall.Children will be most susceptible to the increasing diseases that a changing climate will leave in its wake, she adds. Their education may be disrupted when schools are used as shelters when disaster hits their communities.If temperatures increase in already hot areas, it will diminish scarce resources to sustain life and will force many to become refugees.But this may “dwarf numbers caused by conflict or political and economic necessity. When their land becomes uninhabitable because of drought, flood or sea-level rise, they will have to seek a safer place to live,” Higgins predicts.It may be a world where techniques such as conservation agriculture transform crop production and smartphone technology helps drive rural economies backed by deployment of cheap solar PV. But extreme weather events will continue to threaten food production, as seen with recent cyclones in southern Africa.Gold fears a business-as-usual approach means such circumstances can become an intractable problem very quickly, and says solutions are beyond most communities on cost grounds. Therefore the child is facing increased malnutrition, chronic hunger, dependency on external aid, and political instability – an existence marked by inequality and injustice.The IPBES report starkly outlines how indigenous peoples and the poorest are most reliant on land and sea for survival. The combination of land grabs by multinationals facilitated by corrupt governments, extreme climate events and bioersity loss add up to a very bleak future for their offspring, Gold concludes.The future of the cow Humans are not the only beings whose lives will change. The IPBES report emphasises that the effects will be felt first among animals and other living things.In Ireland, there are currently more cattle than people, and they are the most common large animal. For many, the cow (for beef and milk) is the bellwether of Irish agriculture and rural life. For others, it’s the problem because of associated carbon emissions.Teagasc’s head of communications, Eric Donald, says cattle numbers are currently a matter for inidual farmers. With no quotas, no policy instruments are in place. In future we are likely to have fewer beef and more dairy cattle.On emissions, Donald says there is wide acceptance of the need to implement mitigation measures – a process is already in train.Having a grass-based system to feed those cattle will be critical to sustainable farms from an environmental, economic and social perspective, Donald adds. Ireland will need to find export markets for 80 to 90 per cent of its product. Meat consumption may decrease on an inidual basis and there may be a shift to plant-based diets, but increased population growth will mean “demand won’t drop significantly”.But cattle will have to compete for space due to a more erse range of crops, land being used for bioenergy and afforestation (increasingly native woodlands and not just on marginal land) that will act as important carbon sinks, and hedgerows ensuring better bioersity and pollinator capacity.To question beef consumption may currently be an Irish “no-no”, but the reality is the consumers of tomorrow will be confronted by a wide range of new plant and synthetic proteins that will taste surprisingly good and be cheaper, which is likely to mean less red meat is consumed – in line with health guidelines.Eric Donald defends the pursuit of higher genetic quality as a means of increasing efficiency and lowering emissions, especially “because lifetime productivity is better”. With extending grazing seasons, it’s the key measure in improving farm sustainability guidelines. It also complements changes in fertiliser use and slurry management.But John Sweeney says the Irish cow is “reaching limits in terms of genetics”. Like pedigree dogs, they are less able to cope with change and stress compared with native species.Unquestionably, there will be fewer of them, he believes, “if we want to maintain bioersity for future generations”.Expansion in the cattle population has coincided with deterioration in water quality, with widespread glyphosate contamination (one study has found 20 per cent of Irish adults have traces of the herbicide in their urine), nitrates pollution and an emerging ammonia problem.“Continued expansion of the national herd is not compatible with this report. That’s where the crux comes.”The future of the lionJennifer Higgins joins in a lament for so many endangered mammals.Of all species threatened, IWT campaign officer Pádraic Fogarty is shocked by the latest indicators for hippos, giraffes and lions. In particular, “it would be an absolutely travesty if lions were to go extinct . . . The magnificent animal has permeated our culture and imagination, from children’s stories to the pillars on Trafalgar Square.”But maps don’t lie. In 1950 there were 400,000 lions in the wild. Today there are 23,000-39,000 lions in all of Africa, which is “extremely low” in global terms, when once they lived in Ancient Greece and North Africa, and became extinct in Greece only around 100BC.Outside of southern Africa, numbers of lions in 23 unfenced reserves in 11 countries are estimated to have dropped by 62 per cent between 1993 and 2014. Asia is home to a small subpopulation in the Indian state of Gujarat, where numbers are growing, but it’s just a pin on the globe.“There is no data to say that lions are about to disappear, but their populations are shrinking fast,” he explains. The species is classified as vulnerable but the slide into the “endangered” and then “critically endangered” categories looms, while “threatened with extinction” is applied to its current status.For Fogarty, the same pressures apply to other mammals, but the lion’s wellbeing is further undermined by gametrophy hunting and false western-world notions that it is somehow good for population numbers. All told, we are facing a scenario where lions will “shrink to a few corners of the planet”.What to doThis is not going to be sorted by putting bird tables in back gardens. The Ipbes report shows nature-based solutions can help bring “transformative change”, but there is a greater systemic problem.In the past 50 years, the human population has doubled, the global economy has grown nearly four-fold, and global trade has grown tenfold, together driving up the demands for energy, food and materials.Thinking that endless economic growth is possible and not valuing the essential services provided by nature is a delusion leading to catastrophe, Sweeney believes.“Until we get away from euros and cents and GDP, we will be in a cul-de-sac . . . Unless we rethink how we value the services provided by the natural world and include them explicitly in a wellbeing measure, we delude ourselves that a sustainable future is possible.”That was the core message in a submission this week to EU leaders meeting on the future of Europe by the European Environmental Bureau (EEB) and more than 200 academics, including John Sweeney, policy experts and civil society groups.There is an onus too on iniduals to act, according to EEB vice president Attracta Uí Bhroin. “It’s not enough for us to sit on the sofa and watch David Attenborough’s latest breathtaking and terrifying documentary and shake our heads. Every politician coming near your front door needs to know environmental sustainability is your priority, and must be Europe’s priority.”Fogarty hopes people now see the connections between climate breakdown and mass extinction, that they are two sides of the same coin. “We have all of the solutions to hand, but what we’ve been lacking is any sense of urgency to get on with it.”He senses momentum moving in the right direction, though the lack of a response from the Taoiseach or any Government minister “makes me feel that they are still hoping it’s an issue that will go away. We can’t really afford this level of disengagement when we need to be getting on with things.”Scheer is brutally frank about future voters born today. “I don’t think people get a choice of what games they play.”They will have to be focused on survival. “It feels as we have handed them a shitstorm.”As for the current generation, too many are stuck in business-as-usual mode. There is a need to raise consciousness quickly. “Ignorance is not a choice” given the IPBES report. “It’s not an opinion, it’s scientific. It’s happening.”Kevin O\u0027Sullivan is Environment and Science Editor and former Editor of The "},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Assault allegation against John McGahon is denied, Dundalk District Court hearsBig security operation around Shannon Airport where US president is meeting TaoiseachDay #1: Drelfies, poxes and the myth of exam weatherNorthern Ireland Police Federation urges politicians to restore StormontClares Rocket was stolen from kennels of top trainer Graham Holland in 2016Fine Gael politician will not return to European Parliament until Brexit happensMother of children believed they had been taken to swimming when former husband texted to say they would not be backMark Hennessy abducted and killed Filipina student Jastine Valdez last yearWest Clare village abuzz ahead of US president\u0026rsquos arrival at his golf resort on WednesdayGlen Walker (38) from Saggart, arrested after Criminal Assets Bureau investigationPatrick Patton (65) appealing conviction for indecently assaulting babysitter in his Donegal homeHome of woman, who may be made ward of court, described as a health hazardBoy (16) denies murder of Leaving Cert student at park in Dundrum, south DublinA resident who heard the woman scream in a Dublin laneway recorded the attack and called garda\u0026iacuteThe US has security fears over Chinese telecoms firm due to be part of 5G rolloutInitial one-day action by staff could lead to five more days of disruptionJudges hears Wexford TD has \u0026lsquochange in his financial circumstances\u0026rsquo after MEP voteEnvironmental Protection Agency examining whistleblower\u0026rsquos claims of cable failuresPresident Higgins calls Trump\u0026rsquos policy on climate change \u0026lsquoregressive and pernicious\u0026rsquo"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3915461.1559734816!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"massive oil leaks from esb cables in dublin investigated","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Electricity Supply Board notified the agency about the issue at the end of May, following a series of disclosures relating to safety. File photograph: Aidan CrawleyThe Environmental Protection Agency is investigating the leakage of up to one million litres of insulating oil from underground electricity cables in Dublin over the last 20 years. The Electricity Supply Board notified the agency about the issue at the end of May, following a series of disclosures last year relating to safety by whistleblower Seamus O’Loughlin to the company and to the Department of the Environment. Central to Mr O’Loughlin’s claim is that insulating fluid from about 160kms of underground, low pressure, fluid-filled cables, almost all of which are between the canals in Dublin, has been leaking into the ground at a rate of about 40,000 litres per year over the past two decades.The fluid in the cables is a mixture of mineral oil - which was used until the late 1980s - and linear alkylbenzene, a lighter, biodegradable fluid. The majority of the leaks are caused by the age of the cables, most of which were laid between the 1950s and 1980s and are starting to degrade. Subsidence and building works can also puncture the cables. In some cables, the outer casing is made of lead and deteriorates over time, causing leaks. The fluid leaking out is potentially entering the ground water system under Dublin and also into watercourses, including rivers and canals, Mr O’Loughlin said.Also among more than a dozen concerns raised by Mr O’Loughlin in a series of disclosures are concerns about the management of building works near the underground power cables. He cites one recent example of the cable on Harcourt Street being pierced during building works. This could have led to a significant incident, he warned. As it happened, on that day, the cable was punctured, the cable was not live. It said the leakage rate has been on a downward trend in recent years - with exception of 2018 - and it is on course to reduce the leakage this year to 8,000 litres. The company said this is in line with “international peers in other countries (measured on a litres per kilometre basis).“It is important to note that the cable insulating fluid is readily biodegradable. Notwithstanding this, ESB Networks acknowledges that it is preferable to minimise and eliminate leaks.”The company said it is engaged in a long-term cable replacement programme.ConcernedIn a statement to The , the EPA said it was concerned by the reports of leaks from the power cables and particularly the scale and duration. “The report of the alleged leakage of large volumes of oil to the environment over an extended period is of concern to the EPA. “On May 27th, 2019 the EPA received correspondence from ESB Networks regarding their reporting obligations in relation to leaks from underground fluid filled electricity cables,” the EPA said in a statement. “Given the alleged scale and duration of these incidents, and the correspondence received this week from ESB Networks, the EPA will investigate this matter and liaise with the relevant local authorities to determine what, if any action is required.”According to RTÉ, ESB internal documents state the material leaks from these cables could present a “very high environmental impact, given the proximity to the Grand Canal”.The documents also state the underground cable oil is “not considered compatible with watercourses and the associated eco systems, rivers and canals”.AstoundedMr O’Loughlin, who worked with the ESB for more than 20 years, says when he saw the scale of the leakage, he found it difficult to comprehend. “It was so far ahead of what the UK and other international utilities were experiencing. I was astounded that a company like ESB would allow that situation to pertain,” he told RTÉ. In a statement, the ESB said it has started a number of investigations into the claims made by a whistleblower and they should be complete by the end of June. The company said it has introduced new management processes for building works near the cables and has also set reduction targets for leakages from its cables based on benchmarking against other, international utilities. The ESB also said that it has, since 2006, been required to report to the Commission for Energy Regulation (CRU) “on environmental performance under its Distribution System Operator licence. This requirement has included reporting on cable insulating fluid leakage and we have complied with this requirement.”  and it says the material in the cables is all biodegradable. In a statement, the Department of the Environment said it “can confirm that a protected disclosure was made to the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment in May 2018 and the matter has been and continues to be dealt with in accordance with the Protected Disclosures Act 2014. “The Department has engaged and continues to engage appropriately with the inidual concerned and the company.” "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3915614.1559750240!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"nine out of 10 psni officers complain of low morale conference hears","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFederation chairman Mark Lindsay: ‘Feedback from the coalface is disturbing and worrying’. Photograph: Michael McHughPA WireNorthern Ireland politicians have been urged by the chairman of the Northern Ireland Police Federation to “settle their differences” and reinstate Stormont to deliver what society and policing need.Mark Lindsay, calling for “urgent investment” in policing, also told the federation’s annual conference in Belfast on Wednesday that more than nine out of 10 police officers complained of low morale across the PSNI.Mr Lindsay, referring to the dissident republican attempt to murder a police officer in a foiled under-car bomb attack in east Belfast at the weekend, described those responsible as people with “absolutely nothing to offer”.“They are bankrupt, heartless, maniacs, politically irrelevant and deserving only of our condemnation,” he said.He added, “They must be apprehended and for that, I appeal from this platform today for an all-out effort by this community to give them up, to rid us once and for all of this scourge that continues to blight this island.”He also referred to the loyalist murder of Ian Ogle in east Belfast and the New IRA murder of Lyra McKee in Derry and said the community and the police “want to see an end to all terrorist groups”.As political negotiations continue at Stormont, Mr Lindsay deplored the lack of political movement. He said, “We have no programme for government, no one to fight our corner for increased numbers and adequate resources. The job of repairing fences and getting back to legislating and running Northern Ireland should trump all else.”“If politicians are to rebuild public trust and confidence, then they will have to move from narrow, sectional demands and instead consider the greater societal good,” he said at the La Mon Hotel on the outskirts of east Belfast.He urged, “Settle your differences inside Stormont and not outside it. It’s time to end shrill megaphone voices for what passes as local political engagement. Deliver what people want and what policing and society needs.”Mr Lindsay also told delegates that the latest Police Federation workforce survey found that 92 per cent officers believed that morale in the PSNI was low.“This feedback from the ‘coalface’ is disturbing and worrying. In any other organisation or enterprise, this would set alarm bells ringing. Yet, for some inexplicable reason, the silence is deafening in some government departments,” he added.“Without urgent investment, further decline in service will be inevitable. We will see more officers under stress and reporting sick. More being injured on duty and more leaving for less demanding jobs,” said Mr Lindsay.He looked forward to working with the incoming PSNI chief constable Simon Byrne and offered the outgoing chief George Hamilton, who stands down at the end of the month, his best wishes.Mr Lindsay, however, was critical of the outgoing Police Ombudsman, Dr Michael Maguire whose office holds police officers to account. He is also retiring at the end of this month.“We have had a strained relationship with the current ombudsman, where we consistently highlighted a biased viewpoint towards serving and retired officers,” he said. Mr Lindsay added, “We accept the office of the ombudsman has to have the confidence of the public but, crucially, also of police officers. It is not an unreasonable expectation that (Police Ombudsman office) investigations are conducted thoroughly and impartially. Colleagues, in the past, confidence that this has been done has been in very short supply.” In response Dr Maguire agreed, “There has at times been a strained relationship between the two organisations,” while adding: “But I am at a total loss to understand how anyone looking at the totality of our work could conclude that we have a bias against police officers, either serving or retired.”On the legacy of the Troubles, Mr Lindsay complained of a “determined and concerted effort underway to re-write the past, to demonise the security services, to downplay the actions of the killers and pretend their deeds were somehow legitimate or justified”.He said the federation would “never tire of defending the good name and reputation of men and women, like you, who prevented all-out anarchy and mayhem and delivered the conditions for peace”.Mr Lindsay also referred to the Soloheadbeg ambush in January 1919 when two members of the Royal Irish Constabulary were killed. He said, “Some of our politicians eulogise the cowardly actions of the past. To commemorate events such as the murder of two police officers 100 years ago in Co Tipperary, only helps radicalise a new generation. “Whether a murder took place 100 years ago, 40 years ago or 10 years ago, it was all wrong and politicians need to be mindful of the message they send out to society.” "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3915423.1559748564!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"grace o sullivan pips deirdre clune to fourth ireland south seat","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tIndependents 4 Change Mick Wallace talks to count staff at the Ireland South count centre. File photograph: Michelle DevanePA WireGrace O’Sullivan of the Green Party has taken the fourth European Parliament seat in the Ireland South constituency, leaving Fine Gael’s Deirdre Clune in the fifth spot which will become active when, or if, Brexit takes place. Independents4Change candidate Mick Wallace earlier took the third seat and the count has now come to an end, 13 days after voters went to the polls. Mr Wallace was not present for his election as he had missed a connecting flight from London to Cork following a break in Italy.Mr Wallace picked up 27,001 transfers from Sinn Féin’s Liadh Ní Riada on the 19th count to add to 112,528 votes he had already garnered.This brought him clear of the quota of 119, 866. Fine Gael’s Sean Kelly and Fianna Fáil’s Billy Kelleher were elected last week.The elimination and distribution of Ms Ní Riada’s 98,248 papers saw Ms O’Sullivan, a Senator from Tramore, Co Waterford, jump ahead of the incumbent Ms Clune, who she had trailed by 2,306 votes going into the 19th count.Ms Clune picked up 9,038 transfers to bring her to 110,085. However, Ms O’Sullivan took in 15,681 transfer votess bringing her to 114,287 - some 4,000 ahead of Ms Clune.Returning officer Martin Harvey declared Mr Wallace elected and said the next task was the distribution of his surplus of 19,674 papers between Ms O’Sullivan and Ms Clune to see who takes the fourth and fifth seats. There were 46,528 non-transferable votes from Mr Wallace. Ms O’Sullivan was deemed elected following the distribution of Mr Wallace’s surplus. Ms Clune had earlier refused to accept that she was destined to take the fifth seat, pointing out that transfers had been quite random in the contest to date. She said that she was glad that the count was finally coming to a close as it had been an arduous 10 days or so for all the candidates .“I suppose whether I end up with the Brexit seat or not, I’m very happy with our achievement in holding the seat for Fine Gael. I wasn’t fearful on the first count because even though I was down the pecking order a bit, the party vote held up at around 30 per cent,” she said. Ms Clune finds herself in the same situation as Barry Andrews of Fianna Fáil, who took the final seat in the Dublin constituency. Ireland was allocated two extra MEP berths as a consequence of the UK’s decision to leave the EU, but the Brexit process has been repeatedly delayed.She said she found herself in a quandry as the seat is dependent on Brexit but “like everyone else in Ireland, I don’t want Brexit to happen.

Photograph: Barry Roche.Defeated Sinn Féin MEP Liadh Ní Riada has defended party leader Mary Lou McDonald following poor showings by Sinn Féin in both the local and European elections and questioned whether a male leader of the party would be subjected to the same criticism.The Ireland South candidate said Ms McDonald had “big shoes to fill” when she succeeded Gerry Adams but she believed that she had done a good job to date but people needed to remember that she hasn’t been that long in the job and needs more time to put her own mark on the position.“As Mary Lou says herself you can’t just be a fair weather leader - you have to be a leader that goes through the good times and the bad times. Mary Lou has only been a leader for a very short time - I wonder if it was a male counterpart would they get the same amount of criticism in such a short time.“I think she is open to far more criticism than she deserves and I wonder if it was a male would they get the same level of criticism - people should sit back and give her a chance to find her feet and give her time to get the party more in form in terms of cohesion to bring us into a brighter future.”Ms Ní Riada was speaking at the Ireland South Count Centre at Nemo Rangers GAA complex in Cork as count staff were distributing her 98,379 and while she was grateful to everyone who came out to vote for her, she acknowledged Sinn Féin appeared to have suffered from low turn out in working class areas.“You have to wonder why working class people don’t turn out to vote when they are the ones that are most effected by some of the policies that are being implemented - I think people probably thinking ‘ye are all the same, nothing is going to change,’ not realising the change is going to come at the ballot box.”Ms Ní Riada said that it is up to politicians and parties to get out and convince voters on the door step of the importance of voting and establish a reconnection with them as many people, particularly with regard to Europe, feel it has nothing to do with them.“One of the things I found really disheartening was there were 20,000 ballot papers that weren’t filled in the European elections -that meant people actually came to the ballot box and didn’t put in the number- 20,000 people is an awful lot - analysis has to done on that so we have democracy working at its best.”Ms Ní Riada said that she found losing her seat personally very disappointing but she found it even more disappointing for her team of seven office staff both in Brussels and Cork who had worked tirelessly for her over the last five years and she thanked them for their contribution to her work.She refused to be drawn on her own immediate future and whether she might consider running in the next General Election and said her immediate focus was reconnecting with her family who had been very supportive of her work as an MEP and her campaign to get re-elected.“No doubt people will forgive me for taking time out and regrouping with my family who have been tremendous support - I have exams going on with Junior Cert and Leaving Cert so like all other mammies out there, that is my priority at the moment and we will see in due course,” she said."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3915481.1559733972!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"joe biden s climate action plan goes well beyond obama s goals","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFormer US vice-president Joe Biden campaigning  in Berlin, New Hampshire, on Tuesday, as he unveiled a climate plan. Photograph: Elizabeth FrantzThe New York TimesWhen Joe Biden was Barack Obama’s vice-president, their administration brokered the landmark Paris climate accord and imposed the nation’s first federal regulations for cutting carbon dioxide emissions. Now, as Biden runs for president, he has laid out an ambitious climate plan of his own that goes well beyond what Obama achieved, proposing $1.7 trillion in spending and a tax or fee on planet-warming pollution with the aim of eliminating the US’s net carbon emissions by 2050.The sweeping proposal from the typically moderate Biden demonstrates just how far the Democratic field has moved on climate change. His environmental targets are similar to the goals of the Green New Deal put forward by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, which even House Democratic speaker Nancy Pelosi has been unwilling to embrace.Biden’s proposals came just hours before a rival candidate, senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, released her own climate proposal as part of a $2 trillion green manufacturing plan. Her plan would create a National Institutes of Clean Energy and push federal spending toward American-made renewable energy technology.As the Democratic base increasingly demands action on climate change, other candidates have unfurled major environmental policies. Governor Jay Inslee of Washington is focusing his entire campaign on climate change, and Beto O’Rourke has also released a proposal.“Climate change is an incredibly important issue for the Democratic base right now,” said Nick Gourevitch, a Democratic pollster who said he is neutral in the race. “It’s about the future, and it’s something that this president has made worse in the minds of the Democratic base,” he added, referring to President Donald Trump.Biden faces deep scepticism from the liberal wing of his party, even as he leads most early polls. How far he would go on climate change seemed to be a daily question in his first month as a candidate. Senator Bernie Sanders, who is also running for president, and Ocasio-Cortez took swipes at him over that issue.On Tuesday, however, environmental activists largely lauded Biden’s plan and credited the influence of the Green New Deal. “He put out a comprehensive climate plan that cites the Green New Deal and names climate change as the greatest challenge facing America and the world,” said Varshini Prakash, executive director of the Sunrise Movement, an environmental activist group that has championed Ocasio-Cortez’s proposal. “The pressure worked.”Targeting youthBiden’s base tilts toward older and more centrist voters, rather than the younger progressives who are traditionally more closely associated with environmental concerns. But Biden has said that he has “never been middle of the road on the environment”, stressing on the campaign trail that he was an early advocate for combating climate change and frequently referring to work he did on that issue dating to the 1980s, when he was a Delaware senator.Democratic pollsters say that in surveys and focus groups, climate change often emerges as the second most important issue to the party’s primary voters, after healthcare – a departure from previous presidential campaign cycles when the environment was sometimes an afterthought.“We’ve seen the ground shift, certainly in the Democratic Party and with Democratic voters, around the importance of climate change,” said Anna Greenberg, a Democratic pollster who is working for former governor John Hickenlooper of Colorado, another presidential candidate.In some ways, Biden’s plan goes even further than the Green New Deal, which offers aspirational targets but few concrete policy steps to achieve them. Biden proposes that Congress pass a law by 2025 to establish some form of price or tax on carbon dioxide pollution, a policy championed by most economists as the most effective way to fight climate change. Obama tried but failed to pass such a bill in 2010 after Republicans successfully attacked the idea of a carbon price as a national energy tax – and that was when Democrats controlled both the House and Senate.Obama later drew criticism from Republicans for bypassing Congress and using his executive authority to instate the nation’s first major federal climate change policies, including regulations to curb planet-warming pollution from tailpipes and smokestacks.But he never came close to a plan like Biden’s, intended to eliminate the nation’s carbon emissions by midcentury, pledging instead that the United States would lower its emissions 26 per cent to 28 per cent below 2005 levels by 2025. Biden’s plan calls for a federal investment of $1.7 trillion over 10 years into clean energy and other initiatives, which the campaign said would be paid for by rolling back Trump’s tax breaks for corporations. It also proposes leveraging state, private and local funds for a total expenditure of $5 trillion over a decade.It pledges support for environmental justice programmes, designed to help minorities and poor people disproportionately harmed by pollution, and urges an end to new permits for oil and gas exploration on public lands. Biden, who is seeking to appeal to blue-collar workers who helped deliver states in the industrial Midwest to Trump in 2016, promised retraining programmes and new economic opportunities for coal workers and others displaced by the decline of the fossil fuel economy.“We’re not going to forget the workers, either,” Biden said in a video promoting the plan. Biden’s proposal “would be an effective climate change policy,” said Richard Newell, president of Resources for the Future, a nonpartisan Washington research organisation focused on energy and environment issues. “But for the kinds of shifts envisioned in this plan and the other Democratic plans, there needs to be a sea change in Congress.”‘Socialist policy ideals’A spokeswoman for Trump’s re-election campaign reiterated on Tuesday the president’s frequent criticism of climate plans like the Green New Deal. “If they want to win the nomination, all of the Democrats will ultimately have no choice but embrace the Green New Deal, which is just a wish list of unrealistic, socialist policy ideals,” the spokeswoman, Erin Perrine, said in a statement.Hours after the Biden campaign rolled out the proposal, an official with a progressive group and an article in the conservative Daily Caller flagged a handful of sentences in the document that appeared to borrow language from other organisations.It resurrected a sensitive issue for the Biden campaign: Accusations of plagiarism forced Biden out of the presidential race in 1988. “Several citations, some from sources cited in other parts of the plan, were inadvertently left out of the final version of the 22-page document,” the campaign said in a statement on Tuesday. “As soon as we were made aware of it, we updated to include the proper citations.”Other candidates have set out their own far-reaching goals. Warren said on Tuesday she would spend $2 trillion over 10 years for environmentally sustainable research, manufacturing and exports, intended to help “achieve the ambitious targets of the Green New Deal”. She also favours a moratorium on new federal fossil fuel leases on public lands.Warren pitched her plan as part of a broad programme of economic intervention to support US manufacturing and promote job creation. She, too, said she would prioritise investments in historically marginalised communities and provide benefits for fossil fuel workers.Inslee has called for the nation to eliminate its net carbon emissions by 2045 and has proposed $3 trillion in federal spending to create eight million green energy jobs. And O’Rourke would spend $1.5 trillion over a decade on climate and clean energy programmes, with plans to leverage an additional $3.5 trillion in state, local and other funding.Several other candidates, including Sanders and senators Kamala Harris, Kirsten Gillibrand and Cory Booker, have formally backed the Green New Deal legislation but have not put forth their own major climate change policies.Targeting ChinaBiden’s most aggressive initiatives call for flexing the United States’ trade and foreign policy muscles to compel other countries, particularly China, the world’s largest carbon dioxide polluter, to reduce emissions. Combining climate change policy with trade policy, the plan calls for the imposition of “carbon tariffs” on goods imported from heavily polluting economies, a move that would directly affect Chinese imports. It also gives Biden, a former chairman of the Senate foreign relations committee, a chance to highlight his credentials in the international arena.“We can no longer separate trade policy from our climate objectives,” the Biden campaign wrote. “Biden will not allow other nations, including China, to game the system by becoming destination economies for polluters, undermining our climate efforts and exploiting American workers and businesses.”While the idea of placing tariffs or quotas based on pollution associated with specific imported goods has long been discussed in Washington, it has never been enacted, in part out of fear of sparking a trade war. But Trump has already started the process to tax nearly everything China sends to the United States.The president also has pledged to withdraw the country from the Paris climate agreement. Biden’s plan calls for the United States to rejoin the agreement and to take the lead in pushing members of the pact to regularly strengthen their pledges to reduce planet-warming pollution, although such a mechanism is already built into the original text of the accord.A Biden administration would convene a world summit of the most heavily polluting economies, the campaign said, and Biden would urge those nations to commit to even more ambitious pollution reduction plans. – New York Times"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/05/17/TELEMMGLPICT000147339863_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"judges given new expenses policy telegraph discovers judiciary","story":"The Ministry of Justice approved expenses including shampoo and crockery.  Lord Chief Justice, Lord Ian Burnett, pictured, claimed for multiple journeys to and from his homeMinistry of JusticeThe judiciary are to be given a new expenses policy after The Daily  found that Britain\u0027s most senior judges have claimed for crockery, shampoo and a taxi to transport ceremonial robes on taxpayer-funded expenses.Expenses data released under the Freedom of Information Act shows how some of the most high-profile members of the judiciary in England and Wales have had claims for everyday items as well first-class trains approved, even though they receive a salary of at least £180,000.At present, judges are encouraged to follow the expenses policy for Ministry of Justice (MOJ) civil servants, and the judiciary has also set out specific guidance relating to travel, accommodation and relocation....To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletMinistry of JusticeComment: One day, Jeremy Corbyn will have to go.

And for the record, I’ve been reassured that it is all very possible.” Ms Longfield says it is right, as proposed under a new “game-changing” statutory code, that social media sites such as Facebook and Instagram should be required to block under-13s or face punitive fines.Duty of Care | Time for the government to actUnder the age-appropriate code, which is due to become law this year, the companies will have to introduce effective age checks, or treat all their users like children.Those that fail to do so risk fines of up to 4 per cent of global turnover, equivalent to £1.5 billion for Facebook. “For too long, the balance of power between children and the platforms they use has been firmly fixed in favour of the latter.This code could be the first step in redressing the balance,” said Ms Longfield. “Of course, it would be surprising if there was not a flurry of pushback from the tech companies, as so often happens when industry is asked to change its ways. “We will be told it would take a very long time, that it will negate the experience of the activity or that it simply can’t be done.”Duty of care puffShe said one company had told her that current age verification technology was appropriate for them because they needed users to get online “seamlessly”. “But why should it be? If it’s a choice between children having to wait a small amount of time to get on to a site, and continuing to allow them on sites they shouldn’t be on, then to me the answer is obvious,” she added.Ms Longfield backed The Daily ’s campaign for a statutory duty of care, which is to be introduced by the Government.She said the companies should start introducing the changes now, rather than waiting for the Government’s planned legislation.She is incredulous at their claims that they don’t have the technology to do it and that they are obfuscating by claiming they want people to be able to go seamlessly online without checks.“Instead of trying to hold up the inevitable, it would be wise to get ahead of the curve,” she said.  Duty of Care CampaignPlease review our commenting policyComment: One day, Jeremy Corbyn will have to go.

We need your help.”Flanked by big brand designer stores, Caffe Greco is a top draw for tourists visiting the Eternal City and its current owner, the Israelite Hospital, wants to cash on its popularity by raising the rent.The current lease expired in September 2017 and the café’s management recently lost a lengthy legal battle to stay.Management says the owner wants to raise the €17,000 (£15,000) monthly rent so it is more in keeping with the much higher rents paid by the surrounding luxury stores in Rome’s premier shopping street.Caffe Greco is the second oldest coffee shop in Italy after the Caffe Florian in VeniceThere are also unconfirmed reports of  plans to lease the café  to the luxury Italian fashion brand Moncler but Carlo Pellegrini, the café’s manager, is fighting to stay. “Caffe Greco is public heritage,” said Mr Pellegrini in a video published on the café website.“It belongs to all Italians, in particular to the city of Rome. It’s hard to understand why they want to suspend this partnership that has gone on for 100 years.”The cafe is certainly a quaint reminder of a forgotten era. Its burgundy walls are lined with paintings and photos of some of its most famous clients and tourists pay several pounds to sip their cappuccino at tiny marble-topped tables or plush velvet sofas.Named after its Greek owner, the café has weathered 250 years of turbulent history. It’s seen invasions, political upheaval and cultural renaissance.Casanova, the notorious Venetian playboy, once stopped by and so too did the legendary American showman, William Frederick Cody, better known as ‘Buffalo Bill’, who dropped in for a coffee with a posse of cowboys in 1890.Now the café, declared a cultural treasure by the Italian government in 1953, is expected to close on June 12 and police may be forced to intervene if the managers and staff refuse to hand over the keys.Giovanni Naccarato, the director-general of the hospital, was unavailable for comment but told Italian media there was no way the café would close.“It can’t be anything but a café, this we can assure you,” Mr Naccarato told the Italian daily Il Messaggero. “Its administration will be maintained and all its precious assets will remain inside there.”A spokesman for Mr Naccarato stressed there would simply be a change of management and the café’s historic interior and the furnishings would be protected.He said it was too early to say whether Moncler would assume the lease. “Many brands have expressed interest,” the spokesman told The .If the luxury brand Moncler takes over the café it will be following many of its rivals who have moved into hospitality. Prada bought the historic Milan pasticceria, Marchesi, while Giorgio Armani has a hotel, cafe and restaurant in the heart of the city’s fashion district.Comment: One day, Jeremy Corbyn will have to go.

I’m sure that in Brussels they will respect these intentions.”Mr Salvini has been emboldened by the strong performance of his party, the League, in the European elections last month.The League insisted on Wednesday that it would not back down in its clash with the EU.Our economy is already flat, if we cut spending or raise taxes we will definitely go into recession, is that what the Commission wants?, Claudio Borghi, the party’s point-man on economics, told Reuters. The coalition would stop at nothing to prevent new belt-tightening measures. We are very determined on this, he said.Matteo Salvini, leader of The League party, might be tempted to pull the plug on the Italian coalitionThe battle with Brussels could spark the downfall of the Italian coalition, analysts warned.If Mr Salvini’s spending plans are thwarted, he might blame his coalition partners, the Five Star Movement, which has been more conciliatory towards Brussels.He could then engineer a crisis and demand fresh elections, positioning himself at the helm of a centre-Right coalition that would include Silvio Berlusconi’s Forza Italia party and the far-Right Brothers of Italy party. He could be prime minister within months.“We believe that Mr Salvini will probably be tempted to pull the plug sooner rather than later. The most likely scenario is some form of government crisis around the 2020 budget negotiations late this year, followed by an early election in the first half of 2020.”Please review our commenting policyD-Day commemorations: Queen pays tribute to \u0026#39resilience of wartime generation - my generation\u0026#39 - latest newsComment: One day, Jeremy Corbyn will have to go.

The operation became the largest seaborne invasion in history.To mark the 75th anniversary of the D-Day landings,  readers have shared their own stories from the conflict. From tales passed down from previous generations to vivid memories belonging to readers who were alive during the conflict - the stories we have received have, as ever, been extremely poignant and insightful.“Those who planned the largest seaborne invasion in history were acutely conscious that they were producing a highly complex, lengthy plan that had to be communicated to very many people while remaining secret until the last moment”, says  reader Robert Watt.Mr Watt\u0027s father, William Smith Watt, was a fellow and tutor in Classics at Balliol College from 1938 to 1952 who was seconded from his fellowship to become a civilian intelligence officer in the British Naval Intelligence Division during the war. The ision worked to solve the pressing challenges surrounding the printing and publication of the plan for D-Day.“Mistakes in accuracy could have cost many lives and a leak could have lost the war,” explained Robert.The solution came in the form of two printers who worked at the Clarendon Press on Broad Street, based in close proximity to Oxford’s Bodleian library where the planning and strategy for D-Day took place.Inside the printworks, the two men were tasked with printing the plans required for D-Day in its entirety, continuing to work night after night when nobody else was in the building.  They were chosen “because both had sons who would be on the Normandy beaches in the first wave of the landings”, says Mr Watt. “Needless to say, the plans were printed without a single error and they remained secret.”“The original Operation Overlord plan was to invade on the morning of June 5, 1944, buta terrible storm swept in overnight jeopardising the entire operation, so the landings were delayed by 24 hours”, explains Sir Andrew Gregory.Both of Sir Gregory’s parents contributed to the war effort. His mother, Alison Egerton, was a Third Officer working in the Operations Room of Southwick House, General Eisenhower’s D-Day headquarters just north of Portsmouth in June 1944.On the day, Sir Gregory’s father, Dick Gregory, a captain in the 7th Field Regiment, said that his unit “just wanted to get to the beaches so we could get on with it – and get off these awful boats!Dick Gregory and Alison EgertonSo, on the morning of June 6, 1944, as thousands of British, US and Canadian troops stormed the beaches of Normandy, Sir Gregory’s mother was moving markers on the map board in Southwick House that showed the progress of the invasion fleet - with one of those markers denoting the location of her future husband, and Sir Gregory’s father.  When the Allied forces landed, Dick found himself on Sword Beach - one of five code-named landing zones for the invasion. His tank was hit by an 88mm anti-tank weapon and he was then evacuated that night. “As he told me, he spent less than a day in France and two years being patched back up again,” recalls Sir Gregory.Another  reader, Simon Muggleton, shared the story of his father’s experience as a Royal Navy Coxswain on D-Day. Charles Muggleton, now 94 years of age, was just 19 on the day of the invasion. He carried mines and ammunition on his craft for the troops going ashore.Charles Muggelton and Prince Charles on the 70th anniversary of D-Day“Halfway across the Channel the steering broke and they (Charles and his men in the landing craft) drifted towards land, being fired upon by a German tank,” explained Simon.  “He eventually landed with the Canadians at Courcelles, Normandy, where they unloaded.During our visit in June 1994 the Canadian veterans kept telling him he was at the wrong place until he related his story of the disabled landing craft.”   “Darling, something special is happening and you must come down to the front garden and watch the airplanes,” said Arthur Bole’s mother on the evening of June 5, 1944. “It is a memory so clear in my head as if it were yesterday and I shall never forget that moment in my life.”More than seven decades on, Mr Bole recounts the memories of wartime from his childhood. Like many other children who were relocated from London to rural England, Arthur grew up surrounded by the coming and goings of American troops in Somerset. He recalls vividly one day in 1944 when an American Sherman tank stopped outside his family’s cottage and an American sergeant picked him up and sat a young Mr Bole in the driver\u0027s seat.Brenda Rickinson and her half-brother Telegraph reader Brenda Dickinson was fourteen on D-Day, and recalls her mother and father listening to the wireless for news whilst her brother Leonard Frank Orr served on the frontline in France.Brenda’s parents would play Leonard’s recordings of Dvorak’s Slavonic Dances in the evenings. Leonard was wounded as he drove a lorry over Nijmegen bridge and died on September 28th at Arnhem. Even today Ms Dickinson “can never hear the Slavonic Dances without wanting to cry.”.“I have visited Leonard’s grave at Oosterbeek four times with the Royal British Legion,” Brenda says. “It is strange that, as the years go by, Leonard’s loss seem to grieve me more and more. Why do I have a lump in my throat when I think of D-Day and all those brave men facing such danger, injury and death? I can’t believe that it was seventy-five years ago.”Following the D-Day operation, Thomas Frank Edwards, the grandfather of  reader Laura Edwards, assisted a Belgian family with the rebuilding of their farm after it had been raided by German soldiers. On the day itself, he had been a driver for the Royal Army Service Corps on Gold Beach. Subsequently, “after the War had ended, they became lifelong friends and her family is still in contact with ours today,” says Ms Edwards.  Her grandfather went on to liberate the death camps with the Eighth Army “a time he talked very little about”, admits Ms Edwards.Simon Muggleton’s father, Charles Muggelton, stayed in Normandy from D-Day until September and was involved in plenty of follow up work, until he was ferried back to the UK via a motor torpedo boat. He has made a recording for the Imperial War Museum about his D-Day activities, and was lucky enough to meet with Prince Charles on the 70th Anniversary of D-Day in Normandy.Do you have a family member who remembers the events of D-Day and lived through the conflict?

Nearly 4,000 have been found with many more being discovered all the time, and scientists have been shocked by how many of them there are.But only a limited number of them are actually able to sustain life. Many are either too close or too far away from their sun – meaning that any water, required for life, would either evaporate away or freeze up.Some of those planets, however, could also have moons. And some of those moons might have the right conditions for liquid water and therefore alien life.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s most stunning pictures of space Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.An image from Nasa\u0027s Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) shows a 200,000 mile long solar filament ripping through the Sun\u0027s corona in September 2013230 Nasa Celebrates 50 Years of SpacewalkingFor 50 years, NASA has been suiting up for spacewalking.

Doing so is difficult because the moons are so small and distant from Earth.To overcome that, Dr Sutton used computer simulations to model the rings around an exoplanet known as\u0026nbspJ1407b. Those rings are 200 times bigger than\u0026nbsp those around Saturn and researchers looked to see whether the gaps in them were the result of moons.The research failed to show that the scattered particles around the edge of the ring were not likely to have been caused by another undiscovered moon. But the hunt for more exomoons – and the aliens that could potentially live on them – continues.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

In fact you could just look at the title, “Tipping Point”, an apt summation of where the UK is at thanks to the efforts of Fox and his disreputable friends.\u0026nbspThe report shows that the UK experienced a 13 per cent decline in FDI projects in 2018 against a 4 per cent decline across the rest of Europe. The UK’s share of all European projects slipped to 17 per cent. That’s the lowest level in two decades.\u0026nbspThe decline in manufacturing investment was particularly notable - it recorded a stunning 35 per cent fall.\u0026nbspBut the digital side is great, right? They\u0027re gagging to invest in that, and digital is, of course, the future!\u0026nbspThing is, even in that sector the figures are nothing like as rosy as Fox portrays them.\u0026nbspThe report says the UK’s market share in this area fell\u0026nbspto 23 per cent. This\u0026nbspshouldn’t come as a surprise to Fox and his colleagues. EY first flagged signs of a challenge to the UK’s leadership last year when its 27 per cent growth was significantly behind the 33 per cent recorded across the continent as a whole.\u0026nbspCare to take a stab at what’s causing figures that a responsible government (I know, I know) ought to be deeply concerned about? It’s pushing it to award a gold star to those who said Brexit because it’s screamingly obvious, as the report makes clear.\u0026nbspUnlike Fox, I’m going to be honest with\u0026nbspthe numbers. EY asked a panel of 400 investors about the impact of that godawful mess he played a major role in creating and 5 per cent said they had cut their investment. However,\u0026nbspthat was counterbalanced by 5 per cent increasing it. Where’s the problem then? Some 15 per cent had put their plans to hold, double the previous year.\u0026nbspThe investment, jobs, future prosperity etc,\u0026nbspis still available for the UK. But EY says that it will “require engagement with investors to address their concerns” before it is released.\u0026nbspThe farce of a Tory leadership battle currently taking place isn’t going to help with that, nor is the fact that the front runner is Boris Johnson, a man, remember, who infamously once said “f**k business”.\u0026nbspFox is correct that the UK has proven attractive to investors from the US. But his highlighting that glosses over yet another troubling finding by EY: It performed badly with most of the other main sources of investment cash, notably the fast growing economies that Fox and his “global Britain” pals say will pour in to replace what is lost through severing the link between us and our former friends and allies across the channel.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.110 No deal, no tariffsThe government has announced that it would slash almost all tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit.

We believe that with this adjournment, there is a reasonable prospect of reaching an agreement that the majority of landlords will support.”Shopping centre owner Intu told Arcadia\u0026nbspon Wednesday that it will not back proposals to slash rents and close around 50 stores.Created with Sketch.

Patrick Cockburn sounds out the localsClick to followThe IndependentThe River Wye flows through Herefordshire, which is more ‘feudal’ than neighbouring counties. Many big landowners ‘are the same as a hundred years ago’Herefordshire, a county of apple blossom and wild daffodils overlooked by the dark Welsh hills, is England’s arcadia. Its landscape inspired the magical land of Narnia according to CS\u0026nbspLewis. Its ancient gnarled oaks were the reputed model for the Ents, the fabulous trees that walk through the woods and talk to hobbits and wizards in JRR Tolkien’s The Lord of the Rings.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspFor anybody in search of an idyllic pastoral England, Herefordshire appears to be the right place to come. Everything is on a human scale, from the small cathedral city of Hereford with a population of 70,000, to the scattering of towns, villages, and hamlets filled with black-and-white timber frame houses. For those seeking signs of a more robust England, recalling heroic battlefields from Agincourt to Arnhem, there is the comforting presence of the SAS headquarters on the outskirts of Hereford. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspMany people living here do not relish change for understandable reasons and regret the changes in Britain since the country entered the EU a half century ago. “There is a lot of nostalgia in Herefordshire,” says local historian David Whitehead. He notes that local newspapers like to run two-page spreads of old photographs of the county in the inter-war period when life appeared to be more stable and predictable. “People feel closer to the past here than in most of England,” he says.A feeling that Britain should not abandon a successful tradition of standing on its own is particularly strong in this county, which voted to leave the EU by 59 to 41 per cent in the referendum of 2016, a result which was confirmed by the outcome of the EU parliamentary election on 24 May.Brexit voters are a broad coalition of different and often contradictory interests, held together by a conviction that the EU is the cause of their troubles. The grouping includes well-off farmers, fed up with bureaucracy but happy to receive substantial\u0026nbspsubsidies, retirees in bucolic villages, and those “left behind”\u0026nbspor “left out”\u0026nbspfor whom Britain’s EU years have brought insecure ill-paying jobs, housing too expensive to buy, and a flood of immigrants.Created with Sketch. Show all 6Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The beauty and tranquillity of Herefordshire are deceptive: polarisation over Brexit is as deep here as in Islington or Sunderland. Dr Nick Meyer, a retired GP in Ledbury in the east of the county, replied to a question about political isions by saying he was planning on the following weekend to go on a boat trip with four friends, three of whom, including himself, were staunch Remainers and the fourth a committed Leave supporters. The Remainers had wondered if they should leave their friend behind to avoid rancorous disputes, but had finally decided to include him in the hope that they might change his mind during the sailing trip.“Brexit is very destructive in the way it has created a ided Britain,” says Dr Meyer. “Feeling about it is much stronger than it is between those supporting different political parties.”The level of anxiety over Brexit is no less than in metropolitan Britain. Tom Tibbets, who two years ago started a craft cider making business, says that he suffers acutely from Brexit related worries. “I have stress-related alopecia, which means that my hair is falling out,” he says, leaning forward to show a depleted but still substantial mop of dark hair. “According to my doctor this is all stress related.”Herefordshire is more “feudal” than neighbouring counties\u0026nbspand Whitehead says that many big landowners “are the same as a hundred years ago”.\u0026nbspHe says that much of the land between Ross-on-Wye in the south and Hereford in the north belongs to the Duchy of Cornwall, a purchase they made in the 1950s.Overall, however, \u0026nbspHerefordshire is an impoverished county with few jobs for young people, who go elsewhere for work, while well-off professionals from London and Birmingham buy local houses for half the price they would pay at home. “It is an underdeveloped county with poor roads, social services, buses and schools,” says Dr Meyer, who has worked in Herefordshire as a doctor for 30 years.In Herefordshire, as in the rest of Britain, it is easy to discover the reasons why people want Britain to stay in the EU: they make concrete arguments about the economically disastrous consequences of leaving. But Brexiters have a different set of priorities revolving around the supposed threat to Britain’s independence as a nation state by power-hungry bureaucrats in Brussels and other continental capitals. This argument is buttressed by compelling if dubious claims that the EU has for years been bleeding Britain financially and, once out, we will get the money back. \u0026nbspJohn Forsyth is one of many former SAS soldiers who has stayed in Herefordshire and works as a health and safety consultant. He says he voted as a young soldier in the 1975 referendum in favour of membership of the Common Market, but he was dismayed to find that “it has evolved towards a state of Europe”. He sees the EU as corrupt, incompetent and undemocratic: “The reason I want to leave is that I see the EU as this inflexible bureaucratic monstrosity. We would do better to look after our own interests and be able to change our own laws.” He believes that that the referendum did lead to an upsurge in racism, to which he is much opposed, and agrees that Britain has been politically polarised by Brexit, though he believes this will disappear \u0026nbspin time.He does not use the word ‘self-determination’ but his views are very similar to those of nationalists the world over, from the American fighting for independence in the 18th century to the Irish and Indians in the 20th. In all cases, there was a natural desire by people to control their own lives and a tendency to blame all their ills on the British government. Many of the criticisms were justified but scapegoating contains hidden dangers, whether the target is London or Brussels, because it means that those seeking to break free from a detested central authority do not have to devise practical policies of their own. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspEven so, it is strange to hear farmers in Herefordshire say they voted to leave the EU when they have benefited immensely from its subsidies. “The county voted massively for Brexit, but the people who are going to lose from Brexit are the farmers,” says James Marsden, an environmentalist who formerly worked for the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra). The most important of these is “the basic payment scheme of £205 per hectare, which is paid not on what you do, but on how much land you own.” He says that outside the EU the smaller farmers will inevitably go the wall unless, as the Defra minister Michael Gove proposed last year, subsidies are in future geared to farmers cultivating the land in an environmentally friendly way.Ents, in Tolkien’s ‘Lord of the Rings’\u0026nbsp(Alamy)For now the reverse is happening: Marsden pointed through the windows of the house where we were talking at the pretty-looking cider apple orchard where the uniform rows of bush-sized trees were in full bloom. “What we are looking at,” he said, “is an intensely managed monoculture: the trees are not managed by hand but by machinery they are sprayed four times a year there are herbicidal patches beneath the trees. From the point of view of ersity, you might as well be growing rape seed or grain.”\u0026nbspOverall, Brexit will have two contradictory consequences for the rural environment: it will help preserve it because there will be fewer\u0026nbspfarmers, but will also damage it because those who stay in business – the larger ones with more capital to buy new machinery - will exploit it more intensively unless they are tightly regulated. He says small hill farmers in Wales, where he works part of the time, are highly conscious that they are facing extinction post-Brexit, but “in my parish in Herefordshire, they are still in denial”.Some are, in fact, deeply worried about their future. Owen Whittall \u0026nbspfarms cattle, sheep and mixed crops on 800 acres and is conflicted about Brexit. “I remember the morning of the referendum. My wife voted ‘in’ and I voted ‘out’ and I was not a happy person. I felt very uneasy with my decision and I am still not happy.”He thinks that many of the smaller farmers will not survive outside the EU unless they get a second job, intensify their farming, or accept a lower standard of living. He says with some scorn that a lot of well-paid professional people from the cities will be “buying idyllic little farms with a few Hereford and Dexter cattle and doing the lifestyle thing”.Dr Meyer, the Ledbury GP, says: “It will be disastrous for the farming community, but most farmers I know were for Brexit.” He says that one important reason for this was the EU’s bureaucratic hoops that even fervent Remainers confirm are fearsomely difficult. Tom Tibbets, the cider-maker who campaigned against Brexit, says he knows from personal experience that even moving a pig to the abattoir for personal consumption requires endless time-consuming paperwork. On the other hand, once these bureaucratic hurdles are negotiated, the flat rate subsidy is paid without further effort. Farmers do not volunteer what they get\u0026nbspbut one, on a medium-sized farm, said they were getting £30,000 a year.This is all very different from Narnia. Julian Whitmarsh, who owns the “Jules” restaurant’ in the picture post card village of Weobley, has a caustic take on social developments in rural Herefordshire. “Agriculture has ceased to be a craft and has become an industry,” he says. “It employs fewer and fewer people because the big farms that once employed eight workers now employ one.” He complains that villages are full of people who have sold their houses in the cities and “put on green wellies and are playing at Ambridge” (the fictional village in The Archers, the long-running BBC radio soap opera on rural life).His explanation as to why so many people in Herefordshire voted against their own best interests is that they are instinctively right wing and badly informed. Then there are the newspapers on which they rely for information about the EU and everything else in the world. He says: “The Daily Mail sells 50 copies every morning in Weobley and The Daily  almost as many copies. while there are about five who buy  and quite a few of us buy the i.”\u0026nbsp The strong Liberal Democrat and Green vote in the European parliamentary election in Herefordshire does not quite confirm this picture of right wing domination, but it sounds broadly correct.Not all agriculture is industrialised. Cider apples can be shaken loose and hoovered up by machine, but not eating apples, blue berries or strawberries which must be picked by hand. Workers are still needed to do the dirty jobs in the poultry units that are springing up all over the county. Such jobs have been done hitherto by a great influx of foreign labour from Eastern Europe who not only work as pickers or pruners but as vets in the abattoirs and managers in the hotels. Farmers say that this labour force, on which they depend, is in increasingly short supply because of fears of Brexit, the low value of the pound and improved economies in Poland, Hungry and elsewhere.Corbyn is right – only a general election can unite Leave and RemainRemain parties must ditch tribalism and work to stop a no-deal BrexitRenewable energy lets consumers save money and the planetIf sugar is killing us, why does Britain farm so much of it?Esther Rudge, a fourth generation farmer, worries about whether or not she will be able to go on getting the 30 foreign labourers, mostly Poles, whom she has formerly employed to pick her eating apples. Others face greater problems which they may be slow to appreciate: she and her husband have friends “who employ 1,000 foreign workers but still voted Leave”.An even greater threat facing British farming is the prospect that, after a no-deal Brexit, a British government might be desperate for a trade deal with the United States. The price for this might be the opening up of the British market to cheap American farm produce. “Agriculture could be the sacrificial lamb,” Rudge believes, “so you would get cheap beef and chicken coming into the country.” Even without such a deal, she fears that a British crash out of the EU leading to trade on WTO rules would ruin the British livestock industry.Some commentators have compared the prospects for British farming after Brexit as being like playing Russian roulette, but with only one chamber of the revolver unloaded. Others, with long experience of farming in the region,\u0026nbsphave a less cataclysmic but still gloomy view of the prospects for farmers. Francis Chester-Master, a landowner and land agent, gives a summary of the prospects with or without Brexit.Chester-Master says that what is most damaging for rural Britain is the continued uncertainty over whether or not Britain will leave the EU. But this uncertainty may not be a temporary problem supposing Brexit occurs. Rudge, who runs a successful medium-sized farm, says that outside the EU Britain “will be a small fish in a large pool” and small fish necessarily live day to day at the mercy of forces they do not control. Old certainties are evaporating and nobody can predict what will take their place.\u0026nbsp The farmers of Hereford – and in the rest of Britain – have deepened the uncertainties they were seeking to escape.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The season of donning evening dress to sit in the sun in the afternoon. The season of picnics and strolling across graceful, manicured lawns. The season of drinking Pimm’s and champagne. The season of that quintessentially English art form – country house opera.Yes, there is indeed opera, opera that is usually of a very high calibre with celebrated singers and directors. But at the end of the customary 90-minute intervals to consume those picnics and Pimm’s, it is not unknown for some opera-goers to forget what has happened in the first half, or even which opera they are seeing.Country house opera is opera like no other. It should be stressed that for all the corporate visitors and aristocracy that the staggeringly high ticket prices (up to £250 at Glyndebourne) ensures, there are still numerous visitors among those categories and well beyond who both love and are highly knowledgeable of opera.But let’s not be too po-faced about it. It is still fun to watch high society at play in those long intervals. It is still a beautiful feeling to sit in some of the most elegant surroundings and, in the case of Glyndebourne, have a sheep wander to within a few feet of you and after about the 70th\u0026nbspminute of the long interval watch a well refreshed opera-goer attempt to converse with it. And it is illuminating to discover that in every case, country house opera is the result of the unbridled enthusiasm of iniduals whose eccentricity, determination and passion permeates their venues.I recently visited the newest kid on the block, Grange Park Opera in West Horsley, Surrey. For those unfamiliar with the tangled web of country house opera, it is necessary to state that Grange Park Opera is not to be confused with Grange Park Opera. The two venues are not that many miles apart, one in Surrey, the other in Hampshire, near Winchester. Wasfi Kani used to run the Hampshire one, but left and took the brand with her and set up the new one in Surrey. As CEO she has personally raised £10m from private donors in just a year.Traviata’\u0026nbsp(Getty)Brands are important in country house opera, though one must have sympathy for the unfortunate opera-loving motorists who end up at the wrong Grange Park. To be fair the old Grange Park Opera now styles itself The Grange Festival. But an element of confusion remains.“This is the champagne lawn,” said Ms Kani, showing me round the new Grange Park Opera at West Horsley. These are the very words one hopes to hear from the head of a country house opera venue. “I won’t shake hands,” she added, “I’ve been working on the site this morning and my hands are dirty.” This is also an insight into running a country house opera. The bosses muck in, working in the gardens or even on the building sites in the corners that are still being constructed.The site of the new Grange Park is actually the property of Bamber Gascoigne, the original presenter of University Challenge and a long time opera aficionado. He was left the Grade I listed medieval manor house, dating from 1425, and its grounds by his great aunt, Mary Duchess of Roxburghe, in 2015, and he has had the opera house built on site. Elizabeth I and Henry VIII both stayed in the mansion, and the grounds are now an oasis of landscaped gardens set in magnificent woods.Complete with historic walled gardens, a 300-year old orchard filled with mulberry, damson, apple and pear trees and a sprawling ancient house, its five-tiered opera house is the only opera house built in Britain this century.\u0026nbspAs Ms Kani puts it: “At night time it is extraordinary, you come out of the opera house and you’re in a wood. I don’t know of any other theatre where you can do that.”Opera singer ‘asked to change pro-EU dress’Ms Kani is something of a force of nature and this fledgling opera house, in just its third season, bears the hallmarks of her own brand of startling whimsy. Take the toilets, or “Lavatorium Rotundum” as the signpost nearby has it. In the ladies, there is a flag above every cubicle which goes down when the cubicle is locked. In the gents there is a wire basket above every urinal. “They are for programmes,” says Ms Kani. “I was told that it’s hard for men to hold their programme while having a pee.”As an opera aficionado myself, and a user of the facilities in the intervals, I can only confirm this cultural observation and applaud her basket innovation.In the vestibule of the auditorium of the splendid new opera house she is planning to have a model railway under glass stopping at stations such as La Scala and other world-famous opera houses. This, again, feels somewhat unusual for country house opera.She shrugs. “We’re in entertainment. This is showbiz.”Yes, country house opera is showbiz, but not as we know it. It is showbiz where the audience is as watchable as the stars on stage. It is showbiz where the charisma and background of the owner or artistic director is a part of the action. Take another notable venue, Garsington. Now Garsington is, of course, not to be confused with Garsington. The original Garsington country house opera was in the village of Garsington, near Oxford. The new Garsington has moved further down the M40 towards London and is at Wormsley, the private Chilterns estate of Mark Getty, the brother of the late John Paul Getty III, who had his ear cut off by kidnappers in a notorious case in the Seventies that had global publicity at the time.Complete with historic walled gardens, a 300-year old orchard filled with mulberry, damson, apple and pear trees and a sprawling ancient house, its five-tiered opera house is the only opera house built in Britain this centuryMark Getty, one of the world’s richest men, is somewhat reclusive, and not always in this country, so unlikely to be spotted by opera-goers. But they do have the pleasure of entering the estate by motoring down the long drive to the lake and the cricket pitch next to the opera house, with the marquees alongside it serving as interval restaurants.The cricket pitch has sported such part-time cricketers as Getty’s chum Mick Jagger. They also have the pleasure of watching a performance in one of the only opera houses in the world that receives the daylight for its opening couple of hours, the performance rather magically becoming more intense as night falls.If Getty comes from a particularly eccentric family, he has a rival in that department in the particularly brilliant founder of Longborough Opera, beautifully situated in the heart of the Cotswolds. Martin Graham, now well into his seventies, started his opera festival in his cowshed in 1991 and has run it with his wife Lizzie before now handing over the reins, in true country house opera dynastic style, to their daughter Polly.Martin Graham is perhaps the most unusual (and entertaining) of the country house opera founders. A local man, he started as a builder’s mate in the village, became a property developer (and accomplished bricklayer) and is another of the country house elite that wasn’t afraid to get his hands dirty. He built much of his house himself. Longborough has presented Wagner’s The Ring, an astonishing achievement for a small country opera house, and has an international reputation. Chat to Martin Graham, and one minute you will be hearing about his lifelong passion for Wagner, the next will be anecdotes from the building trade. He certainly tells of how in his labourer days he once played a recording of La Boheme on the building site, and fellow builders threw bricks at the tape machine until they too became infected by his passion.At Longborough, as with the other small country house operas, no one is too grand to muck in. One top international soprano who was there for a season recalled: “The atmosphere is just so different. I’ve found Lizzie scrubbing toilets clean. Her kids are out selling tickets. There’s a real feeling of everyone mucking in.”And, of course, like other country house operas they have to find accommodation for the singers. Some are billeted in their house, where one of Lizzie’s many tasks is to supervise the sheet changing. Others go to local friends of the Grahams, who take in the tenants for a couple of free tickets.And then there is the daddy of them all, Glyndebourne. Bigger than all its rivals and with many decades more history, with its lake, meadows, more species of flowers than one can name, and, almost inevitably, a croquet lawn.\u0026nbspIt is an unforgettable sight on the meandering South Downs. A true family dynasty, it is run by Gus Christie, the affable grandson of the founder John Christie (John’s son and Gus’s father Sir George Christie ran the show in between).Gus can certainly boast that he has embraced the art form. So captivated was he with the acclaimed soprano Danielle de Niese, when she appeared at Glyndebourne, that he married her. Being literally “lady of the manor” as well as a regular star at the venue holds no worries for her. She told me when I spoke to her before one of her starring roles there a few seasons ago: “Of course, marriage has definitely added another dimension. But there’s no pressure on either side. I will not be at the long bar having drinks the night before a performance.“I have to take care of myself. It’s about self-preservation. I will do some entertaining with Gus. I love to support him and be on his arm. It’s part of my marriage. But the decision I make about doing an opera at Glyndebourne is about the casting. There have been ones where I have said no. My professional life shouldn’t be an influence on whether I spend time at home. My career is my whole life’s blood. It’s my calling.”For all the passion of those who run these venues, one often senses a hint of embarrassment that with prices so high because of a lack of any public funding, the audiences tend to be wealthy. To spread the word, and just maybe to alleviate consciences, several of the venues do work outside their home bases,\u0026nbspfrom Glyndebourne Touring Opera to a new project by Garsington in London’s inner city. And, somewhat tediously, there are the ritual announcements that, of course, one does not need to dress up.This tends to ignore the fact that people actually rather like dressing up for one delicious summer outing. And I have noticed that the very occasional person who has taken Glyndebourne at their word when they have said this, tends to stand out like the man in the Batman cartoon.Much better to allow that country house opera is expensive, but is a chance to enjoy the finest music in the finest finery. It actually adds to the sense of occasion. And the sense of occasion will be as marked this year as any with a superlative range of operas from, to pick just a few to show that range, Don Carlo and Porgy and Bess at Grange Park, The Damnation of Faust and The Barber of Seville at Glyndebourne, The Marriage of Figaro and a real rarity, a UK stage premiere of Offenbach’s Fantasio at Garsington. And, of course, the Grahams’ passion for Wagner shows no let up at Longborough with Das Rheingold among this year’s offerings.Charity Tillemann-Dick: Singer who drew music from transplanted lungsBilly Budd at the ROH is infused with a desolated tendernessWhy the ugliest opera house in Europe was worth buildingThere are other notable productions at other notable country house operas, of course, with good whispers already about A Midsummer Night’s Dream at Nevill Holt’s Riba-nominated new theatre in Leicestershire.But the joy of country house opera is that what’s on stage is not the total sum of the day’s enjoyment. Yes, the productions can be as memorable as anything one sees at the Royal Opera House\u0026nbspor ENO. But a visit leaves one with a host of other special memories. Not just the glorious settings, the walks around the lakes, the picnics and the Pimms, the opportunity sometimes to wander in a room or two of the stately homes adjoining the specially constructed opera house, and always the people-watching, the observation of high society in cultural mode, and the moments that only country house opera can provide.I can’t quite banish from my mind that a Glyndebourne insider confided in me that there is a corner window in the administrative wing where staff can, and do, see over the boundaries of the lawns into the bushes where occasionally audience members wander when they get a little too amorous by around the 80th minute of the long interval.I shall also never forget a performance of\u0026nbspMozart’s The Marriage of Figaro at the old Garsington. The side of the auditorium gave the audience a view of the surrounding countryside, and sight and sound of the elements. That night in the second half a storm blew up, and as lightning struck and a ferocious thunderclap resounded, the surtitles above the stage showed that the singers were singing the words: “All is peace, all is harmony.”Only in the distinctive and unforgettable setting of country house opera could that line have brought the house down.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We believe that with this adjournment, there is a reasonable prospect of reaching an agreement that the majority of landlords will support.”Shopping centre owner Intu told Arcadia\u0026nbspon Wednesday that it will not back proposals to slash rents and close around 50 stores.Created with Sketch.

Previous studies have shown primates and birds have this ability, but this is the first time it’s been found in insects.The discovery could lead to “exciting new pathways for future communication across species”, says lead researcher Adrian Dyer,\u0026nbspan associate professor from RMIT University in Melbourne.\u0026nbsp“We take it for granted once we’ve learned our numbers as children, but being able to recognise what ‘four’ represents actually requires a sophisticated level of cognitive ability.”He added: “Humans have over 86 billion neurons in our brains, bees have less than a million, and we’re separated by over 600 million years of evolution.\u0026nbsp“Discovering how such complex numerical skills can be grasped by miniature brains will help us understand how mathematical and cultural thinking evolved in humans, and possibly, other animals,” Dr Dyer\u0026nbspsaid.\u0026nbspThe discovery could also point to new types of computing that can replicate the bee’s highly efficient approach to processing, according to the study published in\u0026nbspProceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences.The bees were trained to enter Y-shaped mazes in which they learned to match a character with a number of elements. In each case, if they made the correct choice they were rewarded with a treat.RMIT University)They were then tested to see if they could match the character to the same quantity of other elements. A second group was trained in the opposite approach, matching a number of elements with a character.While both could grasp their specific training, the different groups were unable to reverse the association and work out what to do when tested with the opposite (character-to-number or number-to-character).“This suggests that number processing and understanding of symbols happens in different regions in bee brains, similar to the way separate processing happens in the human brain,” said Dr Scarlett Howard at RMIT.“Our results show honeybees are not at the same level as the animals that have been able to learn symbols as numbers and perform complex tasks.“But the results have implications for what we know about learning, reversing tasks, and how the brain creates connections and associations between concepts.”Gardeners urged to let lawns run wild and count flowers to save beesMcDonald’s designs miniature restaurant for beesDozens of bee species extinct or on verge of disappearing across UKPrevious research has shown pigeons, parrots, chimpanzees and monkeys can also learn that symbols represents numbers.\u0026nbspChimpanzees, for example, have been taught Arabic numbers and were\u0026nbspable to order them correctly. An African grey parrot called Alex learned the names of numbers and could\u0026nbspadd up quantities.“Understanding how tiny bee brains manage information opens paths to bio-inspired solutions that use a fraction of the power of conventional processing systems,” said Dr Dyer.\u0026nbsp“When we’re looking for solutions to complex problems, we often find that nature has already done the job far more elegantly and efficiently,” he said.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This\u0026nbspprevents light being reflected off them, meaning\u0026nbspthey are invisible to potential prey, according to the latest research.\u0026nbsp“They spend most of their time sitting around with their jaws open, waiting for something to come by,” said lead researcher Audrey Velasco-Hogan, a PhD student at the University of California San Diego.\u0026nbsp“Their teeth are always exposed, so it’s important that they are transparent so they don’t reflect or scatter any bioluminescent light from the environment.”Despite measuring just 15 centimetres in length, deep-sea dragonfish (Aristostomias scintillans) are apex predators and feed on fish that are up to half their size. They are so voracious that they even eat each other.\u0026nbspnanocrystals (Audrey Velasco)If their teeth were visible, prey would immediately shy away, researchers say.Scientists analysed the nanostructure of the teeth by using electron microscopy, which is a technique used to obtain high-resolution images of biological specimens.\u0026nbspThey discovered that like humans, dragonfish have an outer enamel-like layer and an inner dentin later.The outer layer was covered in grain-sized nanocrystals arranged to prevent\u0026nbsplight being scattered or reflected off the surface of the teeth, according to the paper published in the journal Matter.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Weird \u0026amp Wonderful: life in the deep sea Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Hidden Ocean 2005 Expedition: NOAA Office of Ocean ExplorationLarva of a European lobsterSixgill shark on Santa Rosa Reef, south of GuamHidden Ocean 2005 Expedition: NOAA Office of Ocean ExplorationLarva of a European lobsterSixgill shark on Santa Rosa Reef, south of GuamThe inner\u0026nbsplayer is also\u0026nbspstructured in a different way, and does not have microscopic channels called dentin tubes which normally give teeth their ivory colour.

produce early warning system for ‘imminent, damaging’ activityClick to followThe IndependentA solar flare erupts from a giant sunspot (file photo)The UK, US and Europe will collaborate on a new space weather system\u0026nbspto protect astronauts,\u0026nbspsatellites and the Earth\u0026nbspfrom deadly solar storms.Researchers are developing an instrument which will be sent into the depths of space to monitor solar wind, the magnetised plasma which is constantly emitted from the sun.The instrument, a plasma analyser, will give early warnings of “imminent, damaging space weather”, a spokesperson for the UK’s Space\u0026nbspAgency said.“Space weather has the potential to cause severe disruption to critical satellite and ground-based infrastructure, so it’s essential that we take steps to mitigate this threat through improving our ability to forecast extreme solar activity,” said Graham Turnock, the agency’s CEO.\u0026nbspSolar storms\u0026nbsphave\u0026nbspcaused some minor problems on Earth in recent years, by disturbing the planet’s magnetic field.Created with Sketch.Jeff Bezos\u0027 plan for future space colonies Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with

to\u0026nbspskies\u0026nbspover the US.Recent solar storms have been benign\u0026nbspbut a powerful one could prove catastrophic.As well as the constant stream of solar winds, the sun periodically releases\u0026nbspbillions of tons of\u0026nbspmagnetic material.These solar events are known as coronal mass ejections\u0026nbspand pose a bigger risk to humans.Scientists fear that one such ejection could wreck the Earth’s communications systems and pose a threat to life.The Earth narrowly escaped a solar disturbance\u0026nbspin July 2012, when an extreme storm cut through its orbit and collided with a spacecraft.\u0026nbsp”If the eruption had occurred only one week earlier, Earth would have been in the line of fire,” said Daniel Baker, a scientist at the University of Colorado.“If it had hit, we would still be picking up the pieces,” he said, in remarks published in 2014.The danger\u0026nbspposed by space weather is serious enough for it to be included in the government’s National Risk Register of Civil Emergencies, due to its potential to cause disruption.The last major space weather disturbance\u0026nbsptook place in 1859, when a geomagnetic storm struck the planet in what is now known as\u0026nbspthe Carrington Event.If such a solar event were to occur today\u0026nbspit could stop communications satellites from working, break GPS systems and stop planes from flying.Mr Turnock said the new system would keep the UK “safe and secure from potential impacts of space weather.​The European Space Agency (ESA) has allocated €8m\u0026nbsp(£7m)​ of funding to the UK’s Space Agency for the project.Researchers at\u0026nbspUCL’s Mullard Space Science Laboratory will develop the instrument and will collaborate with the ESA\u0026nbspwhile developing the instrument.The team\u0026nbspwill collaborate with researchers from NASA and the US’ National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.The UK will also launch a National Space Council later this year\u0026nbspto co-ordinate the nation’s space strategy.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

There are still people who believe there is another way through this – I don’t see it.“Jeremy Corbyn is the leader of the Labour party and he makes the final call of course.”Asked if she wanted her leader to “come round”, Ms Chapman replied: “I would say that.”The comments came as the Labour-run Welsh Government officially shifted its position, in order to campaign to remain in the EU.Jeremy Miles, the Brexit minister, told the Senedd in Cardiff there was no prospect for its previous proposals for leaving with a deal that involved staying in the single market and customs union.“We sought to reconcile the result of the 2016 referendum with the least damaging kind of Brexit but that effort has now reached the end of the road,” Mr Miles said.“Faced by this sort of binary choice, we as a government must recognise these realities and change course.”The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That will be added to the 29 MEPs the party garnered when the Brexit Party finished first, nationally, in those Euro elections on 23 May. Remember, just in case Nigel Farage has allowed you to forget, that this party was only founded in April this year. The Brexit Party’s Mike Greene is the runaway bookies’ favourite to be the next MP for Peterborough. He, and Farage, will be at the centre of a media circus on Friday, with the reverberations rumbling into the Tory leadership contest. After all, Peterborough voted 60 per cent leave in the 2016 EU referendum, and only 5 per cent of the electorate signed the petition to revoke Article 50 this year, well below the national average. Peterborough is Brexit country.The question, really, is who will come second. And what kind of second? A borderline miss to hang on to the seat, or humiliation?At the 2017 general election, Peterborough was a Lab-Con marginal, gained by Labour’s Fiona Onasanya by all of 607 votes, a majority representing just 1.3 per cent of the poll. The Conservatives had held Peterborough since 2005. It was one of the lost seats that robbed Theresa May of an overall majority.Created with Sketch.‘Telling, petty and sour’  Labour figures react to Campbell expulsion Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Deputy leader Tom Watson calls the decision spitefulColumnist and Labour campaigner Owen Jones tweets in favour of Campbell\u0027s expulsionPeter Kyle takes a dig at the Corbyn regime......and calls for humility in the face of electoral defeatIn a comment retweetd by Liz Kendall, Jess Phillips compares and contrastsHarriet Harman refers to the rulebookMargaret Hodge raises the antisemitism questionDeputy leader Tom Watson calls the decision spitefulColumnist and Labour campaigner Owen Jones tweets in favour of Campbell\u0027s expulsionPeter Kyle takes a dig at the Corbyn regime......and calls for humility in the face of electoral defeatIn a comment retweetd by Liz Kendall, Jess Phillips compares and contrastsHarriet Harman refers to the rulebookMargaret Hodge raises the antisemitism questionIn a normal world this classic marginal constituency – middle England almost literally – would be a hotly contested battle between the two main parties. Of course it is not. The Tories aren’t even in the running this time. They finished fourth in Peterborough in the Euro elections, only a smidgen ahead of the greens on a little over 10 per cent. They could easily end up fifth now, when only two years ago they held it. Those with long memories may recall that, in the Thatcher-Major era, it was once a safe-ish seat held by one-time Conservative Party chairman Brian Mawhinney.Tories have the perfect alibi – Brexit and leadership chaos. Self-inflicted, yes, but it allows them to at least say “all will be well with a new leader and when we deliver Brexit”. No one believes that. What is happening now is very clear. The working class, Brexit-supporting, discontented section of the Tory vote is defecting en masse to the Brexit Party, and the moderate, professional, pro-EU wing is off to the Lib Dems.That should mean that Labour would hold the seat easily. Except of course that Brexit is simply so very large in Peterborough – 38.1 per cent of the vote in the Euro elections.Compare the Brexit Party’s showing with that of Labour – a poor second on\u0026nbsp17.1 per cent in the European poll and the Lib Dems on 15.3 per cent. That, in turn, compares with the Lib Dem showing of just 3.3 per cent in the 2017 general election.So you can see where the momentum is going, and it is not to Labour. It would not take much for the Lib Dems to edge ahead of Corbyn’s candidate, Lisa Forbes.The bookies seem to think Labour is still stronger than the Lib Dems, but it may not turn out to be by very much at all.Labour has endured another week of ridiculously bad headlines, from the row over backing a second referendum, to the Alastair Campbell affair, through more credible allegations of antisemitism, Corbyn’s anti-Trump posturing, and an unwise tweet by Labour’s candidate, for which she has apologised. Jewish groups called on Labour to disown her. It does feel like a campaign on the slide. Desperate emails to Labour members to come and help add to the sense of panic and despair.Labour urged to disown by-election candidate over antisemitic postWhy has Nigel Farage refused to stand in the Peterborough by-election?I was asked to stand for Remain in Peterborough – here’s why I said noPro-EU parties fail to find joint candidate for upcoming by-electionAs the Brexit Party is doing to the Tories, so the Lib Dems are outflanking Labour on Brexit, and especially attracting Labour’s professional, educated “moderate” centre-left voters, leaving the rest to be picked off by the Brexit Party and apathy (staying home). It is precisely what is happening across England (Wales and Scotland have the added complication of the nationalist parties – generally also depressing the Labour vote).More deprived than the national average, with lower ages and life expectancies, higher than average levels of migration, suffering from austerity, council tax up six\u0026nbspper cent and cuts to local services, Peterborough should be an easy Labour win. It is worth mentioning that Tony Blair won here by a landslide in 1997, delivering a majority of 7,323, and just over half of the vote. To get from there to about one in 10 voters is quite something.So there is some chance that the Liberal Democrats should elbow Labour into third place in Peterborough by, say, 100 votes. But even if Labour hangs on to its national second place, it would be far behind the Brexit Party, and a far from a convincing result. The tussle between Labour and the Lib Dems for second ranking may come down to the effect of the fringe parties such as Ukip and various independents. There are 15 candidates in all to help confuse Peterborians.Distant second or third placed – the reverberations of such another disastrous showing for Labours should – should – reach right into the\u0026nbspoffice of Leader of the Opposition and his remarkably complacent\u0026nbspteam of advisers – the likes of Unite leader Len McCluskey\u0026nbsp– who tells them to “hold their nerve”. They may hold their nerve, but if they cannot hold places like Peterborough when the Tory party is disintegrating and has given up the fight, then Labour really has had it.The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke). The result is a film without any direction that serves as a Trojan horse set-up for the Avengers.21. When the Thor franchise lost its director Kenneth Branagh between the first and second films, it also had to kiss goodbye to the Shakespearean theatrics that had lent it a sense of goofy charm. Directed by Game of Thrones’s Alan Taylor, The Dark World prioritises its VFX effects above all else. It’s a dull affair: Christopher Eccleston’s Malekith is (by far) Marvel’s worst villain, being a pile of prosthetics with zero personality, while Chris Hemsworth’s Thor completes one of the most unrealistic London Tube journeys in all of cinematic history.20. Edward Norton’s version of the smashing Hulk often gets forgotten by Marvel fans – and for good reason. Whereas Mark Ruffalo’s bumbling interpretation of the character has a gravitational charm, Norton’s moping monster is void of any charisma. With Liv Tyler phoning in her performance as love interest, Betty Ross, the film falls emotionally flat and serves only as a by-the-numbers origins story.422 Avengers: Age of Ultron19. Just in case we’d forgotten that the Disney corporation is an all-consuming titan that owns half of Hollywood, the sequel to 2012’s Avengers decided to sneak in a little corporate synergy: when Iron Man accidentally creates a sentient robot (voiced by James Spader) who decides the earth’s only salvation is through the destruction of humanity, he announces his grim plans with accompaniment of a little citation of the classic “I’ve Got No Strings” from 1940’s Pinocchio. It’s a moment that exemplifies how Ultron feels like a cold, calculated operation from Marvel Studios. It’s merely tick list of obligations to move us on to the next chapter of the MCU.18. Although Kenneth Branagh’s introductory outing for Marvel’s God of Thunder fared perfectly well on release, it’s suffered massively from the MCU’s dramatic sense of progression over the years. Certainly, Tom Hiddleston’s Loki is a strong, well-crafted character right out of the gate, and his plot against his adoptive father (Anthony Hopkins) is delightfully heightened. Yet, it arguably took until Thor: Ragnarok for Chris Hemsworth’s hero to develop much sense of character beyond the initial “fish out of water” trope.17. A self-centred wealthy white man ventures to a distant land and realises his superhero potential – sound familiar? That’s because Doctor Strange and Iron Man are basically the same story, except one uses magic and the other explosives. Benedict Cumberbatch’s Marveldebut impresses with kaleidoscope visuals but lacks the heart of Robert Downey Jr’s hero, leading to a film that wastes the talents of both Tilda Swinton and Mads Mikkelsen. 722 s of the Galaxy Vol 216. The first s of the Galaxy was a risky Star Wars-inspired romp through space, following a bunch of a-holes who form an unlikely familiar bond. For the second film, James Gunn decided to turn everything up to 11, cramming half a dozen interweaving storylines, leading to Chris Pratt’s gaunt Star Lord getting side-lined. The sequel did, however, introduce the now beloved line “I’m Mary Poppins, y’all”, shouted by Yondu as he gracefully falls from the sky. A wonderfully comedic moment in a film that misses on another half-dozen punches.15. Marvel’s first crossover film was an unparalleled cinematic event – one that arguably changed Hollywood filmmaking forever, now that every major studio seems to be attempting the “shared universe” approach to franchises. Although the MCU has refined the template since, The Avengers still established the focus on humour, character, and heart that would come to define the success story of Marvel Studios. It’s a blockbuster that feels large on all fronts, delivering thrills not only in the “Battle of New York” finale, but in the creation of a team of characters that feel perfectly balanced and complementary.14. Despite Captain America: Civil War (AKA Avengers 2.5) featuring Iron Man, Black Widow, and Ant-Man (as well as introducing Black Panther and Spider-Man), the film remains first and foremost about Captain America. And that’s perhaps why the stuffed blockbuster works – were it not for a central focus, Civil War could have fallen into the trappings of other Marvel sequels in being too convoluted. The Russo Brothers also direct one of the best actions scenes in Marvel history so far, the airport scene, which looks as if it leapt straight out of a comic book.1022 Ant-Man and the Wasp13. While the first Ant Man was a mirror image of its star Paul Rudd, essentially delivering a studio comedy dressed in dex, the second found a new trick up its sleeve in the form of Evangeline Lilly’s Hope van Dyne – a smart, capable female hero who didn’t simply exist to serve as a caretaker for the male characters.12. Ant-Man should not have worked as a film. Just look at the title! Ridiculous to think a movie about a man with ant powers should work – let alone be a blockbuster success and part of the biggest cinematic universe going. Yet, despite production problems (Edgar Wright was initially meant to helm the film), Peyton Reed directs this hilarious heist film with aplomb, taking the Marvel world a little less seriously than others. 11. Marvel redefined cinematic narratives once more in 2018, creating a single culmination to a decade’s worth of films. While it plays as total nonsense to anyone who’s a newcomer to the franchise (if that’s possible), it was, for fans, an unmatched emotional release. The Russo brothers faced the monumental task of making each crossover – from the s of the Galaxy to the kingdom of Wakanda – work in a way that feels natural, while also ushering the MCU’s biggest villain, Thanos, into centre stage. Epic both in its sense of scale and stakes, Infinity War also stages one of the most memorable finales in blockbuster history.10. With or without the beard, Steve Rogers aka Captain America has now become the brooding centre of the Avengers, but there was once a time when he was all about the old-fashioned heroics. Director Joe Johnston stayed true to the film’s 1940s setting in a film that embraces that pulpiness of early comic book history, as Steve punches Nazis and romances military officer Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), although her character is thankfully never relegated to the role of damsel in distress.9. Despite centring on a super-powered American nationalist, the Captain America trilogy has the most consistent quality in the MCU. Its crowning moment comes with The Winter Soldier – an adrenaline-fuelled conspiracy thriller that features a spectacular twist and provokes questions regarding modern day surveillance. However, given The Russo Brothers root the rest of the movie in realism, the bombastic CGI-heavy ending is a little ridiculous. 8. Brie Larson gives a superpowered performance as Carol Danvers, the actor playing a hero that\u0027s both relatable and aspirational, strong but vulnerable. While Captain Marvel may not revolutionise the studio’s formula, the superhero\u0027s debut outing provides a platform to show off her Thanos-annihilating powers.  Thanks to a smart script, it also offers some of the very best character development in the MCU.7. While Spider-Man’s miraculous arrival in the MCU came with Captain America: Civil War, it was not until Homecoming that we truly got to know Peter Parker. Tom Holland’s incarnation swings past Andrew Garfield’s version, thanks to the film’s lower-stakes high school story allowing for intimate moments with the character. Along with including some great comic performances (Jacob Batalon as Ned stands out), Michael Keaton’s Vulture makes for a terrifying villain, and the twist is superbly done.6. While isive among Marvel fans, Shane Black’s superhero outing – with the writerdirector’s sharp, stinging dialogue – brings Tony Stark\u0027s story arc to an end (or what should have been its end) with humour and heart aplenty. As Robert Downey Jr’s genius, billionaire philanthropist deals with PTSD and struggles with his robotic creations, we see an actor giving his all. While Civil War and the Avengers films dragged him back into action, fingers are crossed Avengers: Endgame will give the character a similar emotionally satisfying send-off.5. It’s a film that’s hard to place within the MCU canon, simply because the majority of its emotional pay-offs only work due to the groundwork laid by over a decade of filmmaking. Avengers: Endgame is less about inidual storytelling and so much more about the collective experience of cinema itself. This exists to be consumed in the dark, surrounded by loved ones, as  you all cheer, gasp, and cry in unison. The fan service at work may, at times, feel a little outrageous in just how bold it feels, but Endgame earns the right to indulge. This, above all, is a celebration of these movies and their impact on the world. 4. Completely transforming the Thor franchise in a single, effortless move, director Taika Waititi injected new energy into the MCU. Ragnarok is perfectly balanced both as a standard Marvel movie, with all the right heroics and world-building intact, and as a work belonging exclusively to Waititi, filled with the humour and charm he’d previously displayed in What We Do in the Shadows and Hunt for the Wilderpeople. By finding a way to incorporate inidual voices into its massive franchise machine, Marvel found the secret to true long-term success.3. Where it all started. Iron Man subverted expectations by not only reintroducing Robert Downey Jr to the world, but by showing that a relatively unknown B-character could be at the centre of a blockbuster. Other cinematic universes fail because they attempt to introduce too much (a mistake made in Iron Man 2). The first Iron Man, though, had a self-contained story that only hinted at a bigger world – a world that would eventually become a multi-billion-dollar franchise. 2122 s of the Galaxy 2. Blasting the Marvel universe into space for an adventure with a truly ragtag group of heroes, including both a talking racoon and a sentient tree-creature, s of the Galaxy is arguably the biggest risk the franchise ever took. And it paid off in spectacular fashion, with director James Gunn giving the superhero genre a light coat of B-movie glee. It also transformed Parks and Recreation star Chris Pratt into the major box office draw he is today.1. Although Black Panther still dutifully fulfils all the requirements of a Marvel film, providing a bridge to films both past and future plus ending in a cinematic battle filled with CGI trickery, Ryan Coogler’s achievement as a director is to use a familiar framework to tell a radical story within mainstream filmmaking. In the strife between Chadwick Boseman’s T’Challa, the ruler of Wakanda, and Michael B Jordan’s Killmonger, he provided a nuanced, layered commentary on colonialism and black identity. It’s a film that triumphs both within its genre, bringing new perspectives to the superhero story, and outside of it, satisfying purely as a piece of narrative drama.22. Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke). The result is a film without any direction that serves as a Trojan horse set-up for the Avengers.21.

With Liv Tyler phoning in her performance as love interest, Betty Ross, the film falls emotionally flat and serves only as a by-the-numbers origins story.422 Avengers: Age of Ultron19. Just in case we’d forgotten that the Disney corporation is an all-consuming titan that owns half of Hollywood, the sequel to 2012’s Avengers decided to sneak in a little corporate synergy: when Iron Man accidentally creates a sentient robot (voiced by James Spader) who decides the earth’s only salvation is through the destruction of humanity, he announces his grim plans with accompaniment of a little citation of the classic “I’ve Got No Strings” from 1940’s Pinocchio. It’s a moment that exemplifies how Ultron feels like a cold, calculated operation from Marvel Studios. It’s merely tick list of obligations to move us on to the next chapter of the MCU.18. Although Kenneth Branagh’s introductory outing for Marvel’s God of Thunder fared perfectly well on release, it’s suffered massively from the MCU’s dramatic sense of progression over the years. Certainly, Tom Hiddleston’s Loki is a strong, well-crafted character right out of the gate, and his plot against his adoptive father (Anthony Hopkins) is delightfully heightened. Yet, it arguably took until Thor: Ragnarok for Chris Hemsworth’s hero to develop much sense of character beyond the initial “fish out of water” trope.17. A self-centred wealthy white man ventures to a distant land and realises his superhero potential – sound familiar? That’s because Doctor Strange and Iron Man are basically the same story, except one uses magic and the other explosives. Benedict Cumberbatch’s Marveldebut impresses with kaleidoscope visuals but lacks the heart of Robert Downey Jr’s hero, leading to a film that wastes the talents of both Tilda Swinton and Mads Mikkelsen. 722 s of the Galaxy Vol 216. The first s of the Galaxy was a risky Star Wars-inspired romp through space, following a bunch of a-holes who form an unlikely familiar bond. For the second film, James Gunn decided to turn everything up to 11, cramming half a dozen interweaving storylines, leading to Chris Pratt’s gaunt Star Lord getting side-lined. The sequel did, however, introduce the now beloved line “I’m Mary Poppins, y’all”, shouted by Yondu as he gracefully falls from the sky. A wonderfully comedic moment in a film that misses on another half-dozen punches.15. Marvel’s first crossover film was an unparalleled cinematic event – one that arguably changed Hollywood filmmaking forever, now that every major studio seems to be attempting the “shared universe” approach to franchises. Although the MCU has refined the template since, The Avengers still established the focus on humour, character, and heart that would come to define the success story of Marvel Studios. It’s a blockbuster that feels large on all fronts, delivering thrills not only in the “Battle of New York” finale, but in the creation of a team of characters that feel perfectly balanced and complementary.14. Despite Captain America: Civil War (AKA Avengers 2.5) featuring Iron Man, Black Widow, and Ant-Man (as well as introducing Black Panther and Spider-Man), the film remains first and foremost about Captain America. And that’s perhaps why the stuffed blockbuster works – were it not for a central focus, Civil War could have fallen into the trappings of other Marvel sequels in being too convoluted. The Russo Brothers also direct one of the best actions scenes in Marvel history so far, the airport scene, which looks as if it leapt straight out of a comic book.1022 Ant-Man and the Wasp13. While the first Ant Man was a mirror image of its star Paul Rudd, essentially delivering a studio comedy dressed in dex, the second found a new trick up its sleeve in the form of Evangeline Lilly’s Hope van Dyne – a smart, capable female hero who didn’t simply exist to serve as a caretaker for the male characters.12. Ant-Man should not have worked as a film. Just look at the title! Ridiculous to think a movie about a man with ant powers should work – let alone be a blockbuster success and part of the biggest cinematic universe going. Yet, despite production problems (Edgar Wright was initially meant to helm the film), Peyton Reed directs this hilarious heist film with aplomb, taking the Marvel world a little less seriously than others. 11. Marvel redefined cinematic narratives once more in 2018, creating a single culmination to a decade’s worth of films. While it plays as total nonsense to anyone who’s a newcomer to the franchise (if that’s possible), it was, for fans, an unmatched emotional release. The Russo brothers faced the monumental task of making each crossover – from the s of the Galaxy to the kingdom of Wakanda – work in a way that feels natural, while also ushering the MCU’s biggest villain, Thanos, into centre stage. Epic both in its sense of scale and stakes, Infinity War also stages one of the most memorable finales in blockbuster history.10. With or without the beard, Steve Rogers aka Captain America has now become the brooding centre of the Avengers, but there was once a time when he was all about the old-fashioned heroics. Director Joe Johnston stayed true to the film’s 1940s setting in a film that embraces that pulpiness of early comic book history, as Steve punches Nazis and romances military officer Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), although her character is thankfully never relegated to the role of damsel in distress.9. Despite centring on a super-powered American nationalist, the Captain America trilogy has the most consistent quality in the MCU. Its crowning moment comes with The Winter Soldier – an adrenaline-fuelled conspiracy thriller that features a spectacular twist and provokes questions regarding modern day surveillance. However, given The Russo Brothers root the rest of the movie in realism, the bombastic CGI-heavy ending is a little ridiculous. 8. Brie Larson gives a superpowered performance as Carol Danvers, the actor playing a hero that\u0027s both relatable and aspirational, strong but vulnerable. While Captain Marvel may not revolutionise the studio’s formula, the superhero\u0027s debut outing provides a platform to show off her Thanos-annihilating powers.  Thanks to a smart script, it also offers some of the very best character development in the MCU.7. While Spider-Man’s miraculous arrival in the MCU came with Captain America: Civil War, it was not until Homecoming that we truly got to know Peter Parker. Tom Holland’s incarnation swings past Andrew Garfield’s version, thanks to the film’s lower-stakes high school story allowing for intimate moments with the character. Along with including some great comic performances (Jacob Batalon as Ned stands out), Michael Keaton’s Vulture makes for a terrifying villain, and the twist is superbly done.6. While isive among Marvel fans, Shane Black’s superhero outing – with the writerdirector’s sharp, stinging dialogue – brings Tony Stark\u0027s story arc to an end (or what should have been its end) with humour and heart aplenty. As Robert Downey Jr’s genius, billionaire philanthropist deals with PTSD and struggles with his robotic creations, we see an actor giving his all. While Civil War and the Avengers films dragged him back into action, fingers are crossed Avengers: Endgame will give the character a similar emotionally satisfying send-off.5. It’s a film that’s hard to place within the MCU canon, simply because the majority of its emotional pay-offs only work due to the groundwork laid by over a decade of filmmaking. Avengers: Endgame is less about inidual storytelling and so much more about the collective experience of cinema itself. This exists to be consumed in the dark, surrounded by loved ones, as  you all cheer, gasp, and cry in unison. The fan service at work may, at times, feel a little outrageous in just how bold it feels, but Endgame earns the right to indulge. This, above all, is a celebration of these movies and their impact on the world. 4. Completely transforming the Thor franchise in a single, effortless move, director Taika Waititi injected new energy into the MCU. Ragnarok is perfectly balanced both as a standard Marvel movie, with all the right heroics and world-building intact, and as a work belonging exclusively to Waititi, filled with the humour and charm he’d previously displayed in What We Do in the Shadows and Hunt for the Wilderpeople. By finding a way to incorporate inidual voices into its massive franchise machine, Marvel found the secret to true long-term success.3. Where it all started. Iron Man subverted expectations by not only reintroducing Robert Downey Jr to the world, but by showing that a relatively unknown B-character could be at the centre of a blockbuster. Other cinematic universes fail because they attempt to introduce too much (a mistake made in Iron Man 2). The first Iron Man, though, had a self-contained story that only hinted at a bigger world – a world that would eventually become a multi-billion-dollar franchise. 2122 s of the Galaxy 2. Blasting the Marvel universe into space for an adventure with a truly ragtag group of heroes, including both a talking racoon and a sentient tree-creature, s of the Galaxy is arguably the biggest risk the franchise ever took. And it paid off in spectacular fashion, with director James Gunn giving the superhero genre a light coat of B-movie glee. It also transformed Parks and Recreation star Chris Pratt into the major box office draw he is today.1. Although Black Panther still dutifully fulfils all the requirements of a Marvel film, providing a bridge to films both past and future plus ending in a cinematic battle filled with CGI trickery, Ryan Coogler’s achievement as a director is to use a familiar framework to tell a radical story within mainstream filmmaking. In the strife between Chadwick Boseman’s T’Challa, the ruler of Wakanda, and Michael B Jordan’s Killmonger, he provided a nuanced, layered commentary on colonialism and black identity. It’s a film that triumphs both within its genre, bringing new perspectives to the superhero story, and outside of it, satisfying purely as a piece of narrative drama.’s Peter Bradshaw also gave the film two stars, writing that it “offers glimpses of intrigue before regressing into a dull CGI-fest”.“The most interesting aspect of this film is McAvoy’s Xavier,” Bradshaw’s review says. “He is more opaque, more worldly, more secretive – and drinking more heavily. For the first time, we realise that he is not the idealist that we might have imagined. Raven is increasingly angry at Xavier’s recklessness and egotism, risking his pupils’ lives for his own glory – maybe as a result of being too close to the Washington political establishment.”Variety’s review was slightly more positive, with more praise for James McAvoy’s performance that is “driven by a compelling ambiguity”.\u0026nbsp“His Professor X is vain, controlling, and PR-hungry, not to mention a grand deceiver — all the things Jennifer Lawrence’s Raven accuses him of being,” the reviewer comments. “Yet what he says in his own defence is true as well: He’s desperate to protect the status of the X-Men, to not let them slip into being stigmatized, once more, by the world at large. What happened to Jean as a child was cruel, but maybe it was necessary. McAvoy, with his gleam of cunning, plays to both sides of our sympathies, and so does Turner, who gets us to embrace Jean as a superhero, in part, because she’s a destroyer. The pleasure of Dark Phoenix” is watching her emerge from the wreckage.”Digital Spy’s Ian Sandwell said: “In hindsight, Dark Phoenix\u0027s delay from November 2018 hasn\u0027t helped. With it repositioned as the \u0027culmination\u0027 of the X-Men series, it suffers in comparison to Avengers: Endgame and one key third-act beat is a carbon copy of a Captain Marvel moment.New X-Men film Dark Phoenix has nothing fresh to say – reviewNew trailer unveiled for X-Men: Dark Phoenix”It leaves the movie in a tricky position of being a well-made but overly familiar entry in a crowded superhero field. Combine that with the mixed build-up to Dark Phoenix\u0027s release, and the movie just doesn\u0027t do enough, unfortunately.“The Hollywood Reporter also compared the film unfavourably to the Avengers franchise, writing: ”Compared to the conclusions of other major franchises – the most recent being Avengers: Endgame – this one seems distinctly minor-league.\u0026nbsp“The men who have anchored most of the X-Men outings are just spinning their wheels here, and while Jean\u0027s central dilemma is certainly dramatic enough, and is most closely entwined with the actions of two other women, what should have registered as genuinely powerful instead plays out in a pretty low-key way. In no way does this feel like a fulsome, satisfying destination to a journey that started two decades ago and logged about 30 hours in the telling.“”There\u0027s no memorable soundtrack, no thrilling action sequences, not even a detectable sense of humour,” wrote Mashable’s Angie Han. “Dark Phoenix isn\u0027t especially ugly or upsetting, but it\u0027s no pleasure to sit through, either. It\u0027s just there, robotically going through the motions of recounting a story, without stopping to consider why it\u0027s bothering in the first place.“Created with Sketch.A complete list of every Marvel movie coming out Show all 17Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A decade of the MCU comes to a climax with the first of a two-part finale to everything that\u0027s come so far.

While it has always banned hate content in general, the site has allowed some specific kinds of harmful videos – such as those promoting Nazi ideology or claiming 911 did not happen – to continue being hosted on the site.Those videos, as well as other kinds of supremacist content, will now be officially banned.Today, we\u0027re taking another step in our hate speech policy by specifically prohibiting videos alleging that a group is superior in order to justify discrimination, segregation or exclusion based on qualities like age, gender, race, caste, religion, sexual orientation or veteran status, it wrote in a blog post.That is expected to lead to the removal of thousands of accounts as it goes into place, though that could take some time.

or whether shes dead or alive - remains a mystery, despite a £million police probe.Madeleine vanished  years ago on May , , when her family, from Leicestershire, were holidaying in Praia da Luz, in the Algarve, Portugal.Parents Gerry and Kate left their three children – including toddler twins Sean and Amelie – sleeping in their apartment while they dined at a tapas bar -  metres away.When Kate ed to check on the kids at around pm that evening, she discovered that Maddie was not in her bed and was missing.In September of that year, Gerry and Kate, both doctors, were sensationally named as ‘arguidos’ by Portuguese police.The following summer the McCanns were cleared by investigators in Portugal who declared they had exhausted all avenues in the case.Maddie would have turned  on on May , .In April , UK cops released a computer generated image of Maddie showing what she would look like aged nine.However, parents have said new images of Maddies age progression are bogus. Kate and Gerry are warning the new fake images were neither commissioned nor endorsed by them or Scotland Yard’s Operation Grange team.A number of potential leads have emerged since the little girl vanished, but none amounted to anything and no arrests have ever been made.In May , witness Jane Tanner said Gerry had played tennis with a man wrongly identied as her abductor on the day she went missing.She said she spent up to half an hour watching Gerry McCann and Dr Julian Totman, , play on May , .Less than three hours later, she saw a man carrying a child in pyjamas near the McCanns’ apartment in Praia da Luz.But she did not recognise Dr Totman and cops pursued the lead for four years, despite the GP saying it was probably him.There have been more than , potential sightings of the Brit three-year-old since her disappearance, but police have so far failed to locate her.politan Police Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley said there are signicant investigative avenues that are of great interest to both the UK and Portuguese teams pursuing the case.Met cops believe she was stolen by child traffickers or sex fiends, or during a burglary gone wrong.Meanwhile, cops are now hunting a person of signicance in a shock new development.A source close to Scotland Yards search Operation Grange said the person is now a critical line of inquiry in the £million investigation, according to The Times.And a former Met police chief has called for a fresh interview with Maddies parents and the Tapas Seven - who have never been quizzed by British cops.Cops moved the search to Bulgaria as they tried to find a woman in purple they wanted to speak to.On May , , it emerged that Portuguese police were hunting a sex fiend who speaks English and wears a surgical mask in relation to Maddies suspected kidnapping.In one of his previous cases, he broke into a British familys home and loomed over a seven-year-old girl who woke up and asked Is that you Daddy  and he replied Yes in a foreign accent, author Anthony Summers said in the Netflix doc.Detectives have discovered a creep carried out nearly  attacks within a -mile radius of the holiday apartment in Praia da Luz where Maddie vanished from  years ago.He crept into Algarve properties rented by families and many victims were British.And a judicial source is reported to have confirmed the unnamed man was definitely in Portugal at the time the three-year-old suddenly disappeared.And the insider also alleged he was known to local cops and had previously been investigated on suspicion of involvement in paedophile cases.A chilling reconstruction features in the final episode of Netflixs recently released eight-part documentary The Disappearance Of Madeleine McCann.A German paedophile Martin Ney, , emerged as a key suspect in May .He was jailed for le in  for abducting and murdering three children and sexually abusing dozens more.It is believed he was in Portugal when Maddie went missing.Goncalo Amaral, the Portuguese cop who first led the hunt for Madeleine, revealed that police were probing a “German paedophile who is in prison”.Ney was working for an evangelical church on a project for the homeless in Portugal when Madeleine disappeared, its claimed.Ney also looks like a photofit of a man, who was seen acting suspiciously before Madeleine vanished from her Portuguese holiday apartment  years ago.Funding for the search was due to expire in October .But on September , , it was confirmed investigators have received £, to keep the probe alive until March .Then more funding - said to be around £, was granted in March .The extra cash for Operation Grange is being used to investigate signicant leads, which Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley described as very worthwhile.Kate and and Gerry are “extremely thankful to both the Home Office and Scotland Yard for the continued funding,” their spokesman Clarence Mitchell said.The Home Office announced it was ploughing more money into Operation Grange, the official investigation, at the latest request of Met Police.In February  it was confirmed that the politan Police were asking the Home Office for more funding to continue the work of Operation Grange.Scotland Yards investigation has been ongoing since .During that time the number of detectives working on the case has been cut from  to four in .On June , it was believed another £, of funding was given to the probe.Those still involved with the investigation are now said to spend a lot of their time eliminating known sex offenders and chasing down potential witnesses.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But who will be her successor As soon as Theresa May left the podium outside Downing Street, focus turned towards the rest of the Tory party.Jeremy Hunt and Dominic Raab were first out of the blocks to replace May.Sajid Javid and Michael Gove also jostled for position while Boris Johnson broke his silence about his plans.Jacob Rees-Mogg revealed he wont run for the leadership because he wont get enough support to win and Amber Rudd ruled herself out too.Other contenders vying for the job include former Leader of the House of Commons Andrea Leadsom plus Health Secretary Matt Hancock, Housing Minister Kit Malthouse and Brexit Minister James Cleverly .They span the whole of the Brexit spectrum, including Eurosceptic hardliner Esther McVey and Rory Stewart, who is against No Deal.On June , Sam Gyimah became the th candidate to enter the Tory leadership race - promising a second referendum where Brexit could be stopped.May claimed she had done all she could to take Britain out of the EU with a deal, saying: Ever since I first stepped through the door behind me as Prime Minister, I have striven to make the United Kingdom a country that works not just for a privileged few, but for everyone. And to honour the result of the EU referendum.If you give people a choice you have a duty to implement what they decide. I have done my best to do that.Sadly I have not been able to do so. I tried three times - I believe it was right to persevere even when the odds against success seemed high.Her voice cracking, she attempted to defend her legacy and insisted she has helped to fix Britains burning injustices.The PM confessed she now had no chance of ever getting her Brexit deal through Parliament.But she urged MPs to come together and deliver on the referendum, saying: Le depends on compromise.May survived a vote of no confidence in December , but repeated thwarted attempts to pass her Brexit deal have left her without authority. Here are what the bookies are saying on June , .These are the odds on who will be the next PM according to Ladbrokes:Former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson is still a hugely popular figure among Tory grassroots and the general public.Boris quit as Foreign Secretary on July , , in a blow to Mays Government.He walked out just hours after she lost Brexit Secretary David Davis over her Chequers plan to keep close ties to Brussels.He called on May to stop dithering and tell the EU that Britain will not accept the controversial backstop arrangement designed to avoid a hard border in Ireland.He rejected warnings about the impact of a No Deal Brexit, insisting: Whatever the doomsters may say ... there will be no shortage of Mars bars, we will still have potable drinking water in Britain. The planes will fly, the ferries will ply.He has said he would of course stand in the Conservative leadership contest to replace Theresa May.The Environment Secretary has achieved a remarkable turnaround since kning Boris Johnson during the  leadership contest.His support among party members dropped through the floor and it seemed his chances were gone for ever.But Mr Gove, who led the Leave campaign in the EU referendum, has rebranded himself as an ecowarrior as Environment Secretary.He has also thrown his full support behind Theresa Mays Brexit plan, winning him friends among MPsnot the party faithful.He claimed May blundered by not having key Labour figures on her Brexit talks team.The Environment Secretary said the PM made a mistake by not asking Gisela Stuart to join at the beginning.He also said No Deal must be kept on the table.The former Brexit Secretary quit the cabinet in protest over Theresa Mays soft orce deal with the EU.Raab has insisted No Deal wouldnt be chaotic for Britain and said the short-term risks were manageable.He has blasted those who want to extend Article  or a second referendum.He said: If theres an attempt to reverse the referendum, stop Brexit altogether I think that would cut across not only the democratic mandate, the biggest in history we had.Though an unlikely candidate at the time, Brexit campaigner Leadsom reached the final two of the  leadership contest.She withdrew over ill-judged remarks about Theresa May not being a mother.Leadsom resigned as Leader of the House on May , ,  with reports claiming May begged her not to go.Mr Hunt was the longest-serving Health Secretary in British history before replacing Boris as Foreign Secretary.He left the Department of Health after securing a £bn funding increase for the NHS, but was hated by junior doctors after changing their contracts so they wouldnt receive extra pay for the many shts they work - previously classied as unsociable hours.Mr Hunt is known to have leadership aspirations and now says he backs Brexit despite campaigning for Remain during the referendum.Just hours after Mrs May resigned, he put his name into the hat to be in the running to replace her.Prisons Minister Rory Stewart MP put himself forward to replace May as Prime Minister on April , .Mr Stewart told the Spectator: “Dficult periods need dferent types of people.One of the reasons why I would be tempted towards this job is that we desperately need to rebuild ourselves internationally after Brexit. I am one of the only people in Parliament who is a genuine specialist.”Mr Stewart studied at Oxford and tutored Princes William and Harry in his spare time.On June , Trade Secretary Liam Fox threw his support behind Hunt in a surprise move.The Home Secretary ended up backing Remain during the EU referendum but is popular among the Tory parliamentary party.Mr Javid was appointed Home Secretary in the wake of the Windrush scandal and the resignation of Amber Rudd.A known Eurosceptic, some of his statements and his backing for a harder Brexit have been taken as signs he is pitching for the leadership.The MP for Bromsgrove in Worcestershire is a former managing director from Deutsche Bank.On May , Javid announced his bid to run for PM.Another female Brexiteer to watch out for is Penny Mordaunt.On May , , she was promoted to Defence Secretary after Gavin Williamson was sacked, which is fitting as she is a Navy reservist.Previously the former Splash! contestant ran the Department for International Development.The Health Secretary tried to break the ice in a crunch Cabinet meeting in May by turning up with a packet of waffles.Hes already raked in £, in donations from digital tech entrepreneurs, The Sun revealed on May .And hes won admirers for his positive and optimistic brand of conservatism and his track record of getting things done.Cleverly is the MP for Braintree and became Brexit Minister on April , .He became the eleventh Tory to declare for the leadership race on May .He is a Brexiteer and has said he wants to see Brexit delivered.Cleverly backed Mays Brexit deal saying it allows us to take back control of our borders and our laws, stop sending those vast sums of money to the EU, and to make our own trade deals across the world.However on June , he dropped out of the race after admitting it was highly unlikely he would win Tory MPs support.Jeremy Corbyn still has strong odds on becoming the nations next Prime Minister, despite it being inevitable that the next PM will be a Tory.The Labour leader has made calls for a General Election but despite Mays resignation there will not be one - yet.The Labour leader has had to fight constant opposition from his own MPs including a leadership contest after just a year.But the party swung behind him after a much stronger than expected  General Election when Labour picked up  seats and Mrs May lost her majority.Although the fabled youthquake of support from younger voters did not happen,Corbyn finally agreed to consider a second referendum in February  — just weeks before the UKs scheduled departure date.Ms McVey has said that the next PM must believe in Brexit.The Tory leadership candidate has backed a No Deal Brexit.On May  she said that Britain should immediately end Brexit talks and go all out for a No Deal Brexit.Mark Harper, , was the th Tory to declare his candidacy for the partys leadership.After graduating from Oxford in PPE he became a chartered accountant before becoming an MP for the Forest of Dean in .He has served as a junior minister in the Cabinet Office before becoming an Immigration Minister and then the Minister for Disabled People.Harper then held the position of Government Chief Whip between May  and July  under David Cameron.He hasnt served under Theresa Mays administration and has positioned himself as offering fresh thinking for both the party and the approach to Brexit.Harper told the Daily : We’ve seen basically the same faces saying the same things that they’ve been saying for the last three years.A number of them have tried to position themselves as fresh faces but I’m afraid they’ve sat around the cabinet table sharing the responsibility with the Prime Minister.During the EU referendum campaign in  he backed remain.Priti Patel is the MP for Witham in Essex who backed Leave.She has said MPs are flailing around making a complete hash of this simple instruction to exit the EU.Sam Gyimah resigned as Science Minister in November  in protest at the PMs Brexit deal.He was elected to Parliament as Tory MP for East Surrey in .He has been married to Dr Nicky Black since , and they have a son and a daughter.He supported remaining in the European Union in the EU referendum.Mr Gyimah said he would give the people another choice, three years after Britain voted to Leave.Ms Rudd has managed to stay in favour with Mrs May, taking the buck for the Windrush Scandal and stepping down as Home Secretary — before ing to the cabinet within months and becoming Work and Pensions chief.The -year-old Hastings MP has voiced support for the PM and for her botched Brexit deal, but insiders think shes savvy enough to manoeuvre a bid to the top when shes ready.But that move doesnt appear to be yet as shes ruled herself out of the contest.Mercer became a well-known face in politics when he appeared on Channel s Stand Up to Cancer show Hunted with Kay Burley.Hes the MP for Plymouth Moor View and a former Army captain who was stood up for veterans rights.Housing Minister Kit Malthouse declared his bid for PM in an article for The Sun.He claims that Brits dont want any of the Cabinet-level Tory candidates to succeed Mrs May and that they want someone new.Leave campaigner Mr Malthouse is the author of the lauded Malthouse Compromise plan for Brexit to break Parliament’s deadlock.His idea to replace the hated Irish backstop with alternative arrangements over a longer three year period is the only solution yet to have won a Commons majority in six months of Parliamentary warfare.The -year-old Brexiteer revealed he has already won the support of a number of Tory MPs across the spectrum of the Conservative Party.David Davis quit as Brexit Secretary on July , , with a devastating letter warning Mrs May her proposal would leave the UK in a weak negotiating position with Brussels.He has since launched a series of attacks on Mrs Mays strategy, and led a Tory rebellion to ditch the Chequers plan.He called on Cabinet ministers to rise up and kill off the plans.Furious Tories then demanded Mr Davis be installed as interim leader to save true Brexit.Cameron was PM before Theresa May but resigned after the Brexit referendum, which saw Leave come out on top.The Remainer has kept a low profile since stepping down in .Speaking to the BBC on January , , Cameron said: Obviously I regret that we lost that referendum, I deeply regret that - I was leading the campaign to stay in the European Union.He is set to release his memoirs before the Tory Conference ."},{"url":null,"title":"when school holidays 2019 start end dates","story":"Parents will no doubt be working out how and where to spend their summer, so here are all the dates you need to know so that you can get going with all those fun plans you have in mind.Schools are in their summer term now -

But the family does not get the support it needs.Thousands of kind-hearted Sun readers have already signed Vickey’s letter to Chancellor Philip Hammond demanding he properly funds services — such as respite and overnight support — for parents with disabled children.We hope more of you will show your backing by signing the letter today, because the Kowal family are not an isolated case.Mums and dads up and down the country feel unable to look after their disabled children adequately because they are so exhausted — and they are frustrated at being let down by a system that is meant to help them.When we surveyed parents, just four per cent said they felt they had the support to safely care for their child.More than half have been treated by a GP for depression, anxiety or stress.Ollies grandad Dave helps out when he can, but the family are far from an isolated case - they need your helpIndependent Provider of Special Education Advice- for specialist legal adviceNewle - a charity that provides help with equipmentGOV.UK - to understand your childs entitlementsNational Autistic Society And a huge  per cent of children have gone without therapies, such as physio and speech and language help, meant to improve their lives.This lack of support starts right from diagnosis — with parents being left alone to come to terms with devastating news.They are then left to care for children with complex needs — often through the night — for months or years without any help or respite.This care is often emotional and stressful, and sometimes physical and back-breaking, too.At my charity, Contact — which works with families of disabled children — we hear all the time from those who have to fight for even the most basic provision.Disabled children and their families are desperately struggling because of a lack of support.We want the Government to reinstate the £m of funding it has cut from early intervention services - such as respite care and vital equipment.It is time for the Government to Give It Back.The number of disabled children in the UK has risen to nearly  million over the past  years - up by a third.But funding and support has been cut.Families with some of the most vulnerable children in the country are struggling to cope.That’s why we’re working with the Disabled Children’s Partnership to help them.Together we can make a real dference and hugely improve the lives of disabled children and their families.We want you to share your stories, email us on giveitback@the-sunPlease sign Ollie’s letter to put pressure on the Government to act now.These families are morally — and legally — entitled to help from local authorities, but it is just not forthcoming.It does not need to be like this. All the families want is a little amount of support to enable them to care safely for their child at home.They want a chance to go shopping, a moment to catch up on sleep or have a bath, or time to spend with their other children.This is not about pity or sympathy for disabled children.The families we work with cherish every day spent with their children, who bring real joy and have so much to offer. Instead, we are calling on the Government to help tackle the problem of the lack of support they are given.I have worked in the field of disability for  years, so I know that services have never been perfect.But cuts to budgets, combined with a  per cent increase in the number of children classed as disabled over the past decade, means we have reached a critical point — one where we need to decide what kind of country we want to be.We are talking about some of the most vulnerable children in society, and also children who have the potential to contribute a lot.This is not a campaign based purely on emotion, compassion or wanting to do the right thing, although those are all important.There is a hard-headed economic case here, too. Without putting funding back into services for disabled children, we can guarantee the taxpayer will be faced with a bigger bill in the long-term.That is because when families break down, children can end up in care or needing expensive crisis intervention from local councils or the NHS.Our families are amazing. When the chips are down, people can be remarkable.But most do not want to be amazing, or superhuman — they want an ordinary le.As Sun readers, you can give families up and down the country a real shot at that.Sign Vickey’s letter using this link, and ask which of our potential leaders will be first to agree to Give It Back.Amanda Batten is chair of the Disabled Children’s Partnership, a coalition of  leading charities, and CEO of Contact.Jane Harris, Director of External Affairs at the National Autistic SocietyWe want as many people as possible to sign the open letter calling on the Government to give back the millions that have been cut from support for disabled children. Thanks to The Sun and The Sun readers for getting behind this important campaign.”Dr Hilary Cass OBE, Chair of BACDEvery professional working in the field of childhood disability will be grateful to The Sun for launching the Give it Back campaign.Naseem Waker, mum of Leila, sevenThe Give It Back campaign shows the stark reality of a very complex situation. I am delighted a paper with the clout of The Sun has taken up the cause. Dan White, writer and broadcaster, dad of Emily, It’s  and parents and children in our community are like ghosts to society. We live amongst you, breathe your air, look at the same stars, but you do not know us.

It’s been like that since series one.It’s just that this year’s contestants forced them to be even more credulous, gushing and moronic than usual.Particularly the magicians, who were all doing iations on the same trick, with such little stagecraft, that one of last year’s rejects, Marc Spelmann, was deemed best of the bunch by virtue of putting on his X mask and saying nothing.It didn’t end there, however.Critical faculties also had to be suspended for a procession of try-hard comedians, pub singers, sob stories, village fete dancers and that Haunting thing which had Amanda Holden gasping, panting, yelping “F***” and Simon claiming: “It sounded like being next door to you on honeymoon.”Though probably not the fortnight inside Les Dennis’s static caravan in Rhyl.It wasn’t all bad, naturally.Someone almost held a tune, I’m sure, and there was a bit more tension to Jonathan Goodwin’s “Blindfold chick- en with crossbow”than there was about the Gomonov bird, who kept ducking out of the way almost every time her mate threw a kne.But what BGT really needs in such circumstances are dingbats like Gonzo, the fat Japanese tambourine frenzy, and Guy First, the Israeli bloke who can hand-fart the opening verse and chorus of We Will Rock You.He was born to be on this show, in fact, which makes what Alesha Dixon did during his semi-final appearance even more of a sackable offence.

Labouraposs Clive Efford raised the cancer suffereraposs heartbreaking case today in the House of Commons as he begged ministers to stop this injustice. He said the constituent in Eltham, south London, was left so short of money he was unable to attend most daily appointments - and risked infection on public transport. The man failed in an appeal against cuts to his Personal Independence Payment . The benefit is worth up to £. a week to help with costs of disability. Crucially it helps pay for specially-adapted vehicles that are mostly provided through an organisation called Motability. But more than , people have had their cars taken away after losing out when they moved to PIP. In many cases, people were forced to give up their adapted cars even though an appeal was still in process.  Speaking at Prime Ministeraposs Questions, Mr Efford said: In July  my constituent was diagnosed with multiple myeloma, a form of blood cancer. It was treated with two lines of chemotherapy and initially he responded well. But [he] had recurrent infections which required antibiotics. He went into remission in  and his PIP was stopped in December . He appealed the decision - despite the fact that he was receiving treatment, his appeal was refused. In February he was told his cancer had relapsed. Itaposs incurable. Heaposs now being told his mobility car will be repossessed this week. Removing his PIP will leave him short of money, unable to get to most of his daily appointments and at risk of infection when travelling on public transport.  Can I appeal to everybody on those benches over there - show some compassion, someone intervene and stop this injustice.Paula Sherrf, Labour MP for Dewsbury, could be heard shouting: How do you sleep at night  Cabinet Office minister David Lidington answered the question because he was standing in for Theresa May .He said he would ask Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd to ensure a minister speaks to Mr Efford urgently to get to the bottom of what has happened. The DWP was understood to be looking into the case this afternoon. The man was not named in the Commons.

The former Work and Pensions Secretary turned an interview into a car crash as she cruelly refused to say the word sorry for the six-in-one benefitaposs flaws. She was asked six times by LBC presenter Nick Ferrari whether she apologised to those who lost out on money in the rollout of the new welfare system. It comes after she admitted some claimants will be worse off during her time as Tory welfare chief. But despite admitting sheaposd had to make several changes because claimants were losing out, she refused point-blank to say sorry. Scroll down for the full transcript  Asked the first timeshe would apologise in any way, she insisted: The benefits system before was failing people. She said under Labour the number of households where nobody had worked had doubled, and the benefits bill had gone up by % She added she made sure more people could get into work while Tories also supported the most vulnerable. Mr Ferrari pressed on. He said: Do you apologise for the way it was introduced, that some people were left without money  Ms McVey - who is running to be the UKaposs next Prime Minister - replied: I wasnapost in government when those changes were brought in, those were George Osborneaposs changes. I actually fought to bring more money into the system, because I could see where the failings were.    This much is true - Mr Osborne stripped £billion out of the benefit, and Ms McVey as welfare chief persuaded the Treasury to give some, not all, of that cash back. But still she didnapost say sorry. A third time Mr Ferrari said: I get that, but do you apologise for those who did lose out  She stuttered: What weaposve done is... Nick... But Mr Ferrari asked a fourth time: It was reported that maybe million households lost up to £, each. If that were the case evenit was half that number do you apologise to those households  Again she insisted she managed to get more money into the benefit by being honest about the problems at Cabinet.    Mr Ferrari said: I think Iaposve asked you five times to apologise, Esther McVey. She pressed on, still not saying sorry, telling him: I made sure we changed them [the previous cuts], to make sure we reached out and helped the most vulnerable. Did I change direction for the party   Yes I did - to help the most vulnerable. Asked, a sixth time, to confirm she would not apoloigse, she said: If people didnapost get what they meant to get, thataposs why we have a process by which you can appeal and give the money back. She added, correctly, that she had also reversed previous limitations on Personal Independence Payments- though she neglected to say it was after a High Court defeat.  Iaposve changed a lot of things for the benefit of people on benefits, she insisted. Full transcript Courtesy LBC. NF  Nick Ferrari. EM  Esther McVey NF: Would you apologise in any way for Universal Credit EM: Nick let me explain, because the benefit system before was failing people but nobody was scrutinising that as an old system. The number of people under the previous Labour government, the number of households where nobody had worked had doubled, that shows us a benefit system and a work system that isn’t working. Also the benefits bill had gone up by %, so what we sought to do was to make sure that we supported the most vulnerable, which is what we are doing, but at the same time allow people who can work, and want to work, to get into work, and that’s why we have a thousand more people each and every day into work, and then what I also…NF: I’m not questioning your motives, I’m questioning the execution, do you apologise for the way it was introduced as some people were left without money and seeking benefits and were made worst off, do you apologise for that  EM: That’s why before me, because obviously I wasn’t in government when those changes were brought in, those were George Osbourne’s changes, taking out more money from the system. I actually fought to bring in more money into the system because I could see where the failings were, so I made sure more money came in, made sure there was more for, you know, outreach work, flexible work to get people into work. I also introduced something called Disability Confident which I designed and made sure worked with disabled people, with businesses, and that’s now helped get a million, nearly a million more disabled people into work. But I think what we’ve got to see is a very, very complex system.NF: I get that, but do you apologise to those that did lose out.EM: Well what we’ve done is, Nick...NF: No Ms McVey it was reported, maybe three million households lost up to two thousand pounds each, it is reported. If that were the case, evenit was half that number do you apologise to those households EM: I was the only Secretary of State who actually said people would lose out, so I went to Cabinet saying... NF: I think I’ve asked you five times to apologise Ms McVey… EM: Can I explain, and I made sure I got the extra money, so I went via the Cabinet and I said,   you want to say did we need change, the changes that were brought in by George Osbourne, I made sure we changed them, to make sure that we reached out and helped the most vulnerable and then that money is now helping the most vulnerable. So,you are saying that means did, I change direction for the party, yes I did, to help the most vulnerable, and fought for those people to get more money in for those people.NF: I think for the sixth timeyou would except that there were some people were left behind, and they did lose money, you will not apologise to them EM: Ohpeople didn’t get what they were meant to get that’s why we have a process by which you can appeal and get the money back, I also reversed some other of our parties decisions by giving extra money into personal independence payments, so I’ve changed a lot of things for the benefit of people on benefits, so I…"},{"url":null,"title":"meet voters peterborough brexit party","story":"NewsMeet the voters of Peterborough - where the Brexit Party could triumph tomorrowA by-election in crunch marginal Peterborough is held tomorrow.

Weary electors face their third ballot in five weeks after local elections on May  and the European Parliament poll on May . Brexit Party candidate Mike Greene is tipped to triumph in the marginal Cambridgeshire constituency, where % of voters opted to quit the EU in the  referendum. The ballot in the cathedral city was triggered by the ousting of MP Fiona Onasanya, who won the seat for Labour in  but was later jailed after lying over a speeding offence. The Tories held the constituency for  years from  when Labour reclaimed it by just  votes.    But the Conservatives have haemorrhaged support since failing to deliver EU withdrawal on March , making the seat a fight between the Brexit Party and Labour. Brexit Party activists were out in force in Cathedral Square today, their stall enjoying the most prominent position in the city centre, next to it its  rhythmic fountains. EU-loving Independent candidate Dick Rodgersapos bike stood feet away, festooned with a big EU flag and flags of all  member states. His sign read: “Common good. Remain in the EU. Please tell me why .% voted to leave.” A woman reading his sign said: “Remain in the EU  You must be bloody joking.” Mr Rodgers told the Mirror: “Lots of people take my leaflets, especially young people and minority ethnic people – not so much older people, but that accords with the national statistics and demographic.  “Iaposm very keen on what I say – the EU is a good idea, making a constructive spirit in Europe.” When his bike toppled over in the wind, an opponent from the Brexit Party gamely helped him right it. The Renew Party was stationed nearby, and one activist, struggling to handout his leaflets, apparently recycled his T-shirt from the Newport West by-election in April. The back read: “New party, new hope, Newport.” Labouraposs low-key red gazebo was hidden under four trees in the quieter Bridge Street, opposite the Town Hall and Mountain Warehouse. One wag quipped the position was apt because the party had a “mountain to climb” to retain the seat. Its stall had signs saying “For the many not the few” and “Your NHS safe with Lisa Forbes”. The candidate faced calls to quit the kne-edge race earlier this week after a new anti-Semitism row. Ms Forbes apologised for “liking” a post that said Theresa May had a “Zionist slave masters agenda” She said she was sorry for “wholeheartedly for not calling out these posts”. Labour activist Liz Bartley insisted the campaign was “going very well”.  She said: “The Brexit Party hasnapost got a manesto or any policies. “This election is about Peterborough, itaposs not about Brexit. “Itaposs about whataposs going on with our schools, our police, our social services, our health service.” Ten yards away was the purple and yellow UKIP gazebo with its banner: “UKIP for the nation.” A passer-by yelled: “Good morning, fascists and racists, how are you ” Candidate John Whitby blamed the Brexit Party for his likely defeat.  Denying he was “bitter”, he admitted: “We got a group here at the last minute which has rather taken the wind out of our sails.” The only sign of the Lib Dems in town by lunchtime was four youngsters in yellow rosettes scuttling along the edge of the square, not attempting to engage would-be voters. Busker Martin Plant, playing Fields of Gold and with about £. in his case, attached a Brexit Party flag to his guitar. Martin, , who ed to his native Leicester from Spain in the aftermath of the  referendum, said: “They are the only ones bringing our country back. “Iaposve never voted, apart from Neil Kinnock when I was . “I didnapost believe in democracy until it went away.”  Fteen candidates are bidding to succeed Onasanya. But bookies believe the battle is a two-horse race. The Brexit Party is   to win, Labour  , Lib Dems   and Tories  . One source said the Conservatives, whose candidate is Paul Bristow, had effectively “given up”. They were nowhere to be seen today. And there was little love for the Tories – or Labour – among voters. Louisa Berry, , a photographer, said: “Iaposm voting for the Brexit Party. “Everyone  seems to be messing things up and the Government needs a shock – this is the way to get the message across.  “I voted Remain in  but the country had its say, the vast majority voted to leave and we need to get on with it. “We canapost keep having votes until they get the answer they want.” Louisa voted Labour “until Jeremy Corbyn ”, adding: “I donapost like him, I think heaposs an idiot. “Heaposs very much along the lines of Trump in the fact heaposs got everything twisted. “I donapost like him as a person, I donapost think he would be good for this country. “He flip-flops on Brexit.” Gordon Richardson turned his back on the Tories and will vote for the Brexit Party.  The retired engineer, , said: “Itaposs the last chance weaposve got to get England back. “The Conservative Party havenapost done anything like what the people asked for. “Mrs May – and this sounds rather harsh – should have been tried for treason.” Looking ahead to the Tory leadership race, he added: “This by-election is a benchmark. “If the Brexit Party can get into Peterborough we will show Boris Johnson this is what the people of England really want.” Ivor Henson, a retired foundry moulder, will also back Nigel Farageaposs party, saying: “Itaposs time for a change. “Iaposve always voted Labour but the Brexit situation has put everything off. “Iaposve lived in this town since I was born – Iaposm  – but itaposs gone to the dogs. “The last Labour MP went to jail! “Labour hasnapost done anything, they just argue among themselves. They havenapost come up with an alternative.” He added: “I feel sorry for Theresa May, she worked bloody hard.” His we Shirley, a retired machinist who was also a lelong Labour voter, will also back the Brexit Party. “I want to leave the EU,” she said. “I hate the size of Jeremy Corbyn. Itaposs Nigel we are all for.” However, Remain-supporter David Richings, , a retired local government clerk, plans to vote either Lib Dem or Labour.  He said: “I voted for Fiona last time just to get rid ofStewart Jackson, a smarmy Brexiteer. “I didnapost vote in , I didnapost think there should be a referendum. “Iaposm dubious of Labour because Iaposm not sureLabour is a party of Remain. “I would describe myself as a Labour voter but they ought to get rid of Jeremy Corbyn and be a Remain party.” When the result is announced early on Friday, the Brexit Party could be sending its first MP to Westminster, piling fresh pressure on Labour and the Tories.

But David Hutchinson, CEO of theatre owners Selladoor, said he had intervened to cancel the appearance because of Ms Widdecombeaposs comments. Further dates next week in Lytham St Annes and Altrincham are understood to be going ahead as planned. Last night, the MEP, ex-Tory minister and one-time Strictly flop ranted against her former party in a chaotic appearance in Peterborough.  Wearing a pale blue rosette on her left lapel, she plodded along the Cresset Theatre stage as she raged about “three years of utter incompetence and lack of will” over Brexit by MPs. Warming to the panto atmosphere, the new partyaposs bizarre heroine asked  activists: “What do we want Peterborough  Brexit! When do we want it, Peterborough ” “Now!” came the reply. Her baffling entry to the by-election campaign came just days after she triggered fury by suggesting science could eventually cure people of being gay. But there was no mention of her offensive views on how to stop homosexuality as she urged supporters to back Brexit Party candidate Mike Greene, a former Conservative-supporting businessman who has appeared on Channel ’s The Secret Millionaire. She said in a weekend TV interview: “The fact we now think it’s quite impossible for people to switch sexuality doesn’t mean science may not yet produce an answer at some stage.”    But instead of ing to here theme, she focused on the impact a Brexit Party victory today would have on politics. “You will be sending shockwaves through Westminster,” she trilled. Shouting into a microphone in a haughty, Victorian school mistress voice ranging from alarming high-pitch to affected baritone, she pounded around the  saying: “We had have three years of fudge, confusion, obfuscation, misleading statements and getting absolutely nowhere, bot because something unpredictable and quite inevitable happened but simply because Parliament does not want to do what the country told it, it wanted to do.” Conservatives had “umpteen chances to deliver Brexit”, she insisted. While Miss Widdecombeaposs message and style will alienate many ordinary voters, Brexit Party fans lapped it up, including many who flocked to the rally from outside the constituency. Ben Rockclfe, , a student from North Cambs, said: “I thought it was good, Iaposve not really been involved in politics before or come to any rallies before but it has quite inspired me. “Iaposm interested in the Brexit Party and what they have to offer. “Hopefully they will get their first MP.” Brian Vowell, , a retired telecoms engineers of Southend, Essex, added: “She speaks the truth – MPs donapost speak the truth. “She was smashing and to the point.” His we, retired toy factory worker Jean Vowell, , said: “Sheaposs out of this world, sheaposs great.” Retired engineer Chris Edis, , of Peterborough, was “quite impressed”, saying the new party was “on the way up”.

With Jeremy Corbyn and Theresa May in Portsmouth for the D-Day commemoration the dubious honour of PMQs was handed to David Lidington and Rebecca Long-Bailey. For reasons best known to Labour Kremlinologists Ms Long-Bailey was the understudy for the usual understudy Emily Thornberry The shadow Business Secretary is viewed by some of Corbyn’s team as the preferred successor should the Labour leader ever decide to step down. So this step up was an opportunity to gauge whether she is a potential leader in waiting or a victim of over promotion.  If there were any nerves, she concealed them well. This was competent performance that made you forget it was her debut. Lidington had some fun in his first response at Ms Thornberry’s “internal exile” after falling foul of the “dear leader” but for the rest of the exchanges it was Ms Long-Bailey who set the pace. Understandably, she played it slightly safe by sticking to her areas of expertise, climate change and industrial policy, but her questions were sharp and detailed. She also showed the confidence to apparently re-write Labour’s policy on the hoof by declaring her party would not be reopening coal mines for energy use.  Scoring points off the unflappable Lidington is not easy. He has the manner of a vicar but one who, like Angela Rayner today, is prepared to wear bovver boots. Yet Long-Bailey made him commit a couple of unforced errors and neatly picked him up when he failed to answer her question on what the Government was doing for the steel workers. In her final question she combined an attack on the Conservatives’ failure on renewable energy with a big sell for her party’s green industrial strategy. There was fluency here that is often lacking when her boss is at the despatch box. Perhaps he should allow the understudies to take on the star role more often.

Gordon Rees, , scooped the le-changing £ million prize after buying a lucky dip entry while in his local shop in Nottingham, buying milk. He bought the winning ticket for the EuroMillions Millionaire Maker on June , , after a serendipitous chain of events.It started with his friend bringing him back some duty-free cigarettes, Nottinghamshire Live reported.He said: On that day, I didn’t need my cigarettes so I didn’t go to my usual shop but instead went across the road to the Co-op because I wanted milk and I thought itaposd be nicer than the corner shop one.    I went in, saw the price of the milk and almost walked out again, but then decided I couldn’t be bothered, walked to the counter with my money in my hand for the milk and my lottery. I had to queue - I think the shop assistant was having a bit of banter with a young lady in front of me - but I got there in the end, asked for two lucky dips on that nightaposs Euros and lo and behold, one turned out to be a winning ticket. It was just a lucky dip and I’ve done lucky dips ever since. I still play the lottery now. He checked his ticket in the advert break while watching a film, after a night of playing dominoes. He was so shocked, he called his daughter to double check. I couldn’t believe it. It was mind-blowing, he continued.    The next day we phoned the lottery people from the florist shop where my daughter worked at the time. They did all the security checks and said Congratulations Mr Rees, you’re a millionaire! But the money didnapost go to Gordonaposs head - he stayed in his job for another year, until his th birthday. He said: I’ve always enjoyed driving, they were a great bunch of lads at the company I worked for. I always enjoyed the banter and everything like that. Eventually, he took early retirement when the guilt he felt charging customers for their journeys became too much. I came to the conclusion that with all that money in my pocket, I couldn’t bear to take any money off my customers so I decided to finish, he added. When he won the money, Gordon had recently split from his long-term partner, had lost his family home and was living in a two bed flat on a council estate. The prize changed his le - he was able to buy a house, a car and has even been on a couple of nice holidays and treated his children.    But he hasnapost really splashed the cash and is excited to spend some time at his friendaposs caravan in Skegness. He did treat himself to some shares in his beloved football team, Notts County, after he had to grow up and give up his annual membership and season ticket when he became a dad, Iaposm living the le now, he said.

Organised by the Imperial War Museum it is part of an effort to recreate the campaign which helped end the Second World War. The Red Arrows put on a stunning display over the skies of Portsmouth as thousands gathered to watch below. The landings in Normandy on June   marked the opening of a critical third front against Nazi Germany and started the liberation of western Europe. Thousands of troops landed on the beaches of northern France  years ago tomorrow and fought their way through German defences.    So far,  dferent aircraft have been confirmed for the flypast on Wednesday  June. Following delays it has been announced they will set off at .pm from the Imperial War Museum at Duxford in Cambridgeshire. They will make their way over Essex, towards Eastbourne. hrsfrftowards Caen-Carpiquet Airport in Normandy. They will be escorted by a group of Second World War fighters.    They are expected to fly over Colchester and then to reach Southend. All times are approximate and weather dependant. The aircraft will then fly to Le Havre in France and the historic UK Drop Zone at Sannerville. Finally the fleet will descend on Caen-Carpiquet Airport. The US President joins more than  D-Day veterans at the ceremony to finish his UK state visit.    Trump, accompanied by his we First Lady Melania, is present with several other world leaders and royalty at the Portsmouth Naval Memorial in the coastal Hampshire town. But the world leader has today sparked fury after branding hospitals in the UK as a sea of blood . More than , members of the public are believed to be in attendance. One veteran, Alfred Fuzzard, , was a petty officer in the Royal Navy during the Normandy landings. He was on Landing Craft  and left Portsmouth at pm on the day before D-Day, carrying Royal Marines and sailors on board.    I wouldnapost have missed D-Day for the world, the pensioner, from Bexhill, East Sussex, said. It was a bit rough going over but it calmed down when we got near the beach.  The RAF had carpet bombed the beaches before we got there. We had rocket ships behind us - we could hear the shells going over the top of us. The full program for D-Day  can be found here. Details of which aircraft have been confirmed can be found here .

How fantastic!” yells the old soldier, , the wind carrying away his excited cries. Perched in the stern, two young marines watch admiringly as the pensioner from Dudley, West Midlands, takes the adrenaline-pumping ride in his stride. But Albert doesn’t scare easily. And nor do the  other  to -year-olds watching from the quayside and ship decks.    Seventy five years ago they dodged bullets, bombs and U-boat torpedoes as they stormed the coast of Normandy to turn the tide of the Second World War. And today, as they sailed into the peaceful waters of Poole Harbour, this spirited band of brothers got a heroes’ welcome from today’s naval personnel. The Royal British Legion-chartered MV Boudicca, which had sailed overnight from Dunkirk, was escorted into dock by three marine vessels as local children waved from the quayside. After disembarking the veterans and their carers chatted to young service-men and inspected their modern kit. Then Albert, who saw his Bren gunner pal Ernest being shot and killed in front of him in the weeks after D-Day, joined a handful of others taking thrilling boat rides.    On the quay former Royal Marine Commando Eric Carter, , of Birmingham, climbed up into an armoured vehicle. Serving Marine Christopher Takacs of Charlie Company,  Commando, demonstrated a new grenade machine gun that fires  rounds a minute. He said: “They’re our forefathers and we look up to them. They laid the ­foundations of what we are today ­especially in the D-Day landings.”” Impressed Mr Carter, who landed on Juno beach with Canadian troops on D-Day, said: “They weren’t like this in my day. It’s a nice piece of kit.” Coxswains of  Assault Group’s  Assault Squadron and troops also showed off their kit before sharing stories with the D-Day heroes. Veteran Trevor Stacey, Royal Marine of  Commando, chatted happily. Albert Barnes, , of Southend, Essex, inspected a modern weapon’s sights.  Royal Marines veteran Robert William Yaxley, , said: “I feel so lucky to be here. I landed on D-Day and went through to Germany without a scratch.It’s very important to mark this.” Aboard the Boudicca, Gordon Highlander veteran James Glennie, , of Aberdeen, tried a modern assault gun. The veterans are on a week long cruise marking the anniversary and will be in Portsmouth today for the official commemoration attended by the Queen and President Trump.    On Thursday they drop anchor off Gold Beach, Normandy, for services at Bayeux’s Cathedral and War Cem­etery and a march-past in Arromanches. Arthur Jones, , of ­Wolverhampton, drove a Sherman tank on to Gold Beach as he served with the th Essex Yeomanry. He said: “Another of our tanks had been blown up. The men hadn’t made it so I didn’t know what lay in store. I made it through though.” Eyes welling up, he added: “I think I’m going to get emotional standing in the cemetery at Bayeux on Thursday with the chaps who didn’t come home.” Arthur Bailey, , served with the th West Riding Infantry Division on D-Day then with the Paras at the Battle of Arnhem in September . He spoke to two local schoolchildren fascinated by his chest-full of medals. Explaining what they were for, he told the girls: “A lot of men died in the war, there aren’t many of us left.”    He went on: “It’s lovely that they are showing an interest. Youngsters today don’t seem to know much about it. Perhaps this will spark new interest.” Jack Mortimer, , from Leeds also made friends with a group of pupils. Jack, a dispatch driver with the th Ordnance Beach Detachment, had transported ammunition and mortars in his jeep on D-Day. But yesterday he stood surrounded by youngsters jigging away as they showed him the moves for toothless Grandpa Shark in the Baby Shark dance. He beamed: “Oh, how marvellous. I’ll have to remember this one.”    He added: “Today has been brilliant. I can’t really get the words out. It’s just tremendous to be welcomed like this.” Back on the Boudicca the veterans enjoyed a talk from TV historian Peter Snow and were entertained by magician Lance Corporal Richard Jones, winner of Britain’s Got Talent in . L Cpl Jones, , who serves with the Household Cavalry, said: “This is a really wonderful event to be a part of. “It is incredible and awe-inspiring to hear what these men went through on D-Day and throughout the war. “They are clearly having a great time, making new friendships and renewing old ones and having a real laugh together.

But a group of around  people are seen parading into the square, chanting shame on you, scum, and We love you Donald.And tensions quickly boiled over - just a .-mile walk from Southsea Common, where Donald Trump, Theresa May and other world leaders had joined , people for the National Commemorative Event for the th anniversary of the D-Day landings .For updates on the third day of Donald Trumpaposs state visit follow our  LIVE BLOG    In one clip a man runs around the outside of the protest with an American flag tied around his waist. It is understood one of the Pro-Trump group managed to grab an anti-Trump flag and snap it in half. Witnesses said police had to stand between the groups for around five minutes until tempers cooled.    Charlotte Jenkins, a politics student, was among the anti-Trump protesters. The -year-old, who had travelled from Swindon, Wiltshire, managed to avoid most of the fracas. She said: Itaposs great to see so many people challenging Trump and challenging his state visit. All the time the United States ban women from having abortions I will stand against him. It should not be up to political leaders, especially males, to decide whether a woman can have an abortion. Our body, our choice.    The UK should not be greeting Trump with fancy dinners with the Royal Family, he should be challenged. I am not going to stand here and throw milkshakes at people like they did in London yesterday, Iaposm against that. But raising awareness and giving people a voice is important, thataposs why I travelled from Swindon to be here.According to The Sun , Colonel Richard Kemp, head of UK troops in Afghanistan, branded todayaposs protest as extremely disrespectful to the soldiers who fought at D-Day.But Ronald Davidson, , whose grandfather served in the war, said: I think itaposs pretty ironic for Donald Trump, who has insulted every ally in NATO, to then show up today.  He has offended everyone and everything. The British Government are so busy looking after Trump that it is actually taking away from the reason we are even holding these D-Day events - to remember those who served on D-Day. Today should be about the veterans, not about Donald Trump.  My grandfather, Sergeant Andy Davidson, served in the war. It should be about him and everyone  who served. It upsets me that the public could not be there alongside our Royal Family remembering veterans because it is more important to protect Donald Trump. Trumpaposs UK state visit ends today. He flies out of Southampton Airport at around pm.

His we was very pleasant as well.    Mr Cuthbert was awarded the Legion DaposHonneur in May  for his role in the D-Day landings during which he served on a landing barge oiler anchored off shore from Utah and Omaha beaches. Charles served in the Royal Navy in the s, ending his career commanding the minesweeper HMS Bronington and joked with Mr Cuthbert about suffering from sea sickness. Referring to a segment of the commemorations that highlighted the conditions the men had to endure on the vessels heading to Normandy, the prince told Mr Cuthbert: As they were saying the smell of the fuel and people being sick must have been terrible.    I remember being in the navy and always being sick, and there was always someone who was never sick and would always appear with a mug of steaming soup. President Trump also wished happy birthday to Joan Jonni Berfield, a Wren, who worked as a coder and will be celebrating her th birthday on June . When she told Mr Trump how old she was going to be, he replied, Youaposre kidding, and Mrs Trump said: Nice to meet you. Happy birthday, hope you have a great celebration.

I received this email and I was shocked and saddened. It makes me so upset that something so important for our childrenaposs early learning is becoming so dficult for the school to afford. What the school are finding is even the most basic equipment, such as books and even pens and pencils, are dficult to afford. Books should be one of the basic things all schools and all children have access to. Stacy slammed funding cuts that see West Sussex schools receive £million less than the national average each year, according to the WorthLess  campaign for fairer funding. The school, which has more than  pupils, is situated in one of the aposmost underfunded countiesapos in the UK.  Other inidual books needed include atlases and healthy eating guides. A Department for Education spokesperson said that under the national funding formula, funding for schools in West Sussex local authority has increased by .% per pupil compared to -. They said it is equivalent to an extra £ million in total, when rising pupil numbers are taken into account. However White Meadows Primary School has only attracted .% more funding per pupil compared to - - the equivalent to just £ extra per pupil.

They are being as proactive as they can be.  Even though it looks like thereaposs more funding per pupil, in reality that doesnapost match the outgoings of the school to stay running. The schools are struggling so much to provide the basic things they need to educate our children. I know a lot of the items on the list were the Read, Write Inc. phonics packs which are books they use to teach the children the basics they need for reading. Now Stacy and other parents with children at the school are faced with the dficult decision of whether they can afford to purchase the books themselves. Stacy said: Iaposll be thinking about whether we can donate. Although my husband works we donapost have a lot to spare at the end of the month, so it would have to be a financial consideration. The school is good school and their pupil premium is spent on things like learning mentors and an in-house counsellor for the children that need it. Itaposs spent on the childrenaposs well-being.  It would be amazingthe general public were to donate too. A spokesperson from White Meadows Primary Academy said: “Like many schools across the country, we are finding the current funding environment challenging. We have worked hard to manage our resources the best we can, but we are now supplementing this by inviting parents to make voluntary contributions. As a school, we stress there is no obligation for parents to donate and we value the ongoing support from our families and the local community.” The Department for Education spokesperson said the Government was giving support to schools facing budgeting challenges. “While there is more money going into our schools than ever before we know schools face budgeting challenges, which is why we have introduced a wide range of support to help schools reduce costs and get the best value from their resources – from a free-to-use vacancy service to cut the costs of recruiting teachers, to advisors who are providing expert help and support to inidual schools that need it. “The Secretary of State has made clear that as we approach the next spending review, he will back head teachers to have the resources they need to deliver a world class education in the years ahead.” "},{"url":null,"title":"mum tears note boyfriend left","story":"NewsMum-to-be in tears by note her boyfriend left in balloon at gender reveal partyKevin McIntyre and dance teacher Amy Leishman gathered friends and family to discover the sex of their child - but there was an unexpected twistShareCommentsByJack Aitchison:,  JUN Updated:,  JUN Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video mum-left-tears-note-boyfriend-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,video.suppressDates:true\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA gender reveal party took an unexpected twist which left the mum-to-be in tears.

A report by the Rail Accident Investigation Branchhas revealed how the worker, who was working as a site lookout for a colleague,was aposdistractedapos when the high-speed train darted through the station. He would certainly have been struckthe train driver had not alerted the horn just in time. A series of recommendations have now been made following the near-miss in Peterborough on July , .    The report stated the worker moved out of the path about . seconds before the train, which was travelling at mphat the time, reached him. It also told how the track worker carrying out the inspection, who was also responsible for the safety of all the staff involved in the work, was not monitoring the unsafe actions of the lookout. Five recommendations have now been made to Network Rail, including ensuring that site lookouts stand in safe positions.    Simon French, Chief Inspector of Rail Accidents said: The number of near misses involving trains and track workers which we have seen in recent years is hugely disappointing. The catalogue of problems with on-site organisation and communication that we found in this investigation was alarming. Some of the people involved made assumptions about what was happening, and the lookout allowed himself to be distracted from the vital duty of warning of approaching trains. It is disappointing that the planning of the work had resulted in it being done while trains were running.    The investigation highlighted the dficulty of managing effective communications between controllers of site safety and the lookouts at locations remote from the site of work. Mr French explained: A number of unofficial flag signals were being used to transmit messages, and this was a factor in the Peterborough incident. For this reason, we are recommending that Network Rail investigates the methods of communication that are actually being used in these circumstances, and comes up with practical measures that will make le safer for teams working on the track.

Painter and decorator Kevin Dooley, , who was deemed fit to work by the Department of Work and Pensions , texted his daughter “I love you” before hanging himself. His daughter, Leanne Dooley, , found him hanging in his bedroom just days before Christmas last year and he died three days later in hospital. She told Wakefield coroneraposs court how she was certain his death was caused by his benefit woes. In a read statement, Leanne said: “I am of the firm belief the issues regarding my fatheraposs fitness to work and the subsequent stopping of his benefits had a very detrimental effect which resulted in worsening anxiety and depression and ultimately caused him to take his own le.” Department for Work and Pensionsassessors had written to Mr Dooley requesting a consultation in July last year and he was then declared fit to work. The decision was taken despite Mr Dooley suffering breathing problems caused by chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and doctors telling him he was too sick toto his job.    Mr Dooley lodged an appeal following the decision by assessors at Leeds Centre for Health and Disability Assessments, run on behalf of the DWP, but it was rejected. His employment support allowance was then stopped in November. His mental health suffered as a result and Mr Dooley feared he would be without money and may have to apply for universal credit, the inquest heard. His daughter planned to help him take his case to a tribunal. During the -minute inquest, a court heard Mr Dooley, from Leeds, West Yorks., had suffered from anxiety and depression since  and received the DWP letter in July . Mum-f-two, Leanne, , a pharmacy healthcare assistant, added: “At the time I tried to convince him not to worry. “Following an assessment, he was deemed fit for work and he appealed the decision but it was upheld. “The only option available to him was to take it to a tribunal. My fatheraposs payments stopped in November, he then had to apply for universal credit. He was extremely worried about not having money. “I visited my father on December , he was very quiet and worried. He was worried about his benefits having been stopped. “I had to leave him to go Christmas shopping and to pick my children up. I received a text from him saying love you. I knew straight away there was something wrong.” He was found hanging in an upstairs bedroom by Leanne who performed CPR before calling an ambulance. A decision was taken to turn off his le support machine and Mr Dooley died from a hypoxic brain injury due to asphyxiation secondary to hanging at Leeds General Infirmary on December th last year.    Doctor Caroline Abbott GP said: “He attended the surgery on August , , and was in a state of panic about his DWP medical in four days time. “It would appear Kevinaposs mental health was severely and adversely affected after the DWP told him he was fit to work, this affected his housing benefit.” Area coroner Jonathan Leach recorded a conclusion of suicide. He said: “It is apparent from Miss Dooleyaposs statement that issues regarding his fitness to work and stopping his benefits had a very detrimental effect on him and ultimately caused him to take his own le. “Kevin didnapost leave a note or any indication as to why he would take his own le so we donapost knowthat was the case.” Speaking previously about her dadaposs death, Leanne said he had been informed the £ a week and housing benefit entitlement he received would be cut. She said at the time he had three inhalers and “all kinds of medications” and would black out during coughing fits. “The assessor said he was fit to work because he told them he could walk to the shop sometimes and occasionally minded his grandkids,” she said. “But most days he was so ill he couldn’t get out of bed. No employer would give him a job because he wasn’t physically able to hold one down. “You only have to look at the news to see this is happening to many people. They are being deemed fit to work and killing themselves. It’s an absolute disgrace.” The DWP have been approached for comment.

And when the -year-old gave him a hug she felt a lump on his back and urged him to have his GP check it out. The University of Central Lancashire student said: “I thought it would be a cyst, nut I also realised it could be something more serious.” And it was.    James, , was discovered to have Ewing’s Sarcoma, a rare form cancer for which he’s spent the last  months receiving treatment, including Proton therapy in the US, before finally being given the all-clear. Emma said: “Before I spotted the tumour, I had only known James for five months after friends put me on Tinder as a joke. “James always tells me I saved his le. Butthat’s the case, I didn’t just save him, I saved our future together.” When Emma discovered James’ lump in November  he’d had no symptoms of illness and was busy getting on with his le, working in wealth management, playing golf, watching football – and getting to know the lovely new girlfriend he had met on the dating app.  “I wasn’t too concerned at first because I thoughtI hadn’t noticed it before, it couldn’t be much,” said James. His GP told him to monitor it, but by April last year it had grown to almost cm in diameter and James was sent to the Royal Preston Hospital near his home for an ultrasound and MRI scan. James said: “I was still thinking it was just something annoying that could be removed. “But when I got the call back from a specialist sarcoma nurse a week later, I realised it was what we had all feared.” Ewing’s Sarcoma is a rare cancer of the bone or soft tissue and it had begun in one of James’ ribs.    It mostly affects children and young people, with most cases diagnosed between the ages of  and .  James’ treatment began in Clatterbridge Cancer Centre, Wirral, Merseyside, in June . He was prescribed  cycles of chemotherapy with two very dferent regimes, radiotherapy and, in between, Proton Beam Therapy which the hospital suggested and sought to secure. Conventional radiotherapy can damage tissue surrounding the tumour which, as James’ was near several organs, could have affected him later in le. Proton therapy allows doses of radiation to be delivered precisely to the treatment area to ensure the therapy is accurate and prevents the risk of radiation reaching surrounding healthy tissue. When the tumour was shrunk sufficiently in May this year, James had an operation to remove what remained of his growth along with the rib where the cancer had originated, one above and one below.  It left him in a lot of pain, but every bit of it was worth it. Three weeks later, doctors gave him the cancer all-clear.    “And I owe it all to Emma,” said James. “She saved my le.” Emma,  from Lytham St Annes, said: “It’s hard to think back to when I found the tumour but I know a lot of people were expecting me to say ‘okay best of luck but I’m out of here. “But to me, that didn’t seem to be an option. “It did feel strange because we had only known each other for about five months but I just felt we were going to get through it together. “The hardest part was watching James go through all the treatment and feeling helpless because I couldn’t do anything. Even James has said he thinks it was harder for people looking on than it was for him. “And it was hard. When he got infections and he was in pain and feeling down, I couldn’t do anything to make it better. All I could do was watch…and hope.” Getting the ‘all clear’ was fantastic news, according to Emma, who says that she and James can now look forward to the rest of their lives together. The cancer is one that can come back but, she says, they can’t live their lives always wondering what is around the corner.    She said: “James and I have grown up going through this, without a doubt, and we have grown up together, and come through it stronger than ever as a couple. “We have been together now about two years and, for both of us it has changed our outlook. We appreciate each other and the le we have because of what we have gone through. “I obviously need to finish university but the plan then is for us both to travel and spend more time together – although we’ve spent almost every day together since we met. We have been through the worst and now we can look forward to the best, although we will be happy with a simple le. “Going through what we have - what James has – has made us both realise that it’s the little things like going to the cinema that mean everything and, of course, having our health. “We are happy and excited about what is to come and that, hopefully, will be a home, marriage and a family one day. We have joked about the great story we will have to tell our children, or the speeches people will be able to tell on our wedding day.” "},{"url":null,"title":"tragic story only two heroic","story":"NewsTragic story of the only two heroic women to lose their lives in D-Day landingsNures Dorothy Field and Mollie Evershed were killed as they depserately tried to treat the badly injured soldiersShareCommentsByJames Murray:,  JUN NewsJust some of the nurses who risked their lives to treat wounded soldiers \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email Only two British servicewomen lost their lives in the Normandy Landings – heroic nurses Dorothy Field and Mollie Evershed. This is their tragic story...They paid the ultimate price as they tried to save the lives of badly injured soldiers - becoming the only two British servicewomen killed during the Normandy landings. Nurses Dorothy Field, , and Mollie Evershed, , perished while tending  wounded soldiers from a sinking hospital ship. But their memories will be honoured afresh when their names are engraved on the planned £million British Normandy Memorial. They will be the only two women among the , names of those who lost their lives under British command during the Normandy campaign.As Prime Minister Theresa May and French president Emmanuel Macron prepare to unveil a foundation stone and a sculpture at the site of the memorial off Gold Beach on Thursday, the full story of the heroines of Normandy can now be told.   Dorothy and Mollie were serving with Queen Alexandraaposs Imperial Nursing Auxiliary on the SS Amsterdam. The Amsterdam had carried US rangers for Omaha Beach on D-Day – where they had suffered heavy casualties scaling the clfs – before converting into a hospital carrier ship, with wards and operating theatres, aimed at keeping the wounded alive and transporting them back to the UK for hospitalisation. For weeks since then, the medical staff, including Mollie and Dorothy, had nursed horribly injured men caught in the fighting still raging on the French mainland. Both were ranked as sisters, but Dorothy was a matron Then on August , , while making its third journey back to the UK carrying casualties, the vessel struck a mine off Juno Beach in fog, shortly before am. Knowing the ship was stricken, both women went below to help the stretcher-bound wounded up to a waiting leboat. Amid the chaos and panic of the sinking ship, they helped save many lives. The last man Dorothy assisted had just had a leg amputated.    But by the time they tried to escape the foundering ship themselves, it was simply too late. The Amsterdam sank in just eight minutes and their bodies were never to be recovered. Witnesses reported seeing a nurse, thought to be Mollie, trying to squeeze out of a porthole as the ship sank. In total,  wounded men were lost, along with  medical staff,  crew and  prisoners of war –  souls in all. But there is no doubt the death toll would have been far higher without their heroism. Another nurse, Lily McNicholas, from Ireland, survived the tragedy and was awarded an MBE for her heroism. One of the Amsterdamaposs crew, Patrick Manning, later recalled: The ship seemed to be broken in the middle, with one half listing one way and the other half the other. One of the funnels and the mast were down and the screws were out of the water. Only one LCA could get away to pick up survivors.  The wounded men were safely evacuated back to Britain where they wrote praising letters in tribute to the heroism of the nurses. They also wrote to Dorothyaposs parents in Crow, Hampshire, who were already grieving the death of her brother Charles, a test pilot, killed in . There is no record of either of the nurses having been married – though Mollie was thought to have been engaged – and it is not knownany of their families survive them. Mollie, born in Battle, East Sussex, went to Ely High School in Cambridgeshire. In July , the school magazine published a stirring tribute to its fallen pupil. It stated: In August of last year, she was on a hospital ship full of wounded men. An explosion occurred and the ship began to sink but Mollie and the Matron succeeded in carrying up to the deck about  stretcher cases.  Finally, however, Mollie was trapped below deck and she went down with the ship. Practical, steady and reliable, Mollie was always eager to help in any way. She was energetic, lively, full of fun and friendly and popular with everyone in the school, both staff and girls. We, who knew her and remember her, were grieved to hear of the loss of a young le, so full of promise, but we are also very conscious and proud of the heroism, devotion and sacrice which she showed in that hour of her supreme testing. Mollie is also commemorated on the Soham Town memorial. Former Ely pupil Christine Fuller, , who came across Mollieaposs story in the schoolaposs archives, said: She was an incredibly brave young woman who worked miracles to save as many servicemen as possible in horrendous conditions.

Talisa-Rose Smith, who was feeling down about a reduction in her Personal Independence Payment, was found dead by friends in a flat above a pub. The -year-old had also been informed her housing benefit was being reduced and received an eviction notice demanding she leave her flat above the Old Farmhouse pub in Nailsea by May . Talisa had suffered with mental health problems since school where she first started self-harming. There had also been a number of suicide attempts, leading to her GP practice only issuing her enough medication for three or four days at a time in a dosset box.    Just a year before her death her friend Claire Tavener was murdered by husband Andrew Tavener in their hometown of Nailsea, Somerset. The inquest heard she had suffered with post-traumatic stress disorder following Claireaposs tragic death. Talisa met best friend Kathryn Irish, who she had known for  years, for a drink at The Sawyers Arms in Nailsea, ten miles west of Bristol, where she worked as a bar supervisor. While Kathryn said Talisa seemed fine on the evening of March , her boyfriend Matthew Wilke said she got in a huff because he didnapost want to stay with her that night. She texted another friend during the evening telling him she was driving her car around as fast and she could adding that she was done, Avon Coroners Court heard. The friend told Kathryn about the text, leading her to contact Talisa who said she was all good. She replied telling Talisa people cared for her, everything would be okay and that she would see her the next day.    Talisaaposs mum and some of her friends tried to contact her but got no response the following day. Kathryn and her husband Joshua went to The Old Farmhouse at around .pm on March  where they met two other friends before throwing stone chippings at the window in a bid to rouse her. Having gone to collect a ladder Kathryn climbed up to the window and saw Talisa inside her front room, prompting her to rush upstairs and force the doors of her flat open. Despite attempts to revive her she was pronounced dead at the scene. Talisa’s mum Elizabeth Sanders told the hearing how her daughter, who she called Rosebud, had been badly effected when she orced her father Andrew in  and he had moved to Thailand. She said: “The effect of not having her dad around hit her hard. “She started to struggle at school and had bouts of depression.    “She loved people but could only cope in social groups where her condition was known. “She had a good group of friends and a busy social le. But the anxiety of that took its toll.” A post mortem examination gave the cause of death as hanging. Talisa had also confided to her mum she was a secret binge eater. Just days before her death she also told that her that the decision to reduce her benefits would not be overturned. Mrs Sanders told the inquest: “She felt betrayed and mocked. “But she did have things to look forward to. She was going away with friends for a long weekend, we had a family holiday booked to Malta and she had received money to buy a new car.” Toxicology reports showed Talisa had levels in excess of the safe drink driving limit in her system as well as traces of cocaine. The assistant coroner for Avon, Myfanwy Buckeridge, reached the conclusion that Talisa took her own le but the question of intent was unclear.If you are struggling and need someone to speak to, call Samaritans confidentially on   or email jo@samaritans.org"},{"url":null,"title":"best friends wear wedding gowns","story":"NewsBest friends wear wedding gowns on nights out after husbands cheated on themJulie Frug and Sarah Kralowski, from Illinois and Michigan, celebrated their orces by creating positive memories with their wedding dressesShareCommentsByAlyce Collins:,  JUN Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news weird-news video two-best-friends-wear-wedding-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, combinedPrompt :true, options :, subsets :[,,,,,],bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, combinedPrompt :true, options :, subsets :[,,,,,],bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,video.suppressDates:true\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailTwo best friends have been wearing their glamorous wedding dresses on nights out after they found both their husbands were cheating on them.

Julieaposs orce was finalised in January  while Sarah was officially orced in October same year. Julie was trying to find a way to donate her  wedding dress but because it was a -year-old dress, the only option was a company which repurposed the material to bury stillborn babies in. Julie was not content with that being her dressapos lasting memory, so she told Sarah thatshe wished to sell her Vera Wang gown, sheaposd better do so fast.    Sarah couldnapost bear to part with her stunning wedding dress as it was too important to her.One evening, Julie and Sarah were discussing what to do with their wedding dresses and were inspired to create an Instagram page where they post photos of themselves wearing their beloved wedding dresses while sitting at home, in the garden or larking about in public.Julie said: I married my husband in April , while Sarah married hers in May . I was looking for a new hair stylist and the universe put me in Sarahaposs chair as sheaposd had a cancellation that day and we connected very quickly.    My wedding dress was a sample dress which cost about £, and Sarahaposs dress was a Vera Wang dream dress. Julie and Sarah have created positive memories by wearing their wedding dresses around the house in each otheraposs company. They even ventured out the house to a local park recently where they took pictures of themselves laughing on the slide. Wearing their wedding dresses is light-hearted fun, but the pair also hope to convey the message that men and women shouldnapost feel ashamed of being orced, nor should they feel any shame for their marriage not working out.    Too many people let the fear of being orced impact their lives, so thereaposs a veil of shame or a feeling of failure that comes with orce, said Sarah. Creating new memories with the dresses has helped us both mentally as we canapost put them on without giggling. We rarely think about the first time we wore those dresses because now we laugh at the silly things weaposve done in them. We have found a lot of happiness after going through hell by finding humour doing funny things in our old wedding dresses, and hope we inspire others with our posts.

longer to charge an electric vehicle but uses less electricity, making it more efficient.The slower chargers, also being installed in the Greenmarket and West Bell Street multi-storeys, are

What a lovely morning.To all who sent cards for my th, including the community council, the Wednesday Club, the Inveraray Highland Games , my warmest thanks. And many thanks to those who helped me up after my fall and in particular Stuart Campbell of Brambles who took me to the surgery, whose very kind people cleaned me up and sent me on my way to my party half an hour later.And a mention to Take the Floor too on Radio Scotland on Saturday night. Thank you Inveraray and District Accordion and Fiddle Club and Margaret Mather our secretary for this request.So I won#t forget my th in a hurry, but such kindness and friendliness cannot be forgotten ever.My thanks to you all,Niall Iain MacLean, InveraraySir,I read with great interest the letter in the March  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser from C Rees, Lochgilphead.In addition to all that was mentioned I wonderyour readers are acquainted with the McCrone Report which was written in the s As I’m sure your readers are aware this was when oil had just started flowing from the North Sea. Mr Gavin McCrone was, at that time, a civil servant instructed to write a report on the possible effects of North Sea Oil on the argument for Scotland’s devolution.This quote comes from a letter written, by Mr McCrone, in April : #The Paper was written over a year ago in the weeks immediately before the February  election. This will be particularly apparent on page  where, of course, the ministerial pronouncements referred to relate to the Conservative Government.#So he was instructed to write this report by a Conservative Government but was reporting to a Labour Government.This quote comes from the end of the letter: #When my paper was written it was classied “secret” and given only a most restricted circulation in the Scottish Office because of the extreme sensitivity of the subject.#The report discussed the possibility of Scottish Independence and came to the conclusion: #What is quite clear is that the balance of payments gain from North Sea oil would easily swamp the existing deficit whatever its size and transform Scotland into a country with a substantial and chronic surplus.#Now, this is a very tiny segment from a document that could have changed our history but that’s in the past and we must now look to the future.What is upsetting is thatthis wealth had been invested in an oil fund or more fairly distributed by the  British Government # either Conservative or Labour # there might not, now, be an upsurge in support for separation from Westminster.Wilma Watts, TarbertSir,With Theresa May’s Brexit deal yet again failing to get through the House of Commons and a delay to the date the UK is due to leave the EU, it is clear that we are simply lurching from crisis to crisis.One wonders what good an extension will actually do given the negotiating position of both the EU and the UK. The UK is deadlocked, in terms of its people, Parliament and Cabinet and the likelihood of any semblance of a deal that command the majority of the House of Commons is unlikely. This is especially true given the deep isions within the Tories, both Remainers and Leavers, as well as opposition from the DUP.Given this situation those like myself have long argued that a UK-wide referendum on the deal, a so-called ‘People’s Vote’, with the option to remain in the EU, is the only credible way to break this deadlock. For those who argue that this would damage our democratic process, I am not sure we can slump any lower than the situation we are currently in.As David Davis, the former Brexit Secretary and an ardent Leaver, pointed out before the EU referendum: #If a democracy cannot change its mind, it ceases to be a democracy.#There are few I know who voted for Brexit in the belief it would make them poorer, and it is up to the public to give its view on whether the deal, and more importantly its implications, are what it wants.For once I agree with Jacob Rees-Mogg who previously supported a vote on the renegotiated settlement. A statement he now curiously seems to have forgotten.The Scottish Parliament has led the way in backing a People’s Vote and now that we know the precise nature of the deal, it is up to the public to have its say.Alex Orr, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 13","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWe could be wrong, but the confusion over Minard war memorial seems to be nothing a sit-down over a cup of tea couldn#t fix.It#s a pity the community missed out on the centenary fund, but there are general UK funds available for war memorials.

An implementation plan was produced in December  to cover the years -. Who in Argyll and Bute is responsible for this plan  How many of the outcomes have been achieved As someone who has been involved with autism personally and professionally for many years, I find it extremely disappointing there seems to be an inability by those in authority to get organised enough to address the issues and provide services for autistic people and their families.There is no need for further drafts and consultations.Someone in the authority needs to take responsibility for the existing strategy and implementation plan and get on with it.Maureen Mackintosh, Ardrishaig.Sir,Scotland’s small building firms had a strong start to , in contrast to the UK construction small and medium sized enterprisesector, according to the Federation of Master BuildersScotland.The FMB State of Trade Survey for the first quarter of , the only quarterly assessment of the UK-wide SME construction sector, showed SME workloads declined for the first time in six years.In Scotland, however, there was a jump of  per cent compared with the previous quarter. Thirty per cent of weighted responses were positive, up from  per cent from the fourth quarter of .It is encouraging the Scottish construction industry is bucking the wider Brexit trend with workloads and enquires in rude health. The UK-wide picture is very dferent, with the construction SME sector overall contracting for the first time in six years.Scotland’s good fortune could be due to fewer EU workers being based north of the border compared with other parts of the country, like in London where one in three construction workers are from the EU.Relying less heavily on migrant workers has meant the Scottish construction industry hasn’t fallen foul of thousands of EU workers ing home during the long march to Brexit due to no longer feeling welcome in the UK or sure of their future here.Scotland’s builders, however, must not be complacent. Looking ahead, the First Minister has indicated thatthe UK does leave the EU later this year, she wants a second independence referendum before the next Scottish Parliament election in . This additional political uncertainty, on top of the continued uncertainty stemming from Brexit, could impact on the construction sector in Scotland.The fear is a looming second referendum could test consumer confidence this year and next. For construction SMEs, this is particularly concerning as their prospects are vulnerable to dips in consumer confidence as so much work comes from the private domestic sector.Gordon Nelson, Director of FMB Scotland.Sir,I was joined by my fellow Conservative councillors in Kilmory recently as we discussed atthe numerous challenges facing Argyll and Bute.Ferry sailings, roads, education and the SNP#s late single farm payments were all mentioned.With the SNP hammering local authority spending and cutting our budgets, challenges in delivering services will become more prevalent.Despite this climate of cuts from the separatists, Conservative councillors are delivering for Argyll.

The weather was a challenge in itself due to the bitter cold, but the young people rose to the challenge and coped admirably.The climax of the weekend was the presentation of six Gold Chief Scout Awards to group members who have been working hard for four years to gain the highest achievement possible for a Scout. All six Scouts who gained the award have now started their careers in the Explorer section of the group.In late March members of the Scout and Explorer section joined with the Heart of Argyll Wildle Organisation to undertake an Earth Hour Camp. During the camp the group discussed how the unit could reduce its impact on the environment and how these changes could be implemented.

This new parliament will be pivotal in determining the nature of our future regulatory environment and we are keen and ready to meet with them.Our industry faces a number of challenges over the coming years, not just in relation to Brexit but on issues such as climate change, environmental policy, plant protection and animal health and welfare. There will also be opportunities for farming and we must ensure that we make the most of these opportunities to build a forward-looking, progressive and resilient sector that benefits farmers and consumers throughout the UK.We would like to invite all UK MEPs on to farms in their local areas to discuss a range of priority issues and to answer any questions that they might have.

coordinator who can point them in the direction of services such as volunteer-led social centres.According to the report, the closure of the councilrsquos day services will result in job lossesno

officer for adult service Michael Murphy, reads: ldquoDespite signicant increases in the numbers of older people living in our communities and accessing social care services, the volume of clients using day services has reduced in number from  in   to  in .ldquoThere is considerable overlap between day centres and social centres such as providing transport, meals and social

construction work to restore an elderly womanrsquos home damaged by recent floods.And the group will also take time to hike up Mount Mulanje to reach the highest peak in Malawi.After planning the expedition last summer, the group has need to raise over pound each for the project.Denis Robson, Graham Little, Thea Panter, John Little and Sophie Wilson will team up with five Malawian leaders to host the pilot programme.Through the Rotary Young Leadersprogramme, the Scottish Borders group was able to link up with the Rotary Club of Limbe, to plan the project.Travelling to Zomba, in Malawi, the objective is to develop leadership skills for both the --year olds taking part and the young Borderers involved.Innerleithens Denis Robson, the group leader, has been involved in making connections with the Zomba district for many years.Denis told us: ldquoOur focus is on creating a sustainable model for educating people to become young leaders.ldquoRYLA is a worldwide programme offered by the Rotary to improve the leadership skills of young men and women.ldquoWe are delighted to be taking part in the pilot RYLA Malawi programme and hope to encourage the local rotary clubs to adopt the model in future years and make it sustainable.ldquoWe have an amazing set of Border Exploration Group leaders and graduates who will be able to help share their skills and confidence to the Malawian youths.ldquoAnd I hope they develop a great international understanding that they can have throughout their lives.As part of the development project, the group will work with local skilled people to rebuild a storm damaged home in Liwonde.Malawi often is hit by extreme weather conditions and the recent Cyclone Idai was no exception.Additionally, the programme will include a Climate Mitigation project on the Zomba plateau.Working alongside the Forestry Department the team will prepare a site to plant  trees in October.And educate the community living in the forest to preserve the highly valued resource.It is hoped that these daily activities, together with evening workshops, will develop skills in teamwork, collaboration, problem solving, critical thinking, communication and leadership.A self- assessment questionnaire will be completed before and after the event covering self-confidence, communication skills, practical and leadership ability and general happiness.A presentation to parents s will be given by the young Malawians on the final day explaining what benefit the camp has had for them and how they can apply the experience for the benefit of the community.President-Elect Bernard at the Rotary Club of Limbe:ldquoThe RYLA-Malawi Program will offer an opportunity for Malawian youth to nurture and grow their leadership skills and potential,

Galashiels ndash who was a Captain and i c of A Company, st Battalion Kingrsquos Own Scottish Borderers, in the second assault wave on the morning of June .By June , , the Battalion had moved into the marshalling area Camp A. By this time all ranks of the Battalion had been briefed on maps with bogus name and map references - but everyone was fully in the lsquopicturersquo as to the plan for the invasion of the continent . The time in A was spent testing weapons and lsquoteeingrsquo up all the last details for the lsquobig dayrsquo.In the early morning of June , the Battalion embussed in TCVs and moved to the final Assembly area at Victoria Barracks, Plymouth. At am we were informed that owing to bad weather the operation had been postponed  hours.On June  we again moved to Victoria Barracks and at  hours started embarking on LSIs , although there was a fairly heavy sea running. The Battalion was on board by .. We sat at anchor until . when we set sail for the big adventure for which most of us had been waiting four years. It was an amazing sight, all around as far as the eye could see, there were ships of all shapes and sizes bobbing up and down on the water with their ensigns flying bravely in the summer breeze. As we passed the flag ship, with our Divisional Commander, Major-General Rennie and Admiral Vian on board, all ranks turned out on deck and saluted while the pipers played our Regimental march ldquoBlue Bonnets orsquoer the Border.The sea journey was one of the worst we had experienced, there was a heavy swell running and most of the Battalion felt very ill. After midnight maps were issued and from these, we saw we were scheduled to lsquotouch downrsquo at Lion-Sur-Mer about three miles west of Ouistreham.About . on June  we could see faintly the coast of Normandy on the horizon, all around us were battleships, cruisers and destroyers firing at the enemy, while overhead there was a continual stream of bombers and fighters. As we drew nearer the shore, we could see LCAs, DUKWs, etc ferrying stores from larger ships to shore.At . we were ordered to lsquostand byrsquo to disembark. Each man carried his normal equipment and personal weapon plus to extra bandoliers of ammunition, two -hour ration packs and an airborne bicycle. We had expected a wet landing but when we touched down, dead on time at ., we stepped off the LCI on to the shore. The Navy had certainly put up a terric show and now it was up to us.It took only a few minutes for the Battalion to disembark and then we moved off to our Assembly area north of Hermanville-Sur-Mer , this move was carried out without incident except for a few heavy shells from the coastal guns at Le Havre.At . the Battalion were ordered to move to St Aubin drsquoArquenay and ordered to lsquodig inrsquo. At . we witnessed what must be one of the most spectacular sights of the war - the landing of the Reserve Brigade of the th Airborne Division. It was certainly heartening for us, as up to then we had the feeling that we were all alone on the continent. Several prisoners were brought in during the night.Early on June  we prepared to attack the village of Gazelle. We moved on bicycles through Periers-Sur-le-Dan preparatory to the attack. At midday patrols reported Gazelle clear of the enemy and led by lsquoCrsquo Companythe Battalion moved through Gazelle to the woods north of Le Mesnil.We stayed until the morning of the th when we were relieved by the S Lancs while the Royal Ulster Rlesattacked Cambes Wood. At . the Battalion was ordered to pass through the RUR who had reached their objectives but were pinned down by heavy machine Gun, and Mortar Fire. The Battalion attacked after passing through the RUR and were met by machine gun fire and heavy mortar fire, but all Coys successfully reached their objectives. The Battalion suffered several casualties mainly from mortar fire.From June  to  the Battalion remained in Cambes Wood, where we were continually shelled and mortared and suffered fairly heavy casualties.Enemy mortar and artillery was very active ndash Battalion HQ receiving most attention. lsquoArsquo Coy HQ unfortunately came in for a very heavy lsquostonkrsquo and lost five killed and seven wounded. The end of the month saw the Battalion back in Cambes Wood once more, when we took over the right half of the line from the nd Lincs.During the month of June the Battalion sustained the following casualties two officers and  other ranks killed, eight officers and  other ranks wounded, and four other ranks missing.The Battalion remained in Cambes Wood till July . We continued to probe the enemy defences at night by patrolling. Sgt Grant carried out a very successful  hour patrol in the area of Galmanche. A lot of very valuable information was gained from this patrol. On the evening of July , Lt Robertson lsquoBrsquo Company carried out a very successful patrol and succeeded in bringing back identication of  SS Div ndash this information had been urgently required by higher command in view of the forthcoming attack.The Battalion were relieved by a Battalion of South Staffs and moved by march route to the area of Benouville in preparation for the attack on Caen. On the evening of July  the Battalion took over the nd Kings Shropshire Light Infantry in the area of Le Homme. A large formation of Allied bombers raided Caen in the early evening.On July  the Battalion again moved forward, this time to the area of Lebissey. There was some enemy mortar and artillery fire, but few casualties were suffered.On July  in conjunction with the RUR and Canadians, the Battalion attacked Caen. The Battalion was ordered to attack from the West with the RUR on our right. The Battalion moved to the Forming Up Pointon the outskirts of Caen. We were continually shelled from the Eastern side of the River Orne. It was a very unpleasant approach march to the FUP as the ground was completely open and overlooked from the high ground on the far side of the river. Led by lsquoCrsquo and lsquoDrsquo Coys the Battalion advanced into Caen and proceeded to winkle out the enemy. This proved a very slow job, the town had been heavily bombed and the roads crated or blocked by rubble, giving ideal cover from snipers and Spandau posts. By early evening all companies had reached their objectives, patrols established on the canal, and contact established with the RUR. The civilians gave everyone a terric welcome and produced wine, fruit and bouquets of flowers.On July  the Battalion continued to lsquomop uprsquo the town. There was slight enemy shelling during the day.On the morning of July , the Battalion were relieved by Canadians and moved to a rest area at Plumeto where the time was spent cleaning up, kit inspections and parades. Football games were organised and there was a generous allotment for film shows, swimming, etc. The Pipe Band played Retreat for the first time since landing, on the evening of the th. Officers and Other Rank reinforcements joined the Battalion and on the th we moved off at full strength to the area of Ranville, east of the Orne river, in preparation for operation lsquoGoodwoodrsquo, our objective in this operation was the important road centre of Troarn.On the morning of July , the Battalion moved off via Herouvillette, Touffreville to Sannerville. This was the worst approach march the Battalion had ever experienced. It was a hot summerrsquos day and having to follow the same route as an armoured Div and we were completely overlooked by the enemy. Enemy shells and mortaring was heavy and we experienced for the first time the enemyrsquos multi-barrelled mortarndash several casualties were suffered by the Battalion, including the CO, Lt. Col G.D. Renny. He was wounded in the face and arm but refused to be evacuated.On passing through the RUR at Sannerville lsquoDrsquo and lsquoBrsquo Coys pushed forward and encountered enemy machine guns. The enemy shelling continued throughout the whole advance. After lsquoBrsquo Coy had successfully put in an attack, the Battalion occupied an orchard about  yards west of Troarn where consolidation was carried out. During the night enemy shelling continued and enemy patrols encountered. On the th, the Battalion attack towards Troarn was continued, lsquoCrsquo Coy left ndash lsquoArsquo Coy right. Both Coys advanced, but were met with heavy machine gun fire, and although supported by tanks, were forced to withdraw with heavy casualties.The Battalion took up its former positions and spent a most unpleasant day of enemy mortar and shell fire.The C.O. was ordered to be evacuated by the Brigadier and Major T.G. Coverdale took over command of the Battalion. Casualties in the Battalion in this action were  officers and  other Ranks. To make things more unpleasant we had  hours solid rain. Enemy shelling and mortaring continued but our own guns had moved up and they did some very good counter battery shoots.On July , two enemy Stretcher Bearersapproached lsquoBrsquo Coy position and asked that they and ourselves should bury our dead who were lying in lsquoNo manrsquos landrsquo. A party of SBs under our Padre, Capt Wilson, went out and did this job. As in Cambes Wood some very good patrolling was done, and several prisoners were taken mostly from  Fusilier Battalion and  Panzer Grenadiers.On July , Lt. Col. J.F.M. MacDonald took over command of the Battalion. A strong enemy patrol attempted to penetrate lsquoBrsquo Coy position but were beaten off by small arms and two-inch mortar fire. Several casualties were inflicted on the enemy in this short and sharp engagement.The Battalion remained in this area till July  when they were relieved to go back into Army Reserve.The total casualties for the month of July were five Officers and  other ranks killed,  officers and  other ranks wounded and one other rank missing.The Old Gala Club records show that the KOSB story of World

He goes to bed with his T rex, plays with dinosaurs constantly and knows even the complicated names of lesser-known dinosaurs.However, we have tried very consciously to allow our kids to be who they are and resist the gender stereotyping that defines what a girl should be and what a boy should be.But here was my youngest daughter, at the age of five, clearly articulating the ision between girlsrsquo and boysrsquo toys.Her list was in line with the way toys are still marketed. Often there are two versions of the same thing, one for girls and one for boys.Even some story books are defined in this way, with images and colours which are used to reinforce the gender identity of the object evengender is not specically mentioned.Donrsquot get me wrong, I have no problem that my son loves dinosaurs.But I do have a problem with marketing directed at my children to force them into a narrow definition of what toys they should like based on a patriarchal version of gender.In truth, itrsquos not so much the toys themselves but the emotions and ways of being that are deliberately connected to them.Itrsquos the idea that boysrsquo stuff promotes bravery, toughness, being fierce and adventurous, while girlsrsquo stuff promotes cuteness, romance, beauty and love.It is changing and itrsquos much better than it used to be because there is so much more awareness and debate about this issue. Gender neutral marketing is more common now, mainly as a result of public pressure.But as the conversation with my daughter shows, we still have a way to go.But does it really matter  Is it just a politically correct obsession that is making a mountain from a molehill ldquoBoys will be boys, after all, and ldquogirls are all sugar and spice, and all things nice.It really matters, of course, and I think it matters just as much for my son as my daughters, perhaps even more so.That may be controversial, but I believe that as gender stereotyping is being challenged, it is often more dficult for boys to free themselves from the traditional definition of male identity than it is for a girl.I say this as a father of four girlsand one boy.Perhaps part of the reason for this is the fact that being male is still in many ways the privileged gender, and so there is an understandable focus on removing the restrictive definition of female roles which limit opportunities for women.But the struggle for gender equality has to be a two-way processit is to be ultimately successful.We must also unshackle our boys from the narrow definition of what it is to be male, a definition which still remains powerfully entrenched in our mindsets and the way society works.I personally suffered from this when at school. I was ldquosoft, sensitive, a daydreamer. I was often made to feel I was not a proper boy. There was no space for me to realise that the lsquoladdishrsquo way of being male was not the only way.Irsquom not advocating taking the dinosaurs away from my son and forcing him to play with a unicorn or Barbie doll. Even I loved dinosaurs when I was young. But it does mean allowing him, and yes encouraging him, to explore sides to his nature that society would still label as feminine: nurture, co-operation, make-up, dresses, dancing, looking after dolls and toys, and feeling vulnerable and being allowed to express it.The best way to encourage boys to express this part of who they are is through role modelling by other men, especially in the early years of childhood when a childrsquos brain is forming, and the childrsquos view of how the world works is being created.This includes how to treat others on a personal level.So nurture and care by male family members can be a crucial part of this. But one gender inequality we rarely hear about is the fact that men make up only two per cent of early years childcare workers. And this is an inequality not just for adults, but for our children.It conveys the message to young children that caring and nurture is not a manrsquos job or a male quality. So we grow up believing this is lsquonaturalrsquo.And this idea is so entrenched that there have even been examples of parents complaining that a man is working in a nursery!Looking after children is as much a manrsquos job as it is a womanrsquos. Or it should be, and seen to be. But itrsquos not just about work, or even childcare or parenthood. Itrsquos about ways of being and understanding that there are hundreds of ways to be a man or woman and we all have the right to make our own path.Thatrsquos why itrsquos important from the beginning to show that therersquos no such thing as boysrsquo toys or girlsrsquo toys: there are childrenrsquos toys.Or perhaps more accurately, to show the emotions and qualities traditionally associated with them are not gender specic.As always, children teach us. When we got home, Lewis put his T rex to bed. ldquoHersquos tired, he said, ldquoand hersquos a nice T rex.This was my lesson from my son: a T rex can be nice.He summed up the issue as only a child can."},{"url":null,"title":"looking-back-25-years-since-east-lothians-independence","story":"Twenty-five years ago this week, the Courier proclaimed the news with the headline: ldquoItrsquos independence for East Lothian.This week, East Lothian Council chief executive Angela Leitch said: ldquoThe Local GovernmentAct of  saw the abolishment of the two-tier Region and District Councils to be replaced with  unitary authorities across Scotland.\"I believe this has greatly benefited East Lothian communities, as responsibility for major services including education and social work were decentralised from Edinburgh and instead became the focus of political decisions at a more localised level.\"Over the years, our politicians have ensured ongoing investment in all of our towns and villages, providing facilities for local people, developing our infrastructure and continually working to improve the services we deliver. This has been recognised in a iety of inspection reports that have confirmed that East Lothian Council is a high performing council and has an ethos which recognises the importance of working closely with its residents and communities.\"Our elected members all live within the county, understand local issues and can ably represent the views of communities.\"Previously, some political decisions

government reorganisation:East Lothian has won the battle for independence.In a dramatic about face, Scottish Secretary Ian Lang has given in to the majority wishes of the population and decided it can stand on its own two feet.From , the district will once again become master of its own house as an all-purpose local authority.It means East Lothian councillors will be responsible for running a full range of services ndash from education and social work to rubbish collection and recreation.The Local Government Bill which will end the -year lespan of Scotlandrsquos network of region, district and island authorities is currently going through its final stages in Parliament.And earlier this week, Mr Lang ndash supported by local Labour MP John Home Robertson ndash tabled an amendment to give East Lothian the go-it-alone status it wanted.It was the high point in a hard-fought campaign by angry locals which began last year when the Government announced its original intention to lump East Lothian in with Berwickshire.But their success in fighting off that idea was not the end of the battle ndash they still had to persuade Mr Lang and his local government minister Allan Stewart that East Lothian was NOT too small to become an authority in its own right.They had also to force them to give up alternative plans to create an East Lothian-Midlothian-West Lothian authority ndash and more recently a proposal to merge East and Midlothian.As councillors and senior staff celebrated the announcement with champagne, [district] council chairman George Wanless smiled and said: ldquoWe

to do with it.He added: ldquoIf I was being charitable, I would say it was a case where the Scottish Office actually listened to the people for a change...It was, however, a ldquogreat decision for the people of East Lothian, who had supported the campaign from the start.ldquoI would like to thank all those who came out on the streets and took part in demonstrations in the early days of the campaign ndash and all those who wrote to Ian Lang in support of the idea that East Lothian should be an all purpose authority.Councillor Wanless totally rejected the previously-held Government view

fought back in a massive local campaign and we have won a magnicent victory.He paid tribute to Councillor Wanless and others who took part in the campaign, saying: ldquoWe have shown that public pressure can move even this Government.ldquoHowever, we are not out of the woods yet.ldquoLocal government is all about providing important services to local communities and we must continue to fight to ensure that East Lothian is properly provided with the funds it requires through revenue support grants.The councilrsquos Conservative group leader, the Rev Dr David Whiteford, said: ldquoI am very pleased that the Scottish Office ministers have listened to the electorate.ldquoThe view of the electors all along has been consistent ndash that East Lothian could and should be an all-purpose authority.ldquoI believe East Lothian has the capacity and potential to become an authority on its own and its staff are well capable of serving very well the needs of all the people.He added: ldquoI am very pleased that that message has now been accepted by the Scottish Ministers and that they have departed almost entirely from their original plan.ldquoLarge is not always beautul and I think we can do better on our own.He believed the transition to a stand-alone East Lothian council would be fairly simple.ldquoThe staff structures are already on the ground and all you really need to do is build on that.ldquoI do not anticipate a great deal of dficulty.ldquoIt is a challenge.ldquoIt is something that we should think through.ldquoWe have a new council coming into being and we should try to run it in a new style way.ldquoI hope councillors will concentrate on the needs of East Lothian people and will try and make that their main concern.Said SNP councillor George Thomson: ldquoEast

club who splits his time as a part-time support worker and caring for seven-year-old Sophie, from Blawearie Road, Tranent, has now hit out at the ldquodisgusting behaviour of security staff at the park.The family had made the trip south as Sophiersquos brother Kaden, , was playing in the May - football tournament.Mr Carruthers said that he, along with most of the group, woke up on the Sunday morning totally unaware of the events of the previous evening which resulted in the group not allowed to remain at the park, where they were due to stay another night, after their football tournament at nearby sports pitches ended.ldquoIt was all very upsetting, he said.ldquoWe didnrsquot really know what was going on. To kick everyone out after a few incidents seems to me really unfair.ldquoThere were young kids there who were very upset and humiliated.ldquoAs I understand it, the people responsible for what happened had offered to leave so that the rest of us could stay. It seemed cruel to kick every single one of us out.ldquoWe were on the bus when members of the security team came on and cut the childrenrsquos wristbands off [for entry to the park] which was really unnecessary.ldquoMy daughter was crying, it was disgusting behaviour.ldquoWhen it came time for us to leave after packing up our stuff, we had to walk to the place of pick-up and wait for the buses, watched by security guards the whole way.ldquoWhen we got to the place we were getting picked up from, we then found out that they werenrsquot going to allow the buses into the park. My daughter had her walker with her instead of her chair and was already struggling at how far she had had to travel there was no way they could ask her to walk another fair distance to the buses.ldquoIt was after what felt like ages, and I had kicked up a bit of a fuss, they finally let the buses come down to us to collect us. It was a humiliating experience.And he claimed: ldquoThe security guards were very intimidating, especially to the children. We were all treated like criminals, even though the majority of us hadnrsquot done anything wrong.ldquoMy daughter even turned to me at one point in tears, asking: lsquoWersquove done nothing wrong, why are we getting thrown out rsquoldquoI understand some of the behaviour was unacceptable, but there were young children on the trip and they should have been taken into account before the decision was made. To punish everyone for the actions of a small few seems very unfair.Flamingo Land did not respond for requests for a comment this week,Last week, spokesperson Andy Miller said: ldquoThe anti-social behaviour which was displayed by members of the football team in question couldnrsquot be tolerated as it was interfering with other guestsrsquo enjoyment.

Trees emit chemicals too, and darken the land, thus absorbing heat. But letrsquos not quibble. The Committee on Climate Changewhich inspired last weekrsquos landmark target, is in no doubt that mass reforestation ndash and wersquore talking billions of trees ndash will be one of the major methods of scrubbing CO from the atmosphere.Scottish Greens: How you can help fight climate changeScotland is well placed to deliver on this at least. Those barren hills and glens used to be under a dense covering of foliage. The forests were cleared for agriculture and charcoal in the south, and latterly for sheep and deer in the north. So mass forestation is only restoring the ecological default in Scotland.Nice to know, too, that Scotland, on paper at least, is leading the way on meeting climate change targets, having reduced emissions by a creditable % since . This is better than the UK as a whole, which is itself a world-leader in climate control. Scotlandrsquos abundant renewable energy is going to play a major role in transforming the UK economy.Transport is one of the main areas yet to be decarbonised, and every watt of that green energy is needed to make the switch from petrol and diesel in the next decade. Itrsquos long overdue. The internal combustion engine is th-century technology, horribly complex, unreliable and inefficient. Future generations will be astonished that we allowed our city streets to remain sewers of toxic chemicals.Mind you, the Scottish Government needs to put its foot on the environmental accelerator pedal. It is three years since I wrote a series of articles on electric cars after being allowed to drive some of them around Scotland. There were precious few charging points back then, and therersquos scarcely any more now. Yet, the electrication of transport should be a relatively simple exercise.Every petrol station should be a charging station, every supermarket car park, every school and hospital. Wherever cars congregate, in fact. The good news is that no-one who tries a modern electric car will want to drive anything , because they are faster, cheaper, safer and more reliable.Of course, manufacturing any car uses prodigious amounts of energy too, requires many costly materials and produces toxic waste. Electric cars arenrsquot a solution to climate change, but electrication of transport must be, especially micro-transportation. Every city in Europe seem to be turning to those electric scooters ndash except in the UK where they are illegal. Half of the bicycles sold in Germany now are electric. People are turning naturally to more energy-efficient transport so why not give them a push :Climate clock is ticking and now is time for politicians to fightThe CCC report was rather benign on flying. Yoursquoll be pleased to know that itrsquos not being phased out. This is probably because reducing aviation requires international agreement. However, cuts in air passenger duty seem dficult to justy. The Scottish Government wants APD cut by % to attract more business and tourists to Scotland. But Nicola Sturgeon is going to have to bite the environmental bullet here. The optics are wrong. It looks too much like a middle-class subsidy, even though many working-class people swear by Ryanair.Then therersquos the nuclear conundrum. Scotlandrsquos nuclear power stations account for % of electricity generation ndash a large proportion of our nominally clean energy. But they are old and unreliable and in need of replacement. However, nuclear power stations are regardedas a safety issue following Fukushima. They are also ruinously expensive and damage the environment by producing toxic waste which needs to be stored for thousands of years.The nuclear industry leapt upon last weekrsquos CCC report as a vindication of nuclear as part of the de-carbon equation. Big money is going into painting the atom green. But the prospect of the Scottish Government commissioning a new nuclear plant, given the explosive cost of Hinkley Point C, Englandrsquos first new nuclear power station in decades, seem remote. Renewable energy is much cheaper, joule for joule,it can be brought to grid fast enough. We are in a race against time to seeTorness and Hunterston can be made redundant before they fall apart.There are other issues too. Homes need to be insulated, gas boilers are going to have to go. Wersquore told to keep our home thermostats at  degrees, when most of us donrsquot have them. Itrsquos all expected to cost -% of GDP. But what was remarkable about last weekrsquos much-anticipated report was how doable it all appeared. By comparison with the apocalyptic forecasts of the climate Cassandras, like -year-old school striker Greta Thunberg, the CCC sounded like a walk in the environmental park. Nicola Sturgeon insists that cutting carbon will improve our health and wellbeing and the quality of le. Wersquoll all be happier, cleaner and probably working less in our new habitable planet.I hope shersquos right. There was an air of wishful thinking about last weekrsquos pronouncements. But therersquos nothing wrong with accentuating the positive. The problem with the more alarmist forecasts of Extinction Rebellion, who want net zero by , is that they induce not willingness to change, but a sense of futility and public apathy. If addressing climate change is going to involve banning travel, eating no meat, digging for vegan victory and plunging the economy into a biblical recession, as we close down whole sectors of industry, then people will not buy into it. The Yellow Vest movement was ignited by an environmental tax.Scottish Greens: How you can help fight climate changeIt may well be that the climate change targets are still too conservative. According to the UNrsquos International Panel on Climate Change, CO emissions need to be cut faster to prevent the planet warming by more than .C ndash the new tipping point. But the Scottish and UK governments have consistently outperformed their targets since they started making them seriously over a decade ago. They can do so again.Much of climate hygiene is self-evident. The public are morally signed up to it, and while abandoning their petrol and diesel cars may seem a grim prospect now, in practice it is likely to be a liberation. Most cars spend their lives sitting near a pavement losing value through depreciation. With proper public transport and urban alternatives, everyone wins.Vested interests are always a block on progress, but there is now a remarkable consensus, from the CBI to the GMB, BP to the NFU, the BMA to BMW. Addressing climate change need not take us back to a pre-industrial world of squalor, disease and hardship. The human race isnrsquot over yet."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/9918363.jpg?type=article-full","title":"a-guide-to-some-of-scotlands-best-beer-gardens","story":"Relaxing with a cold drink and enjoying the sunrsquos rays is a rare but welcome treat for us Scots.

After gorse was taken away and sand imported from other parts of the site, the new th, known as lsquoHillhouse,rsquo replaces the former par- th hole.To create a better link between the th green and the former th fairway, Kimber has also built new teeing grounds near the th green to enable play towards the new th fairway from a completely dferent angle and achieve a right-to-left dogleg hugging the railway line.With the alterations ready for the start of the  season, the new th ndash which at  yards features an undulating green, pot bunkers around the green and a view to Arran looking back down the hole ndash has already proved popular with members and visitors.Bob Anderson, Greens Convenor at Kilmarnock , said: ldquoWe are absolutely delighted with the new th hole, it couldnrsquot have looked better. It is a well-designed signature par-, with a nice yardage and improves the enjoyment of playing Barassie without the walks.ldquoVisitors or potential members were previously coming to Barassie and it was too long, overall. Over the years we have tried to get the playability up but retain the enjoyment and the new hole has already proved tremendously popular with all the members.The total yardage for the par- course has reduced by eight yards to ,, while the standard scratch for all levels remains the same.Coupled with other initiatives such as rough reduction, the course changes have also helped Barassie to grow membership in these challenging times.The club, which was founded in  and the course finally laid as  holes in , now has a total membership of over ,.Claire Middleton, General Manager at Kilmarnock , added: ldquoWe are thrilled with the new par- th hole. Paul Kimber and his team managed not only to meet our budget and a tight schedule but, even more importantly, meet membersrsquo expectations.ldquoWe look forward to another great golfing season and our members and visitors enjoying the course changes.Barassie, which also boasts a -hole layout, counts former Amateur champion Gordon Sherry and fellow ex-Walker Cup winning players Jim Milligan and Jack McDonald among its current members.The club also offers improved facilities in the clubhouse and professionals shop, run by Gregor Howie.Visit the website to find out more.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Lochranza CentreWelcome to Arranrsquos oldest and youngest tourist attraction.The Vikings called Arran the mysterious Island, sometimes there, sometimes not depending on the weather.

A pound token can help make sure that every child we support has a day out during the summer.ldquoMany of us will be planning elaborate holidays, but for some children and families just one day out can provide a vital break from everyday problems. To have these experiences is a really important part of growing up.Ruth provides some examples of the experiences that are made possible by the appeal.ldquoOur Family Resource Centre in Ruchazie is very much about getting families out together, but at other services children need a break from whatrsquos going on for them at home, so our support workers accompany the children.ldquoChildren can choose their own day out. One young man wanted to go to the art galleries in Glasgow. A -year-old girl who has been in care for many years had never been to a restaurant for Chinese food, so wanted to go out for noodles.ldquoOur Renfrewshire service helps adults with head injuries, but often their children are affected too, especially as incomes can drop dramatically. When a -year-old was asked, he said lsquocan I use the money to go the pictures with my pals and get popcorn rsquo.These are all things that most of us take for granted.A day out gives children the opportunity to try new things, make friends, feel included and just be a kid for the day.

Hersquos doing his best to look after everyone, but they are all struggling. Sophie needs a break, but this family has so little, they have no hope of financing that.Ruth Park says that bereavement is an area that Quarriers recognises as important to help with. ldquoIt is such a time of change for children. The mental health services that we have launched in schools help children facing those issues, whether its the loss of a parent, grandparent or a sibling, or even a orce.All Sophie wants to do is go to the beach with her mum, something that most of us donrsquot think twice about.

The squeeze means some subjects are disproportionately affected, including some sciences, modern languages and social subjects.The other issue, highlighted in the Stirling University report, is the fact the squeeze appears to be impacting on schools in some of the most disadvantaged areas of Scotland.: Disadvantaged pupils hit by subject squeezeOne answer to this from minsters is that CfE offers flexibility to pick up qualications at a later stage and that the success of the school system should not be judged in S alone.However, the Stirling University report is not so convinced, concluding: ldquoVery few schools have taken advantage of this flexibility.

One low estimate is that it caused , extra deaths.But for campaigners like Mr Roche ndash back in  a member of Scram, a group which united around opposition to East Lothianrsquos Torness nuclear power plant ndash it became an object lesson.But could Scotland or the UK suffer a Chernobyl  Mr Roche fears so.ldquoThat we donrsquot have this kind of reactor in the UK was always the get-out clause of the British industry, he said. ldquoBut that does not mean we cannot have another kind of accident.Scotland currently has two civil nuclear plants: Torness, opened in  and scheduled to keep working till , well beyond its original -year lespan, and Hunterston B, due to close in .:Mapped: Scotlandrsquos planet-saving carbon lsquosinksrsquoMr Roche recently warned that Hunterston could cause a Chernobyl. He was speaking after The Ferret, a Scottish investigative journalism team, revealed operator EDF had found  graphite cracks. That delayed plans to restart two reactors which were undergoing maintenance.The nuclear industry is confident it has better technology than the old Soviet system used at Chernobyl ndash and a tougher safety regime. Britain, it says, has been producing atomic power for  years and still has eight plants, including the two Scottish ones.Scotland is not building new civil atomic energy facilities, but England and Wales are. But the UK also has disused sites, such as the early experimental reactor at Dounreay in Caithness.The Nuclear Industry Association sees decommissioning these sites as an important business. It said: ldquoThe UKrsquos first generation of nuclear power stations and early research facilities have left a legacy which requires management and as a result the UK has a challenging portfolio to decommission.The UK also has another legacy: waste from the heydey of nuclear generation, currently stored at Sellafield in Cumbria, the former Windscale, which had its own incident in . That accident, a fire, was ranked at five on an international scale of disasters.Chernobyl was a seven, the highest. So was the  Fukushima incident when an earthquake damaged a power plant in Japan.Nuclear fall-out does not respect borders, so Scotlandrsquos decision to slowly phase out the technology does not mean the country could not be affected by a disaster.Watching Chernobyl, Mr Roche said he did not think UK authorities would be as ldquoincompetent as those in the Soviet Union. The old Communist dictatorship was only just opening up in .The show demonstrates just how dficult it was for local and national powers to handle the crisis.But as that mystery plume of fall-out crossed Europe, even authorities in UK struggled to know what to do.Documents revealed under the -year rule that Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher complained that her government had given the ldquoappearance of disarray in her absence.REDA MORE:Review: Midnight In Chernobyl: The Story of the Worldrsquos Greatest Nuclear Disaster, by Adam HigginbothamShe had been away on what was a long bank holiday weekend.

Associated with it is the emergence of strongmen leaderswho set themselves up as demagogues. Historian Reinhard Luthin defined a demagogue as: \"A politician skilled in oratory, flattery and invective evasive in discussing vital issues promising everything to everybody appealing to the passions rather than the reason of the public and arousing racial, religious, and class prejudice. Sound familiar In the US, we have Donald Trump, both egoist and egotist, who craves attention and would go to almost any s to get it. In India, Narendra Modi and his BJP have just been re-elected overwhelmingly, helped by their flirtation with Hindutva, Hindu nationalism, and by his high-risk, contrived military confrontation with Pakistan. And Vladimir Putin has always traded on Russian nationalism to maintain support.Closer to home, we have seen a marked rise in English nationalism as the Brexit debate has progressed. Not all Brexiters are nationalists, but an alarming number certainly are. As Michel Barnier has commented, therersquos a nostalgic longing for the days when the UK was the dominant world power and to be born into a prosperous, white British family was to win the lottery on Day One. And, of course, for the English nationalist, English and British are synonyms.Strangely enough, the SNP, the Scottish National Party, isnrsquot nationalist. Thatrsquos something that took me a while to get my head around, given the partyrsquos name perhaps it would have been betterit had been called the Scottish Peoplersquos Party or somesuch. The SNP is an internationalist party it recognises that Scotland is a small country on the periphery of Europe, with world-class universities, a skilled workforce and a strong reputation. It also recognises that, to capitalise on those strengths, Scotland has to work closely with others and to be an open, welcoming and inclusive country. I prefer that vision to the one projected by todayrsquos Conservative Party Labour lost its vision years ago.Doug Maughan,Dunblane.YOU see that Alasdair Galloway  And his letter about the collapse of the Labour Party in Scotland   Do you know what He is, in this caseno other, absolutely correct.He might also have added that Labours decline in Scotland has also been due to its massive complacency in the form of a chronic case of taking voters for granted, and an idiotic failure of the UK leadership to see the  referendum as both a mortal threat and massive opportunity. And that the  Brexit referendum was largely a replay of the same on the wider scale of the UK.

This means workers have to collect litter by hand that has either been dropped from passing vehicles or left behind in lay-bys.Douglas Laird, Transport Scotland’s Project Manager for the AWPR B-T project explained: “The process of collecting litter from the side of a trunk road places road workers right next to high speed traffic, which can be dangerous. However, this type of work would be unnecessaryeveryone took their litter home with them. We are therefore asking road users to consider the safety of workers, not to mention the environment, before throwing litter from their vehicles.“The benefits of this project are expected to be wide-ranging, including reducing congestion, improving journey time reliability and enhancing safety, as well as attracting new business and tourists to the area. “The new trunk road gives everyone a snapshot of how beautul the north east is, so keeping it free from litter will create a good impression for visitors and give everyone the chance to see the North East at its best.”Malcolm Findlay, General Manager, Aberdeen Roads Limited commented: “We would like people to take all of their litter home with them, instead of discarding it on the new trunk road, so we don’t have to ask our road workers to clear it up. Our workers are already busy patrolling the new road to ensure it is operating as it should, as well as helping road users who need assistance.“In addition, litter-picking in certain areas of the road will require temporary traffic management to be implemented, which has an impact on road users by reducing the number of lanes available.”Inspector Steve Manson from Police Scotland said: “Littering is an offence which is thankfully unacceptable to the majority of people. However, it is becoming an issue on the new road.“Workers have to be located in close proximity to fast moving traffic to remove litter and these works can themselves be a distraction to road users. Littering on a road can also cause damage to vehicle tyres or windscreens.“In circumstances where road policing officers observe anyone to be littering on any road, they will take appropriate action.”data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Families have told of their experiences on Universal Credit\"  Universal Credit in Crisis: These people want you to hear their stories of le on the problem benefit before it is rolled-out even furtherviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Tesco colleagues will be showcasing the Community Food Connection scheme this weekend\"  Inverurie store celebrates four years of surplus food donations viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"mp praises extension of apprentice programme","story":"Gordon MP Colin Clark has praised Aberdeenshire Council for #ambitious# plans to extend the Foundation Apprenticeship programme to more school pupils across the local area.The Scottish Conservative made the comments following a visit with Cllr Gillian Owen toan employer in his constituency that has taken on the first apprentice through the scheme.SengS of Ellon part of the Pryme Group, an engineering firm in the Balmcassie Commercial Park, took on Ellon Academy pupil Callum Turnball as a Foundation Apprentice .The FA is a qualication – over one or two years – that let’s pupils gain work experience within one of Scotland’s  growth industries while still attending school.The apprentices spend one day or two half days a week working with a local employer, learning some of the skills required for a future career.Mr Clark said: “SengS is a great example of a growing company here in the north-east of Scotland with world-class skills.“Callum is the company’s first apprentice taken on since Aberdeenshire Council became a Foundation Apprenticeship provider. “The council recently received £million from Skills Development Scotland to develop the programme and encourage more young people into work while they are studying.“Apprentices are in many ways the leblood of industry and governments at all levels should be doing all we can to increase vocational training and job opportunities for our young people.“We are fortunate here in the north-east to have a thriving economy with many good local employers.“The council’s ambitious plans to get more young people into vocational training should be welcomed.”Cllr Gillian Owen, Ellon  District councillor and chair of education and children services at Aberdeenshire Council, said: “FAs provide a unique opportunity for our young people and I hope other local employers will follow the lead taken by Sengs.”data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.ellontimes webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Ellon Resource Centre is one of the Aberdeenshire Day Service sites\"  Council day care services praised after inspection viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"oor wullie big bucket trail to visit inverurie","story":"Cartoon favourite Oor Wullie will make his way to Inverurie this summer as part of his charity Big Bucket Trail.The town and local area will house seven sculptures as part of the first ever nationwide trail raising money for The ARCHIE Foundation, the official charity of Royal Aberdeen Children’s Hospital.Across Scotland,  Oor Wullies will be found on the streets of Aberdeen, Inverness, Dundee, Edinburgh and Glasgow.A portion of those have been allocated to Inverurie thanks to the help of local businesses.GPH Builders Merchants, Inverurie Precast, ANM Group, Tarmac, Barra Berries, the Inverurie panto and the town’s Business Improvement District have each sponsored a sculpture, with funds going to benefit sick children in Grampian.Six Oor Wullies will be found in the town, while one will be ready to discover in Oldmeldrum.Derek Ritchie, manager of Inverurie BID, said: “We are absolutely delighted that the town will be hosting a number of sculptures this summer.

James said: “I’ve spoken to numerous people who have used the service. “Many of them have said that knowing a volunteer is giving up their time to help them at their lowest ebb is incredibly powerful.“When people are struggling, eventhey have family and friends close by, it can be hard for them to open up and talk about what is troubling them.“That’s particularly true of Scottish men who have a reputation for being stoic and unlikely to talk about their emotions.“However, that is also now changing and the ratio of men to women calling the Samaritans is almost  .“Men are more inclined to pick up the phone nowthey are worried or sad about something as they know that they can talk to someone at the Samaritans in the strictest confidence.“When callers phone in, it’s completely anonymous. “We can’t see your phone number or where you are calling from and you don’t even have to give your nameyou don’t want to.“All of that means people can have conversations in a way they wouldn’t normally.”Men and women contact Samaritans for a wide range of reasons including isolation and loneliness, problems with mental or physical health and worries about family and relationships. Just under a third of callers also express thoughts of suicide.Volunteers also run hundreds of community events and awareness sessions, working with a wide range of organisations including schools, colleges, foodbanks, community centres, support groups, youth groups and health and emergency services.These events help spread the message that Samaritans is there for everyone.The charity also works with a range of national and local partners to ensure suicide prevention is a priority. Samaritans runs a Prison Listening Scheme, training inmates to become listening volunteers and provide peer-support.And through its work with National Rail, it has trained thousands of rail staff in suicide prevention.Of course, operating  hours a day,  days a year means the charity needs ever more volunteers to help provide its services, which now include email and text messages too.So in this diamond anniversary year, James is hopeful of recruiting an additional  volunteers.“We have up to  volunteers, more than  of whom answer calls, emails text messages and letters,” said James. “What our volunteers do is pretty demanding – when you pick up a phone, you’ve no idea what someone is going to say to you next.“Being non-judgemental is the most important quality we look for in volunteers.“Many of our callers thank us for our advice but our volunteers don’t actually give advice – they are trained in active listening, encouraging people to share their story and work through their own problems.“We are often referred to as the fourth emergency service and demand across the UK is substantial.“That demand is not going to go away and we want to make sure we’re here for people now and in  years.“But there’s a natural turn-over of volunteers so we always need to recruit more.“We could be there for even more peoplewe had more volunteers.“So we’re looking for people of all ages and from all backgrounds to get on board.“We’d love to hear from younger volunteers as we’re looking at new technology, such as webchat, to respond to people too.“In the s and s, most people came to our branches for face to face chats now almost  per cent of our contacts are via the phone and you don’t need credit on your mobile to call us.“We can’t do online chats now but we want to make sure we’re accessible to future generations so we hope to set them up soon.”John Lawrie has been a volunteer at the Edinburgh branch for  years and has witnessed many changes.As long as his hearing remains intact, the -year-old plans to continue.Initially, though, the retired investment manager had his doubts.He said: “I never thought I’d be able to do it. But in the early s, a mini series was on TV about the Samaritans and I started wonderingit was something I could do.“So, almost on the spur of the moment, I applied. “After an initial chat, I was invited to do the training.“The intervening  years have been immensely rewarding. That might sound strange but speaking to someone in a terrible state and them ringing off  minutes later, feeling better, can be really rewarding.“I’ve not changed their le they are still in the same boat as when they first called. But talking to someone  can often help them see a way forward.“It’s a privilege to be the person that they’ve opened up to.”Some calls are, of course, harrowing but volunteers are there for each other and also debrief their manager at the end of each sht.John said: “I have spoken to people who are suicidal – we’re not there to talk them out of it. “However, we do ask them to talk about why they’re feeling so bad. “The fact they’ve called the Samaritans might mean they’re not quite as certain as they say they are.”John also enjoys visiting schools. “I often worry they’ll think I’m terribly old, which I am!” he said. “But I like to think they get on better with their grandparents.“I always end my talk by saying: “I hope you never need our service but,you do, I hope you never hesitate to use it.”Someone contacts the Samaritans every six secondsToday Samaritans has grown to become the leading charity for suicide prevention with  branches across the UK and Ireland. Someone contacts the charity every six seconds.In Scotland, volunteers were contacted more than , times last year and spent more than , hours providing emotional support to people in distress and crisis.People can contact Samaritans by phone, email, text, letter or by visiting their local branch.

According to these three parties, the new power supply system — known as #cold ironing# — will reduce the overnight carbon footprint from the vessel’s diesel generators and engines. It is believed that this will lower the ferry#s fuel consumption by at least  tonnes a year and resulting in a signicant reduction in carbon dioxide. It is also hoped that this will make a contribution towards further reducing nitrogen oxides, sulphur oxides and noise.According to the organisations behind these plans, it will be £, cheaper to service MV Hamnavoe each year, as a result of the project. £, of funding was secured for the scheme from the European Regional Development Fund in August last year, with additional funding coming from OIC#s Miscellaneous Piers and Harbours fund and HITRANS.The scheme is expected to fully pay for itself in three years’ time through efficiencies and cost savings.Organisations behind the project say that other benefits will include the installation of an electric bus charger at the ferry terminal to open up opportunities for an electric vehicle to be used on the Stromness to Kirkwall route. There are also plans for the installation of electric vehicle charging points, as well as  electric bicycles for use by members of the public.For the full story, pick up a copy of The Orcadian, this Thursday.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Having been extracted in the lab, the DNA has been sequenced and compared against known species, creating a near-definitive list of everything that lives in the loch for the first time.The results of the study were supposed to be published in January, but cataloguing the extensive range of micro-organisms and bacteria has taken longer than expected.The team has found around  dferent species of fish and up to , species of bacteria, some of which will have been deposited in Loch Ness by animals using connecting rivers.Prof Gemmell said he hoped to announce the full findings of the study at a press conference in Scotland next month.“Is there anything deeply mysterious  Hmm. It depends what you believe,” he said. “Is there anything startling  There are a few things that are a bit surprising.“What we’ll have achieved is what we set out to do, which is document the bioersity of Loch Ness in June  in some level of detail.“We’ve tested each one of the main monster hypotheses and three of them we can probably say aren’t right and one of them might be.”Although Prof Gemmell would not confirm which hypothesis might be right, the two main theories about the monster is it is a long-necked plesiosaur that somehow survived the period when dinosaurs became extinct, or it is a sturgeon or giant catfish.Prof Gemmell admitted that part of the reason for the delay in publishing the results was due to a series of failed attempts to film a television documentary.Negotiations with a series of production companies ended without a deal.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"lesley riddoch are the lib dems tory lite or truly radical","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Buoyant party must find distinctive policies and a leader capable of commanding the UK stage, writes Lesley Riddoch.Liberal Democrats are suddenly news again – dangerous enough to warrant Labour’s instant expulsion of nose-holding supporter Alastair Campbell but appealing enough to notch up a remarkable opinion poll first. \u2028Last week YouGov put the Lib Dems on  per cent, with the Brexit Party on  per cent and the Tories and Labour tied on  per cent. Even though that lead evaporated in the latest Opinium poll , they’re still celebrating a first UK top spot in nine years.: Dani Garavelli: ‘I disagree with Jo’ moment a bad start for SwinsonThe good news for the Lib Dems is that English Remain voters have either forgotten their part in imposing university tuition fees and austerity or decided there are bigger Brexit fish to fry. Whatever the reason, the party most used to losing deposits is riding high. But will they be able to capitalise on this opportunity without the weel kent face of Sir Vince Cable at the helm  : Jo Swinson: I will take on ‘independence obsessed’ SNPThe battle to replace him as leader at the end of July is a modest affair compared with the Tories’ -strong line-up. It features just two candidates: Sir Ed Davey and Jo Swinson. Nominations close on  June, the day Theresa May bids a tearful farewell. But at that point the Lib Dems must decide what kind of party they really are – nasty or nice Tory-lite or genuinely radical a one-trick, anti-Brexit pony or a vigorous and serious potential government. It won’t be as easy as it looks. The party’s moment in the sun may finally have arrived but beyond “Bollocks to Brexit” it’s not clear the party has a winning slogan, distinctive policies or a new leader capable of commanding the UK stage.Take Sir Ed Davey, whose radical credentials are surely damaged by taking a gong from the Tories in consolation for losing his seat after the coalition debacle. Sir Ed’s record as energy minister is underwhelming from a Scottish perspective. Subsidies for community hydro and solar  were cut and vital subsea connectors to the Northern and Western Isles vetoed because islanders wouldn’t knuckle down and build vast wind farms tode-risk the project and simply the budgeting process. Even though Alistair Carmichael was Scottish Secretary at the time, the long-awaited Northern Isles cables weren’t built on the Lib Dems’ watch. Mind you, Sir Ed did approve connectors to Norway and Ireland instead. Nice. He also introduced contracts for dferencein place of subsidies for onshore and offshore wind plus marine renewables. Somehow Scots firms have won only a handful of these contracts and a new island-shaped CfD was only introduced last week. Soon after losing his seat in , Ed was knighted and joined the PR firm that represents EDF Energy. EDF had just been awarded the contract to build Hinkley Point C nuclear power station by… Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change Ed Davey. Oh, yes, and Sir Ed supports fracking too. This is what passes for a radical record on tackling climate change in England.Anyway, back to Brexit – doubtless the Lib Dems’ strongest card. Sir Ed wants to use “the Cooper-Letwin process” so the Brexit default is Revoke rather than No Deal on \u2028 October. Whoop, whoop. When the crowd-funded Revoke Article  legal action failed its first hurdle in February , Lib Dem MP Christine Jardine promptly quit. Happily for MPs, all are now legally entitled to press the Revoke button, thanks to the tenacity, vision and co-operative capacity of the original petitioners in the Green, SNP and Labour parties. Without their constancy when the going got rough, Ms Jardine’s colleague Lib Dem MP Tom Brake would not have been able to join the posse in the latter stages and give the Lib Dems a democratic name-check. Poor.Meanwhile Sir Ed’s sole opponent, Jo Swinson, announced her candidacy on last week’s Question Time, taking a pop at the SNP’s failure to close the educational attainment gap. The MP for East Dunbartonshire cited figures from the Scottish Index on Multiple Deprivationwhich suggests only  per cent of children in Govan go on to higher education. This immediately provoked a social media storm, not least from Govan High’s headteacher who cited more recent figures which show the school’s actually doing pretty well. Was this an own goal or just plain baffling  Well, it would be usefula Holyrood statistician could explain how such wildly dfering stats can attach to roughly the same educational cohort. It would also be pointless to maintain that income doesn’t play a shamefully large part in determining access to opportunity in Scotland. But that’s why roughly half the population supports Scottish independence so all policy decisions, tax levers, benefit levels and income streams are under Scottish control, all ability to offload responsibility are at an end and a truly concerted sht of resources can tackle Dickensian levels of poverty, generated by David Cameron’s Con-Dem coalition government. Just for the record, both Sir Ed and Ms Swinson were members – she voted  times for the bedroom tax, five times against raising benefits in line with inflation, seven times for disability cuts and  times for general welfare cuts. But bygones…Even though the SIMD figures do exist, the statistical basis of her Question Time rebuke was dodgy, the “Milngavie air of superiority”was snfy, the “forced breeziness” a little wearing and the choice of First Minister Nicola Sturgeon’s seat as a target was negative and predictable. If Ms Swinson aims to outdo Ruth Davidson with high octane attacks on the SNP’s record in office, good luck. The SNP isn’t perfect. But politicians in glass houses shouldn’t throw stones. And thanks to the Lib Dems’ disastrous involvement with the Tories, shatterproof glass only covers them south of the Border for the single issue of Brexit. Even there, they must share the honours as second vote champions with the UK Greens. In Scotland, the latest poll puts them in fourth on just  per cent. And this despite winning a seat in recent European elections.If it’s too late to bring on a fresh face, the Lib Dems must find a fresh approach. Otherwise, it’s not just the big two parties that face political oblivion – ultimately, the big two-dependent Lib Dems will become political casualties as well. ©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"murray a scottish team could make more children play tennis","story":"More children would play tennisthey were able to play for Scotland and not just Great Britain, Judy Murray has said.Speaking at a special seminar in the Scottish Parliament, the mother of Andy and Jamie Murray also said she believed more money could be driven into the gamethere was a Scottish tennis team.Giving a talk as part of a series of seminars in Holyrood by leaders in sport, she said that Tennis Scotland received just £, from the Lawn Tennis Association - around one per cent of the organisations budget of £ million.She said tennis \"was and is\" a minority sport in Scotland and added: \"In tennis you cant play for Scotland - you have to play as part of GB. In some ways this is a disadvantage. If you were able to play for Scotland you could grow it [tennis] through a sense of identity, but its a GB sport.\"She also spoke of her disappointment that Scottish tennis was in a similar situation to when she first played as a teenager, and even when she became Scotlands national coach in  - the same year that she became the first woman to pass the Lawn Tennis Associations Performance Coach Award. \"When I was young there were no tennis coaches, because no-one aspired to be good at tennis, and there were no indoor courts. So it was a game you played in summer, and played badminton in winter,\" she said.\"When I became national coach it was because no-one  wanted the job because there was no track record [of Scotland in tennis] and no infrastructure. Nobody with any pedigree would apply for it. So I did.\"We had nothing here [Scotland] and we still have nothing here. Its the biggest source of disappointment to me in light of everything weve achieved.\"The former GB Fed Cup captain, who has  national titles to her name, also spoke of the sexism she had faced within tennis which helped her develop a \"f-you\" attitude.\"When I was young there were very few girls playing playing and there was no coaching infrastructure. But I do remember one coach who had no time for girls... he would put us in the worst hall, where we would crash into the equipment that piled up at the sides.\"When I started coaching I went down south to a course where I was one of two women out of  people. I was told by one man that I was lucky to get a place and that theyd had to turn guys away. I was told theyd had a complaint about me even getting a place as what could I possibly offer to coaching when I had two kids.\"I went into f-you mode.

Overall a victory for hope not hate. Lest we forget what international solidarity and cooperation sounds like:Love it. What a wonderful man and what a great work – one of Europe’s greatest composers and one of Europe’s greatest poets – a sublime combination. Here’s to Europe and Europeans: Wo dein zanfter Flügel weiltThis has always been my favourite stanza, but I’ve yet to find a satisfactory English translation – one that conveys the humanity as well as the poetry. Would you happen to have one Peter as ian says your discount the exit tories and labour. and best for remain itsa draw at worse its a good win for leave.In Britain, the total Remain vote was larger than the total Leave vote :. you claim that is not true.O dear me, Peter, you have absolutely forgotten both the Tories and the Labour voters.

Schiller was surely making a typically Enlightenment-era appeal for people everywhere to enjoy brotherhood or solidarity, irrespective of the irrational isions imposed on us, saying that joy in this reunites us. He knew it was chance that saw us on one side or another of any nationalist driven war, and wanted to emphasise the need for healing and togetherness.It’s a concept of course that also is captured by Robert Burns ten years after Schiller in: For a’ that and a’ that, or Trotz alledem und alledem, as it also became in . The final lines guaranteed translation into many other language too:Shall brithers be for a# thatSchiller would also have recognised the romantic sensibilities which informed Shetland’s Up-Helly Aa, or unserer feuer-trunken Faschingsdeinstag, ob du wilst. I think these lines from the closing verse of The Galley Song capture Schiller’s intention perfectly:O’er stre the curtain drawHappy to see Europe inspiring Shetland still!#Schiller was surely making a typically Enlightenment-era appeal for people everywhere to enjoy brotherhood or solidarity, irrespective of the irrational isions imposed on us#Unless of course they#re English eh Peter. You want to separate scotland from the rest of the UK yet come out with the PC BS above. just who are you trying to kid I wondered when the anti- English racist rhetoric would raise its ugly head on here. Rule Britannia was actually written by Thomas Arne a Roman Catholic who was proud to be British. He’d get short shrt on the so called Liberal Shetland Islands.The first  notes of Beethoven#s Fth.

Napoleonic Wars were certainly consequential in the rationale behind the companies formation. Particularly the Peninsular war.It wasn’t of course ever a one way street. Garve, a contemporary of Schiller and Goethe, did a great to broadcast the gains of the Scottish Enlightenment by translating and accrediting the works of Smith, Hume, Ferguson, Hutcheson, Reid and others, to the extent that Goethe himself, though perhaps before his heyday, said there was nowhere in Europe that could hold a candle to what was happening in Scotland. It would be unreasonable to suggest Burns did not become familiar with the thoughts of Kant, Rousseau, Locke, and other European philosophers, directly or indirectly, in the salons of Edinburgh. It would similarly be a nonsense to suggest that Haldane had no exposure to all this. His inspiration cannot be orced from the earlier flourishing of inspirational ideas of brotherhood and equal worth that happily live on yet. Shetland, after the Napoleonic era, seems to have been quite a radical place to a degree, as the later broken-promise legal challenges possibly demonstrate. There was also a legal challenge related to a whale grounding in Sandwick which seemed fairly radical in intent. The underpinning ideas don’t appear to respect the random lines drawn on maps that seem to dominate some people’s thinking.Some lines are more equal than others eh Peter The modern Labour movement of course grew out of the earlier Liberals, with many older ideas and values broadly held in common. Opening the debate, crossbencher, Lord Lisvane saw a problem where Scotland and Northern Ireland, as two of four parts of the United Kingdom, backed Remain, yet could be dragged out of Europe against their will. He identied #a sort of imperial condescension from the centre—from Westminster and Whitehall# and sought #a devolution settlement properly owned by its participants# that would #include something perhaps missing from the present arrangements: the R word—respect.#Most Scots voted to continue their solidarity with Europe, whilst a signicantminority of English and Welsh voters would apparently risk sacricing their older union with Scotland in order to Leave. Schilleradvocated seeking broadminded and warmhearted company. Should the UK falter, will it be those who sought to continue to enjoy the benefits of the wider degree of solidarity who are really to blame I am so sorry, Peter Hamilton, Schiller died two hundred years ago. Have you someone a little more contemporary to bore us with  Tony Benn had some creative thoughts about Europe, as did Jack Jones. They were real socialists and Democrats, not pretentious windbags. Now carry on spouting, Liebe Rosa, will be most impressed. # made me realise how cushioned from the worst excesses of Tory Lib-Dem austerity we are in Scotland: free prescriptions, no bedroom tax and – of vital important to many state benefit recipients – universal credit payment choices, to name but three.

Prepared in partnership with the pupils, diners will be treated to a lunch of scallop ceviche, oysters, seaweed soup and carrageen panna cotta, washed down with a Harris Gin and sea buckthorn cocktail.Events on Sunday nd June will include a walk to a rare native Skye oyster habitat, which will be followed by a screening of the recently-released film #Artishal# at the Aros Centre in Portree. Produced by Patagonia, #Artishal# is a film about people, rivers, and the fight for the future of wild fish and the environment that supports them. The film screening will be followed by a discussion led by environmentalist Corin Smith.Alon Schwabe of Cooking Sections explained why he believed this project was so vital. He said: #All across the Scottish isles, the United Kingdom and across the planet we are witnessing a tremendous loss of bioersity and extensive pollution of our air, land, and waterways. In the UK and all around the world, the environments we leave to future generations are in a fragile state.#Climavore questions how we eat as humans changes climate and develops programmes to provide tools to young residents of Skye to transform food practices, ecologies and environments to become better places for humans, plants and animals living along the tidal zone.#Atlas Arts producer Shona Cameron added: #Working with the students and teachers at Portree High School over the last year has been an exciting development for this project. The students have shown real enthusiasm to learn about the local ingredients and engage in conversations that question sustainability.#It has been brilliant to see restaurants across the islands continue to show enthusiasm towards the aims of Climavore and demonstrate a willingness to take on apprentices, working with them to bring Climavore dishes to their menus. It is our vision to expand the apprenticeships to more students and restaurants across the whole academic year, starting in September .#If you would like to attend these events or wish further information, you can visit atlasarts.org.uk, email shona@atlasarts.org.uk or phone  ."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/KEEP-TO-THE-LEFT-1-Copy.jpg","title":"tech giants urged to join keep left road","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineTech giants are being urged to provide an additional safety feature to stop foreign motorists from driving on the wrong side of the road.Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch MSP Kate Forbes has written to leading satellite navigation firms such as Apple and Google Maps to highlight the concern.Because some sat navs and smartphones give users a reminder of the speed limit, she hopes that a similar notice can be given so that tourists stay on the left-hand side.Ms. Forbes is supporting the #Keep Left# campaign, which was launched after Skye woman Sharon Anslow was injured in a collision with a tourist#s car last year.Ms Forbes said: #Nobody intentionally drives on the wrong side of the road, but clearly we#ve got to do more to remind visitors to drive on the left.#Having contacted all the car hire companies to raise awareness of this issue, I#ve started looking at other points of contact with tourists.#I#m sure that many will be using a navigation device, whether a GPS, SatNav, Google or Apple maps.#Already, these devices usually remind drivers not to touch it whilst driving and to keep to the speed limit.#I have contacted the tech companies to askthey could develop them further to remind drivers to drive on the left.#This could be done either verbally whilst driving or a warning sign before the start of a journey.

In  its final report included “proposed actions” for Ministers to adopt or pursue in order to lessen theeffects of households having to spend more than  per cent of their incomes onheat and light.Housing minister Kevin Stewart told the Free Press thetask force’s report and recommendations have “helped inform the development ofthe Fuel Poverty Bill and draft strategy”, alongside other signicantstakeholder engagement, including the first ever Islands Communities ImpactAssessment.He added: “Scotland is one of the few countries in theworld to define fuel poverty and set a goal towards eradicating it. By changingthe definition of fuel poverty so it’s more closely aligned to relative incomepoverty and taking steps to ensure it works for remote rural and islandcommunities, we are ensuring our support is focused on those who need it most.”A spokeswoman for Mr Stewart also said that “tacklingand prioritising extreme fuel poverty” – where households have to spend over per cent of their income on heat and light – was the first priority of the newBill. New definitions of both fuel poverty and extreme fuel poverty arecurrently being worked on.She added: “Our proposals in the Fuel Poverty Billwill align fuel poverty more closely with low income. Scotland is among only ahandful of European countries to define fuel poverty, let alone set targets relatingto its eradication. Our proposal to use the Minimum Income Standard isimportant and innovative and more closely aligns fuel poverty with low income.The UK Minimum Income Standard, used in the new definition of fuel poverty inthe Fuel Poverty Bill, takes account of the additional costs associated withliving in remote and island communities by applying an uplt for remote ruralareas and remote small towns, and, separately for island areas.

The late Peter McCambridge won his Distinguished Conduct Medal on the Longest Day - but he had, in fact, dropped into Normandy in the late evening of June , .Anyone who has seen the film of The Longest Day will remember the scenes featuring Richard Todd and the Glider troops of the Oxs and Bucks Light Infantry attacking Pegasus Bridge.Mr. McCambridge, then an NCO with the thParachute Btn. of the th Airborne Division, was fighting only yards from this famous action in the nearby village of Le Port.In later years, Peter McCambridge was a familiar figure in Ballymena. He lived at Wilson Crescent and was a keen walker. Few,any, would have known that the tall, bespectacled figure who went about his civilian le so quietly and modestly was one of the heroes of D-Day.This is what his citation recorded about the action:-  Unit : B Company, th Parachute Battalion. Service No. : . Awards : Distinguished Conduct Medal‘This NCO was one of the parachute troops who landed behind the German lines in Normandy on the night th th June . During the fighting for Beacutenouville bridge on the th June, McCambridges platoon was responsible for holding the village of Le Port. At one period his section became detached from the platoon and the fighting, which went on for  hours almost without pause, was particularly fierce. McCambridge noticed that one house dominated the scene of the fighting. By skilful use of a smoke grenade and displaying the greatest dash he got his section across a road swept by Machine Gun fire and into the house. He used anti-tank grenades to smash open the garden gate and the door of the house. Once inside the house he was completely cut off from the rest of his company, who actually had withdrawn slightly, but he was in a dominating position and became the target for the enemy who greatly outnumbered his section and were surrounding him. So well did he dispose his men however and so splendid was his leadership that he held this isolated house until the seaborne troops eventually entered the village from the other end, several hours later. At times the enemy were close enough to try and beat down the door by beating it with their rle butts - McCambridge dealt with such attacks by having grenades dropped on them from the upper windows. There is no doubt that the holding of this dominating house seriously weakened the enemy attacks and greatly assisted the battalion to carry out its job of holding the bridge. On the th June at Bois de Bavent during a company attack Sgt McCambridge, together with another NCO, saved the le of his platoon commander, who had been wounded and whose phosphorus bomb was burning in his pouch. Between them they extracted the burning bomb and dragged the officer to cover despite heavy and accurate mortar and Machine Gun fire.McCambridge has shown himself throughout the three weeks continuous fighting to be a truly magnicent NCO. He is calm, cheerful and always reliable.

Both league officials made excellent speeches during which they brought the best wishes of their respective organisations and paid generous compliments to Dromore on reaching their th anniversary.AuctionA highlight of the evening was the auction of sporting memorabilia. Hospitality tickets for a Northern Ireland game, signed shirts from Ulster Rugby and Linfield FC, and signed footballs from Rangers FC and Manchester United, all sold for very respectable sums.However, a titanic bidding war took place over a signed Liverpool FC football and the atmosphere in the room was electric as the figure kept getting higher and higher.When the auctioneer, Mr Fullerton, eventually brought the hammer down and declared ‘sold’, it was Amateurs committee member and local businessman Darren McCauley who became the new owner of the prized football.He might have paid an eye-watering amount, but being a lelong Liverpool fan and a great Dromore clubman, Mr McCauley was delighted with his purchase – and with Liverpool having won the Champions League final at the weekend, it now looks like a clever investment.With the formalities over, it was time for the band to take to the stage, and five-piece Klass proved a big hit, packing the dancefloor until the finish.AwardsThe final act of the   season came on Saturday, May  with a charity match between current players and a team of Amateurs “legends”.An entertaining game was played in a friendly but competitive spirit at the Community Centre.The youthful legs of the current players proved too much for the wise old heads of the legends. However, a clever tactical decision to play the last  minutes with  players on the pitch helped the old boys finish the game with a respectable - defeat.It was wonderful to see so many former players come along, pull the boots on and attempt to relive past glories.

It was really satisfying, there were no TVs, no gaming machines, managing there was all about conversation.”Gerry spoke of how the initial spark of the Jawbox brand came about due to his “wee bit of entrepreneurial spirit” – the ‘spirit’ being his drink of choice.“In all the years I’ve worked in bars the only spirit I’ve ever liked was gin. I had the idea of producing my own gin, bringing out my own brand. If it didn’t work I was more than happy to stay on as a barman, I would’ve always regretted never giving it a go.”Gerry said the process took over two and a half years from the concept to getting the name registered.“I did come close to giving up but all the right people came together, the absolute best of the best, with Echlinville distiller Shane Branf, his head distiller Graham Miller and packaging and branding coming from Drinksology. Everything started to move dead fast.”The launch night of Jawbox took place in late February  – “a night of one of the worst storms, so I wasn’t hopeful people were going to turn up” – at the Linehall Library, with a little help from the then Lord Mayor Arder Carson.“I didn’t want to launch Jawbox in a bar, every other bar would’ve gone ‘Well, why didn’t you launch it in my bar ’ I wanted something ‘old Belfast’ and at the start Linenhall [Library] told me that didn’t really do launches as such. I loved the setting and told them I had the Lord Mayor on board – I just had to ask him,” he laughed.“I then went over to City Hall and said ‘Any chance of speaking to the Lord Mayor ’ The staff were brilliant and Arder came over and fair play as he likes a brandy.“The next day, when it was being rolled out, I think almost every bar in Belfast took it.”In the event, over  people turned up to support Gerry that night – “one of their own”Jawbox is now served in bars across Ireland, has its own mural in Kelly’s Cellars, is the go-to spirit at Belfast International Airport, is served across the water as well as its signature label displayed in over , retail outlets in England, Wales and Scotland.Recently awarded Supplier of the Year at the Institute of Hospitality Awards at Titanic Belfast, Gerry was one of five artisan suppliers chosen to showcase his product at a reception for Prince Charles and Camilla at the Grand Central on Wednesday.“The name comes from my granny, Maisie, Maisie Cunningham, who would always say to us ‘In my day we all stood round the jawbox and did our washing,’ as not everyone had the pleasure or the luxury of having their own shared washing area. Everything would have been washed in a big Belfast sink, clothes, dishes, the baby –everything was washed in it. People shared their stories, told their tales, it was their jaws going round the box. I always say to people to this very day, when they have parties, where do people go  The kitchen. Everybody stands around the sink.”It’s evident just how much pride and enthusiasm Gerry has for the product that has grown at a speed he never foresaw just three years ago.“The award for Supplier of the Year meant an amazing amount to me, it was my fth time being shortlisted, twice for Jawbox, always the bridesmaid, never the bride. It was fantastic.”The -year-old says the power to promote Jawbox via social media is “amazing”.“There are places Jawbox is appearing that I would never know. Philip Schofield posted a bottle to his Snapchat, everybody was ringing me saying ‘did you see it  Did you see it ’”Having grown up in C­onway Street and later Lenadoon, Gerry has his base just off Queen’s University Belfast. “Where will the next three years take Jawbox ” I ask him. He replies: “The States.”“You only get one chance in America. It’s a matter of making sure we have the right importer, distributor. Sean Muldoon and Jack McCarty from the Dead Rabbit are out there who are going to be so supportive. I used to work with Sean in the Northern Whig. “Just two weeks ago Jawbox was used as the reception drink for the Irish Film Festival in Australia, we launched in Sweden.”Inbetween “surprising” those who take part in weekly ‘Gin Jaunts’ every Saturday afternoon as part of the extremely popular Taste and Tour experience, Gerry hosts Jawbox gin evenings at ious hotels were he shares his passion with others keen to hear how Jawbox was born.“I was really surprised to see how many young people turn up to these events. I nearly dropped when someone asked me to sign a bottle recently.“What I set out to do from the start was build a legacy, make the product authentic, that’s why my signature is on the bottle. I knew from the start that the quality of this product had to be better than anything  out there.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"loughinisland journalists re united with seized belongings","story":"TWO journalists who had materials seized by police after their documentary into the Loughinisland massacre have collected their belongings from the police.Trevor Birney and Barry McCaffrey were arrested in August  over the suspected theft of confidential files, shortly after the release of their documentary ‘No Stone Unturned’.On Tuesday, both men collected their possessions from Castlereagh police station which included laptops, hard drives, mobile phones, notepads and millions of digital files.On Monday, Durham Constabulary dropped their investigation after a judicial review last week ruled the search warrants linked to the raids on the two journalists’ homes would be quashed.Both men were released from police bail.Sinn Féin MLA Gerry Kelly called on Durham Police and the PSNI to apologise to the journalists and the victims of the Loughinisland Massacre. “This is a victory for freedom of the press.“Durham Police has done the right thing dropping the case against Trevor Birney and Barry McCaffrey.“This case should never have been pursued in the first place.“The two journalists should be thanked for doing their job and providing a service to society by shining a light on state collusion in the Loughinisland massacre.“They exposed British State involvement in one of the most notorious atrocities of the conflict. “The police response was to arrest the journalists rather than pursue those responsible for the massacre and cover up.“Freedom of the press is a fundamental principle in any democracy. “The Chief Constables of Durham Police and the PSNI should apologise to Barry McCaffrey and Trevor Birney as well as their journalistic colleagues and the Loughinisland families.“Durham Constabulary’s Chief Constable Mike Barton said: “Following the outcome of last week’s judicial review, a decision has now been taken not to progress the investigation into those two iniduals and both will be immediately released from police bail.“We are in the process of concluding what has been a highly complex investigation, with some final lines of inquiry still to be assessed. These lines of inquiry do not include the journalists, Mr Birney or Mr McCaffrey, as suspects in the investigation.“At all times, my officers have acted in good faith, within the law and followed due process. The warrant application was originally submitted to and approved by a county court judge. We do, however, accept and respect the decision of the High Court last week.“We plan to produce a final report to the Chief Constable of the PSNI outlining all of our findings.”In response PSNI Chief Constable George Hamilton said: “In , PSNI became aware of an alleged theft and or unlawful leaking of sensitive documents relating to the Loughinisland investigation from the Office of the Police Ombudsman. To ensure independence and address any conflict of interest I asked Durham Constabulary to conduct the investigation.“I am grateful to Durham Constabulary and to Chief Constable Mike Barton for the work they have conducted on our behalf in this sensitive investigation. I have always accepted the autonomy of Chief Constable Barton’s inquiry and I fully concur with his decision not to progress the investigation into the two journalists Mr Birney and Mr McCaffrey.“Throughout the period of this investigation, the horror of what happened in Loughinisland has never been far from any of our thoughts. The perpetrators of that crime have never been brought to justice and that is a matter of huge regret for policing.“The police investigation into who murdered the six innocent men in the Heights Bar in  remains open but progress is dependent on new information. There are people out there who know what happened. I would appeal to them to come forward and make a statement that will help us finally bring justice to the families of the victims.“I am aware that the investigation over the last year has caused concern for families who have already suffered so much. That is something none of us would ever have wished to do.“However, as a police service, the suspected theft or unlawful leaking of any sensitive documents containing information that may endanger le is a serious matter which we are statutorily obliged to investigate.“Recognising the sensitivities, we asked an independent Police Service to conduct the investigation. The clarity provided by last week’s hearing has now brought a signicant part of that investigation to a conclusion.“I await the final report from Durham on this complex investigation.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/PIPS-families.png","title":"pips families provide helping hand to each other","story":"NORTH Belfast suicide prevention charity PIPS has been to the forefront over the years in providing support to iniduals who are considering or who have at some point considered ending their own lives.PIPS also provide support to families and friends who have been touched by suicide, with their family group the driving force behind such support.PIPS Family Group Meeting takes place every Wednesday night from pm to pm in Tesco at Cityside.The group is currently made up of seven members, all women who have lost a family relative to suicide.Two such members are Patricia Perry, who lost her son Johnin , andAnne McKenna, wholost her son Broguein .Patricia explained how she involved in the group.“My son died  years ago. PIPS came to the house for the wake and I got talking to them,” she said.“They offered me the chance to come for some therapy sessions and to get involved in the family group. I went and thought at the time it was all too much. It just wasn’t for me.“A few years later I thought about it and went back. I met the other members and we have been best friends ever since.“The thing is we know exactly how each other feels. You can’t explain it to anyone  how it feels to lose a child.“There is one woman in the group who lost three sons and another who has lost two.”Anne joined the group six years ago when her son Brogue died.“For me, the group provides great friendship for me and I enjoy coming every week,” she explained.“When it is my son’s birthday or the anniversary of his death, sometimes I don’t feel like leaving the house but I would never miss a group meeting on a Wednesday night.“Really, without this group I don’t think I would be doing as well as I am today.“Every week, I look forward to a Wednesday night to come along and meet with people I now class as my friends.”As well as exchanging their own personal stories of heartbreak and loss, PIPS Family Group is much more than sharing their loss.Every year, members save up to fund a four-day holiday abroad with previous destinations including Amsterdam, Malta and Portugal. They also have regular days out, shopping trips and an annual Christmas dinner.“I think the social aspect of the group is very important,” added Patricia. It is not all miserable and we all enjoy our holidays and day trips to just get away from it all. We have all become really good friends.“We work closely with New Lodge Arts doing things like arts and crafts and doing social things with them really gives us all a bit of a lt.“Losing a loved one is dferent for each person. I understand the group might not be for everyone.“We all just sit and chat. We can talk openly about our loved ones we have lost and it helps us remember the good and happy times.”Due to renovation work at PIPS Antrim Road offices, the family group recently got good news of a room available in Tesco in Cityside, Yorkgate, where their weekly meetings will be held for the foreseeable future.Despite the success of the group, Patricia would like to see a similar group set up for men so that men can talk to each other about the subject.“The suicide rate in North Belfast is terrible. It is an epidemic,” she said.“We badly need a similar group like ourselves, but for men so that they can too talk to each other.“We have welcomed men before but some felt it just was not the setting for them.“I wish a man out there would do something. Men need to be talking.“As for our group, it is great to have this new room in Tesco. It is a good size and a lovely room.”PIPS Family Group are open to welcome new members.

It is definitely an iconic part of the lough.In the late s, maritime archaeologist Thomas McErlean and a team from Ulster University stumbled upon the worldrsquos earliest known tide mill during an excavation at Strangford Lough.Discovered close to the remains of Nendrum Monastery on Mahee Island, Thomas recalls the signicance of unearthing this medieval tide mill.Thomas says: ldquoThis was a site we got so excited about, we knew we were changing the course of Irish archaeology and indeedhellip industrial archaeology. We were breaking new ground and it was absolutely wonderful.In recent times, Strangford Lough has become an important site for tidal energy research and in  the worldrsquos first commercial tidal turbine was built near Portaferry.The turbine is now being decommissioned and local marine expert Simon Rogers, who is working on the removal, reveals the impact the tide has on operations.

Based on a five acre site at Kennedyrsquos Lake, the retreat has been visited by disabled groups who abide by the ethos of lsquofishing for funrsquo.No lead weights or barbs are allowed. Once a fish is caught and photographed it is released back into the lake.Robert explains that with the help of his close aide and fellow veteran, Nigel Cree, who is a director of Letrsquos Do Veterans Support, the net has been widened and that an invitation is being extended to anyone within the local community who wants to try out fishing.While battling to overcome his disability, Robert discovered there was little or no help for disabled veterans available in his community.Facing an interminable series of bad news on his journey to recovery he viewed the opportunity to be given a role in the British Limbless Ex-Servicemenrsquos Association as his saving grace.Robert said: ldquoWhen I got involved I saw people much worse off than myself. Some veterans had catastrophic injuries. I began to gain qualications in helping other people in the same situation as me. This helped me with my own recovery and give me a focus.ldquoMy house is down by the lake. One evening I was sitting observing how peaceful it was and it got me thinking about how I could put the lake to good use. In hindsight, the idea saved me from myself.ldquoI got a small team involved and before we knew it we had been successful in attracting funding to construct a car park, create fishing stands and a foot bridge, stock the lake with indigenous course fish and install an eco-toilet with disabled access.ldquoThere was no stopping half way through and the gamble has paid off with a successful opening and an encouraging demand for bookings growing each day.Robert describes himself as ldquonot being a lsquotea and biscuits man and doesnrsquot like to stand on ceremony.He continued: ldquoI have been helped by a devoted team of helpers and I would like to pay tribute to each of them and I dedicate this achievement to them and the three other veterans I started with who gave me great encouragement.ldquoIrsquod also like to thank Alpha Concrete, Hamilton Brothers and Cunningham Stone who were exceptional in their work with memorial plaques which have been erected.Robert said he hopes to provide fishing workshops in the near future and to get more people using the retreat.He added: ldquoA lot of time and money has been invested and when strangers visit we would ask them to adhere to the rules. They can contact me to book a session and pay a minimum day fee.For more information on Clough fishing retreat and for other initiatives which Letrsquos Do Veterans Support carry out, visit www.letsdoevents.info or contact Robert on  ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Event marking Men’s Health Week  ","story":"THE St Patrick Centre in Downpatrick is hosting a special event next month to mark Menrsquos Health Week.Between June  and June , the centre dedicated to Irelandrsquos patron saint will feature an exhibition of art, craft and woodwork by members of the townrsquos Menrsquos Shed.The shedders are busily preparing for the exhibition with visitors welcome to view the work on display and learn about the work of the organisation in the community.The Menrsquos Shed aims to promote positive mental health and wellbeing to men over the age of  with the organisation offering a sizeable, well-equipped workshop at its Ballydugan Road industrial estate.There, shedders make wooden items to order such as garden seats and planters and they also produce items for community and conservation projects, like bird, bat and owl boxes for the National Trust.The Menrsquos Shed also offers opportunities for people to learn new practical skills including art, wood carving, clay, copper and leather work. The shedders also sing, cook and enjoy copious amounts of tea, biscuits and craic.And when not busy making things, the men love to get out and about visiting other Menrsquos Sheds which is a great way to network and exchange ideas.They also take part in day trips and have been involved in a new community engagement programme at Hillsborough Castle.

He instigated the tournament and hopes his successors will continue with it.He continued: ldquoDuring my year we had the opportunity to salute Dermot Curran, one of our long standing councillors mdash in fact the longest serving in Northern Ireland mdash with whom we enjoyed a fantastic night.ldquoIt was also a pleasure to lead our St Patrickrsquos Day parade in my home area which was really special for me.

As a district, this is something that we need to take seriously, and not necessarily just rising sea levels.Mr Murnin believes that increased rainfall is going to make a dramatic dference to the way buildings and roads are designed, also highlighting the need to look at alternative energy forms.He added: ldquoBuilding for the future and how a modern city should look like will also be important. One thing that struck me looking out from the observation tower at the One World Center in New York was that the city is surprisingly green as so many of the buildings have roof top gardens and trees.

Those that are successful are provided with financial support for one year only.It is a system that the chairwoman of the Bishopscourtrsquos playgroup is keen to see changed.Mrs Patricia Curran, who revealed that Tiny Toons recently missed out on Pathway funding by a narrow margin, said playgroups did a ldquomagnicent job, particularly in rural area where working parents rely heavily upon them.She said playgroups look after children at the most critical time in their development and need to be provided with financial certainty.A number of playgroups across the district revealed recently that they were organising additional fundraising activities to generate income and were appealing for donations of everyday essentials including toilet paper, wipes, photocopying paper and even bin bags.Mrs Curran revealed that Tiny Toons only found out about the strategic support fund by chance and while pleased the cash will pay staff wages over the summer, fresh funding applications will have to be made at the start of next year to cover costs.ldquoWhile we narrowly missed out on Pathway funding, we have secured other support from a fund which we knew nothing about, she continued.ldquoThe money we have secured will keep us ticking over. We are not saying everything is hunky dory as a result of this particular finance. We have money to pay for  childrenrsquos places from next September which is good. The money secured under the strategic support fund will pay our staff over July and August.Mrs Curran said that had the playgroup not been made aware of the strategic fund it would have been a ldquovery dferent story.ldquoWhile securing funding comes as a relief, it does not provide us with any degree of certainty. We will have to make a fresh application for Pathway funding at the start of next year and go through this process all over again, as we and others do every year, she continued.Mrs Curran said Tiny Toons and other playgroups across the district were operating in a ldquochallenging financial climate.ldquoThe provision of ring-fenced funding is vital for us, she declared. ldquoWhile things are fine for now, we know that come the New Year we will have to start filling in funding application forms again.ldquoRing-fenced funding for a two or three-year period would provide certainty and help playgroups operate in a climate where there would not be a cloud hanging over them.ldquoThe funding issue affects all those in the education sector and I read recently that one headmaster warned that his school could be forced to only open four days a week as it did not have enough money.Mrs Curran said that while strategic support funding has provided Tiny Toons with short term relief, guaranteed ring-fenced financial support would provide certainly and allow future planning.She added: ldquoGiven the current funding model, there is always uncertainty hanging over us. We are voluntary workers and we should not have this pressure on our heads. That said,we did not do this work, who  is going to do it ldquoNot many people want to do voluntary work any more because of the pressure involved. We in Bishopscourt were worried about paying our staff and have been provided with some relief.

They set off, quickly deciding to start the race on the green paddock below the lodge .The decision to start there had far-reaching consequences for just adjacent to the chosen start location, come Thursday at pm, a camping couple decided to cook dinner on a makesht stove - they must have been planning a quiet romantic evening with stunning views and just as they had sat down, Frank Morgan, the perennial starterwith his flags and tape followed soon after by hundreds of runners and spectators gathering beside them - no need for them to put on the TV, they had all the live entertainment they needed.Back to Monday evening and the lsquocourse recce crewrsquo followed the Trassey river, crossing it before the hard climb up Slievenaglough, then following the green shoot up to the first check point at its summit.Then it was the technical descent down and up to the summit of lesser-known Lukersquos Mountain and from there making their way home.Mountain leader and rescue stalwart, Ian McCracken fell not once, but twice going over on his ankle badly mdash thankfully, no need for the mountain rescue as the lsquoProphetrsquo was there to guide him home safely mdash poor Ian, after all the winter preparation there would be no Thursday evening race for him.As the runners milled around , Pete Grant, who was surprisingly wearing his club vest for a change, must have had a category win on his mind, as he moaned and groaned about the long, sharp start, delaying the time before he could get his shoes properly mucky.Later on, however, that would be the least of his worries as for some reason he decided to leave his car keys somewhere out on the open mountain at a grid reference that to the present time only God knows.As Frankrsquos whistle was blown at ::the  runners charged off up the track and onto the open mountain.The route, mostly on sheep paths, took them directly onto the craggy summit of Slievenaglough that is part of the Mourne Wall route - a mountain that meant something on Thursday evening rather than just being an anonymous part of the route from the Harersquos Gap to Commedagh.Positively, pretty much everyone successfully reached the cut-off point of  minutes for the first mile that included around  feet of climbing.Newcastle ACrsquos Seamy Lynch had established a comfortable lead early in the race, clear of his club mate Mark Stephens with Newry ACrsquos Esther Dickson also comfortable in the womanrsquos race, ahead of Karen Wilton from Lisburn and Mourne runner Sarah Graham.It should have been plain sailing for everyone, but as often happens, the low cloud rolled in onto the ridge between Slievenaglough and Lukersquos and the summit of Lukersquos disappeared from view. We are still not sure that everyone made it there, but what is certain is that everyone made it back.Legal counsel Higgins lives le in the fast lane, balancing defending the indefensible in one court room or another with le on the farm and a Viking love nest in Tullybrannigan.If therersquos controversy in a sport not known for its controversy, Higgins perhaps will not be too far away - gamekeeper turned poacher  On the way home he chose his own line and clearly there had been some pillow talk, for she did too - slightly dferent, but both probably crossed the moral line, but probably not far enough to be eligible for a criminal conviction.His talk of bringing his finely honed orienteering skills to the table was not convincing the lsquoBroken Wing Commanderrsquo, but despite his protests supported strongly by the lsquoHenrsquo, the directors have no appetite for years in court ending in the European Court of Justice, no doubt, so the results stand.A fine run from Ballydrain junior Jared Martin to come home in third - a big star for the future  Many of the runners remarked this was the best HD course in years and it was great to freshen the series up with a new route - food for thought for the organisers for  Many thanks to all at Meelmore Lodge for the use of their facilities in this beautul location, the marshals, time keepers and people behind the scenes who keep the series running smoothly each week.Thanks also to the Avoca Hotel  Spa on their excellent food and beverages, by order of Jack OrsquoHare.Tomorrow night sees theto Millstone with full body cover required.

Ahead of the first episode, Ruth told the News Letter: “I was nervous at the start about it coming on TV. Then whenever I saw the adverts it’s put me at ease a wee bit. Businesswoman and fashionista Shirley“We’ve seen a few clips but we don’t get to see the whole episodes until the public sees them.”While it’s been billed as Northern Ireland’s equivalent as TOWIE and Made In Cha the characters come across as being a lot more down to earth.Ruth, , said: “It’s just the way we are everyday. People in Co Tyrone are very genuine.“It might come across as we all know each other but a lot of the people in the show I hadn’t met until we came together for the programme.Country singer Neil“I’d never met Bobby or Lynda or Audrey or Melvin. We’re all friendly now.“Even when I met them and the cameras weren’t on we got on really well. Bobby constantly had me in stitches. He could have his own show.“We’re from Dungannon. Lynda is Omagh direction, Audrey I think she’s up by Clogher.NI athlete Erin McConnell happy to rise before am to achieve Olympic dream\"  \"  Reported On This Day  Years Ago : Entry rules for the Downpatrick races are listed Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“The way it’s filmed it might seem that we live closer together.”Ruth said she had some dficulties with the cameras to begin with but soon found her feet: “When it was being filmed they said, ‘pretend we’re not here’. At the start I was accidentally looking into the lens. After a while, after the second or third time, you do forget the cameras are there.” Ruth explained how she got involved with the programme which was filmed at the start of last summer: “They went to my friend’s salon and they were giving out flyers trying to find someone who comes from a farming background and is also into the beauty and all. Helen said about me and passed on my details. They contacted me and I said I’d be interested, it sounds like great craic.”Ruth revealed that it wasn’t technically her TV debut: “When I was in primary school I was in school choir of the year, but that was in a choir and I’m a blur.”In one scene, Ruth who is a member of a gun club takes two of her friends shooting: “Hollie had shot once before, Helen had never shot in her le. We just sort of thought we’d go for the craic. That’s the sort of thing that we did for the show. It’s not like reality shows were they make drama for the sake of it.”Ruth described herself as “a part time farmer, part time beautician and a full time mum”. She said: “Maisie is two this week. She’s not in the show but I do talk about her.“I have a boyfriend, we’re not married or engaged. We’ve been going out for three and half years and we’ve been friends since we were .”During her early days as beautician she needed someone to practice on. Cue her dad John: “When I was training as a beautician I had to practice eyebrow waxing. I got my kit and asked dad would he let me practice. I think I got one strip pulled off and he stopped me. He said he’d been in enough accidents on the farm but that was by the far the worst. He ended up with one bushy eyebrow and one normal one.”She added: “My oldest brother John is a full time farmer. He’s won’t be on the show, he’s a bit shy. He works on the farm with my dad and my dad’s friend Billy.“My mumhelps out on the farm before her own job as a classroom assistant in a special needs school.”Ruth appears in the show alongside her brother Neil. As a duo they’re used to being in the limelight together.She said: “Neil’s a country singer. We used to sing together. We were a two-piece band then I went to Australia for a year and he went out on his own.“He started to make it really well on his own so I left him to it. I started a new job as a beautician and helped my dad out on the farm.”So has she got the bitten by the TV bug “It’s was really good craic,” she said. “If there was a second series and they asked me to be in it, I’d definitely say yes. I suppose they’re waiting to see how the first series goes.”She added: “The first night the trailer was on TV quite a lot of people videoed it and sent it to me on Snapchat. A lot of people have taken an interest.”try catch  TrendingPolice searching for missing N.I. man Ryan Smyth find bodyTT : Ian Hutchinson escapes serious injury following high-speed crash in qualyingIncreasing concern for N.I. teen who has vanishedSinger Malachi Cush lsquostablersquo in RVH following road collisionN.I. child reported missing is found safe and well*,:after,:before .teaser-essential,.u-clearfix .teaser-essential:after,.teaser-essential:before,.u-clearfix:after,.u-clearfix:before .teaser-essential:after,.u-clearfix:after .teaser-essential__link-primary .teaser-matrix__image, .teaser-matrix img, .teaser-matrix--native-ad img -moz-transform: rotate-ms-transform: rotate-o-transform: rotatetransform: rotatedisplay: blockwidth: %height: %overflow: hiddenobject-fit: coverobject-position: center@font-face src: url format, url format, url formatfont-weight: font-style: normal@font-face src: url format, url format, url formatfont-weight: font-style: normal.slab-matrix__title .slab-matrix__title span .teaser-matrix__readers, .slab-matrix__tabs li .teaser-matrix__heading, .teaser-matrix__category-link, .teaser-matrix__sponsor-link, .teaser-matrix__sponsor-text .slab--wowbrand  .slab__inner  .slab__block @media .slab__inner  .slab__block @media .slab__inner  .slab__block @media .slab__inner  .slab__block @media .slab__inner @media .slab__inner .slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title @media@media@media@media.slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title:hover,.slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title span:nth-of-type:hover .slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title span:nth-of-type:hover .slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title span:first-child .slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title span:nth-of-type @media .slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title span:nth-of-type .slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title .logo .slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title a,.inews-link-mobile a .inews-link-mobile a .inews-link-mobile @media@media.slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title a:after,.inews-link-mobile a:after .slab-matrix .slab-matrix .slab__block @media@media.slab-matrix .slab__block:nth-child, .slab-related .slab__block:nth-child @media.slab-matrix .slab__block:nth-child, .slab-related .slab__block:nth-child @media.slab-matrix .slab__block:nth-child, .slab-related .slab__block:nth-child @media.slab-matrix .slab__block:nth-child, .slab-related .slab__block:nth-child .slab-matrix__tabs .slab-matrix__tabs li .slab-matrix__tabs li.is-current .slab-matrix__title @media.slab-matrix__title span .slab-matrix.tabbed, .tabbed.slab-related .slab-matrix.tabbed .slab__block, .tabbed.slab-related .slab__block .slab-matrix.tabbed .slab__block .slab-matrix__title, .tabbed.slab-related .slab__block .slab-matrix__title .slab-matrix.tabbed .slab__block:nth-child, .tabbed.slab-related .slab__block:nth-child .slab-matrix-link .teaser-matrix, .teaser-matrix--native-ad @media@media@media@media.teaser-matrix:hover .teaser-matrix__image, .teaser-matrix--native-ad:hover .teaser-matrix__image, .teaser-matrix:hover img, .teaser-matrix--native-ad:hover img .teaser-matrix__image-container .teaser-matrix__image-container:before .teaser-matrix__image-container  img .teaser-matrix__image, .teaser-matrix img, .teaser-matrix--native-ad imgcontrastfilter: saturate contrast-moz-filter: saturate contrastopacity: .teaser-matrix__text-container .teaser-matrix__heading .teaser-matrix__heading:hover .teaser-matrix__meta-container @media.teaser-matrix__category-link .teaser-matrix__category-link--relative .teaser-matrix__category-link--relative.popular .teaser-matrix__readers .teaser-matrix__readers:after .teaser-matrix__readers svg .teaser-matrix__readers svg path .teaser-matrix__readers.up svg fill: #CFC.teaser-matrix__readers.up svg path .teaser-matrix__readers.down svg .teaser-matrix__readers.down svg path animation: half-fade s ease-out infinite.teaser-matrix__readers  span @media span @media span .teaser-matrix__sponsor-link .teaser-matrix__sponsor-text .teaser-matrix__link-primary .teaser-matrix.is-ie-fit .teaser-matrix__image, .is-ie-fit.teaser-matrix--native-ad .teaser-matrix__image .teaser-matrix.is-ie-fit .teaser-matrix__image-container, .is-ie-fit.teaser-matrix--native-ad .teaser-matrix__image-containercontrastfilter: saturate contrast-moz-filter: saturate contrastopacity: .teaser-matrix.is-ie-fit:hover  .teaser-matrix__image-container, .is-ie-fit.teaser-matrix--native-ad:hover  .teaser-matrix__image-container .ie .teaser-matrix__image-container .teaser-matrix--native-ad__meta-container .teaser-matrix, .teaser-matrix--native-ad .teaser-matrix__image-container .teaser-matrix__text-container background: -webkit-linear-gradient.teaser-matrix__heading @media@media@media.teaser-matrix__category-link .teaser-matrix__readers .teaser-matrix__sponsor-link .teaser-matrix__sponsor-link:hover .teaser-matrix__sponsor-text @media screen and .dy_unit .dy-editorial-wow__items + .dy_wow_widget_header .st .st The EssentialsVisit inewsVisit inews        v.. -

Presenting the memorial Morris Gault, Minister of Cooke Centenary, said: “For many of us the Church of Scotland being our mother church, means that they are family. The decision that we made last year, was to say that the moderator of our mother church was not welcome at our assembly anymore. That part of our family was not welcome in our house.”.ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog He added: “I found it dficult to understand last year, that having watched the Scottish moderator leave our assembly obviously heart broken, that we immediately passed a resolution that said that the councils, committees and departments of our church could collaborate with the Church of Scotland for the mutual benefit of both. Such meetings have been taking place. So what was the point in passing the earlier resolution ”Seconding the motion, former clerk of South Belfast Cecil Graham, said: “Our focus is on the restoration of relationships which go back over many centuries. Indeed the Scottish Kirk is regarded as our mother church.“As in most families there can at times be tensions and disagreements but pastoral experience evidence suggests that the restoration of relations brings healing. The heart of this memorial is the restoration of this relationship with the Church of Scotland.”Opposing the memorial Rev Jonathan Boyd, minister of Hyde Park and Lylehill Church in Templepatrick, said it was “time to move on”.He said: “It’s been six years since I was ordained and I can’t remember a General Assembly where we haven’t debated these issues.“I don’t see how it does our denomination any good to keep revisiting an idea that is so clearly being rejected in not one, not two, not three, but four successive votes. Surely not even Theresa May wouldn’t go so far as to put the same issue to a fth vote.”He said: “I pray that there will be such revival and reform in the church of Scotland that we will be unanimous in wanting to restore these symbolic links, but that time hasn’t come.”Following the defeat of the memorial Clerk of the General Assembly Trevor Gribben said: “Democracy is one of the strengths and hallmarks of our Presbyterianism and system of church government – debating together, in General Assembly, in an open and transparent way. “I am sure that there will be some in our church who will be disappointed that this assembly decided not to reopen the debate next year.”MOT delays: PSNI in talks about relaxing rules for affected drivers Coremetrics  Coremetrics

Unfortunately the swing bridge has been out of commission since June .I have met with residents and local Labour councillors, who have been working closely with residents to discuss their concerns and plans to make the bridge once more available to the public.The bridge is owned by the Vale of Glamorgan Council and leased to Penarth Quays MarinaLTD. It was built to ensure that both residents and boat owners had equal access to land and water.I understand that there are no mechanical reasons why the bridge should not be used.The Vale Council and PQM have agreed that safety upgrades need to be carried out for the bridge to reopen. In October  PQM submitted a planning application for modications to the swing bridge. I have been told that PQM were contacted by the Vale council to mody the current application to include lower intensity flashing lights and lsquosilent alarmsrsquo. Unfortunately PQM felt that the changes would not meet the safety standards they felt necessary and choose to withdraw the application. I understand that the Vale Council is currently awaiting the outcome of a noise report which will feature in future discussions between the Vale and PQM over the future of the swing bridge.The swing bridge has been an integral part of marina le for many years and is enjoyed by both residents and the thousands of tourists to the area. Connecting the two sides of the marina the bridge acts as a short cut for residents, particularly useful for those with walking dficulties. Having spoken to local businesses about the potential for the reopening the consensus seems to be generally positive. Reopening of the swing bridge, customers could use the car park on Llwyn Passat and use the bridge to access Portway businesses.I hope that the Vale council and PQM are able to work together to find a solution. I think we can all agree that the way forward is to ensure safe operation of the bridge while minimising disruption to adjacent properties.Before the Easter recess I met with residents to listen to their concerns over plans to remove Victorian lampposts from across Penarth. The cast iron lampposts, which have been an integral part of Penarthrsquos street scene for a century are being replaced by the Vale council with modern LED lighting. I am disappointed that several lampposts along Cwrt-Y-Vil road have been removed without notying residents.Residents have set up a petition, of which over a thousand people so far have signed asking for the old posts to be left in place with new ones installed beside them. This has been carried out in towns and cities across the UK to protect the local heritage.The petition can be found at www.change.org p vale-of-glamorgan-council-save-the-victorian-heritage-of-penarth u .I will continue to work with your local Labour councillors on these issues.

Although a relative newcomer to the site, having previously taught in Newport, it is clear he is immensely proud of the students and staff.ldquoVisitors to the school often comment on the warm, friendly and purposeful environment that exists at Stanwell and, despite its size, they see how the school cares about the inidual child and their progress, he said.ldquoThe schoolrsquos Mission Statement is summarised as lsquoLearning to Excelrsquo and this is the vision for every child, whatever their starting points, interests or talents. The school thrives because we have a fantastic team of teachers, teaching assistants, support staff, parents and governors who help make this vision a reality.ldquoThis is what makes the school so successful because everybody gives so much.Wandering through a theatre the school uses to put on assemblies and biannual productions, Mrs Kynaston pointed out a section of floor that moved away to create an orchestral pit. The production value afforded to every department ndash theatre, maths, sports, English ndash was astounding.ldquoWe try to give our pupils the very best, said Mrs Kynaston. ldquoWe want them to truly reach their potential.

The same story went for maths, with  per cent again hitting their expected target or better, against  per cent of Wales.       ,params: .pushAt A level,  per cent of all grades were A* or A, with  per cent of the year group achieving A* to C overall.A level results put Stanwell students amongst the top performers in Wales, with many iniduals securing exceptional grades.  of themachieved the equivalent of three A grades or better.Three of its pupils went to Oxford University last year, while another earned a place at Cambridge University.Mr Brown said: ldquoWe place a large emphasis on listening to our learners and and our pupils make a dference as leaders in the school, whether itrsquos through well established groups such as our school council, eco-committee or charity committee, or in aspects of teaching and learning where we have subject prefects and learner voice groups.ldquoThey help us evaluate our work as a school and plan for the future.ldquoWhat always comes through is how proud they are of their school.Rightly so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

So can the Secretary of State explain what he has done to offset the lost opportunity for Welsh steel producers of the lost Swansea Bay Tidal Lagoon and the electrication to Swansea \"What projects has he actually secured to provide procurement opportunities for Welsh steel producers  article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This argument was discounted by the planning committee.“As it is new information it is clear the initial granting of planning permission must be set aside. I have written to the NI Public Ombudsmanto look into how this planning decision was taken in the first place given information that was denied councillors and the public as well as the fact the land is zoned for sport and recreation not education.”Man banned from driving for a year Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT | Article

They toss, turn, and grade the shellfish according to size, before ing them to the seabed. Across the Lough we can see the Cooley Peninsula and Co Louth. In the Brexit border debate, this is ground zero.Growing oysters takes three years, says Darren Cunningham, owner of Killowen Shellfish, and he exports stock every week. “It leaves on a Friday evening at around pm, and % is exported to France. It goes through Dublin and Rosslare to the top oyster buyer in Europe. The oysters are in purication tanks in France by Sunday evening. That’s how quick it is.” Carlingford Oysters then travel to restaurants in Paris and other European capitals. How is business  “Very good,” Darren says. “We sold nearly  tonnes of oyster last year. Two tonnes went to China and the rest to France.” Is there much competition  “Not for us. We’re the talk at the minute. We have the best stuff.”Darren and his team work next to Ballyedmond Estate, the family home of the late Edward Haughey, founder of Norbrook, one of the world’s leading veterinary pharmaceutical companies. If you travel further up the lough – past Warrenpoint, home to Northern Ireland’s second largest port – you will reach Newry, where Norbrook is based.Killowen Shellfish and Norbrook, which generated an operating profit of £.m in the year to August , are very dferent businesses, yet both speak the common language of exports. There are around , VAT registered businesses in the greater Newry area and many of them are accustomed to criss-crossing the border.“We have a number of major global players based here in Newry who supply goods across the world,” Colm Shannon, chief executive of Newry Chamber of Commerce and Trade says.He name-checks MJM Marine, a leader in the global marine industry, which employs  people in three offices across Europe. “Equally, we have a number of smaller companies who are involved in north-south trade. That’s usually the first step into the export market.”Exports are the essence of business for Re-Gen Waste, a Newry firm established in  by five siblings. Re-Gen began by recycling paper, cardboard, tin and plastics, before graduating to municipal waste and black bin waste. The family developed their own purpose-built facility in Newry, creating a business that generates millions. Its work is spread across Northern Ireland, the Republic and rest of the UK.According to John Doherty, a director at the business, Re-Gen “exports hundreds of tonnes across the border every day. We’re the fourth largest recycler in the Republic.” Its recycled products are exported to almost  countries around the globe. Re-Gen is not alone. Other successful Newry exporters include FM Environmental Group, which has offices in Malta and the Middle East. In , Newry’s BM Steel landed new business, in a deal worth £m, in the Netherlands and Great Britain. Around Noon, a producer of high-quality sandwiches, employs  people and has made acquisitions in Dublin and London. Newry-based construction firm mac-group is another all-island operation. In , it completed a £m refurbishment of River House, a -storey building in Belfast. Simultaneously, it was working the new Barclays headquarters in Dublin. “We employ over  people, across four dferent offices,” Brendan Moley, group interiors managing director at mac-group says. “The Newry office has  full time people. A lot of those staff members support projects in Dublin, London and Birmingham. There’s a lot of commuting back and forth across the border. We are trading in cross border services on a daily basis, but we’re also heavily involved in products and goods.”Although GB is Northern Ireland’s biggest external market, businesses in the Newry region are accustomed to cross border trade due to their geographical location. “We’ve always looked at Newry as being half way between Belfast and Dublin,” Brendan says. “You can get to Dublin Airport in  minutes from here. The talent available within the Newry market, in terms of some of staff, skill-set and knowledge, is extremely beneficial as well.”Some businesses fear that a hard border, in the event of a ‘no deal’ Brexit, will cause delays. According to Darren Cunningham, only a few hundred lorries crossed the border every day in . That number is around , today. “A minute delay can knock everyone back hours,” he says. “My oysters can’t hold their breath forever. They’re a living creature. They only have a certain amount of time. The quicker they get to France, the better condition they’re in.”Re-Gen operates its own transport department. “Currently we send a lorry to Dublin twice in a day to collect materials,” John Doherty says. “If there is a delay at the border, you are likely require a second lorry. The cost of taking everything from the Republic to the north doubles.”Technology, such as unmanned border posts equipped with cameras, would be unlikely to solve the problem, suggests Brendan. “Any type of border control will impact business. Being from the border area myself, knowing how many crossings there are, I think it would be absolutely impossible to police it in any sensible way.”Newry businesses fear they will face mountains of costly paperwork post-Brexit. There may also be compliance issues, such as food traceability dficulties for food producers like Killowen Shellfish, construction product regulations for mac-group, or paper work for Re-Gen’s haulage drivers, whose Certicates of Professional Competencemay not be to be recognised in a post-Brexit EU. The Government has suggested imposing zero tarfs on goods from the EU in the event of no deal. Newry businesses believe this would put them at a competitive disadvantage. “The business community has expressed concerns that Northern Ireland will become a back door into the UK market for goods coming from the EU,” Colm Shannon says. “History tells you when you have iation of tarfs on the border, that’s an opportunity for smuggling.”Staff recruitment is another concern at Re-Gen, which has a -strong workforce. “We’re already finding it dficult to recruit staff,” John says. “Often, the people we’re hiring are seasonal and foreign workers. It’s the same for the agricultural industry, hotels...”But what about the arguments that a managed no-deal could be good for business  Firms would still have access to EU markets under WTO rules. Furthermore, the UK might strike lucrative trade deals in the years to come. Businesses around Newry are not buying this. Certainly not Norbrook, which has “an integrated supply chain, with a global supply base, which relies on frictionless trade,” according to Liam Nagle, the company boss.Uncertainty reigns for export businesses in the Newry area. “The chaotic nature in which this has been managed has restricted companies like ourselves from planning for the future,” Brendan Moley says. “It’s one  dawn after another.”Darren Cunningham, looking across the water to where Co Louth is starting to feel very far away, says: “A lot of people are in complete disbelief and don’t think it’s going to happen. I can’t get my head around it at all. That’s the truth.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/jannine_1.jpg","title":"my day jannine waddell","story":"Posted on Friday  May  by Ulster Business Name: Jannine Waddell MBE Position: Managing director at Waddell Media .amMy alarm goes off and I instantly check the weatherand have a quick look at emails that have come in overnight.

This level of freedom will no doubt make sure that Northern Ireland companies are at the cutting edge of innovation in the years to come.” Angela McGowan, CBI director in Northern Ireland, said: “KPMG’s  Global CEO Outlook gives local business leaders some great insights into what is on the radar for chief executives across the globe and raises some important and interesting ideas around what leaders should doing to maintain competitive advantage despite the uncertainty.”  View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/glandore_web.jpg","title":"glandore the family flexible workspace on the rise","story":"Posted on Wednesday June  by Ulster Business High-end flexible office company Glandore has expanded rapidly into an all-island family business with further growth on the horizon. Ulster Business speaks to director Clare Kelly about a burgeoning firm which is leading the way in more than just business, but connectivity, co-working and wellness for its members Eighteen years ago and in its early stages of infancy, Glandore began its le in one building at Fitzwilliam Square in Dublin – capable of hosting just  members.Fast forward to the present day and it’s an all-island business with an -strong workforce across nine locations in Belfast, Dublin and Cork – playing host to as many as , people. And it’s very much a family-owned and run business, led by founder Michael Kelly with daughters Clare, Fiona and Rebecca each as directors within the company.Glandore’s high-end flexible working spaces have been up-and-running in Belfast for  years – with capacity for  members across its two locations here. However, the family’s connection to the city dates back to , when Michael first bought - Arthur Street, now Arthur Place.It’s been at the forefront of attracting some of the leading international foreign direct investmentto Belfast, working closely alongside Invest NI to bring in cyber-security and technology firms from the US and beyond – first setting up here in . Glandore offers its members a wide iety of flexible office space, co-working and hot-desking – designed so companies can grow organically. But it’s also focused on bringing its members together, connecting indigenous and international firms, while also considering wellness in the workplace, and improving its green credentials. Clare Kelly is a director of the family business – a qualied occupational therapist and Trinity College graduate, who joined Glandore in .She’s now tasked with focusing on the key marketing and business development elements of the burgeoning company – attracting and retaining members, and ensuring there remains a strong pipeline of clients.“We offer our members a erse range of services,” Clare tells Ulster Business. That includes short-term hot-desking for small businesses with just a handful of employees, to providing flexible high-end office space for companies with dozens, or hundreds of workers.”And while the flexibility allows firms to scale from small numbers to a larger workforce – taking short-term space for as little as just three months – Clare says many of the companies stay for several years, orto Glandore further down the line in their own business journey.“We also host a range of events, and can bring everyone together through the network of our members. That has allowed us to cater from very early start-ups, right through to the largest multi-national company, or scaling FDI business,” Clare says.“The dference with Glandore is the flexibility. A company may wish to bring in one or two people, and then concentrate on recruitment – but they can then scale with their growth, from say  to  people. “That flexibility and scale is key. In terms of Glandore, we are offering high quality space, but also offering a range of business services to our members.”Across its two Belfast city centre flexible workspace buildings, Glandore’s expanding network means it can now host around  members – with locations at Arthur House and the nearby Arthur Place.It has six locations in Dublin, including the Silicon Docks and Central Business District, and has boasted a long list of foreign direct investment firms, including Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox and Smartbox, and has also opened its newest office space building in Cork city.Glandore has forged strong relationships with Invest NI – helping provide high-end working environments for rapidly expanding FDI businesses – along with Belfast City Council, the Belfast Chamber and Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Some of its high profile international current, or former members, include cyber-security experts Rapid , digital marketing firm Bazaarvoice and global payments giant Cayan – a company which has now expanded into its Belfast headquarters at City Quays.The quality and bespoke nature of the offices are part of what helps Glandore stand out from the crowd. Clare says firms are able to specy exactly what they want, with a top-end design and fit-out team on hand to develop a specic working environment for each business.“When Glandore was set up by Michael in , he always focused on a high quality working environment,” Clare says. “We take premium office space in premium locations, and there is no expense spared in fit-out.“We provide a bespoke set up – whether they need a co-working space or a virtual office, for example. We can tailor that for each business. It’s not a cookie-cutter approach.”And while she says design and the aesthetics are important, behind the decor is the IT and security infrastructure to ensure that guests have the very best available to them.“We have always invested heavily in our network, and have our own on-site IT. We have an IT director, manager and team – so there is support even before day one. All of these things are important to firms of all sizes.”For Glandore, it’s not simply about putting guests on seats – there’s much more to the offering. “We have such a erse mixture of companies in the network and community, and we are able to mix the indigenous firms with the international companies, and actively, facilitate connections between our members.”That includes an alumni programme, which sees members past and present ing to celebrate their successful partnerships.“We bring back customers from the last  years, and representatives from Invest NI and Belfast City Council. It’s about making the connections between the current scaling members and those which have come before,” Clare says.“That support is invaluable. It can be very isolating in the those days when you are setting up, so it’s great to have someone you can bounce ideas off.”Glandore goes further still, with the introduction of both the Glandore Wellness Programme and Glandore Green Initiative – the latter focused on creating a greener and more sustainable office space.“We have been working with these companies for several years, and we get a bird’s-eye view,” Clare says. “One thing we have been very mindful of is the need for us to support from a wellness perspective.“We offer a complimentary wellness programme, which started in , long before it became a buzzword. It offers a way for our members to connect with each other, and help in retaining talent.”And while almost every business has experienced some Brexit-related impact, Clare says Glandore has reached its highest occupancy rate in its history – rising to % in Belfast.“It has been a very uncertain time and that has impacted businesses across Northern Ireland. There have been some delays in regards to FDI, but our hats go off to Invest NI which still attracting businesses into Northern Ireland.”And while there’s also scope for further growth in Belfast, there’s potential for that demand to move outside Belfast, with a potential to grow into the North West.“The hope is to continue our expansion as an all-island business, having operated on both sides of the border for  years, with capacity to grow the businesses in Belfast.“With the likes of Derry, that would be something on the agenda for Invest NI as part of its remit to win investment for outside Belfast. We will take the lead from the councils and from Invest NI, and we will look to see where we can add. If there isn’t space for a business to land, people will go where.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
