This means if there is a snap general election as a result of the Brexit impasse, Mr Bercow could be out of a job much sooner than he expected.One senior Tory said: ‘As soon as it’s practicable we are going to hit him with everything we have got in our armoury. I know we are breaking with precedent but that is exactly what Bercow does when it suits him, and he hides behind precedent when it doesn’t suit him.’It is not only the Tories who have turned against Mr Bercow. There are two petitions circulating in his constituency, urging him to name a date to go. One – the ‘Give us a voice – not a Speaker’ petition – has 6,750 signatures.         To challenge a sitting Speaker would break with centuries of tradition, but they have given their blessing to the Conservative association in Buckingham, where Mr Bercow is the MP, to advertise for a new candidate. The decision was taken long before Mr Bercow dramatically announced he was blocking a vote on Theresa May’s Brexit deal       When he became Speaker in 2009, he promised that in line with his predecessors he would serve for nine years. This meant he should have resigned last June but grandly announced he would be staying on to ‘see Brexit through’.The decision to stand against Mr Bercow, described by one senior minister last night as ‘the nuclear option’, was taken long before he dramatically announced he was blocking a vote on Theresa May’s Brexit deal.In his local association, there is mounting frustration that he has refused to give any indication of when he intends to quit, despite endless requests.A senior Conservative source said: ‘The voices of more than 75,000 voters in the Buckingham constituency have not been heard in Parliament since 2009. \u0027Bercow is high-handed and arrogant in the Commons chamber. He is exactly the same in the constituency.‘We Tories may be ided on Brexit but we are united in our disdain for Bercow.’"},{"url":null,"title":"Owner Sam Smiths pub tried ban smartphones tablets bars","story":"Share this article ‘He was dressed down in ordinary clothes, a bit scruffy really,’ said Kevin Brown, 64.‘It was just a few people, about three of them, one using a mobile phone to talk to someone and the other two using a mobile and a tablet – I think to catch up on that day’s racing from Cheltenham.‘They weren’t being loud or anything but the old man heard a noise and went to investigate and realised the phones were the culprit.‘Apparently he wanted them banned immediately but the staff quite rightly told him he couldn’t do that. Phones are a part of life now, everybody’s got one. \u0027The fear now is that he has gone away to think about it and could issue a ban any day.’ Staff at another pub – the Bispham Hotel in Blackpool – confirmed they had heard a ban was on the way, but refused to elaborate.Across the north of England, stories abound of an anonymous scruffy pubgoer suddenly revealing his true identity – then sacking bar staff on the spot for overfilling pint glasses or giving incorrect change.         When a reporter tried to use a tablet at the New Inn in Stamford Bridge, North Yorkshire, a member of staff told him: ‘You can’t do work on your electronic devices in here because Mr Smith doesn’t like it.’ A member of bar staff pours a pint in the Anchor Tap in Southwark, LondonAccording to a TripAdvisor reviewer, Mr Smith ‘lost the plot’ at one of his Edinburgh pubs after discovering it was selling mince pies even though they weren’t on the menu. Mr Smith’s determination to uphold behaviour that would have been acceptable to the original Samuel Smith when he founded the brewery in 1758 was dramatically illustrated two years ago when staff were told not to serve punters who swear.But the question of what exactly is banned does not appear to be consistent across the estate. Mr Smith has reputedly barred motorcyclists from drinking in the Royal Oak, in Ulley, near Rotherham, claiming they were ‘undesirable’.However, not everyone opposes the old-fashioned atmosphere in his pubs. One regular at the New Inn said: ‘I like the old style of the place. You can read the paper and have a natter for entertainment. Who wants music or the TV blaring out?’ Locals at the Victoria Hotel were also largely content to put up with his approach to hospitality. ‘You can get a pint of mild in here for £1.34 and a pint of bitter for a few pence over £2,’ said one.‘How many places offer you that? Plus there are no jukeboxes, no televisions and no one-armed bandits so everyone talks to each other. It’s the way pubs were meant to be.’Calls to Samuel Smith’s Old Brewery in Tadcaster, North Yorkshire – from which barrels of beer are delivered in horse-drawn carts, and email is apparently regarded as a modern aberration – were firmly rebuffed this week.Calls to Mr Smith’s office were yesterday put through to a senior employee who said there would be no comment from the brewery."},{"url":null,"title":"Lionel Richie says hes far retirement ahead 70th birthday celebration","story":"Share this article          Richie was accompanied by much younger girlfriend Lisa Parigi at the gala as he was honored for his charitable contributions and then performed his biggest hitsHe performed three of his biggest hits All Night Long, Hello and Dancing On The Ceiling to a packed house at the MGM Grand Garden Arena.Before that stars like Snoop Dogg, NE-YO,, Miguel, Leona Lewis, Bernie Williams and Pedro Capó performed some of his iconic hits.Close friend Shania Twain got emotional as she presented Richie with the award, she said: \u0027He\u0027s my buddy, my pal, he\u0027s a lifesaver and a really wonderful friend.

In the men\u0027s pole vault, nine men are listed as competing in that age group.Meiler said the events she likes the best are the hurdles and the pole vault - one of the more daring track and field events, in which competitors run while carrying a fiberglass or composite pole, brace it against the ground to launch themselves over a high bar, and land on a mat.\u0027You really have to work at that,\u0027 she said. \u0027You have to have the upper core and you have to have timing, and I just love it because it\u0027s challenging.\u0027She revealed to the BBC that saw a lady doing the sport and thought \u0027I can do that\u0027, even setting the bar higher. Mrs Meiler admitted she never thought she would be a pole vaulter. \u0027Not in my wildest dreams!\u0027 she said.  She is used to hard work having grown up on a dairy farm, where she helped her father with the painstaking labour, feeding the cattle and raking hay.          The petite, energetic woman from Shelburne, Vermont has won a staggering 750 medals         Mrs Meiler also competes in the long jump, 60-meter hurdles, 800-meter run and pentathlonIn school, she excelled at basketball, took tap and ballroom dancing, and, living near Lake Champlain, she water skied.Meiler, who worked for 30 years as a sales representative for Herbalife nutritional supplements, and her husband, Eugene, who was a military pilot and then became a financial analyst, together competed in water skiing.\u0027Many times when I did water ski competition I was the only gal in my age group,\u0027 she said.She\u0027s a relative newcomer to pole vaulting and track and field, overall. At age 60, she was competing in doubles tennis with her husband in a qualifying year at the Vermont Senior Games when a friend encouraged her to try the long jump because competitors were needed.\u0027That was the beginning of my track career,\u0027 she said, standing in a room of her home, surrounded by hundreds of hanging medals. She took up pole vaulting at 65.Athletics has helped her though some hard times, she said. She and her husband adopted three children after losing two premature biological babies and a 3-year-old. Two years ago, their son died at age 51.         Mrs Meiler admitted she never thought she\u0027d be a pole vaulter. \u0027Not in my wildest dreams!\u0027 she said         Meiler turns 85 in June, when she\u0027ll head to the National Senior Games in New MexicoAnd she desperately misses her training partner, a woman who started having health problems about five years ago and can no longer train. It\u0027s tough to train alone, she said, and she hopes to find a new partner.\u0027She\u0027s incredibly serious about what she does,\u0027 said Meiler\u0027s coach, Emmaline Berg. \u0027She comes in early to make sure she\u0027s warmed up enough. She goes home and stretches a lot. So she pretty much structures her entire life around being a fantastic athlete, which is remarkable at any age, let alone hers.\u0027And it has paid off, said Berg, an assistant track coach at Vermont.Berg herself first started following Meiler 10 years ago while she was a student at New Hampshire\u0027s Dartmouth College, watching her at the annual Dartmouth Relays.\u0027She was like a local celebrity,\u0027 she said.Setting a record at age 80 with a 6-foot (1.8-meter) pole vault at the USA Track and Field Adirondack Championships in Albany, New York, while her husband watched, Meiler said, was one of her happiest days.\u0027I was screaming, I was so happy,\u0027 she said.The overall world record for women\u0027s pole vaulting is 16.6 feet (5.6 meters), according to the International Association of Athletics Federations.Meiler turns 85 in June, when she\u0027ll head to the National Senior Games in New Mexico. That will put her in a new age group, in which she hopes to set even more records.Meiler\u0027s athletic achievements are remarkable and something to be celebrated, said Dr. Michael LaMantia, director of the University of Vermont Center on Aging.Pole vaulting clearly isn\u0027t for everyone of her age, but in general, activity should be, LaMantia said.\u0027She can serve as a role model for other seniors,\u0027 he said."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/03/21/19/7572810-6833739-Transport_Secretary_Chris_Grayling_had_mooted_the_Government_lea-a-20_1553198139940.jpg","title":"Botswana baby buffalo comes seconds eaten lion","story":"Share this article          This snap shows the mother butting the smaller lioness with its horns as another buffalo joins her for the attack          Mr Cranke said: \u0027An elderly 18-year-old lioness lead the hunt but failed to catch the young calf and got butted by an older buffalo.

This year, she won gold at Simple Session, a women’s contest in Estonia. The course had been designed for men twice her size.         Skateboard GB chair Lucy Adams describes her as ‘absolutely phenomenal’, pointing out that she can pull off moves such as a 720, which involves two full mid-air rotations. ‘There are only a handful of girls in the world doing that\u0027Today’s venue — a skate park in Salford, Greater Manchester — is pretty much Sky’s UK ‘home’. She certainly seems at ease here.One minute we are standing together at the edge of an 8ft drop, talking about her favourite pop stars, the next she has tipped her board off the side and disappeared. No helmet. No knee pads. Argh!‘This is the thing we have most arguments about,’ says her dad. ‘She hates the pads, so we don’t make her wear them for bowls this size — but we do for bigger ones, and when she’s on concrete. We’ve said that if she breaks a bone, we may reconsider.’Off she goes, arms out, body bending, sun-bleached hair billowing behind. She swooshes up the other side of the bowl, coming right over the edge, and flips her body upside down. Afterwards, she’s grinning ear to ear.What does it feel like? ‘Like I’m flying,’ she says. ‘The minute I stop, I want to do it again, but higher.’         Her father Stu claims to be a social media novice, and was astonished when the first YouTube video he posted of Sky in action got tens of thousands of hits. Another followed. And anotherDo skateboarding prodigies exist? Well, Sky did develop the skills early. Perhaps some of it was in the genes.Before she was born, her father was a passionate and committed surfer. He admits that when his Japanese wife Meiko gave birth to Sky, he thought those days were over.‘My attitude to risk changed when I became a dad,’ he says. ‘It seems weird now, given how things have turned out, but when I knew I was having a girl, I thought she’d want to do things with her mum. I never imagined she would be into the same things as I was.‘She’s taught me a lot about gender equality — about everything.’ He had a tiny tornado on his hands. When he tried to wrap her in cotton wool, she broke through.‘She was fearless. She’d say: “Higher, Daddy, again.” Sky could surf pretty much before she could walk. She still surfs every morning.’The fact that their house is on the beach helps. ‘School starts at 7.30am so I have to get up at 5,’ Sky says. ‘Ocean and I run down the beach. When Dad tells us it’s time to get ready for school, we say: “Just one more wave!” ’They surf on their own? Stu nods. ‘They know what they’re doing. It’s natural for them.’There are shared skills between surfing and skateboarding, and they’ll both be making their Olympic debuts at the Tokyo games. And guess what? Sky hopes to qualify for the GB surfing team, too. ‘Two medals would be good,’ she admits. ‘I’d like to win, yes, but even if I don’t, it doesn’t matter. I just do it because it’s fun.’ Is she ever afraid? ‘Yes, but I want to beat it,’ she says. ‘And if you fall, you just get up again.’And it’s not just sport. She will try anything, especially if there is a competition involved. ‘She and her brother will see who can eat the spiciest chilli,’ says Stu.What’s the most adventurous thing she has eaten? ‘Tarantula,’ Sky says. ‘We were in Cambodia and they have restaurants that serve crickets and all sorts of insects — and tarantula. Someone said: “Would you like to try it?” and I said: “Why not?” ’Stu claims to be a social media novice, and was astonished when the first YouTube video he posted of Sky in action got tens of thousands of hits. Another followed. And another.The family were asked to get involved with skateboarding charities. Sky developed a taste for mentoring, it seems, and was happy to try her hand at being a feminist icon, too.‘Why should the boys have all the fun? I’ve been to Cambodia to teach children who have never skateboarded before. It was amazing. I said to the girls: “Just try it. You can do it.” ’ When she first pitched up at contests, she admits the men raised their eyebrows. ‘Then they started crowding round to watch and I was like: “Yeeeeesss!” I want to show them that girls can do anything boys can do.’In the space of just a few short years she has amassed an extraordinary fan base. She was seven when she got her first sponsorship deal, but the big sporting juggernauts have started to take note. She recently signed a deal with Nike, which meant her image was emblazoned on posters all over the U.S.All the attention has thrilled and alarmed her parents in equal measure.‘We are nervous about putting too much pressure on her, and it becoming more than just fun for her,’ admits Stu. He isn’t specific about how much money she has made, but it sounds as if her parents are determined that she is sensible about it.‘She self-funds a lot of the charity projects, so she will put money into that, with flights for instance,’ Stu adds. ‘And her merchandising goes 100 per cent to charity. After that, well, money has been put away so that it will help her in the future.’They certainly don’t seem to be limelight seekers. Stu declines to be in our photographs, ‘because this isn’t about me’.Nor is his wife mad keen on the attention. ‘We live in a small village in Japan, and we want to keep it low-key.’That may prove tricky. Last year, Sky won the junior version of the U.S. programme Dancing With The Stars, despite the fact she’d never had a dance class in her life.Stu says that the family were reeling when Sky got the offer, yet Sky insisted she wanted to do it. Why? ‘Because it sounded fun,’ she says.She couldn’t dance but threw herself into training, adapting her somersaults to moves she could do in a sequinned ballgown.While her mum and dad had moved to California for the filming of the show, they hesitated over allowing her to be too much of a media darling. Offers to appear on big chat shows such as Ellen were politely declined.And Sky’s parents were nervous when the idea of her aiming for the Olympics was mooted.‘I didn’t think it was a good idea, because I didn’t want to put too much pressure on her, but Sky said she wanted to do it,’ says Stu.The family set-up is quite unique, but, as a blueprint for creating a future Olympian, it has its merits.The Brown family have a Californian beach vibe going on, but also a rigid Japanese work ethic. ‘Her school is quite strict. They don’t mind her being off if we have to be travelling, but she has to do her homework. That idea of hard work is important.’Sky’s first language is Japanese, but she is also fluent in English, helped by her time in the U.S. She’s very much a global citizen, though. She’s travelled all over the world on sporting and charitable adventures. She has released her own skateboard, with proceeds going to charity, and has so far raised £13,000.Some of her mentoring has happened closer to home. Little Ocean is his sister’s double. They are inseparable and share everything, even a bed.‘He’s my bestie,’ she says, as he joins her on his skateboard, trying to match her every leap.When he takes a tumble — doubtless acquiring another bruise — she pulls him up.‘Let’s go again,’ she says, and they do. Sky Brown (@skybrown) • Instagram photos and videos"},{"url":null,"title":"Tories plan rival MP candidate against Speaker John Bercow election","story":"Share this article If the Tories stand against him – the party has comfortably held the seat since 1970 – they would almost certainly capture the constituency. This means if there is a snap general election as a result of the Brexit impasse, Mr Bercow could be out of a job much sooner than he expected.One senior Tory said: ‘As soon as it’s practicable we are going to hit him with everything we have got in our armoury. I know we are breaking with precedent but that is exactly what Bercow does when it suits him, and he hides behind precedent when it doesn’t suit him.’It is not only the Tories who have turned against Mr Bercow. There are two petitions circulating in his constituency, urging him to name a date to go. One – the ‘Give us a voice – not a Speaker’ petition – has 6,750 signatures.         To challenge a sitting Speaker would break with centuries of tradition, but they have given their blessing to the Conservative association in Buckingham, where Mr Bercow is the MP, to advertise for a new candidate. The decision was taken long before Mr Bercow dramatically announced he was blocking a vote on Theresa May’s Brexit deal       When he became Speaker in 2009, he promised that in line with his predecessors he would serve for nine years. This meant he should have resigned last June but grandly announced he would be staying on to ‘see Brexit through’.The decision to stand against Mr Bercow, described by one senior minister last night as ‘the nuclear option’, was taken long before he dramatically announced he was blocking a vote on Theresa May’s Brexit deal.In his local association, there is mounting frustration that he has refused to give any indication of when he intends to quit, despite endless requests.A senior Conservative source said: ‘The voices of more than 75,000 voters in the Buckingham constituency have not been heard in Parliament since 2009. \u0027Bercow is high-handed and arrogant in the Commons chamber.

Mr Smith has reputedly barred motorcyclists from drinking in the Royal Oak, in Ulley, near Rotherham, claiming they were ‘undesirable’.However, not everyone opposes the old-fashioned atmosphere in his pubs. One regular at the New Inn said: ‘I like the old style of the place. You can read the paper and have a natter for entertainment. Who wants music or the TV blaring out?’ Locals at the Victoria Hotel were also largely content to put up with his approach to hospitality. ‘You can get a pint of mild in here for £1.34 and a pint of bitter for a few pence over £2,’ said one.‘How many places offer you that? Plus there are no jukeboxes, no televisions and no one-armed bandits so everyone talks to each other. It’s the way pubs were meant to be.’Calls to Samuel Smith’s Old Brewery in Tadcaster, North Yorkshire – from which barrels of beer are delivered in horse-drawn carts, and email is apparently regarded as a modern aberration – were firmly rebuffed this week.Calls to Mr Smith’s office were yesterday put through to a senior employee who said there would be no comment from the brewery."},{"url":null,"title":"Little litter heroes lead way Britains biggest Spring Clean","story":"Share this article Waving a litter-picker, she said: ‘I found a hat!

James spends pretty much every waking hour with the koalas, tending them and chatting to them. Even on a rare day off he pops by to photograph them and check everything’s OK.‘It goes beyond love! I would do anything for them,’ he says. Which is a good thing, because koalas need a lot of love.         In the wild in Australia, the koalas are threatened by urbanisation, dingoes, bush fires, drought and heatstrokeDespite never knowingly taxing themselves (in the wild a koala can live its entire life never moving from one eucalyptus tree), they’re prone to illnesses, including a kidney disorder and a virus that affects their immune system. A study has also revealed that 47 per cent suffer from koala chlamydia, which is often inherited.In the wild in their native Australia, they’re also threatened by urbanisation, dingoes, bush fires, drought and heatstroke.But despite all these problems, their appalling eyesight and teeny brains, koalas have been around for more than 25 million years.         Enclosure keeper James Dennis checks Violet\u0027s weightThere are two species — the Northern Koala, smaller with finer fur and endangered and the bigger Southern Koala whose numbers have recovered after being hunted almost to extinction in the Sixties.Both live up to about 15 years in captivity (compared with ten or so in the wild), nurse new-born ‘joeys’ in their pouches for the first six months and are such solitary animals that there’s no collective noun for them. Until this lot came to Longleat last year, there were just three Southern Koalas outside Australia — in Hong Kong and Japan.The journey was two years in the planning, in which government licences had to be obtained and meetings held with Viscount Weymouth (patron of the International Koala Centre of Excellence, which protects koalas in the wild).Longleat’s facilities were inspected twice by officials from Cleland Wildlife Park to ensure they could cope with the koalas’ demands. ‘Very few places can take Southern Koalas,’ says Cleland director Professor Chris Daniels.‘You have to be at the top of your game in animal husbandry. Koalas are incredibly difficult to move because they get easily stressed. And if they become stressed, they stop eating and with that goes their water intake.’It took two full-time staff a year to prepare eight animals for the 47-hour journey. They trained the koalas to move in and out of travelling crates.They simulated the plane’s movement by driving them around in crates in the back of pick-up trucks. Not knowing which type of aircraft they’d be travelling in, they even played recordings of all sorts of aircraft engines, so the koalas wouldn’t panic.         It took two full-time staff a year to train eight koalas to move and out of travelling crates in preparation for the 47-hour journey from Australia‘Koalas have incredibly sensitive hearing, so they would know the difference between one plane and the next,’ says Chris.Eventually, five koalas travelled by cargo jet, accompanied by a veterinary team and three keepers who chatted all the way to keep the animals calm.Not that they needed to — the koalas ate and slept all the way here. On arrival on UK soil, a fleet of Land-Rovers drove them to Longleat to start their new life.Five months on, they look happy and ready to meet human visitors when Koala Creek opens next week.         When the bears arrived on UK soil, a fleet of Land-Rovers drove them to Longleat. Five months later, they look happy and ready to meet human visitors when Koala Creek opens next weekTo me, they all look pretty much the same, sitting in trees on thick, furry, padded bottoms adapted for a life of sloth. But to keeper James, they couldn’t be more different.He identifies them by the unique pink and black patterns inside their enormous nostrils and by their different personalities and peccadilloes.Maizie, he says, is the cuddly one, Dennis is a bolshy teenager full of hormones, Violet is the ‘free spirit’ and Coorong is ‘stubborn’.         Keeper Alessandra Topazio weighs one of the koalas. Longleat staff have to monitor every aspect of the Koalas daily life. The south Australian Koalas are choosing the specific type and even the location of the eucalyptus trees used to provide their daily dietAnd then there was Wilpena.‘She was our best eater, our largest koala,’ says James, suddenly sad. But after six weeks at Longleat she had lost a kilogram (a sixth of her bodyweight) in just seven days. Despite 24-hour care, she suffered a kidney disorder.‘Everyone was here for her final moments,’ says James. ‘We all cried.’It was just awful bad luck.Today, ahead of opening to the public, the keepers are planning koala birthday celebrations (involving eucalyptus treats, naturally) and, hopefully, the pitter-patter of a teeny joey.Because, aged two, Dennis is nearing breeding age and the females know it. They’ve been bellowing at him and flipping their furry ears to get his attention. In return, he’s been flaring his nostrils and looking moderately interested.If he’s a bit reticent, it’s understandable. As Professor Chris Daniels says: ‘Koala love-making is a challenging business — a fairly aggressive activity, and the boy needs to be big and strong if he’s going to get his way . . .’All of which, of course, involves far more effort than this very lazy animal is used to."},{"url":null,"title":"New book tells little known maverick helped save rare cherry trees extinction","story":"Share this article For some Japanese cherry aficionados, it was disgraceful even to think about receiving a cherry tree from an Englishman. And especially so given that, under Emperor Hirohito, the nation’s emblematic flower had come to symbolise more than ever the Japanese fighting spirit and willingness to die in the imperial cause.When war came and reached its desperate conclusion for the Japanese, pink cherry blossoms on white backgrounds were painted onto the fuselage of many kamikaze planes.By then, a sign next to a cherry tree flourishing at the Hirano Shrine in Kyoto had already been removed because it mentioned Ingram’s involvement in the tree’s return to Japan. And his son’s wife, Daphne, had witnessed first hand the brutality with which that country’s forces treated their enemies.A military nurse who was caught up in the Japanese invasion of Hong Kong in December 1941, she had a close friend who was gang-raped by soldiers of the Imperial Japanese Army. She herself was interned for three years in a camp where malnutrition was the norm and diseases such as diphtheria and beri beri were epidemic.During her time there, 121 people died, including seven executed for possessing a radio, and Daphne came to detest the country which had raised men capable of such barbarity.After the war, she and her father-in-law had a close bond and he gave her many flowers from his garden, but she never asked for any cuttings from his Japanese cherries. By silent agreement, they refused to discuss anything to do with Japan.And while he never expressed his thoughts about the country which had taken away her freedom for more than three years, his love of its national flower seemed to dim following the publication of his Ornamental Cherries book.Later in life, he resumed his interest in the study of birds but, in 1980, to mark his 100th birthday and recognise his contributions to horticulture, a botanist from Kew Gardens made a list of the trees and plants in his garden, mapping the places in which each grew.Across Britain, the cherries he had loved and saved from extinction were alive and well. At The Grange, those that survived included many of his favourites and, in the spring of 1981, which was to be his last, the bright-pink Hokusai, the tree which had ignited his interest in cherries so many years previously, was among the first to bloom. It was followed by Taihaku, the flower he had returned to its homeland.Concluding the seasonal symphony that May, a late-blooming variety Imose took its turn in the limelight. Soon, its petals began falling silently in the wind outside Ingram’s room. As they did so, the life of the man who had nurtured this and so many other blossoms came to its own peaceful end.Adapted by David Leafe from ‘Cherry’ Ingram: The Englishman Who Saved Japan’s Blossoms by Naoko Abe. Published by Chatto \u0026amp Windus at £18.99. ©Naoke Abe 2019. To buy a copy for £15.19 (20 per cent discount), go to www.mailshop.co.ukbooks or call 0844 571 0640, p\u0026ampp free on orders over £15.

Photograph: Ludovic MarinAFPGetty ImagesEverything revolves around the leaders. The 28 heads of government who comprise the European Union’s highest decision-making body, the European Council, have traffic stopped, streets closed, doors opened and ways cleared for them.They are whizzed in at high speed from the airport by an armada of motorcycle outriders and police cars, lights flashing, sirens wailing. Their cavalcades deposit them at the vast glass-and-steel palaces that house the EU’s headquarters, where they are ushered through specially constructed VIP entrances, along lush red carpets, past the flags, past the press – perhaps stopping for a few words with a forest of journalists’ microphones – to the secure areas where only those with the highest security and diplomatic passes can venture.The leaders themselves wear no passes nobody asks them for their badges. They enter the summit chamber alone their aides are not permitted. And then the leaders of Europe deliberate and decide.Except, on most things, they don’t, really. The decisions – the council’s conclusions – are largely agreed in advance by diplomats and officials in an intensive series of meetings that precedes each summit. The leaders may tweak them before signing off. But any changes are normally minimal.This summit, though, was different. Because of the uncertainty surrounding the British position – and with Brexit Day looming just a week away – it was not possible to pre-cook the summit conclusions in the normal fashion. Instead, the leaders would hear from Mrs May, question her, and then decide on a way forward.Privately, the prospect filled some senior officials with alarm – politicians drafting! – and there were only-half-joking predictions that the session would last until\u0026nbspthe early hours.“What is she going to tell them?” everyone inquired of the small army of British journalists. God knows, came the typical response. But whatever it is, they might not believe it. Having twice told EU leaders she could pass the withdrawal treaty through the House of Commons and twice failed, May’s credibility with her fellow leaders is not high, to put it mildly.‘Sense of crisis’Before the summit, there were meetings of the European Parliament groups at locations around the European capital. Leo Varadkar was at the EPP, where the business of the day was drumming out Viktor Orban, the authoritarian prime minister whose anti-immigrant, anti-EU and xenophobic rhetoric , curbs on press and academic freedom alarm his Christian Democrat allies. Especially in an election year.Emerging from the meeting, Varadkar reprised his “cut the British some slack” line. But he also warned that the British could not keep putting decisions off. And if the UK remained in the EU while the European Parliament elections were held, it would have to take part. This theme – we will try to help the British, but uphold EU conventions and institutions – would re-emerge later.Micheál Martin was in town too, meeting with the alliance of liberals to which Fianna Fail belongs. “A real sense of crisis,” was his summary of the mood. So far, though, events were progressing as he had expected. As Noel Grealish, the Independent TD from Galway had told him (he related to journalists): “Every single thing you said has come to pass, ie, there would be a deal, the deal may not get through the British parliament, it hasn’t, hasn’t got through the parliament the second time.”“We’re up to the wire,” Martin summarised.So given his stellar record of predictions so far, what is going to happen to Brexit next week?“I think it’s going to be very difficult for Theresa May to get it through but I wouldn’t rule it out ...\u0026nbspYou can’t predict with any great certainty on that one,” he says.OptimismBack in the headquarters of the council, the pace was picking up. May was holding a series of bilateral meetings, including with French president Emmanuel Macron and with Varadkar and Helen McEntee, the increasingly visible Minister of State for European Affairs.The leaders proceeded in past the banks of cameras and shouted questions from the journalists. Lithuanian president Dalia Grybauskaite proclaimed herself “still optimistic”. It did not appear to be a widely held view.Back in the common parts of the Lipsius building, Nigel Farage was peacocking about no summit would be complete without him decrying it from within. But in truth, even the British have less and less interest in him these days.Sinn Féin MEP Martina Anderson also buzzed around, distributing copies of the party’s answer to the Brexit crisis – a glossy pamphlet entitled Irish Unity – the Solution. Many unionists are changing their minds, she says. You can see a few problems with that one, all the same.At about 3.30, the doors to the council chamber closed and Mrs May began her address to her fellow leaders, requesting the ratification of the Strasbourg clarifications and undertakings and the extension until June 30th. When she concluded, Mrs May was questioned for 90 minutes it was neither comfortable nor satisfactory, many of the leaders thought.According to several accounts – including an Irish one – from people briefed on the proceedings, they asked her the same question a dozen different ways: what will you do if you lose the next vote? Her answer remained the same: I believe I can win the next vote.Their frustration was unmistakable. “Not always crystal clear” was one account. “Evasive and tightlipped” was another. Other summaries were considerable more brutal and profane. “It was f***ing awful,” said one report. “Dreadful.”And then\u0026nbspMay was out the council changed to “article 50 format”, or everyone except the British. For the next five hours or so, May remained outside while the other 27 leaders discussed what should be done about the chaotic British efforts to leave the bloc. Schedules came and went the dinner was sent in (langoustine terrine, duck a l’orange, chocolate variations) and consumed. The leaders huddled together, discussing and drafting. Macron was bullish, dismissive of May, saying they must prepare for a crash-out exit now. Merkel, still the most important person in the room, was “searching for a solution”, said one person briefed on the proceedings. Outside, officials worried. Mrs May waited. And waited.Two-step deadlineThe solution, when it arrived was neat – a two-step deadline for the UK. If\u0026nbspMay can win a vote on the withdrawal agreement next week, the UK would be able to remain in the EU until May 22nd. But if MPs fail to back the deal next week, the prime minister could seek to negotiate an extension to the April 12th deadline – but only if she agreed to hold European Parliament elections on May 23rd.It postpones the cliff edge of next week. It preserves the EU’s rules. And it gives MPs an opportunity, if May cannot get the deal through, to direct her to a different Brexit.Said the Danish prime minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen: “We left them with the opportunity to rethink the whole thing.”At a late-night press conference, council president Donald Tusk and commission president Jean-Claude Juncker were tired but upbeat. “Now I am much more optimistic,” said Juncker.Asked about his famous musings about a special place in hell for Brexiteers, Tusk joked: “According to our pope, hell is still empty. It means that’s a lot of spaces.” His spokesman swiftly brought the proceedings to an end. Afterwards, with midnight come and gone, journalists crowded around Juncker’s spokesman, Maragritas Schinas. “March 29th is over,” he summarised. “April 12th is the new 29th.”The following morning’s British press headlines were brutal for May, who headed back to London “to start her work”, said Luxembourg prime minister Xavier Bettel.Perhaps the most upbeat take was from one columnist in the Daily . The headline read: “We’ve had worse humiliations than this”.Reset, the clock began to tick once more.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: Getty ImagesPlans on how to deal with the Irish Border issue in the event of a no-deal Brexit are to be discussed urgently between the European Commission and Irish Government officials. This comes after EU leaders at Friday’s European summit raised the need to protect the single market if the UK crashes out of the union without a deal. Several senior EU and Irish sources said there was a desire that the issue be prioritised immediately.Senior Irish Government sources acknowledged preparations now needed to be intensified, but stressed EU leaders were also committed to keeping an open border in Ireland and protecting the Belfast Agreement. The issue will be the subject of intense discussions over the next three weeks as EU leaders increasingly fear the prospects of a no-deal Brexit are rising, having made clear in private discussions that they have little faith in British prime minister Theresa May’s ability to secure the votes she needs in the Commons.In a letter to MPs that emerged on Friday night, Mrs May hinted she might not bring her withdrawal deal back to parliament for a third time if there was not enough support for it to be passed.“If it appears there is not sufficient support to bring the deal back next week, or the house rejects it again, we can ask for another extension before April 12th – but that will involve holding European Parliament elections,” she wrote. Private discussionsThree people briefed on the private discussions of EU leaders at the Brussels summit agreed there was “little optimism” that the UK could avoid a no-deal, and that preparations for that outcome would now accelerate, especially in the member states most closely affected.German chancellor Angela Merkel raised the issue of the Irish Border during discussions on Thursday night, noting the difficulties of protecting the Belfast Agreement in a no-deal situation, said sources familiar with the notes of the meeting.Asked about the issue on Friday, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said Ireland would seek to “uphold the Good Friday Agreement, keep the border with Northern Ireland open and still fulfil our obligations in European treaties to protect the single market and make sure Ireland is still fully a member of the single market and that the Border doesn’t become a backdoor to the single market”.Mr Varadkar was speaking at the conclusion of the two-day summit. Meanwhile, Tánaiste Simon Coveney, speaking at the Fine Gael conference in Wexford, said there would need to be regulatory alignment between Northern Ireland and the Republic to keep the Border open even if there was no Brexit deal. Regulatory alignment“Whether there is a deal or no-deal, the way we will resolve these issues will involve some form of regulatory alignment. Even in the British paper which was published, which we didn’t have any input into, they’re effectively talking about the all-island economy not being interrupted by any form of checks. I think the UK government and the Irish Government and the EU Commission have thought about this issue as to how they would respond to it. “But we haven’t had any interaction between all three parties because we still advocate for the solution that we know works, which is the backstop, as the fallback position unless we can negotiate a future relationship that is so comprehensive that it doesn’t involve border infrastructure. I think our position has been very, very consistent on that.”Mr Coveney refused to engage with suggestions that an EU task force could be set up to deal with the Border in the event of a no-deal Brexit, while Mr Varadkar said: “There’s no task force being set up or anything of that nature.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: Yves HermanFile PhotoReuters“Until April 12th, anything is possible,” European Council president Donald Tusk said of the Brexit process on Friday.Summing up the EU’s summit in Brussels and the breathing-space extension the UK has been given to get a Brexit deal, Mr Tusk said the options still ranged from a deal to a long extension – “if the UK decided to rethink its strategy” – or abandoning Brexit altogether by “revoking article 50”.But pessimism pervaded the meeting. Leader after leader privately expressed their fear that UK prime minister Theresa May would not be able to win a majority for the withdrawal agreement and that a no-deal scenario must be, as lead negotiator Michel Barnier was quoted as saying, their working assumption.Diplomats say they fear that Mrs May, if voted down in the Commons, would indeed prefer no deal to a deal with Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Her next “meaningful vote” is expected on Tuesday.There was a sense of bewilderment at Mrs May’s repeated inability or unwillingness in response to their questions on Thursday night to set out her plans should she lose the meaningful vote.All she would say is that she intended to win, and yet she was here looking for their support.Needing a ‘miracle’Latvian prime minister Krisjanis Karins asked her why she remained “so optimistic”, while the Luxembourg prime minister, Xavier Bettel, said only a “miracle” would allow her to succeed.French president Emmanuel Macron warned that what they faced was a systemic crisis of British politics: “The EU today had to face up very clearly to a crisis of the British political system. British politicians are today incapable of putting into practice what their people have asked of them.”Thursday night’s deal moves the departure cliff edge from next Friday night until April 12th, and beyond to May 22nd should Mrs May win her vote next week.Unusually, it was drafted by the leaders themselves, meeting late into the night. Officials said the process was extremely political and so necessitated high-level input from the leaders, who appear to have been particularly concerned to demonstrate that, if a no-deal happens, the EU cannot be blamed.China demotedBrexit was inevitably a leitmotif in all the discussions, even pushing aside the important debate on China-EU relations.A lengthy discussion on preparing for an EU-China summit in April was curtailed but officials were keen to emphasise its importance strategically.As leaders joined their counterparts from Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein on Friday morning to mark 25 years of the European Economic Area – the free-trade zone that links them to the EU – Donald Tusk spoke pointedly about “the spirit of neighbourly co-operation”.No one could really doubt what he was suggesting: “Today, within the EEA, more than 500 million people are free to move and travel, to do business and invest with ease, to receive an education, conduct cutting-edge research abroad, while enjoying the safest consumer protections, the highest standards at work and the cleanest environment.“We have accomplished this through shared pragmatism, and in a spirit of neighbourly co-operation.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: Jasper JuinenBloombergThe UK’s negotiating position was already weak when Theresa May walked into the council chamber at the Europa building in Brussels on Thursday. But she had one card left to play: the threat of a no-deal Brexit next Friday, with all the disruption that would cause to the UK’s neighbours as well as itself. By the end of the night, that was gone too.“All they had left was the date. Now we’ve taken that away from them,” a senior EU source said.May’s presentation to the EU leaders and the question-and-answer session that followed persuaded them she had no chance of winning a majority for her deal at Westminster next week. So instead of coming back to Brussels next Thursday to decide whether to push the UK out of the EU 24 hours later, they drew up their own timetable for Brexit.If May’s deal fails next week, the UK will leave the EU on April 12th unless it agrees to hold European Parliament elections and seeks a longer extension to hold a general election or a second referendum. The extra two weeks are designed to give MPs time to come up with an alternative to May’s deal that will command a majority, probably by changing or removing her negotiating red lines.Already, Jeremy Corbyn has tabled an amendment for Monday to set aside parliamentary time next week for MPs to debate alternatives to the prime minister’s deal. A cross-party group of MPs including Conservative Oliver Letwin and Labour’s Yvette Cooper wants indicative votes on competing options. And business secretary Greg Clark suggested on Friday that the government would offer a free vote on indicative votes if the prime minister’s deal is rejected a third time next week.The picture was further muddied on Friday night when it emerged that May had written to MPs suggesting she might not bring her withdrawal deal back to parliament for a third time if there is not enough support for it to be passed.Unsuitable MayIf Westminster must pursue new ideas for Brexit, May is singularly unsuitable to lead MPs in a new direction and her future as prime minister is in doubt this weekend. Her disastrous televised statement on Wednesday, when she blamed MPs for having to postpone Brexit, was the last straw for many ministers and backbenchers alike.She had already alienated chief whip Julian Smith by giving the nod to cabinet ministers that they could break a three-line whip by abstaining on a government motion. She cannot face another confidence vote in her leadership until next December, but there is a growing view at Westminster that if her Brexit deal is rejected next week, she will have to go.The EU’s timetable does not allow enough time for a Conservative leadership contest, so May would have to hand over to a caretaker leader, preferably someone without leadership ambitions such as her de-facto deputy David Lidington. But the factionalism within the party may be too poisonous for any caretaker leader to gain the confidence of Conservative MPs.One of the reasons behind the continuing deadlock surrounding Brexit at Westminster is that the competing factions each believes that their preferred outcome can still prevail, making them unwilling to compromise by backing the next least bad option. Hard-line Brexiteers are confident the UK can leave the EU without a deal and the EU’s new deadline of April 12th will encourage them.Corbyn proposalsCorbyn thinks his proposal for a customs union and close alignment with the single market could form the basis for a deal that could win a majority. And those who favour Common Market 2.0, remaining in both the customs union and the single market, believe their plan can secure cross-party majority support.But advocates for a second referendum, including the SNP, the Liberal Democrats, the Independent Group, many Labour MPs and a few Conservatives, still believe they can reverse Brexit. They will be emboldened by what is expected to be a huge demonstration in London on Saturday calling for a second vote and by the three million people who have signed a petition demanding that Brexit should be cancelled by revoking article 50.The EU leaders have said that, if by April 12th the UK has not agreed to hold European Parliament elections, it must leave the EU that day. But if there appeared to be some progress at Westminster towards finding an alternative to May’s deal, would the EU really bundle Britain out the door right away?Senior EU officials say there would be no question of offering a further extension to May 22nd, just before the European elections. But a short extension of two or three weeks would mean that, with Mrs May’s deal dead and no prospect of remaining in the EU for long enough to hold a second referendum, MPs would face a straight choice between a soft Brexit and no deal.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: Yui MokPA WireDemonstrators have arrived in central London on Saturday to join a march on the UK Parliament to demand a second Brexit referendum.Hundreds of thousands of people were expected to pour into the capital on Saturday to take part in the Put it to the People march.The day’s activities were kicked off by the unfurling of a large banner on Westminster Bridge that read “Love socialism, hate Brexit”.The stunt was organised by a group calling itself the “Left Bloc” which is supported by Labour MPs, including Clive Lewis and Kate Osamor, Green Party MP Caroline Lucas, trade unions and grassroots campaigners.Saturday’s march will see protesters process from Park Lane to Parliament Square at noon, where a rally will be held.As many as a million people could flood the streets of London after estimates for a similar rally in October were as high as 700,000.In Parliament Square, Labour’s deputy leader Tom Watson is expected to tell marchers that the only way to resolve the Brexit impasse is “for people themselves to sign it off”.Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, former deputy prime minister Lord Heseltine and London mayor Sadiq Khan are also expected to take the stage.Other speakers will include former Conservative cabinet minister Justine Greening and former attorney general Dominic Grieve, former Tory turned independent MP Anna Soubry, Lib Dem deputy leader Jo Swinson, Green Party MP Caroline Lucas and SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford.Campaigners are arriving to the capital from across the country, with one taking on a 715-mile journey on ferries, trains and buses from Orkney in Scotland. Student Sorcha Kirker (27) will be joined by about 30 other students from the University of the Highlands and Islands.The London march coincides with pro-Brexit campaigners continuing their long hike from the North East to the capital.Former Ukip leader Nigel Farage re-joined the March to Leave when it set off from Linby, near Nottingham, on Saturday morning.Saturday’s demonstrations follow EU leaders agreeing to delay Brexit to give Prime Minister Theresa May a final chance to get her deal through Parliament.Leaders agreed to extend Brexit to May 22nd if Mrs May can get MPs to back her deal in the Commons at the third time of asking.If the vote is not passed, the UK will have to set out an alternative way forward by April 12th, which could mean a much longer delay — with the UK required to hold elections to the European Parliament — or leaving without a deal at all.Mrs May has admitted she may not garner enough support to get her twice-defeated Brexit deal through the Commons next week.The prime minister wrote to MPs warning that if there is insufficient support for her Withdrawal Agreement in the coming days that she could seek an extension to Britain’s EU membership beyond the European Parliament elections.An online petition demanding the Government stops the Brexit process had topped four million signatures by Saturday morning.–PADeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

The storm has killed hundreds of people and affected more than 2.6 million others with catastrophic damage occurring in and around Beira in southern Mozambique. Was Cyclone Idai caused by climate change?It’s impossible to say if the storm itself was caused by climate change but experts believe its impact was made worse by the gradual rise in temperature.How did climate change make it worse?Experts point to three factors.First, warmer air temperatures mean more rain is held and then released. Idai produced nearly a year’s worth of rain in just a few days - more than two feet in parts of the region.Second, the region has been suffering from sustained drought in recent years, itself a problem associated with climate change. The hard, parched earth was unable to absorb water quickly, increasing the risk of flash flooding.Third, rising sea levels mean that storm surges are much more powerful, increasing the risk of the sort of inland flooding seen in the port city of Beira. Sea levels are about a foot higher than a century ago fed by melting ice at the poles.What do the experts say?“Cyclone Idai is a clear demonstration of the exposure and vulnerability of many low-lying cities and towns to sea-level rise as the impact of climate change continues to influence and disrupt normal weather patterns,” said Mami Mizutori, the UN’s Special Representative for Disaster Risk Reduction.What does the future look like for the region?Rebuilding with climate change in mind will be essential. This was not done after the last major cyclone 19 years ago. Roads, housing, utilities should all be built with future storms and flooding in mind.Sounds expensive, can this be done?Ironically, climate change makes future-proofing more difficult as the region’s economy, and therefore its capacity to rebuild, has already been depleted by rising temperatures, drought etc.At the Paris climate summit in 2015, then-prime minister of Mozambique, Carlos Agostinho do Rosario, said: “These weather phenomena affect the government’s efforts to meet national priorities, especially food security, that are critical to poverty reduction.”Secretary General of International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), Elhadj As Sy talks with a survivor of Cyclone Idai, at an evacuation centre in Beira, MozambiqueYes, developed nations, including the UK, are scrambling to send aid and disaster relief teams to the area.The rich nations also pledged in Paris 2015 to ramp up aid to $100 billion per year in restorative climate funding to poorer nations by 2020. This is because industrialisation in the west caused most of the current rise in global temperatures. But so far less than 10 per cent of this funding has been secured.Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security Please review our commenting policy17-year-old boy stabbed to death outside west London flatsComment: The only reason we\u0026#39re in such a mess over Brexit is because of Theresa May - it\u0026#39s time for her to go Prince of Wales \u0026#34completely supportive\u0026#34 of Prince Harry and Meghan during tough first few months of marriageIsil defeated: how the Islamic State’s caliphate tried and failed to change historyEgyptian singer banned after claiming lack of free speechIsil \u0026#39totally eliminated\u0026#39 in Syria: Caliphate destroyed in final strongholdComment: No, of course \u0026#39misgendering\u0026#39 a trans person shouldn\u0026#39t be a crimeIsil\u0026#39s key players: Where are they now?The Caliphate may be defeated but the ideology lives on: Why Isil is still dangerousLove or hate it?

The EU says its initial package to Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Malawi is worth about $3.9 million, while Britain says it will provide up to $7.9 million (£6m).The US Embassy in Zimbabwe says it is mobilizing support for partners in the three countries, with no further details.Tanzania\u0027s military airlifted some 238 tons of emergency food and medicine to the three countries. Zimbabwe\u0027s president has said a number of countries, including the United Arab Emirates, South Africa, Botswana, Namibia and Angola, also were offering aid.Cyclone Idai and climate change | The Key questionsAid organizations and authorities are rushing humanitarian aid to Beira and other areas by air and sea, while rescue efforts push on.The torrential rains are expected to continue in central Mozambique until Thursday. As the water begins to recede throughout the region, the extent of the devastation will become clearer.And thousands, perhaps scores of thousands, of families could be on the move, seeking new refuge after their homes were washed away.

Although at first some found them strange-looking or were convinced they would fall out of their ears, they quickly became the in-ear wireless headphone to aspire to.Rarely in the two years and three months since launch has demand eased off. As a result, the look has gone from curious to acceptable to – dare I say it\u0026nbsp– iconic. And certainly ubiquitous.Now, the second-generation AirPods have been announced, I talked to Greg Joswiak, Apple’s Vice President of Product Marketing and Kate Bergeron, Vice President of Hardware Engineering about the new arrivals.The new AirPods look, at first glance, like the older model, even down to the price, which remains the same at £159. There is no difference in the look or shape of the buds themselves and there is only one visible change to the case: a Wireless Charging Case is now available\u0026nbspfor an extra £40, allowing you to place the case on a compatible wireless charging pad instead of plugging it in with a Lightning cable.This means there’s a tiny LED on the outside of the case to show when it’s charging.\u0026nbspThe new\u0026nbspAirPods\u0026nbspare on sale online now and will be in Apple Stores next week.Created with Sketch.Apple unveils the iPhone X Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone x during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone X during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone X during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone x during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone x during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone x during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, shows Animoji during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, speaks during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone x during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Tim Cook, CEO of Apple, speaks about the iPhone X during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone x during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone X during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone X during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone x during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone x during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone x during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, shows Animoji during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, speaks during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone x during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Tim Cook, CEO of Apple, speaks about the iPhone X during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017So far, so good.“The bigger picture, though, is that AirPods simply deliver a magical wireless experience.”I’m not sure I like using the word magical, but I see what he’s saying. Pairing AirPods with an iPhone is exceptionally simple. As Joswiak explains, “As soon as you’ve pulled the AirPods out of the box and flipped open the lid on the case, there’s a simple one-tap set-up, they’re automatically paired and connected. Once you’ve done that, they’re immediately set up to work with all your Apple devices, including an Apple Watch, iPad or Mac that uses the same Apple ID. Once you’ve used AirPods, you never go back. They’re the most popular wireless headphones in the world. They’ve become a cultural phenomenon. For us, they’re the key ingredient to the wireless future. We designed them to be effortless to use.”Open the case near an iPhone and a screen will pop up showing the exact battery life. And there are other cool features, like the way when you’re talking to someone, and you naturally take one of the AirPods out your ear to do so, the music pauses, resuming when you put the bud back into your ear.All these features remain the same in the new version. By the way, you can use AirPods with Android phones, for instance, but the pairing is not as seamless.Kate Bergeron explains the new headphones in more detail:\u0026nbsp“When we were thinking about generation two, we really wanted to focus on this new H1 chip that was designed specifically for headphones. We’re combining wireless technology which is a hallmark of Apple’s and very highly customised audio. Together, these things create an amazing audio experience. Because the H1 chip is more powerful, it delivers some profound efficiencies, which means you can have Siri available all the time.”Ah, yes, I forgot to say, another AirPods feature is the way you can tap on either of the buds while they are in your ear and then ask Siri, Apple’s virtual personal assistant, to change the track, lift the volume or even give you spoken directions to wherever you’re going.AirPods 2 on Wednesday, 20 March (Apple)Now, with the new AirPods, you don’t need to tap. Just say, “Hey, Siri” and it will respond. This is made possible thanks to the H1 chip saving so much battery life that it can be listening for the magic wake words at all times.“So, we’re able to have \u0027Hey, Siri\u0027 listening enabled at all times and still keep the same battery life as before: five hours’ listening time is still achieved thanks to this new chip,” Bergeron says.“In addition, we’ve been able to deliver 50 per cent more talk time so when you’re on a call, you’ll have three hours of battery life, not two.”Leaving aside whether jabbering on for three hours is really desirable, this is quite a feat. So, how come more talk time but no extra battery life? That’s because when you’re talking, listening out for “Hey, Siri” is turned off.Switching between devices is up to twice as fast, now, too. “If you’re using your AirPods between your Mac, your iPhone and your iPad, switching is even more seamless and the connection to phone calls, when you’re pulling your AirPods out of your pocket to connect to a phone call, is up to 50 per cent faster than before,” Bergeron says. “In addition, for some casual gaming on your iPhone, for instance, we’re able to provide up to 30 per cent lower latency.”My experience of Apple’s stats in situations like this is that the figures don’t mean that much but the experience when you use them is noticeably different.Apple leak reveals bizarre new feature for 2019 iPhoneApple unveils brand new iPads in surprise announcementThe improved chip means improved audio in different ways, too. “The combination of the wireless changes we’ve made in the chip as well as the audio gives a more robust wireless connection, which turns into better audio quality in different conditions. When going outside, some people have found that in that environment there can be problems maintaining RF (radio frequency) links. Now, in all sorts of different conditions we find we’re able to have better audio quality all the time.”The LED on the new wireless charging case is the main visible difference compared to the previous case. “The cases are exactly the same size, there’s a slight increase in weight thanks to adding the wireless charging coil but it’s negligible.”Wireless charging is traditionally slower than through a Lightning cable. “It’s just over two hours to charge the case from zero to 100 per cent via Lightning,” Joswiak chips in, “and around three-and-a-half hours wirelessly. But realistically, customers rarely charge from zero, and the fast charge is the same as before – just put the AirPods themselves into the charging case for 15 minutes and you get three hours of listening time.”Apple is expected to release a new version of iOS, the operating software for iPhones and iPads, soon. I wonder if the new hands-free Siri feature will have to wait for that, but Joswiak’s reply is elegant rather than factually revealing: “We always recommend that for every new product that customers install the latest version of software that’s available at that time.”Reading the runes, I would imagine it means that by the time the new AirPods reach customers next week, that enhanced software will be available to make hands-free Siri work.The new AirPods are a big event because almost no product attracts the level of interest of these little in-ear wireless headphones.\u0026nbsp Next week, if they live up to Apple’s promises, they’ll be even more desirable.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It was on the side of the angels with the second of those, and stands a better chance of winning the next fight\u0026nbspClick to followThe IndependentHyundai\u0027s patriach Chung Moon-Koo. The family Chung family is locked in a battle with Elliott over HyundaiHyundai Motor was celebrating victory this morning. Its investors rejected a demand for the appointment of several new directors and a huge special idend, tabled by the activist investor, Elliott Advisers, which has become a major thorn in the side of the South Korean conglomerate.\u0026nbspPaul Singer’s outfit may have pushed too hard when it came to the size of the Won7tn (£4.7bn) idend it wanted. Hyundai has vast reserves of cash, but its profits have been in decline and the global outlook is cloudy for the motor industry. Given the latter, it’s perhaps understandable that investors baulked and opted for the company’s offer, even though it is worth less than a sixth of what Elliott was proposing.It was on far firmer ground with its demand for a shake up in the boardroom to foster improved governance and greater accountability at the firm, one of the country’s famed family controlled Chaebol that have long dominated the South Asian nation’s vibrant economy. They have been facing criticism on a number of fronts, including the charge of taking minority investors for granted.\u0026nbspHyundai creates app to unlock and control vehicles with mobile phoneHyundai unveils walking car to help save livesHyundai to introduce new electric cars for 2022While this battle may have been lost Elliott’s war is far from over.\u0026nbspIt won a dust up\u0026nbspover a proposed\u0026nbspownership restructuring last year, which critics held was designed solely to benefit the Chung family, and cement its control.The next one will come when a revised plan is submitted later this year. Hyundai only needed the support of 50 per cent of its investors to knock Elliott back over the idend and board seats, and it was assisted by investors such as South Korea’s National Pension Service, the second biggest shareholder, falling in behind the Chung family.\u0026nbspA revised restructuring plan could require up to two thirds support to pass. Elliott should find that easier to win if it objects by aligning with other overseas investors.

They can be of benefit to lumbering,\u0026nbspunderperforming companies with moribund boards that get stuck in the mud and are in need of a good jolt. But they can also cause a great deal of damage in their desire for a quick buck, leaving scorched husks behind them and longer term investors scratching their heads and wondering how it happened.\u0026nbspHowever, while its demand for a huge payout from Hyundai is debatable, Elliott’s call for improved governance sees it on the side of the angels. It\u0027s a sad fact that good corporate governance is an under rated virtue\u0026nbspand it sometimes seems to require the movement of financial mountains to achieve it. Elliott is a rare outfit with the clout to make it happen when so minded.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspIts activities are certainly being watched very carefully by other Chaebol for fear they’ll be next\u0026nbspas investors in the country demand more influence, better returns.We’ll tell you what’s true.

Are you kidding me? Give me a break! Everyone, including Facebook, have tech debt and security debt that piles up. But that\u0027s not an excuse any longer, Sam Curry, chief security officer at security firm Cybereason, told\u0026nbspThe Independent.Facebook is starting to look like critical social infrastructure, where there responsibility is to the public. It\u0027s past time to go back and clean the skeletons out of the closets. How can we trust this platform to get bigger and get more connected under the hood if they can\u0027t do the basis blocking and tackling right?

Their deaths on Pakistan’s ‘Killer Mountain’\u0026nbspleave a sport reckoning with its own burgeoning popularity, writes Adam WithnallClick to followThe IndependentThe bodies of British climber Tom Ballard and Italian Daniele Nardi were found after a two-week searchTom Ballard will never climb Everest. Before his death on Pakistan’s Nanga Parbat was confirmed earlier this month, the prodigious British mountaineer would joke that he had been scaling peaks since before he was born –\u0026nbspin a way, it was what he was born to do.\u0026nbspAged just 30, Ballard already had some extraordinary feats on his climbing resume, foremost among them his record for scaling all six of Europe’s most challenging north faces in a single winter.Ballard’s mother was Anna Hargreaves, the first woman ever to climb Everest solo in 1995 and who, equally famously in the eyes of the press at the time, then died descending K2 the same year, leaving behind a husband, Jim, and two children, Tom and his sister Kate.\u0026nbspShe carried Tom up the north face of the Eiger in the Swiss Alps when she was six months pregnant, and after he was born the family moved to Scotland so Hargreaves could practice on the local crags.The story of how Ballard came to attempt this particular mountain –\u0026nbspthe mountain where his body will remain unless and until a recovery attempt is made –\u0026nbspis as much about his co-climber Daniele Nardi as it is about the way this extraordinary, exhilarating yet occasionally deadly sport has evolved since Ballard’s mother’s own demise.Ballard, 30, and Nardi, 42, were attempting to reach Nanga Parbat’s 8,126m peak via the most direct route, the Mummery Spur. It is an audacious approach, flanked on both sides by towering ice walls that make avalanches a regular occurrence and requiring “mixed climbing” across both ice and rock, a technique beyond even some of the most proficient mountaineers.Created with Sketch.Peaks of Europe Show all 35Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.‘Peaks of Europe’ is a photobook by Johan Lolos.

Published by LannooThe dangers and challenges are such that no one has ever successfully taken the Mummery Spur route in winter before. And for Nardi, who had already turned back from four previous attempts at the same expedition, that was the point.\u0026nbspThe Italian was obsessed with the route, says Pakistani climber and tour operator Ali Muhammad, who accompanied Nardi on his 2014-15 attempt but chose to turn back when conditions became too hazardous.In winter this mountain is so dangerous very windy, many avalanches and cloudy, with zero visibility. Sometimes you have to stop on the wall because you cannot see where to go – down or upNanga Parbat is known as the “Killer Mountain” for a reason, he tells The Independent. “In winter this mountain is so very dangerous very windy, many avalanches and cloudy, with zero visibility. Sometimes you have to stop on the wall because you cannot see where to go –\u0026nbspdown or up. Then we have no choice:\u0026nbspjust hold on until we get better weather.”It was only three years ago, in early 2016, when an international team of climbers made the coveted first winter ascent of Nanga Parbat by any route, leaving K2 as the only mountain above 8,000m anywhere in the world that has yet to be conquered in winter.Muhammad says he understands the urge to conquer a mountain in a way that has never been done before. “Daniele and Tom were trying to make a new history in winter climbing,”\u0026nbsphe says.But the Mummery Spur, he says, is not just one of the hardest ways to summit Nanga Parbat\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspit is, in Muhammad’s view, the most difficult unconquered route anywhere in Pakistan, perhaps even the world.Nanga Parbat is seen as a far greater challenge for serious climbers than Everest\u0026nbsp(AP)Simone Mori, the star Italian climber among the group that completed the winter ascent in 2016, has described the Mummery Spur as “suicidal”. “It is ice, rocks, snow, and deep crevasses, and that’s just to reach Camp 2. After Camp 2 there are no crevasses. It is all vertical,” Muhammad says.Nardi and Ballard last made contact with base camp when they were at an altitude of about 6,300m. After a search of almost two weeks, their bodies were found using a high-power telescopic lens by Spanish climber Alex Txikon, another of the successful 2016 ascent team. The families consented to the release of the images, showing two figures and a tent lying close together on a small patch of snow at the bottom of a gully, surrounded by jagged rocks.What changed in the sport of mountaineering between Hargreaves’ generation and that of her son, Ballard, and Nardi? Everest is still Everest, the highest peak on the planet, its height unchanged,\u0026nbspmore or less,\u0026nbspfrom 1995 to 2019.Rather what has changed is our perception of what is humanly possible, argues Jake Meyer, a mountaineer who at the age of 21 years and four months became the youngest Briton to scale Everest in 2005.\u0026nbspHe says that the cultural allure of Everest comes from the fact that it wasn’t climbed at all, that we know of, until Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay as late as 1953.The number of climbers worldwideAfter that, the landmarks tumbled:\u0026nbspin 1975, the first woman to reach the summit. In 1978, the first successful climb without supplemental oxygen. In 1980, the first winter summit. All the way to Hargreaves’ own achievement in 1995. To elite climbers, Everest now has little left to offer.Like Ballard, Meyer started climbing when he was young, gaining a degree of competency quickly so that his youth alone was basis enough to set new benchmarks and, almost just as importantly, attract the interest of sponsors to make the expeditions possible.\u0026nbspHe describes a never-ending “arms race” among professional mountaineers to keep pushing the boundaries and achieve things that have never been done before, or at least do them in a way that is new –\u0026nbspplaying with the “semantics”, he calls it.Nanga Parbat is the ninth tallest mountain in the world (AFPGetty)Nardi was keenly aware of this competition, and indeed saw it as integral to the sport. Pakistani mountaineer Karim Shah Nizari quoted him in a tribute after his death by saying: “He always said, ‘A climber is someone who climbs new routes’.”In a modern world of social media and round-the-clock connectivity, that urge to open up new frontiers and explore the world’s last wildernesses may be appealing –\u0026nbspbut it is also one “that has always been there” as a driving force for the great historic mountaineers, Meyer says.The difference now is that with Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, hundreds of thousands of fans around the world can follow their favourite climbers’ expeditions in real time.Nardi’s official Facebook page had more than 100,000 followers at the time of his death. The latest updates in the search and rescue operation for the pair were distributed direct to supporters by Stefano Pontecorvo, the Italian ambassador to Pakistan. And Alex Txikon, who has more than 58,000 Facebook followers, shared dramatic photographs and video from the frontline of the search.Alex Honnold, the first solo climber to scale Yosemite’s El Capitan Could this new exposure, and the fact that sponsors pay a lot of attention to mountaineers’ status as modern influencers, be another factor leading them to take greater risks? It’s a question Meyer poses. “Everyone is so aware of what everyone else is doing,” he says. “You have\u0026nbspto be doing bigger, badder, more awesome and, as a result, slightly dangerous things to keep up? I think that if people are treating it like that, then it is a race to the bottom.”If mountaineering and climbing have taken an edgier and more extreme turn in the past 20 years, it isn’t just on new media formats that people are taking notice.\u0026nbspUp until the turn of the century, the sport was considered fodder for low-rent thrillers like Vertical Limit (2000, starring Chris O’Donnell), Cliff Hanger (1993, Sylvester Stallone) and The Eiger Sanction (1975).Something changed around the time of North Face (2008), a critically acclaimed German film about the competition to scale the most dangerous ascent of the Alps. In 2010, 127 Hours about mountaineer Aron Ralston’s fall down a canyon in Utah was runner-up for six Academy Awards.\u0026nbspFinally, this year the suspenseful Free Solo, about Alex Honnold’s successful climb up Yosemite’s El Capitan rock wall without a rope, won the Oscar for best documentary.I don’t go to the mountains because I have a death wish. On the contrary, I go there because that’s where I feel aliveClimbing is now officially cool –\u0026nbspand there are figures to back up the assumption that young people who might once have been inspired to take up skate- or snowboarding are now turning to their local bouldering gym instead.\u0026nbspIn North America, indoor climbing is set to be a billion-dollar industry by the year 2021, according to the Climbing Wall Association, with a record 43 new climbing gyms opening up across the US in 2017.The International Federation of Sport Climbing estimates 25 million people are climbing regularly worldwide, with the number of young competitors in the UK up 50 per cent in the past five years.\u0026nbspAnd in another landmark for the sport unthinkable a generation ago, sport climbing will feature at the summer Olympic Games for the first time in history next year at Tokyo 2020.Created with Sketch.Jake Meyer: youngest Briton to climb Mount Everest Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.110 Jake Meyer and K2210 Team climbing at 7400m on K2310 Ottalie and Poppy (with Daddy on the front page)410 Camp 4 on K2 - 7650m510 Jake on way to summit610 Climbing though the glacier710 Jake at summit of K2810 Ottalie, Jake and Saskia at Heathrow as Jake arrives home1010 Basecamp panorama K2 on left, Broad Peak on right110 Jake Meyer and K2210 Team climbing at 7400m on K2310 Ottalie and Poppy (with Daddy on the front page)410 Camp 4 on K2 - 7650m510 Jake on way to summit610 Climbing though the glacier710 Jake at summit of K2810 Ottalie, Jake and Saskia at Heathrow as Jake arrives home1010 Basecamp panorama K2 on left, Broad Peak on right“It’s amazing to see how much it’s changed over my career, and we’re talking 20 years since I watched the new millennium dawn over Kilimanjaro,” Meyer says.\u0026nbsp“It’s incredible, fantastic, and it’s an inspiration.”As the sport’s popularity continues to grow and its elite members keep pushing the limits of what’s possible, a point will be reached where mountaineering must pause and take stock of the element that makes it stand apart from other pursuits – the extraordinary risk to life involved.The Italian climber Mori has been the most outspoken in the community since Ballard and Nardi’s deaths, telling The Times newspaper that “if we continue to say they were just unlucky, the risk is someone will die there next year”.And if the trend continues for increasingly young climbers to seek out the road less travelled, in search of new and more impressive feats, the dangers posed are not just from the mountains themselves.\u0026nbspSearchight)Nowhere is this more evident than with Nanga Parbat. In 2013, a major terrorist attack was launched at the mountain’s base camp, itself a remote outcrop 4,200m above sea level that can only be reached on foot.\u0026nbspThe attack, claimed by the Pakistani Taliban, killed one local guide and 10 international climbers, among them an American-Chinese citizen who was believed to have been the prime target for the gunmen in a kidnapping gone wrong.In 2013 at Nanga\u0026nbspParbat\u0026nbspbasecamp a\u0026nbspterrorist attack by Pakistani Taliban claimed the lives of one guide and 1o international climbersAfter the massacre, the gunmen walked for five hours before eating breakfast at a village and dissipating in the small hours of the morning. An AFP report a year on from the attack suggested most, if not all of the perpetrators remained at large.\u0026nbspThe 2013 attack aside, the Gilgit Pakistan region where most of the country’s biggest mountains lie is generally very safe, far from the restive western border with Afghanistan.Trekkers and climbing enthusiasts are starting to return to the region in larger numbers and can expect encouragement from visa officials and a warm welcome from locals, says Karra Hadri, spokesman for the Alpine Club of Pakistan, the sport’s governing body in the country.\u0026nbspHadri, who remembers Ballard from the time when he visited Pakistan as a toddler with his mother and was carried up to K2 base camp on a porter’s back, says last year there were more than 40 major expeditions in Pakistan –\u0026nbspup from just one or two in the years after the 911 attack.The Bigger Red Nose Climb: Charity trek could do with less BallsStray dog follows climbers to become first to reach Himalayan summitWoman becomes first in India to climb ‘men only’ sacred mountainBut he is concerned that growing numbers of young people will come to the country seeking adventure and put their lives in danger. He is calling for a change to the regulations for permits, so that climbers must prove themselves on smaller peaks before attempting any of Pakistan’s five 8,000m-plus summits.“Mountaineering in Pakistan, especially above 8,000m, can be very difficult compared to the rest of the world,” he says. “We still have many mountains that have not been climbed, but youngsters need to know the risks. They should have a lot of skill, a lot of experience, and much budget. And they should go in a group,\u0026nbspnot just one or two alone.”Hadri was closely tracking the progress of the search operation over the past two weeks and was “very sorry to hear” about Nardi and Ballard’s fates. “Tom’s mother was a brave lady,”\u0026nbsphe adds.Ballard is survived by his sister, Kate, who posted a message on Facebook after he went missing thanking people across the world for their “love and thoughts”, and by his girlfriend Stefania Pederiva, who wrote: “I will find you in nature, in the rivers, in the trees, in the mountains, you will always be my most beautiful rock.”Nardi is survived by his wife Daniela and a son Mattia, who is just six months old.\u0026nbspAnd while the sport mourns two of its most promising sons, climbers as a whole are stoic about the risks they take in pursuit of their passion.\u0026nbspMeyer, who last year joined an elite group of only 10 Britons to have scaled K2, says he cannot imagine removing the element of danger from mountaineering,\u0026nbspdespite having, like Nardi, young children at home.“I don’t go to the mountains because I have a death wish. On the contrary, I go there because that’s where I feel alive,” he says.\u0026nbsp“If you remove the element of risk completely, then what you are left with is almost every other sport. Having children didn’t change my desire to want to go, but what it did was it gave me three times the reasons to come home safe.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

Then on 25 October a cow fell ill on a farm near the market town of Oswestry in Shropshire.That was the beginning of an epidemic that only ended five months later, with the farming business on its knees and huge areas of the country covered by overlapping five-mile exclusion zones.A total of 442,000 animals had been slaughtered in 2,364 separate outbreaks. Roughly £150m\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspa huge amount at the time –\u0026nbspwas spent on slaughter costs and lost sales farmers received £27m in compensation.It became known as the Great Cattle Plague, and even today it is still the subject of angry discussion in rural circles.As outbreaks popped up around the country, triggered by the combination of the virus’s 14-day incubation period and its extreme infectiousness, the Ministry of Agriculture began imposing five-mile exclusion zones as new infections were identified animals could not be moved in or out.Created with Sketch.Looking back at Britain’s foot-and-mouth outbreaks: 1927-1967 Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Two farmworkers read a notice declaring a footpath closed because of foot-and-mouthA man hoses down a car at Cockernach Farm, Barkway,  Hertfordshire, in an attempt to contain the spread of foot-and-mouth.

Entrances to fields and farms were blocked with disinfected straw members of the public were not allowed to enter them.Humans are usually safe from the disease, but at least one person died from the epidemic some of the worst outbreaks were in Cheshire, Shropshire and Wales.The disease was later reckoned to have been virtually eradicated throughout the European Union after a campaign of vaccination and slaughter. That makes yesterday’s action, in which the EU banned all meat, milk and livestock exports from the UK, understandable.After slaughter, farms had to be scrubbed twice a day with special disinfectant and animals were not allowed on to the land for at least six months. Restricted entry signs stood over the entrance to farmland, bearing warnings including: “You are now entering an infected area.”Horse racing was suspended in Britain after the 1967 outbreak and the official Shrovetide football game in Ashbourne, Derbyshire, was cancelled in 1968 because of continuing restrictions.The outbreak was finally linked to frozen lamb carcasses imported from Argentina.Although Britain did suffer another foot-and-mouth outbreak in 1981 on the Isle of Wight, it was easily isolated. A total of 200 cattle and 369 pigs were destroyed.This article first appeared in The Independent on 22 February 2001We’ll tell you what’s true.

In nine days, Scottish farmers and dealers reach the more important deadline when they can apply for a resumption of overseas exports, because then they will have been free of the disease for 90 days.The auction at Kirkwall, capital of the Orkneys six miles off the mainland, was seen as a trial run for the resumption of trade in other unaffected areas of the United Kingdom.Though no more than two dozen buyers, many of them mainland farmers from Aberdeenshire, made the ferry trip for yesterday’s sale, only auction and government veterinary officials, and representatives from the Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, were allowed close contact with the livestock. The buyers, dressed from head-to-toe in hats, clean boiler suits, rubber boots and white plastic raincoats, had to forgo the usual close inspections of the cattle before the sale began.For the Orcadians, the resumption of the weekly cattle mart was more than just a lifeline for business. The social effect of the closure has been devastating. Since the beginning of the crisis, movement on the island has been curtailed because friends and neighbours fearful of spreading the disease kept their distance from other farms.Created with Sketch.How the 2001 foot-and-mouth outbreak brought Britain to a standstill Show all 26Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Around 150 dead cows that may have come in contact with foot-and-mouth disease are burnt on a funeral pyre at Great Warley Hall farm in Great Warley, Essex, 27 February 2001.

There’s much still to do to get out of the mess that foot-and-mouth has caused and get the farmers back to a kind of normality.”Steven Metcalf, chairman of Orkney Auction Mart, said: “The social effect of the mart reopening is good news. Early in the outbreak people were frightened to move around and weren’t visiting neighbours or friends. It is a good boost for the morale of agriculture and it is a step nearer to normal trading and normal life.”Although the slaughter of more than 800,000 animals north of the border has so far limited the number of confirmed cases to 187, Maria Limonci, spokeswoman for the NFUS, said Scottish farmers needed to see export bans lifted. “Around 40 per cent of the sheep produced in Scotland usually go out of the country and at present they have nowhere to go,” she said. “More farmers deal in sheep than cattle, and this was only one sale. It’s a huge step in the right direction but it doesn’t mean things are now OK.“We have to hope nothing goes wrong in next few days. Having 90 clear days would give Scotland grounds to put forward the proposal to Europe to allow exports to restart.”In England, continuing restrictions prompted 600 farmers yesterday to demand a public inquiry into the handling of the crisis.David Handley, head of the pressure group Farmers For Action who spearheaded last year’s fuel blockade, led a protest march from Hyde Park to Downing Street to hand in a petition condemning the government’s policy on dealing with the crisis and the failure to implement a vaccination strategy to prevent the spread of the disease.Although the turnout was lower than expected, protesters included farmers from foot-and-mouth hotspots in North Yorkshire, Cumbria and Devon and Cornwall.Up to 3,000 civil servants at the Department of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs held a one-day strike on 20 August 2001 over pay inequalities that followed formation of the new departmentThis article first appeared in The Independent on 21 August 2001We’ll tell you what’s true.

The supermarkets described the CMA’s provisional findings into the merger, as “prohibition in all but name”.Sainsbury\u0027s boss Mike Coupe and Asda chief executive Roger Burnley added: “We have asked the CMA to correct significant errors in its provisional findings.Created with Sketch.

Giving evidence Witness O said he had been a member of an active IRA unit in Birmingham, but was in prison at the time of the attack.He said that Seamus McLoughlin, the officer then commanding the unit, had selected the targets.\u0026nbspHe added that he gave Mr McLoughlin’s name to police in the days after the bombings, while serving time in HMP Winson Green, but heard nothing more.Speaking via videolink, he said Mick Murray was “one of the bombers”, before naming Michael Hayes and James Gavin under questioning by lawyers for the bereaved families.Mr Murray and Mr Gavin have both died in the years since the attack.All you need to know about the 1974 Birmingham pub bombingsWitness O added that two other men he knew as Dublin Dave and Socks had also been involved, but that he did not know either man’s real name.Speaking outside court after the revelation, Julie Hambleton, whose sister Maxine was killed, said: “Witness O has today named the bombers involved in the Birmingham pub bombings.\u0026nbspI have a letter from David Thompson, chief constable of West Midlands Police, that says this is an ongoing live investigation. As such we expect action.”Previously, the inquest\u0026nbspheard that the attack was “an IRA operation that went badly wrong”.Kieran Conway, a criminal solicitor who had once been an intelligence chief with the paramilitary group,\u0026nbspsaid the bombers were supposed to call a coded-warning to police ahead of the explosions but that the chosen phone box had been out of order.In 1975, six men – who became known as the Birmingham Six – were convicted for the bombings but were acquitted 16 years later in 1991.We’ll tell you what’s true.

I couldn’t do very much.\u0026nbspIt was a really difficult time, and all the while his visa was getting refused.“Right now I’m just sitting at home, and I’m desperate to go back to work. Childcare costs almost £1,000 each per month,\u0026nbspso it’s not worth me working part-time. I’m having to rely on benefits, which is not what I want.“If he were here and we were a unit, everything would be consolidated. We would be able to support each other. But right now our life is on hold. If I’d have known things would be this complicated, I would have had an abortion.”If she were able to go back to work, Ms\u0026nbspMettle-Olympio\u0026nbspwould be able to sponsor a visa for\u0026nbspMr\u0026nbspKponouglo, which carries a minimum income requirement of £18,600 a year. But without childcare, it is impossible for her to meet this threshold.Families forced to spend Christmas apart due to UK immigration rules“I’m in a catch-22 situation,” she said. “And it’s been very difficult for my partner. He feels incompetent and almost useless. I have to tell him this is beyond our control. We’re doing\u0026nbspall we can do.”The\u0026nbspJoint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants (JCWI) said at the “very least”\u0026nbsp15,000 British children were living without one of their parents because of family visa restrictions. When asked to provide a more\u0026nbspaccurate figure in a recent parliamentary question, immigration minister Caroline Nokes refused.Mary Atkinson, family reunion campaigner at the JCWI, said: “In 2019, we can and should do better than forcing young mothers into a\u0026nbspsituation like this, making them raise their children alone and give up on their careers simply because of who they have chosen to build a life with.A Home Office spokesperson said: “All UK visa applications are considered on their inidual merits, on the basis of the evidence available and in line with UK immigration rules.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

back\u0026nbspher Brexit deal by staging repeat votes are in tatters, after speaker\u0026nbspJohn Bercow dramatically blocked the tactic, citing rules dating back to before the Gunpowder Plot.The prime minister was left stunned by the shock announcement – which torpedoed her hopes of a third “meaningful vote” while threatening MPs with a long delay to leaving the EU if they refused to give way.The dramatic twist, outlawing fresh votes without substantial changes, left ministers scrabbling for solutions – including an extraordinary proposal to suspend parliament and start a new session.It also achieved the remarkable feat of uniting supporters of a no-deal Brexit and a second referendum, who both believed it made their favoured option more likely.The solicitor general, who warned of “a constitutional crisis”, put forward the escape route of ending the current parliamentary session early to get around the 1604 convention invoked by the speaker, which lapses after a fresh Queen’s Speech.Here’s how Theresa May can get around Bercow’s dramatic Brexit ruling“There are ways around this – a prorogation of parliament and a new session,” said Robert Buckland.Created with

surrenders in reference to the likelihood of Brexit being delayed after the vote Experts pointed to a possible precedent from 1948, when Attlee’s Labour government prorogued parliament for a new 12-day session to pass legislation to reduce the power\u0026nbspof the House of Lords.No 10 is also mulling a possible vote to overturn the speaker’s ruling – but this seemed only likely to succeed if there are enough supporters of the deal in the first place.There was no immediate official response from Downing Street, other than to express its fury that Mr Bercow gave no warning of his bombshell announcement, made in the Commons chamber.The speaker said a further meaningful vote\u0026nbspwould be ruled out of order if the motion was “the same or substantially the same” – under a 1604 convention to stop the government bullying parliament on issues MPs have rejected.Ms May has already admitted that the negotiations with the EU are over, making it hard for her to argue that a further meaningful vote will be on a different question.Crucially, the speaker suggested something would have to be renegotiated with the EU to constitute a “change”, rather than, for example, a clarification of legal advice by the attorney general.Is Matteo Salvini going to veto a Brexit extension?French EU minister names cat ‘Brexit’ because of its indecisive natureMr Bercow told MPs: “What the government cannot legitimately do is resubmit to the house the same proposition – or substantially the same proposition – as that of last week, which was rejected by 149 votes.”The Independent revealed in January that pro-EU MPs believed that Ms May’s tactic to bludgeon her deal through, despite heavy defeats, was barred by parliamentary rules.Senior Tories were livid, believing the speaker had once again laid bare his anti-Brexit bias while twisting constitutional rules to suit his purpose.Rory Stewart, the prisons minister, taunted Mr Bercow by tweeting: “‘When I use a word,’\u0026nbspHumpty Dumpty said, in rather a scornful tone, ‘it means just what I choose it to mean.’”He added: “In the normal course of events, as the speaker says, parliament says no, and the issue is dropped.“But in this case, this is not an option, because these votes respond to an instruction in a referendum, endorsed by parliament, which rules out dropping back to the status quo.”Supporters of a Final Say referendum were delighted, with former Tory MP Anna Soubry telling\u0026nbspThe Independent: “It puts a second referendum very firmly at the top of the agenda –\u0026nbspit must do. We need a way out of this and this is the only way out.”Guto Bebb, a former Tory minister and People’s Vote supporter, said: “It is inconceivable now for ministers to carry on trying to force this broken Brexit deal on the people of the United Kingdom.”And David Lammy, a Labour supporter of the anti-Brexit Best for Britain group, said: “If the prime minister wants us to vote on her deal again, she should add an amendment allowing for her deal to be put to the people.”In the short term, the speaker’s intervention killed off any prospect of a third meaningful vote this week – already in doubt as the Democratic Unionist Party failed to switch sides.It appears certain that Ms May will have to ask EU leaders for a long\u0026nbspextension – anything between nine\u0026nbspand 21 months – to the Article 50 process at a summit in Brussels on Thursday.The new departure date will then be put to a “take-it-or-leave-it vote” in the Commons and Lords next week, just days before the 29 March Brexit day.For that reason, it increases the chances of a crash-out Brexit, which the Treasury has predicted could\u0026nbsptrigger a near 10 per cent GDP decline.However, a long extension could also open up the space for a further referendum, which some believe the prime minister might yet embrace if it is the only hope of passing her agreement.Speaking to a silent Commons, Mr Bercow said repeat votes had been blocked on 12 occasions up until 1920 – a situation only not repeated since because of “general compliance”.“This convention is very strong and longstanding, dating back to 2 April 1604,” the speaker said.“It’s a necessary rule to ensure the sensible use of house time and the proper respect for the decision which it takes.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

What it revealed to me, and I think to the country, as the fog of Brexit cleared, is that’s the emergency stop button.”Mr Osborne, now the editor of the London Evening Standard, also branded Ms May “prime minister in name only” – while declining to say whether she should quit.“She can’t tell ministers how to vote, she can’t sum up her own cabinet meetings and she’s got no majority in parliament, so it feels like she’s running out of road,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.This week, Ms May went back to threatening a no-deal, if the Commons again throws out her agreement, despite previously admitting the outcome would cause huge damage.When is the Put it to the People march and how you can get involved?Uri Geller vows to stop Brexit telepathically if Theresa May does notDUP kills off Theresa May’s hopes it will rescue her Brexit dealWatson defies Corbyn by backing fresh Brexit referendumThe motive appeared to be to terrify Labour MPs into voting for her deal when she makes a third and final bid to pass it next week.However, overnight, the prime minister cast doubt on whether the vote will go ahead, telling MPs she would pull it if clearly heading for another huge defeat.“If it appears that there is not sufficient support to bring the deal back next week, or the House rejects it again, we can ask for another extension before 12 April - but that will involve holding European Parliament elections,” she said, in a letter.“If it appears that there is sufficient support and the Speaker permits it, we can bring the deal back next week and if it is approved we can leave on 22 May.”Nadhim Zahawi, an education minister, warned of a “political meltdown” if Brexit is delayed further and suggested he – and Ms May herself – would quit the government.“Parliament would have failed. Each and every one of us will have to ask ourselves the question \u0027Am I prepared to go back to my constituents and say we\u0027re not leaving the EU, we\u0027re going to go for a much longer extension, and we\u0027re going to take part in the European elections?\u0027“I\u0027m not prepared to do that.

Brexiteers will undoubtedly want a credible Leave option, possibly no deal, while pro-EU campaigners will demand\u0026nbspthe chance to stay in the EU on the ballot.I haven\u0027t marched for 50 years – but I will for a Final Say on BrexitStudent leaders sign letter urging May to hold Final Say referendum Celebrities fund transport to Brexit protest for new EU referendumHere’s how Theresa May can get around Bercow’s dramatic Brexit rulingThe people will have a Final Say on Brexit.

Ms May has always been firm in her opposition to another public vote – but the public will remember she\u0026nbspbroke her promise not to hold a general election in 2017. She is also running out of options to resolve the Brexit crisis.One scenario could see Ms May offer a second referendum to MPs in exchange for supporting her Brexit deal. Labour MPs Phil Wilson and Peter Kyle have worked up an amendment for a “confirmatory vote”, where approval of the prime minister’s deal in the Commons would be conditional on throwing the question to the public.The Kyle-Wilson plan, as it is known, was drawn up in consultation with Jeremy Corbyn’s frontbench, suggesting it could secure that all-important Labour support in the Commons.It\u0026nbspmight\u0026nbspovercome speaker John Bercow’s ruling that the prime minister cannot bring back her deal without “substantial changes”. Her Brexit plan would certainly look different if it had a second referendum attached to it.Another scenario gaining momentum in Westminster is indicative votes. These would test the will of parliament by giving MPs a series of non-binding votes on their preferred Brexit options.It is expected to come to a head on Monday when cross-party backbenchers, led by Labour’s Hilary Benn, attempt to seize control of the Commons timetable to allow for indicative votes on Wednesday.Downing Street is understood to be considering seven different options for the votes, including the prime minister’s deal, a second referendum, a no-deal Brexit or the deal plus membership of a customs union and single market.If a second referendum wins\u0026nbspa large backing, then the prime minister will be forced to give serious consideration to the prospect.We’ll tell you what’s true.

It happens when it rains hard.But this spring, the poppies have been so abundant and so strikingly coloured – orange peel, marigold and burned copper – that the number of people coming to walk among them has simply been too many.\u0026nbspAs a result, the city was forced to say “no” to visitors, after what some officials termed a “super bloom apocalypse”.“The city has expended all available resources to address the #SuperBloom,” they wrote on the the city’s Instagram page. “We have brought in all available staff, as many outside traffic controllers that we could, more shuttles, and our small city can not sustain crowds of this magnitude – our city is not made for Disneyland-size crowds.”It urged residents: “Please, we need your help and understanding.

Residents have complained about traffic jams, as visitors have arrived as early as 5.30am to visit the wildflowers, whose burst of growth was triggered by recent record-breaking rainfall. One person was reportedly hurt in a traffic accident.For the last few weeks, crowds have swarmed onto the fields, many ignoring\u0026nbsp instructions that they stay on the designated path. Some have even picked the flowers to take home.\u0026nbspMayor Steve Manos told The Independent he had never known a\u0026nbspbloom as spectacular as the one this year. “It only happens when it rains hard,” he said. “The last one was 2017, and before that it was 2010.”“People were pulled over on the side of the road to see the flowers as we drove here,” she said. “It was amazing to see the number of flowers grow as we got closer.”Mr Manos, mayor of the city located 70 miles to the south east of Los Angeles, posted videos of himself helping direct traffic on Facebook, to try and give an insight into how bad the situation was.\u0026nbspOn Monday morning, amid some criticism over the shutdown, the city said access to Walker Canyon had been reopened, though parking was extremely limited.\u0026nbspMr Manos appeared in another brief video, standing in front of people walking through the footpaths amid the flowers.REDIRECT Nature Studies by Michael McCarthy: A Western Isles idyllWild flowers are overpowered by exhaust fumesBritain’s most common wild flowers are latest species to disappearThe last stand of the wild flower“As you can see, there are a number of people behind me here to experience the bloom.\u0026nbspBut we are full.

here we have pulled together ten of the most outrageous houses from all over the world.Dubbed the Heliodome, this house in France has been described as the “ultimate solar architecture”.Its eye-catching design - constructed by a cabinet maker - is not just for a unique look but to capture the maximum amount of solar rays as possible.It provides free heating in the winter and cools down the house in the summer.But although it is an eco-friendly way of producing heat, many locals have complained about it’s look saying it doesn’t fit in with the French countryside.The giant seashell house is a joy to look at - with dozens of coloured mosaics that light up the indoors living space.The multicoloured house is in Mexico City and was built in .It is full of plants and natural light after being carefully designed but has all the features to make it a modern home.Despite its unusual shape it was designed to fit in with the natural surrounding and make the occupants feel like they were immersed in the wilderness.This WC-shaped house is made from steel, white concrete and glass, with a suggestive opening in the roof.It is in Seoul, South Korea, and continues the bathroom theme as it is full of toilets.The toilet house was built by Sim Jae-duck, chairman of the organising committee of the Inaugural General Assembly of the World Toilet Association.It is called “Haewoojae” which means “a place of sanctuary where one can solve one’s worries” in Korean.The upside down house is in Affoldern, Germany, and took only six weeks to build.It cost about €, and has an interior which is very disorientating to visitors.It was build in the village near the Edersee Lake in , and comes complete with bedrooms, a kitchen and bathroom.Every item, including crockery, a bath, knives and a toilet, is glued to the ceiling.Star Trek fans can live in a replica of the Voyager, complete with out of this world lighting and decor.The studio flat in Hinckley, Leicestershire, has been lovingly decked out with the main commands control.No detail has been overlooked in the m flat in the Midlands.It went on sale in  for £,.The Keret House in Warsaw, Poland, was the world’s narrowest house when it was built in .The tiny structure is squeezed in between two other buildings and has been described as more of an art installation.Apparently not as claustrophobic as it looks at cms at its widest point, a long ladder takes the occupant up through ious rooms, which look more like shelves.It was planned to be a temporary home for travelling writers.This snappy home is the work of an artist who died two months before it was completed.The crocodile house in the middle of Abidjan, Ivory Coast, is completely hollow.It was completed in  and is now lived in by Thierry Atta, who helped to build it.With windows and a bedroom the unique home is completely liveable and is a popular meeting place for many people in the neighbourhood.This lonely house was built in the middle of a river in .It is perched on a small rock near the Serbian town of Bajina Basta.It was built by a group of young men who thought the rock would be the best place for a tiny shelter, after they needed to rest while out swimming.The man who lives there today was part of the group and has seen off floods and high winds in his little home.One of the strangest homes in the world is one shaped like a giant glittering grand piano and a violin.It is in Huainan, China, and was built in .It features a glass violin propped up against the huge piano, which is the entrance to the house.The piano has a roof terrace beneath a canopy shaped like it’s open top."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/dk-comp-graphic-page10brexit.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"mps vote theresa mays deal brexit slipping hardliners chasing fantasy","story":"Brexit is slipping away.It risks being killed off entirely by the very MPs who claim to love it the most — Conservative backbench Eurosceptics still chasing ­fantasy Brexits.Since last week, the options have changed.First, Parliament voted to rule out No Deal. Then MPs backed a Brexit delay.It’s asthe House of Commons is ­following Tony Blair’s step-by-step guide to overturning the  referendum.A No Deal Brexit will only happen in nine days’ timethe EU refuses an ­extension. That is unlikely.Theresa May will beg for a delay, whatever the conditions.EU members will not want to be blamed for a messy No Deal outcome.From next week, MPs could start voting on their preferred Brexit options through so-called indicative votes. Spoiler alert — they will not end up backing a harder exit.I know there are Leave voters who do not like Theresa May’s Brexit deal.Butyou do not like her deal, look at the alternative options for softer Brexits, which would be far worse for the country.If you think this deal risks the UK ­getting stuck in a customs union, just wait till you see what the deal would look like with Labour’s “permanent” customs union glued on top.Better to have an imperfect route to controlling our own trade policy than no route at all.If you do not like the fact that, under the PM’s deal, we would have to keep existing EU goods and agricultural rules, imagine staying in the Single Market or, as it is rebranded, Common Market .. We would lose the veto over goods rules which we have in the backstop, and be forced to follow rules on services too.Even in a worst-case scenario, Theresa May’s deal lets us escape the EU’s “ever closer union” political project and seize control of our own immigration policy.We would be in control of almost all our economy and not have to pay a penny for it on an ongoing basis.It is far better than most critics will admit. Thanks to changes secured at Strasbourg last week, we have new protections.The EU can no longer do what French President Macron arrogantly threatened. It will not be able to use the backstop as a “trap” to demand access to UK fishing waters.The EU cannot just say “non” to every sensible idea for resolving the Irish border issues. The so-called Star Chamber of MPs were quick to reject the Strasbourg changes.But they should listen to the Irish opposition party.Their Brexit spokesperson said: “We have come a long way” from a “bullet-proof, rock-solid, cast-iron backstop”.Or how about top barrister Lord ­Pannick  He is the QC who won the case for Gina Miller against the Government.He argues that in some circumstances the UK could terminate the deal through the so-called Vienna Convention.Conservative Eurosceptic big beasts, from ex-leader Michael Howard to former Chancellor Norman Lamont, have all weighed in behind the deal.David Davis, who resigned over ­Chequers, is now onside.Lord Trimble, who won the Nobel Peace Prize for the Good Friday Agreement, has backed it. If he can live with the backstop, that should count for something.But some Eurosceptic back- benchers still refuse to support the PM’s deal.Led by Jacob Rees-Mogg, they would prefer a harder deal. But face facts. There is no harder Brexit on offer.With No Deal out of reach, there is no incentive for the EU to provide any more concessions.That means the choices are this deal or a softer Brexit. Or no Brexit at all.And be sure that the Speaker, John Bercow, will bend every possible rule to frustrate Brexit.So, do not expect a long delay to offer a better answer.Anyway, the choice on our future could be made soon.There is no time to lose to save Brexit. Even a snap General Election offers no easy salvation. It would mean Theresa May leading the Tories into another campaign on a manesto of her deal — precisely what her critics want to avoid. And of course, the Conservatives could lose any path to power at all, kissing goodbye to any Brexit.Brexit would never have happenedit had not been for Boris Johnson.Now he has a crucial opportunity to save the whole project.He can show how he can be a ­statesman, by compromising in the national interest.And he can demonstrate the sort of leadership that won him so much praise as Mayor of London.If the Government can persuade the DUP to vote for the deal, backbenchers including Dominic Raab, Iain Duncan Smith, Theresa Villiers and Mark Harper should follow suit.Otherwise, they risk being remembered as the MPs who wrecked Brexit, along with Labour MPs who helped trigger ­Article  and then opposed both No Deal and the current deal.Theresa May also needs to recognise that backbenchers want someone  to take forward the next stage of the negotiations.If she tries to cling to power, critics on both sides of the Brexit ide may never back her deal.Whereasshe pledges to step down on getting her deal through, she can step down as a hero who delivered Brexit against the odds.MPs should know that politics is about taking the world as you find it, not as you would like it to be.And leadership is about taking decisions, even when all the choices are unpalatable.It is fine to stick to principle, but notthat means emulating King Canute’s stand against the waves.If Brexit does not happen it will be a ­national democratic calamity.As the party in power, the Conservatives will be punished.That means risking ­letting Jeremy Corbyn — a leader who can not even deal with anti-Semitism in his own party — seize control of the country.The stakes simply could not be higher.

Maybe to keep up levels of national happiness we should leave horrible, authoritarian bureaucracies every year. Just to put a grin on our faces. I mean, the French don’t seem very happy, do they But here’s the bad news. Theresa May is still Prime Minister and we’re currently heading for a Brexit which would be a travesty of the one we voted for in . If we get Brexit at all.Some of the Brexiteers in Parliament think we might still be able to escape the EU with a No Deal, on World Trade Organisation terms. I think they are deluding themselves.Parliament, which is two to one in favour of NOT leaving the EU, simply will not let it happen.And the EU, desperate to retain its market for goods in the UK, will make sure it doesn’t happen, too.Our Brexiteers are right that Theresa May’s deal is awful. Butthey get a chance to vote on it again, they should hold their noses and vote in favour.Because I reckon it’s that or nothing. We will have a delay, the EU may insist we hold a second referendum as a condition of that delay.And trust me, the second referendum will be rigged in favour of remaining in the EU. It will not be a straightforward in or out option. There will be three options, to split the Leave vote down the middle.In this fight to leave the EU, the British people have had everything against them. The EU, obvs. But also the House of Commons and the puffed-up, ludicrous, pro-Remain speaker John Bercow. And the House of Lords, the civil service and the BBC.The lesson for us low-born, powerless Leavers is to take what we can and scarper before the whole idea is killed stone dead. Which I fear it may be.And now Mrs May is heading back to Brussels to plead for a delay in triggering Article .All along she has been too obsessed with the process of leaving the EU, rather than the clear imperative as demanded by the British people — to simply LEAVE the EU, all of it.She has followed Brussels’ agenda at every twist and turn. And she’ll be following it now. She’ll do what the EU wants.So here’s the deal, as I see it. Give her hopeless proposal one more chance and this time vote for it.We will have been cheated, but not as badly aswe do not leave at all.Because the longer this goes on, the more likely that outcome will be.THIS country becomes more deranged by the very hour.A Roman Catholic journalist claims she may face JAIL because she referred to a transgendered person by the sex assigned at birth, rather than the one she now identies as.Caroline Farrow has been told she must attend a police station for a taped interview.She said: “I have pointed out to police that I am a Catholic journalist commentator and it is my religious belief that a person cannot change sex.”Quite.

I quickly came to learn that, in relation to Brexit, nothing could be further from the truth.Unfortunately, I must remain anonymous for fear of the backlash I would receive at my place of work.However, I can reveal I am a senior policy professional within the service and work closely with a number of government departments.There are a number of extremely dangerous myths regarding civil servants that I must dispel because of the impact they are having on the Brexit process.MYTH : The civil service is independent. The civil service was founded on the pillars of political neutrality.Civil servants are meant to ensure that their own political persuasions do not affect their work. Crucially, they should accept those from all political leanings and points of view.It has become clear to me that the vast majority of civil servants support Remain.From my observations I would estimate this number to be well over  per cent.This is worrying in itself and far from representative of the  per cent of the people who voted for Brexit.Most horrying, however, is the sheer disdain and utter contempt that my colleagues display towards people who voted to Leave.I have lost count of the number of insulting and derogatory terms that are used in my own department and where to refer to the .million people who voted for Brexit: “Racist”, “stupid”, “uneducated”.Anti-Brexit jokes and snide remarks are dropped casually into everyday office con-versations. I live in fear that my colleagues will discover through a slip of my tongue that I am a Brexiteer.Were this to happen, I believe that most would refuse to talk to me again and I might even lose my job.This entire culture creates a thickening cloud of negativity towards Brexit that shades all areas of the civil service. I have witnessed first-hand civil servants doing everything within their power, subtly and under the surface, to frustrate Brexit and talk it down at every opportunity.This can only seriously undermine our efforts to be in the strongest position possible on leaving the EU.MYTH : Civil servants are experts in their field.One would like to think the iniduals making decisions that affect our entire nation would have some level of skill or experience.If only that were true.For example, I know of one stand-alone “expert” policy team leading our preparations for Brexit.You can imagine my disbelief when I discovered none of its members had worked on anything remotely related to the EU before. In fact, I have discovered over time that the vast majority of “experts” within the service have no expertise whatsoever.In many cases the “portfolio” you take on when you join the service is dictated by the one held by your predecessor.As a result, you have new civil servants inheriting politically sensitive and highly important work without the faintest clue about what they are dealing with.Civil servants who are seriously underperforming will usually have a new job title and position created for them somewhere  in the organisation instead of being sacked or performance-managed — they become someone ’s problem then.Given the influence that civil servants are exerting over the Brexit process, this is truly concerning.MYTH : The civil service does not engage in scaremongering.I had hoped that civil servants, even in times of crisis, would be able to remain calm and level-headed in pursuit of ensuring the best outcomes for our country.And yet it is not uncommon for me to receive emails from colleagues promoting Brexit scare stories that are nothing more than lies and speculation. Recently, things have become so panicked that ious “Brexit contingency” plans have been set up throughout the organisation. This is to prepare for the “national public transport breakdown”, “surge in criminality” and “widespread public unrest” that is going to follow after we leave.These plans also involve collecting the personal details of certain civil servants to put in place a -hour, on-call rota for the “emergency” that is looming. This scare-mongering, created and whipped up by civil servants, is having a marked impact on the confidence and well-being of ordinary citizens.For example, one acquain-tance of mine is so terried by the speculative threats put out by the service they have started to stockpile large quantities of their medication. This needs to stop.MYTH : Ministers are in charge.When I was outside the civil service looking in, I always believed civil servants were there simply to advise their ministers, who, as elected representatives of the people, would make the ultimate decision. However, I have come to realise that ministers are often mere puppets, with civil servants pulling ferociously at their strings.The level of bureaucracy is unimaginable.In my experience parlia-mentary briefings go through — at a minimum — five stages of internal clearance, with crucial information being amended or deleted at every stage on the whim of that inidual civil servant.The power and competence of our ministers is, I’m afraid, a facade.They are nothing more than a megaphone for the views of biased civil servants who lurk behind them in the shadows.I am a supporter of the Leave campaign.To go against the will of the people expressed in the  referendum would be the ultimate act of betrayal.The Government MUST allow us to take back control by leaving the EU on World Trade Organisation terms. If the people are betrayed, I may have no choice but to resign.Honesty, impartiality, integrity and objectivity. We will soon discover, once and for all, whether our politicians embody these values.©The Sunday Times News Licensing Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

This was planned and conducted, carried out by one inidual who had control of the aeroplane via his job to have control of the plane.”He claimed that the pilot or co-pilot made the decision “to take it to a remote part of the ocean and make it disappear forever”.Vance spent  months doing research for his book MH Mystery Solved, but he was not part of the official investigation by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau.Some feared Russian president Vladimir Putin was involved in the hijacking of MH. US Science writer Jeff Wise claimed Putin spoofed the planes navigation data so it could fly unnoticed into Baikonur Cosmodrome so he could hurt the West.French ex-airline director Marc Dugain accused the US military of shooting down the plane because they feared it had been hijacked. A book called Flight MH – The Mystery also suggested that it had been shot down accidentally by US-Thai joint jet fighters during a military exercise and covered it up.Malaysia police chief Tan Sri Khalid Abu Bakar suggested the disappearance could have been the result of a suicide. He claimed someone on board could have taken out a large le insurance package before getting on the plane, so they could treat their family or pay back the money they owed.Historian and writer Norman Davies suggested MH could have been remotely hacked and flown to a secret location as a result of sensitive material being carried aboard the jet."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/TM-comp-Politicians-Graphic.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"theresa may brexit deal must offer job face general election","story":"Over the next three weeks, all sorts of choices will race into view. But this country won’t know where things are going to end up until April .On Wednesday, No Deal ­suddenly seemed a likely option again. The EU were saying they would only grant Theresa May’s request for an extensionher Brexit deal passed before March , something that is highly unlikely.I am told that at the No Deal ministers’ meeting on Wednesday night, “the mood was totally dferent to previous meetings, as people thought it might actually happen”.It was agreed that a small group of ministers — Theresa May’s effective deputy David Lidington, Home Secretary Sajid Javid, Health ­Secretary Matt Hancock, Environment Secretary Michael Gove and Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley — would meet again on Friday morning to take the preparations to the next stage.But on Friday morning that meeting was cancelled.Why  Because after the EU agreed to halt the UK’s ­departure until at least April , No Deal is once again highly unlikely.This delay meansMay’s deal fails again, ­Parliament will have enough time to step in and take ­control of the process.The three options now are: May’s deal passes, a softer Brexit is agreed in the next few weeks, or there is a much longer extension to allow a General Election to be held, which could mean no Brexit at all. At the moment, the Brexit deal isn’t going to pass.Getting it through was always going to be hard, but the errors Mrs May made this week have made it even more ­dficult.As one Secretary of State puts it: “She would have been much better off spending three days in bed.”Her speech on Wednesday night, criticising MPs, was also ill-judged, given that they are who she needs to win over.It was particularly mistaken given May had turned down an invitation to address her own MPs that evening.One normally mild-mannered backbencher tells me: “It was offensive to us. You decline to come and talk to us — then insult us.”The Government’s domino strategy for winning the vote required getting the DUP to come on board.There is only one way to change this dynamic — for May to offer to goher deal passes.This would instantly change the debate. In the past few days, one Tory MP who wants No Deal and another who wants a second referendum told me they would vote for a ­withdrawal agreementthey had a guarantee she would go.“An increasing number of people are saying their vote is contingent on her going,” says a senior backbencher.As one Cabinet minister admits: “Even that may not be enough.” But without it, there’s no chance of the deal passing next week.James Forsyth is political editor of The Spectator.AMID all this uncertainty, one thing is looking increasingly clear: Britain will have a new Prime Minister soon.Opinion has turned against Theresa May ­following her ill-judged speech on Wednesday.“She has managed to offend everybody,” one previously loyal minister tells me.And one Secretary of State fumes: “She’s alienated Parliament, the Cabinet and the EU.”There are no shortage of leadership candidates sounding people out.Jeremy Hunt, the Foreign Secretary, has the support of more ­Cabinet ministers than anybody . He is seen as a safe pair of hands and as having the ­emotional intelligence to hold the party together.Sajid Javid was the frontrunner. But as always happens in Tory leadership contests, that has put a target on his back. He has had a dficult few weeks and is losing support.Cabinet ministers are convinced that Andrea Leadsom is running. They point out how, at Cabinet this week, she spoke in a string of highly quotable lines about Leave voters being let down.Liz Truss, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, is also expected to go for it. But many think she is more interested in framing the debate and pushing her pro-growth agenda than anything .Michael Gove is being urged to stand, with Mel Stride, the well-connected Treasury minister, at the forefront of efforts to persuade Gove to run.Matt Hancock is another being encouraged to enter the race. He is the new toast of the party donor classes, who think he offers competence. One MP describes him as “a better version of Jeremy Hunt”.On the backbenches, Dominic Raab and Boris Johnson are competing to be the Brexiteer ­candidate. Raab’s campaign is better organised – he has ten MPs gathering support for him.But Johnson has the proven electoral record and greater experience. One thing to remember, though. Tory leadership races are like the Grand National: Messy, unpredictable and the favourite rarely wins. THE absurdity of Labour’s Brexit position is that it accepts the withdrawal agreement.What it takes issue with is the political ­declaration, which isn’t legally binding.Voting through the Brexit deal would not stop Labour from getting to any of the softer Brexit ­outcomes that it has been proposing in recent months.You could negotiate almost any kind of Brexit from the withdrawal agreement.But Jeremy Corbyn doesn’t want to vote for it because he doesn’t want to vote for a “Tory Brexit”.It would bring the withdrawal agreement, ­without the political declaration, to the Commons and dare Labour to vote it down.If Labour blinked and the withdrawal agreement passed, we would then be out of the EU and into the transition ­period.The EU would also be satisfied and consider us to have ratied the agreement.If Labour voted down the withdrawal agreement, then it would be clear what their motives were.IF there is no chance of the Brexit deal ­passing unless Theresa May promises to go, who can tell her that This is what ministers have been discussing with each other in the past  hours. They think her No aides won’t, so somebody  needs to.The obvious candidate is Sir ­Graham Brady, chairman of the  Committee of Tory MPs. Brady is discreet and respected. But it is now time for him to put on his grey suit and carry this message to May.May promising to go so long as the withdrawal ­agreement is passed would show that it really isn’t all about her.And history would view her in a much more sympathetic light.ONE reason why the UK might end up leaving the EU by April  is the Labour leadership don’t want the European elections to take place any more than ­Theresa May does.They know parties in favour of a second referendum would attack Labour for its equivocation on this point.Jeremy Corbyn, who walked out of a meeting this week because Chuka Umunna had been invited, wouldn’t want to give the breakaway ­Independent Group such a perfect launch pad.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Hope dies last.”Irish PM Leo Varadkar had a dig at Brexiteers by saying the EEA showed “sensible solutions are possible once red lines don’t restrict them”.He added the UK now had to choose between “no deal, the Withdrawal Agreement or a much closer relationship with the EU”.And top eurocrat Martin Selmayr called it “a well tested, successful model for close economic integration between the EU and its neighbours”.Meanwhile Danish PM Lars Lokke Rasmussen said the delay to Brexit agreed on Thursday night meant the UK now had the chance to “rethink the whole thing”.He said: “If they don’t pass the agreement through the House of Commons next week and they still don’t want a hard Brexit, and they want to redefine their own red lines and negotiate a whole new package, that’s a possibility.”Mr Macron heaped pressure on MPs opposed to no deal to form a majority for a softer Brexit by April  or face the UK crashing out by default.He said: “The UK could reject the agreement, in which case they would have two weeks to come up with a credible alternative plan and a majority in the parliament.“Should this not happen, despite the additional flexibility, we will have to conclude that there will be a no deal agreement.”EU leaders also gave a cautious welcome to plans being hatched by No  to hold indicative votes on seven options ranging from no deal to no Brexit.Dutch PM Mark Rutte suggested it “might be helpful” for MPs to now “take the initiative to make suggestions” on the way forward.But an EU diplomat told The Sun: “They’re only helpfulthey actually result in a majority for an organised withdrawal.”Brussels chiefs also expressed renewed hopes that a long delay could end up with Brexit being reversed altogether.Mr Bettel said: “The best possible outcome would be a new referendum and to stay.”And asked whether he wants the UK to remain, Mr Tusk replied: “I think you know my position. I am more pro-British than you, I think.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Attacking the Prime Ministeraposs performance in Brussels last night, the hardline Northern Irish partyaposs commons leader Nigel Dodds said she had missed an opportunity to help unite the country by improving her Brexit deal. And in a brutal jibe at Mrs Mayaposs disastrous Wednesday-night speech to camera, he said: Lectures by the Prime Minister putting the blame on others cannot disguise the responsibility her government bears for the current debacle and the fact that her agreement has been twice overwhelmingly rejected in Parliament.    Itaposs fairly safe to say the DUP wonapost be backing her dealit comes back to the commons. And it calls into question the health of the confidence and supply arrangement keeping Mrs May in power - which is expected to expire in June. Hereaposs the remarkable statement in full: Nigel Dodds said: “The Prime Minister missed an opportunity at the EU Council to put forward proposals which could have improved the prospects of an acceptable Withdrawal Agreement and help unite the country. That failure is all the more disappointing and inexcusable given the clear isions and arguments which became evident amongst EU member states when faced with outcomes they don’t like.

Click here to visit Paddy Poweraposs Brexit Bunker and you might soon be packing your bags!   As we have always said, negotiations with the EU inevitably go down to the wire and the Government has been far too willing to capitulate before securing the necessary changes which would get an agreement through the House of Commons.    The Government has consistently settled for inferior compromises when they didn’t need to and when there was, and is, more negotiating with the EU to be done. Lectures by the Prime Minister putting the blame on others cannot disguise the responsibility her government bears for the current debacle and the fact that her agreement has been twice overwhelmingly rejected in Parliament. The Prime Minister has now agreed with the EU to kick the can down the road for another two weeks and humiliatingly revoke her oft-stated pledge that the U.K. would leave the EU on th March. Nothing has changed as far as the Withdrawal Agreement is concerned. Nothing fundamentally turns on the formal ratication of documents which the Attorney General has already said do not change the risk of the U.K. being trapped in the backstop. The DUP has been very clear throughout that we want a deal which delivers on the referendum result and which works for all parts of the U.K. and for the EU as well. But it must be a deal that protects the Union. That remains our abiding principle. We will not accept any deal which poses a long term risk to the constitutional and economic integrity of the United Kingdom.” "},{"url":null,"title":"brexit news theresa mays third","story":"NewsBrexit news: Theresa Mays third deal vote may not go ahead next week after allTheresa May has admitted she may not have enough support for the twice-crushed plan, which could lead to a longer extension of EU membershipShareCommentsByHarriet Line:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR NewsTheresa May had hoped for third time lucky with her deal \"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email Theresa May has admitted she may not garner enough support to get her twice-defeated Brexit deal through the Commons next week, amid mounting speculation about the future of her premiership.The Prime Minister wrote to MPs warning thatthere is insufficient support for her Withdrawal Agreement in the coming days that she could seek an extension to Britainaposs EU membership beyond the European Parliament elections.

Mrs May sought to soften her approach in her letter to parliamentarians, offering to hold talks with MPs and thanking those who have backed her plan previously.    And she laid out the choices available to the Commons after she agreed a delay to Brexit with EU leaders in Brussels on Thursday night. The PM said the UK could revoke Article  leave without a deal ask for an extension beyond April her deal is rejected or not voted on or leave on May it is finally approved.

The message that the float is delivering is that people want to stop Brexit,” says a spokesperson for the secretive EU Flag Mafia organisation. “The caricature of the prime ministeraposs nose is to highlight the lies on which Brexit is based, and the dying figure represents both the UK economy and its citizens rights.” German artist Jacques Tilly, who designed the sculpture, has been making satirical political sculptures for  years. The effigies are made of wooden frames covered in chicken wire and paper Mache and then painted. The Theresa May Nose float was on display at the Dusseldorf Carnival, held on March th .

Being adopted at the age of four should have been the moment Richard felt the love of a family and a chance to find security and happiness. Instead, he endured merciless beatings from his sadistic adoptive father.  Since that traumatic day in the adoption office, Richard has traced blood relatives and information about the man who saved him from the canal. Gradually, with painstaking research, he has pieced together the story of his le and family and felt able to move on. Richard says: “I’ve spent decades wondering about my birth parents. Maybe to ease the painful knowledge that they had given me up, I wrapped thoughts of them in romantic stories. “Maybe my blood mum and dad were lovers too young, or too poor, to bring me up as well as they’d hoped  “Maybe they wept as they handed me over to a children’s home  I always hoped that one Mother’s Day I’d turn up at my mum’s home with chocolates and flowers, and she would throw her arms around her long-lost son.” Reading his adoption file shattered all his illusions. Richard read that his birth mum Lucy Cunningham was  when she had him.    Lucy had abandoned her three children and husband to be with his birth father Harold Wrenn. She had a daughter with him before Richard’s birth, and two other children after him. Harold, a gang leader in league with the Kray twins, was in prison when Richard was born and never knew he existed. Lucy had always refused to see any reminders of the baby she gave birth to on the freezing canal bank. Richard says: “According to my file, Lucy had been offered pictures of me throughout my le and declined to see them. As I read all this information, all the self-esteem I’d ever built up vanished. I was left feeling utterly inadequate, isolated and inferior. “My adoptive father always said nobody had wanted me, and I started to feel that was true.” Hitting rock bottom that day he saw his file in the Birmingham Children’s Services offices gave Richard, from the West Midlands, no other option but to rise up. Realising how lucky he was to be alive, his first vow was to find and thank the man who had rescued him from the canal bank. At around pm on November , , postman Joseph Lester had just finished his sht at Birmingham’s sorting office and was walking home through freezing fog. It was a familiar route and Joseph was used to hearing the lapping water and muffled sounds of the city as he walked.  That night he was alerted to a faint whimper. He beamed his torch over the water and strained his eyes in the darkness until he spotted something pale. He stooped to find what looked like a parcel wrapped in newspaper, only two or three inches from the water’s edge. As he peeled back the paper, Joseph saw a newborn baby who was white and cold. He tucked the baby inside his coat and walked to the nearest phone box to call . Richard says: “I found this out from newspaper cuttings. Because that evening, Joseph ed home to his we and kids, and this kind, heroic man was so humble he did not tell his family he had just saved a le. “When I tried to find him, I was sad to find a record of his death. But I was so happy to meet Joseph’s sons, John and Keith, who said their dad often helped people without telling a soul.” Richard’s quest to find out more about his early le led him to trace some half siblings, who are now in regular contact and share stories of their childhood with empathy. Richard says: “It was a strange feeling to meet siblings – asI felt every emotion I had ever known rolled into one. “They gave me the first photos I’d ever seen of my birth mother and father. “With my half sister Patricia, I felt a genuine connection between us and an outpouring of love that I will cherish for the rest of my le.”  Patricia had attended their mother’s cremation and visiting the cemetery last September finally gave Richard the closure he craved and helped him look back on his le with new appreciation. He says: “My birth mother died in . Cemetery staff were good enough to open the book of remembrance from the day her ashes were interred, and I saw the names of her six other kids there, but not mine. “That felt like another blow, asI had been purged from her existence. Why had she singled me out  Why was I so bad  “When I was taken to the spot where her ashes were interred, I laid a white roses and tied a photograph of myself to them. “I said, ‘You didn’t want a picture of me when I was alive. But you have one of me now’. “Lucy kept all knowledge of her pregnancy and me from everyone, including my father, my brothers and sisters. I was a secret she took to her grave. “That’s why I had to close the circle, in the way I did in the hope I could move my le forward. “When I drove home that night I felt lighter. I’d done everything I could to find out about my birth family and when my front door closed, I felt I’d laid my past to rest.” Finding the truth about his birth hurt Richard so deeply because le with his adoptive parents had been far from happy. His first four years were spent in Field House children’s home in Clent, Stourbridge, Worcs, and he has only fond memories of his time there.  But the moment Richard met his adoptive parents he felt uneasy with Arnold Gallear, who would not look him in the eye. His instincts were right. Although Arnold’s we Pearl was gentle, patient and caring, Arnold was violent towards Richard, putting him in hospital more than once. The first time Richard suffered at Arnold’s fists, and feet, was just minutes after leaving the children’s home. Furious when Richard was sick in the back of his van, Arnold slammed on the brakes, hauled him out on to the road and laid into him with kicks and punches. Richard says: “No adult had ever hurt me in any way before, let alone hit me. I had a horrible feeling that this was what le would be like from now on. And it was.” On the outside, Arnold was a well-off insurance executive, regular church-goer and loyal member of The Salvation Army. But behind closed doors he ruthlessly controlled we Pearl and constantly verbally and physically attacked Richard.  He says: “He was a sadistic tyrant. But every time social services visited our home to check how I was, they interviewed me in front of Pearl and Arnold and I couldn’t tell the truth. “Teachers and doctors noticed my cuts, bruises, black eyes and broken bones. But no one intervened.” Richard escaped his unhappy home le at , when he ran away to work in the hotel and catering industry, where he could live on-site. Over the years he built up businesses of his own, but never felt he could trust anyone enough to have a lasting, loving relationship. He says: “I felt that loving someone would mean they’d vanish from my le. “First my house mother at the children’s home, who I loved but had to leave behind when I was adopted. And my adoptive mother, who suffered greatly because of Arnold’s violence against me.  “She could never show me affection when he was around, so lived on her nerves and it wore her down. “When I left to take jobs in hotels, I didn’t tell Pearl where I was going or keep in touch because I didn’t want Arnold to know where I was for both our sakes. “That has haunted me all my le and I missed her dreadfully. “So although I never settled down to have a family, I’m blessed with a circle of friends who are so loyal and close I call them my chosen family.” Writing his story in a new book, The Forgotten Child, gave Richard time to reflect on his le. Now, most of all, he feels lucky. He says: “I was incredibly lucky to be found that night on the canal, and also lucky not to have inherited any character traits from my birth parents or adoptive father. “I’m fortunate to have built up businesses to make sure I live comfortably. And I’m lucky I’m still here, despite the way I was born and some health bumps along the way.  “It makes me feel sure someone up there is looking out for me. Researching my le has made me feel, after a letime of self-blame and insecurity, that the bad things that happened were not my fault. “It’s helped me fully move on from the sad aspects of my le, and now I feel I’ve found peace and can finally be happy.”The Forgotten Child, by Richard Gallear, published by HarperCollins, on  March at £."},{"url":null,"title":"brexit march london live tens","story":"NewsBrexit march London: LIVE as tens of thousands demand Peoples VoteThe Put It To The People march is expected to draw crowds of more than , to the capitalShareByDave BurkeUpdated:,  MAR Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video people-across-country-europe-travelling-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News ,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News ,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true\"\" data-chronos-request-url\"https:livecentreps-eb-prod.tm-awx v live-centre nationals-live \" data-embedded-url-endpoint\"https:www.mirror news uk-news brexit-march-london-live-tens- serviceresponsiveembeddedArticleUrl\" data-chronos-domain\"https:livecentreps-eb-prod.tm-awx \" data-inview\"true\"Hundreds of thousands of protesters will descend on Parliament today demanding a deciding vote on Brexit.

Nathan Stevens, , of Edgeley, Stockport, lashed out with aposexcessive self defenceapos when challenging a punter at Hula Bar in West Didsbury, last year, a court heard. The assault started when Stevens had apostaken exceptionapos to something the victim Daniel Roberts had said to one of his female friends on the dancefloor at the venue last April, and aposwords were exchangedapos between, the judge was told. Mr Roberts initially pushed him but Stevens argued in court that he was grabbed by the throat. But Stevens responded by swinging a punch with a beer glass, which ended up sending glasses in the face of -year-old Mr Roberts.  Mr Roberts was rushed to hospital where doctors performed a seven-hour operation in bid to save the sight of his left eye, but it was unsuccessful. He also sustained a number of deep cuts on his face which now have left him scarred. Prosecutor Maria Brannan said Mr Roberts, who works as an electrician, spent three months off work and now struggled having lost half of his vision.

Mr Roberts said: I am normally a very positive person but I have down days when I wished this had never happened and that I still had the sight in my eye. He was pushed against the wall after the attack and Stevens, who didnapost realise how bad the injury was, left the bar. But Stevens handed himself in to police weeks later after an appeal in the Manchester Evening News.    The Stockport man pleaded guilty to unlawful wounding at an earlier hearing. He stated in a plea that the blow was a case of aposexcessive self defenceapos after he was pushed or grabbed by the victim. Daniel Travers, defending, said the father had been left aposdevastated at the injury he had caused and aposthat was never his intentionapos. He said: He knows how signicant an effect that will have for the rest ofle. This is a very poor reaction and was a very bad decision made whilst in drink. It is an immediate and instinctive reaction and we are talking about a few seconds. He has not picked up the glass to use as a weapon, it was already in his dominant hand and thataposs what has caused this injury. He urged Judge Timothy Clayson to suspend any prison term as court was told Stevens was aposcommittedapos to his family, including his children. However those appeals were ignored and he was jailed for two years and four months at Manchester Crown Court on Thursday afternoon.    Passing sentence, Judge Clayson said: This is a really tragic situation which has resulted in the loss of sight in one eye, an injury that is lelong and grave. This was not pre-meditated, it was a single blow which was issued in response to a push or you being grabbed for a few seconds by the throat. However you were affected by alcohol and itaposs right that you would have likely not have reacted by swinging a punch at your victimyou had been sober.

The -year-old felt sheaposd lost her identity after her husband died and children moved away but is now loving performing after losing seven stone in weight - and claims it makes her aposthe coolest gran everapos. The gran-of-two now regularly takes to the stage as her alter-ego Foxy La Mer, complete with corset and nipple tassles - and even reckons burlesque should be on prescription for fellow OAPs. Retired outreach worker Marilyn said: Burlesque encompasses everything I want to do. From the first day I was hooked. I suddenly felt feminine and so glamorous.    Before, Iaposd felt like Iaposd lost all my femininity. Since my husband was ill there was nothing to make me feel glam. Iaposd lost that we role. Sex was out of the window, there was nothing making me feel sexy. It was like I was just existing. I felt very alone. I felt there was something missing. At  years old people have this idea that youaposre old and should just sit at home but thataposs not me.    I wanted something to make me feel like a woman, to feel glamourous and to feel desired. I say itaposs apostease without the sleazeapos. Thereaposs nothing sleazy about what we do. It should be on prescription. At ft in, Marilyn had always been big and was bullied at school by a girl who poured salt on her and called her a aposbig fat slugapos. Turning to drama and acting as a way of escape, she gave up performing when she got married at the age of  and had her children Cymon Hulmes, , and Rachael Knight, .  But her marriage broke down after  years while her confidence had plummeted as her weight crept up to  stone. Marilyn found love again with second husband David Bersey but the pair were devastated when he was diagnosed with Parkinsonaposs Disease shortly after they married in . He died four years ago. Marilyn said: The we role had gone and I had become more of a carer. I felt Iaposd lost my identity - as a we and a mother, my children were all grown up. I was thinking aposwho am I apos My weight was up and down and Iaposd been suffering from high blood pressure for years. I started to steadily lose weight.I lost three stone then another three stone after I retired and joined Slimming World. Another stone fell off after my husband died. I now maintain my weight of st lbs.I was scrolling through Facebook and saw this burlesque group pop up and I thought it sounded interesting.I was very tentative at first. There were a lot of younger ladies and I was the oldest by a long way. They were in their twenties up to their forties.    But I loved it and now go once a week. We learn a routine for four weeks and in the last week we dress up in burlesque and perform it. Theyaposre a fantastic group of girls. Marilyn quickly took on the persona Foxy La Mer and now has two comedy burlesque chair routines that she does at charity events and parties - where she strips down to a sexy corset and nipple tassels which she makes herself. Marilyn, who has a grandson Brandon Hanmore, , and step-grandson Aaron Knight, , said: One is to the ghostbuster tune where, as sexily as I can, I take off a bit of clothing and strip down to my burlesque outfit.  The other routine is the Burlesque Granny. Iaposm an old lady with a walking frame and do part of the routine as a grandma then the music changes and I take off my wig and glasses and strip down to my stockings and corset for the burlesque routine using the walking frame. Then I rip my bra off and reveal the nipple tassels. I love performing because Iaposm not being somebody  - Foxy La Mer is an extension of me rather than a character. Itaposs not important how old I am. I prefer itthey donapost say my age when they introduce me on stage. I want them to clap me because Iaposm doing well and they like it.  Itaposs also toned me up. When I first started I couldnapost get my leg over the chair but itaposs built up my stamina and strength and I can do everything that the others can do now. My daughter will come and watch me. She thinks itaposs fantastic and my son is really proud. My grandson thinks Iaposm the coolest gran ever. Although not looking for a relationship Marilyn said burlesque has given her the confidence to flirt and look men in the eye. She added: Itaposs made me feel sexy again. Iaposm quite happy doing what Iaposm doing andit met someone Iaposd feel confident enough to go for it. I would say to anyone just to try it.

Ben, a rugby coach at Gloucester University who also works as a service engineer, said: “As soon as we had set a date, I told Emma I wanted to go to Vegas for the stag party.  “I’d always dreamed of playing the tables in those iconic casinos and what better time than just before I get married  “We had decided on the flights and the hotel on the strip where we would stay, and he just said he’d take care of it all. “We handed over more than £ each and trusted him to deliver the dream trip. In the weeks running up to the stag, we were all getting excited and there were no signs that anything was wrong.”  Telling of his shock when he got the confession call, Ben said: “I was stunned. I couldn’t believe what he’d done. “It wasn’t just my money, there were others who were going to miss out on a trip of a letime.” To make matters worse, one of the stag members is already in Las Vegas after travelling to Nevada from his home in New Zealand. Police are probing and Ben and his group tried to keep the Vegas dream alive – but flights were too dear.  Ben, whose stag plans had included hitting the Hakkasan party venue, said: “It looks like a weekend in Newcastle rather than Vegas. “There is no use moping about it, I am just trying to make the best of a bad situation and even see the humour in itI can.” Thankfully, Emma’s hen party — a weekend of drinks and games in a Somerset mansion — went without any hitches. Emma, , said: “Ben and his friends were so looking forward to the trip and what happened has been a blow. But they’ll find something  and have a good time.”  Ben added: “At least Emma had a good time and I’m sure we’ll have a blast — just not on the tables in Vegas.” Wiltshire police said: “We can confirm this matter is being investigated. It would be inappropriate to comment further.” "},{"url":null,"title":"major motorways blocked pro brexit","story":"NewsBrexit Go Slow protest turns into damp squib after drivers fined for breaking lawThe demonstration, organised by Brexit Direct Action, failed to cause any unusual traffic issues according to Highways EnglandShareCommentsByTom DavidsonOnline Reporter:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR News \"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA planned pro-Brexit protest which was designed to cause mass disruption on Britainaposs motorways this evening turned into a damp squib - with several motorists expected to be fined by police.The demonstration, organised by Brexit Direct Action, was disavowed by UKIP but received much support from Brexiteers - particularly on social media.One driver taking part said: We can and will bring the country to its knees.The planned disruption - by those angry the UK is not leaving the EU on March  - started at .pm on the A near Bodmin with roughly  motorists showing up, reports Cornwall Live.However, after both lanes were blocked, police soon pulled over nine drivers - two of whom will be issued fines for aposinconsiderate drivingapos.The rest were warned but following more excessively slow driving the entire protest was stopped by police.Were you caught in Brexit protest traffic  Email webnews@mirror    Inspector Si Jenkinson tweeted: We recognise the right to protest and make views clear but we will not tolerate careless and inconsiderate driving on our roads. We engaged with organisers before the go slow began, they ignored our advice to stay in lane  and limit speed to no less than mph.He added: Deliberately slowing or stopping traffic amounts to inconsiderate driving.The drivers were stopped and have been reported for that offence. The rest have been advised they face the same should they continue. There was some traffic in places but it was hard to tell whether this was caused by Brexiteers or just by the Friday rush hour. Highways England tweeted: There have been a few issues but nothing of any major impact and at present everything is running as usual. One angry Brexiteer told Kent Live he “trundled down the M” from Junction  to junction  but “it was a shame no one joined me”. Another driver added: “People ain’t got the b*******. It was a good idea but we have failed.” On the M M past Bristol it was barely noticed however on the M it appears there was some disruption as protesters blocked all three lanes - against police advice. Two drivers on the M in Devon are set to be fined as well.The go-slow started at approximately .pm and consists of around  vehicles, reports Devon Live.  Inspector Si Jenkinson tweeted that two drivers ignored police advice to not deliberately obstruct the carriageway and were prosecuted. He wrote: M go slow. Our advice was the same, make your protest, don’t deliberately obstruct the carriageway. It seems two drivers ignored this advice, slowing to speeds as low as mph on the motorway. They’ve been stopped and prosecuted. Speaking at the start of the protest, organiser Ian Grindod attempted to dampen expectations: “It was never going to be a massive event anyway.” On the A in Flintshire around  vehicles or more turned up - there was slow traffic south and westbound but that was not helped by a closure due to an accident. The go-slow protest is part of a series of action taking place across the country over the next few days. Here is a list of the roads protesters planned to block:  A Cornwall - .pm A M Telford - pm A to M Somerset - pm M Derby Nottingham - pm A Felixstowe - pm M Lancaster Morecambe J to - .pm South Wales M around the Prince of Wales Bridge M M between Avonmouth and Bath - .pmUKIP issued a statement to its members warning against participation. It reads: This will achieve nothing - except the possible arrest of participants on public order offences - and party leader Gerard Batten MEP has requested that UKIP members do NOT participate, and do not allow others to use UKIP flags, banners and other insignia in such a protest. To do otherwise will simply risk bringing the party into disrepute, undermine all our hard work and be a media own goal. A Highways England spokesman said the authority is also aware, adding: Our focus is on providing a safe, reliable network for the millions of drivers who use our motorways and major A roads every day. The penalty for wilfully obstructing the highway is a fine. A Peopleaposs Vote march is due to be held in London on Saturday, finishing in Parliament Square.

She took spare clothes out with her and frequently had to change into them. Yet she suffered in silence. Speaking exclusively to , Kelly-Anne said: I didnapost tell my husband. I didnapost feel I needed to. I couldnapost face telling my friends either. I just made constant excuses as to why I couldnapost go out or see them. I was just so mortied.    Initially, I only confided in my mum, she was the one person that I felt comfortable with telling as I knew she wouldnapost judge me.  But to begin with, it happened a lot but I thought this was just a normal experience after childbirth.Kelly-Anne, who is a lestyle blogger, gave birth to miracle baby Amelia in June  after experiencing dficulty conceiving.But she was mortied to first feel a trickle weeks after childbirth, which quickly became a heavy leak. My sister bought a trampoline so I decided to give it a go.    It began as a trickle, rather than the heavy leak, but I knew something wasnapost right. Initially I ignored it, sweeping it under the carpet as I couldnapost admit that I would have this issue. I had heard of middle-aged women experiencing bladder weakness but not someone of my age. I found it all very embarrassing, the graduate added. The mother-of-oneaposs social le was quickly ruined and the ordeal put a strain on her relationship with her -year-old husband, who doesnapost want to be named. Kelly-Anne stopped going out, distanced herself from her hubby and mates, and grew more and more anxious.    It took her months before she found the courage to tell her mum and sister, who by this stage had four children of her own. The lestyle writer added: I completely lost my confidence and went into isolation. I stopped socialising because I could never relax. Living in a state of anxiety and embarrassment, I soon stopped leaving the house. My way of managing was to isolate myself and not to go out. Feeling shame and embarrassment was a risk that I was not willing to take. But after more than a year of shirking the issue and cover-ups to her hubby, Kelly-Anne was forced to tell him of her plight during a family holiday in August .  Recalling a poignant day, Kelly-Anne said: I was playing football with my husband and Amelia on a beach and I jumped up, and it happened. I had to tell him because I really needed to go back the apartment to get changed. I said aposthis has been happening for a while nowapos and it was becoming more regular than just every so often. He didnapost really know what to say. I donapost think he could quite understand but neither did I really. The only way I can describe it is experiencing the worries of potty training yet itaposs for yourself and not your child. Kelly-Anne eventually saw a doctor and was referred to a professional. The muscles around the mumaposs bladder had become weakened during pregnancy and after childbirth, which led to the urinary incontience. But a third of women suffer from incontinence in the first three months after childbirth, recent statistics show. It was suggested Kelly-Anne used a pair of shorts with electro muscle stimulation technology to help her recovery. The self-confessed tea addict been using the INNOVO shorts infrequently for around three months now and theyaposve helped her get her le back. The blogger continued: I am doing all those things that bladder weakness stopped me from doing for so long. I am out and about, mingling with other mums and feel like me again. I have regained so much confidence again. It feels amazing to let go of those feelings of embarrassment.  I can kick a football around with my husband and daughter, and use the trampoline. The shorts have strengthen Kelly-Anneaposs pelvic floor. These muscles, which keep the bladder shut, come under great strain in pregnancy and childbirth. Professionals suggest mums and expectant mums do simple exercises to strengthen thew muscles. But Kelly-Anne stressed it is also important not to feel alone. My advice to others would be to not feel alone because there are so many women out there who have been through the same thing. Nobody should feel that they need to suffer in silence and be too embarrassed to seek help like I was. Everybody should value their quality of le and not give up years of their le, like I did.

Sammy Halstead, , from Caerphilly, said her condition spiralled out of control before she went for an assessment with a community mental health teamin Cardf. But to her horror she was told that she didnapost meet the criteria for specialist eating disorder support as her body mass index  was not low enough.The psychology student told Wales Live the rejection letter made her think she shouldnapost take on more calories.Sammy has had long-term struggles with food intake and compulsively exercising, as well as self-harming and attempting suicide.    Reaching out for support - before it spiralled out of control - was dficult enough for me, she said. But to then to receive a letter quite simply stating that I was too fat for them to bother helping me made me think I was some kind of fraud. The letter haunts me. I think of it every single time I eat a meal, that my BMI is far too high and how I shouldnapost consume calories. Iaposve read and heard some very invalidating things from professionals, but nothing which had invalidated my struggles surrounding food like this did. Before moving to Cardf, Sammy was deemed eligible for specialist eating disorder services by the Caerphilly CMHT.    I saw my nurse weekly who would offer therapy and support surrounding my issues with food and weight, she said. But as my self-harm began to escalate I was discharged from the eating disorder service in the hope Iaposd get support for the other areas of my mental health. However I barely saw my care coordinator and was not offered any beneficial therapy and was lucky to see a psychiatrist on three occasions in over a year. When she moved to Cardf last summer she registered with a GP in the hope of being referred to their CMHT. I stressed to my GP that I needed crisis intervention, support in place and help regarding my food intake, she said.  I finally had an assessment which I believed went okay. I was struggling to consume anything more than a small meal and cups of coffee daily. I also felt very physically unwell, which is something my BMI wouldnapost tell the assessors.  Weeks after being weighed at her GP surgery, a part of the assessment she knew was required, she received a letter by Links Centre CMHT based at Cardf Royal Infirmary. It stated that Sammyaposs BMI was . which, despite still categorising her as underweight, meant she wasnapost eligible for support. Instead the CMHT recommended she seek support from Cardf University where she was studying. If eating disorder support is based on BMI, then why was I helped and accepted under one eating disorder service for seven months , but discharged back to my GP in the other   There are so many inconsistencies from one health board to another, despite them both being so close in proximity. In response, Cardf and Vale University Health Board said: We are sorry to hear that the patient felt that she did not get the support she needed from the mental health team. “Cardf and Vale UHB provides mental health services for people with eating disorders which covers the whole range of the body mass index . “There are a number of specialist multi-disciplinary teams who provide support and treatment for iniduals with eating disorders. The team works together to make decisions on inidual cases and practitioners use a range of risk factors such as psychiatric co-morbidity as well as physical health and BMI to determine what part of the service is most suitable for the inidual. “If the patient wishes to discuss any aspect of their care further we would ask them to contact our concerns team.”A campaign, called  Dump the Scales , was launched last summer which calls on services to judge eating disorder patients on their mental state, not their physical weight.It wants governments across the UK to fully implement NICE guidelines through GP and clinical training to ensure those with eating disorders get treatment before they reach crisis point. Hope Virgo, who spearheaded the campaign, said: When asked to imagine someone suffering with an eating disorder, most will imagine a stick thin, gaunt looking girl. But this is not the reality of eating disorders. People with eating disorders are currently not getting a fair deal in society. Despite the guidance, too often iniduals are turned away from receiving essential support because they aren’t skinny enough to be considered at risk. This leaves the inidual feeling like they aren’t worth getting that support, feeling like a aposfakeapos, potentially losing more weight to hit that target and in some cases feeling suicidal. This is why I’m calling on governments to review the eating disorder guidance delivered by clinicians. The NICE guidelines are right but these are not being unormly implemented across the nation to the detriment of thousands of people daily. It is time we stopped waiting for people to hit crisis point before offering them support. In response to the Dump the Scales campaign, a Welsh Government spokesperson said: “To support improvements to eating disorder services, Welsh Government commissioned Dr Jacinta Tan of Swansea University to conduct an independent review of the eating disorders framework for Wales. Dr Tan submitted her findings in November and a focused consultation is being planned to inform future actions which will build on the £.m we invest annually to improve eating disorder services for adults and children.”For help regarding an eating disorder, contact the eating disorders Beat on    or www.beateatingdisorders.org.uk "},{"url":null,"title":"twins nanny must dress disney","story":"NewsTwins nanny must dress as Disney princess - and stay in character at all timesThe couple, from Brookmans Park, Hertfordshire, was to \"sprinkle a little magic\" into their girls livesShareCommentsByDeborah Collcutt:,  MAR NewsThe five-year-old twins love all things Disney \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email If Mary Poppins was practically perfect in every way, a nanny sought by a couple for their daughters needs to be practically Disney Princess in every way. For the successful candidate answering an advert posted online is expected to dress - and act - like a Disney Princess while looking after their five-year-old twins.The applicant must turn up to the school gate in costume and stay in role while she supervises play dates, does Disney-related activities, such as singing Disney songs, doing Disney dances or going for Disney-themed picnics. She will also cook dinner and put them to bedtheir City worker parents are busy - all in Disney role. The nanny is required to act as a dferent Disney Princess every months, choosing from positive role models such as Princess Jasmine, Belle and Pocahontas.    The part-time job comes with a generous annual salary of £, and all costumes and props will be paid for in exchange for sprinkling some magic into the little girlsapos lives. Their parents also want their nanny to be a positive influence on the children and believe that many of the Disney princesses encapsulate those values. We hope they can teach our girls about determination, ambition, compassion and fearlessness, says their father. The idea came from the girlsapos mum one day while watching a Disney film - what   - with her daughters.My we came up with the idea, their dad told The Express .She thought it could be a great way to add some magic into their afternoons whilst helping us out.    We were in need of a part-time nanny anyway to pick up the girls after school four days a week and help out until weaposre home. This will make sure itaposs fun for the girls as well as them having a strong role model around them. The family - who want to remain anonymous - are adjusting to hectic le with boisterous twins and as the couple both have demanding jobs, they wanted to ensure thatsomeone  was collecting them from school, it should be a fun experience. We realise it might not be too comfortable, but it shouldnapost be for too long each day, says their dad. He and his we, who commute from Brookmans Park, Hertfordshire, to London, daily, hope that the successful candidate will have a background in performing or acting. They would like her to play the character of each dferent princess, adopting personas and dressing up to perfect the role.  The father said: Like most five-year-olds, our twins are obsessed with Disney and their favourite characters change all the time. However, Elsa from Frozen, normally tops the list. Activities arenapost necessary every evening as sometimes the girls might have homework. However Disney focused activities for most afternoons might include painting, arts and crafts, baking themed biscuits or cakes, dancing or singing - the girlsapos favourite - or even going for a picnic once it is warmer. The parents have also said applicants must be prepared for long-term work, as they are looking to keep them in the girlaposs lives for the foreseeable future. The advert, which starts with I have a slightly unusual request that Iaposm hoping someone will be able to help me with, is on childcare. The site, with more than two million users nationwide, has become the largest online community for parents in the country since launching in .  It is the first time the family have employed a nanny and it is why they want the experience to be extra special. We have used babysitters and a childminder before but never a nanny, says the girlsapos dad who works in finance. Both a qualied nanny and a qualied actor would be amazing, but we realise that might be hard to find. However a qualied nanny is more important as they will have more experience with children than an actor might. The couple have added a £, premium on top of the basic salary for the Disney-related aspects of the job. The advert specied that the role is well-paid and part-time, however the chosen nanny must be willing to work around the parentsapos busy schedules. While the parents will pay for the hire of the costumes they do require applicants to demonstrate a creative flare as well as a passion for all things Disney.  The girlsapos mother, who works for a law firm, composed the advert: My husband and I are looking for a part-time nanny to care for our twin girls during the week, but we want to hire someone to look after our children whilst in character as a dferent Disney princess every month, such as Princess Anna, Moana, Rapunzel and Princess Merida. Like most five-year-olds, our girls are obsessed with Disney and we feel this would be the best way to communicate some important values. We know this isnapost a normal request for nannies, however it would be a great way to teach our girls about things like determination, compassion, fearlessness and ambition from strong yet relatable female role models like Princess Tiana, Princess Anna, Belle and Cinderella. So, how do they react to criticism that not all Disney characters imbue the qualities they are seeking, such as Sleeping Beauty and Cinderella who portray weak women who need rescuing by a Prince Charming  Honestly, before having children, I wouldnapost have known anything about this, but after seeing what seems like a million Disney films I can understand this, says the girlsapos dad.  Despite some older films needing a prince to save the princess, the woman is always the protagonist and holds the values we hope to teach our girls so this isnapost a big problem for us. I think the other parents will think weaposre crazy but hopefully will agree that itaposs a great idea to make the girlsapos days a bit more special - as well as teaching them great le lessons and values, their dad says. Most definitely, I think we will have a lot of girls wanting to come round to play. The girls are already devotees, says their father: We took the girls to Disneyland Paris last summer for the first time and I think it was the best week of their lives. They own a ridiculous amount of Disney toys and they probably have all of the princess costumes between them. We are planning to go to Florida next year too but the girls donapost know about that yet. We are hoping to surprise them and catch it on video. Are they looking for a real le Mary Poppins then  She is more than welcome to apply, says dad, laughing. Our girls have seen the movie and they love it, but I think they might be swayedit was between her or Elsa - sorry Mary! Real le princess Childrenaposs party organiser Lianne Cole understands the attraction of the Disney Princess for little girls. I have been doing princess parties for five years and I absolutely adore it, she says. I arrive at the door in a princess outfit and ask to come to the party. Seeing their young faces is an absolute joy. I organise games but the best part is the singing. I busk parttime at Covent Garden, so I have a big repertoire of songs. Naturally, I get asked to sing Let It Go from Frozen, which the children absolutely love. I have a microphone which I pass around and as you can imagine they all want to have a go. I have two other girls working with me sometimes and when we are together it is an absolute ball. There are so many princesses and so many stories there is a lot of material to draw on. Lianne, , who runs Southamptonbased Ever After Princess Parties is tempted to apply for the nanny role herself.

In fact, at apos with a -inch waist, sheaposs far from it.Pro-skinny Facebook group Superficial Doll described her as the token plus size model among its more slender models Bella Hadid , Kendall Jenner etc.The group posted imagesPalvin along with the announcement: Barbara Palvin is FINALLY the first plus size Victoriaaposs Secret Angel. She DESERVES it.  Other social media users were quick to point out the skewed logic with the statement. If she’s plus size then Iaposm truck size, one woman joked. Another warned: Victoria’s Secret never called her a plus sized model. People just assume she is because theyaposre praising her for having more curves than the typical Angels. Itaposs a dangerous assumption to make indeed, with another woman pointing out:  No wonder girls and women suffer from such bad body insecurities! She is a size  at bestand that’s nowhere near plus size Intriguingly, Palvin did model for the brand back in , but was later dropped, with rumours spreading that her weight had been the reason.

Marketing manager Jane Holmes and her husband, mountaineering instructor, Stephen, parked their long wheel base Volkswagen LT van in the Scottish Highlands. Jane worked remotely five days a week for a London-based tech company and both insist they miss nothing from their former le. The -year-old said: There was a lot of toing and froing before we decided to go and live in the van, while we considered what other people might think, as we knew there would be a stigma around it. We know it is unorthodox. We live in a world where everyone is trying to keep up with the Joneses, but we are the makers of our own destiny and we thought, aposWhy shouldnapost we  It makes total senseapos.    Jane and Stephen, , now live just outside the isolated Highland town of Fort William in their house on wheels with their Husky dog, Goose. The van is furnished with a bed, sofa and cupboards, along with an oven and portable toilet which they can empty, Jane and Stephen insist they miss nothing from their former le. Jane said: At first it was more dficult, not having a shower unless we went to a local gym and not being able to put the heating on after a wet day. But more and more we have learned to adapt to le in the van and I feel like I have everything Iaposve ever needed. I live in a place with stunning views, I have my health and my loving partner, and the ability to fit my working le around what works for me. What more could you want     After meeting  years earlier through Janeaposs sister, Joanne, , an adviser for BT, when Stephen was in the Royal Marines, the couple had their first taste of living in a van when they went on a four-month road trip around Europe in a Citroen Relay in . Jane, who had been working remotely from home in the coupleaposs rented house in Dundee, Angus, said: Steve and I both have the travel bug in us and had planned to do this trip for a while. I handed in my notice to my boss, but to my surprise he turned around and said, aposWhy do you need to quit  You could just work on the road apos And so she did, working two or three days a week while travelling through France, Spain and Portugal, using a portable Wi-Fi router to keep connected with her colleagues in the UK. She added: Having that flexibility with work made me realise that this was something you could do, and you didnapost have to necessarily be shackled to one place. That was what really planted the seed for everything that was to come. Returning home in December , the couple moved to a £ per month rented house in Fort William in early  to be closer to the Highlands, where Stephen runs mountaineering excursions.  They married in November . But, despite both working full-time, they calculated that it would take years of saving in order to buy the home of their own that they so desired, after renting for years. Jane said: Mortgages and deposits cost so much and it became clear after we married that weaposd have to really tighten our beltswe wanted any chance of buying a house. Then it occurred to us both that we could get around the problem by going to live in a van. We had done it before on our trip in Europe and knew that it worked for us, so we thought, aposWhataposs stopping us from doing it again apos Packing up their belongings in April , they bought a -year-old van big enough to fit a double bed in for £,, and leaving conventional living behind them, they headed to the Highlands. Explaining the situation to her boss at Cloudbooking, a meeting room booking , Jane was able to continue working in the same capacity as marketing and communications manager, despite living in a home with no access to water, electricity or gas. She said: In the st century, it doesnapost always make sense for everyone to be based in the same place when itaposs just as easy for people to work remotely with all the technologies we have today. Iaposm very lucky to have a boss who understands that and who gets that employee wellbeing is the most important elementsomeone is going to do a job well.  Living entirely off-grid for the first nine months, the pair braved the northern winter by keeping warm using a wood burner, showering at local gyms and powering up with rechargeable batteries. They provided around a fortnight of electricity, before the couple had to charge them again at friendsapos houses. But when in February  they stopped off at a holiday park a mile outside Fort William and were then offered a more permanent location by the parkaposs owners for £ per month, they decided to stay put, giving them access to the siteaposs electricity and washing facilities. Based there for almost a year now, they have saved two thirds of their £, target, with which they plan to buy enough land in the Highlands to build a three-bedroom house from stone. Jane thinks it will take them another  months to save the remaining £,. She said: It isnapost something that we would have been able to do otherwise at all. A lot of our friends and family thought we were mad at first, but then when you actually explain to people why it is that we made the decision, they start to understand and accept it as being a rational choice. In the summer we will be going to France for a two-month holiday, something weaposd never have been able to doweaposd been skimping and saving in rented accommodation. You canapost spend your whole time saving up your money because le is short and itaposs there to be enjoyed.

We based it on the fact he was coming back from a serious injury and he had to go and play games. He has seen the benefit of that. For me, he is still our player.”McInnes is also delighted with the form of Anderson.“Wee Bruce is on fire.

The society board have now informed Dens financial director David Gray and their own members of the decision to hang on to all their shares.Given there’s no provision in society rules for the sale of any shares and their rejection of the original attempt to get their veto-holding shares, this latest move comes as no surprise, particularly as even an improved offer of £, for the ordinary shares was viewed as derisory by many members.Dundee are now likely to undertake a full share issue that would allow Keyes to break through the % barrier but is likely to entail administrative costs running into five figures."},{"url":null,"title":"dundee united confirm departure of laurie ellis","story":"Dundee United have confirmed former assistant boss Laurie Ellis’ departure from Tannadice.As the Tele revealed at the time, the former Raith Rovers stalwart was put on gardening leave back in January.United made no comment at the time but, in a statement today, announced the -year-old is no longer their employee.“As we continue to review all areas of the club and put in place our plans for the long-term vision we have for Dundee United, Laurie leaves with our thanks for his effort and commitment during his near-three seasons at Tannadice and our best wishes for his future coaching career,” said sporting director Tony Asghar.Ellis arrived at Tannadice as No  when Ray McKinnon was appointed manager in .He continued in that role under Csaba Laszo and for the first three-and-a-bit months of Robbie Neilson’s reign.“I am proud and honoured to have played a role at Dundee United,” he said today.“This is a fantastic club that has the potential to be in the Premiership and, while I wish that could have been achieved in my time here, I wish everyone at United all the best in their pursuit of promotion.“I now look forward to the next stage in my career.”Earlier this month reserve team manager Craig Easton and U  coach Scott Robertson were also stood down from their duties.To date, United have not commented on their situations."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/03/18763375-821x564.jpg ","title":"dundee united hope to have pawlett and connolly fit to take on alloa","story":"Dundee United boss Robbie Neilson is hopeful quick decisions to get injury doubts off in midweek will see two key men available for the clash with Alloa tomorrow.Peter Pawlett and Mark Connolly were both subbed early in the second half of Tuesday’s win over Ross County because of muscle tightness and Robbie revealed that was done with an eye on this weekend and beyond.“If you push them too hard you end up with tears and they could be out for the season.

This area of Argyll is the most fragile in the region. The people of Argyll, businesses and visitors deserve no less.Forget the squandering of £m on unreliable, mitigation measures trying to justy a flawed decision made many years ago to use the Old Military Road as a ersion which has failed on many occasions and now has a landslip between the two roads. Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less. In  at Dawlish .km of double tracked railway and .km of sturdy seawall was built at a cost of £m in eight weeks. Why have we in Argyll after nine years, four dferent Transport Ministers and £m spent and still have no guaranteed safe passage   on The Rest and Be Thankful Follow the Argyll Advertiser#s campaign #Invest in the Rest#. Transport Minister Michael Matheson, Transport Scotland and our Government must abandon their obsession with mitigation measures and fund a permanent solution. We demand no less.Sir,Calls for assurances that the Rest and Be Thankful section of the A will be improved to resist future landslides were made during a session of Transport, Infrastructure and Connectivity questions in the Scottish Parliament.I quizzed transport secretary Michael Matheson, about what was discussed at the last meeting of the A Taskforce in November , and asked what assurances the Cabinet Secretary could give to local residents and businesses who rely on the A being open at all times.The Rest and Be Thankful was closed off for nine days in October  following the largest landslide in a decade, forcing road users to either take a major ersion, or to use the Old Military Road during certain hours of the day.A number of petitions were created during the period of the incident, including one by myself, calling for a permanent solution to the Rest and Be Thankful.The transport secretary said that the meeting was #full and frank#, and that there would be a #review of the potential for additional landslide mitigation measures at the Rest and Be Thankful#, and that this would be discussed at the next A Taskforce meeting in March .There was also a commitment that Argyll and Bute would be #prioritised# in the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.I welcome the assurances by the transport secretary that there will be a review of any additional measures for the Rest and Be Thankful, and that Argyll and Bute will receive priority at the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.Donald Cameron, MSPReserve forcesSir,Last issue#sletter raising concerns about the UK government’s proposed use of the army’s reserve force in the event of a no-deal Brexit is timely.In case anyone out there still thinks a no-deal Brexit is a good idea it’s worth noting that the legal authorityof Reserve Forces Act  allowing the Secretary of State to take this step requires him to establish that it is necessary #for the alleviation of distress or the preservation of le or property in time of disaster or apprehended disaster#.Enough said.Frances Roberts, Ardrishaig"},{"url":null,"title":"honours even for red star in argyll derby","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Ropework played host to this keenly contested local derby which was watched by a healthy crowd on Saturday February .And for the second time this season, Red Star and Campbeltown Pupils shared the points in a match both sides will feel they could have won.Both sides were struggling for fluency in the opening stages but Red Star settled first and grabbed the opening goal after  minutes. A long ball to the right hand side was met by Ryan Caskie who cut the ball back to Stuart McLean. The youngster took a touch before slotting past the Pupils# goalkeeper to give Star a - lead.Star continued to press and doubled their lead when Coll McCallum robbed the Pupils# defender on the edge of the box before cutting the ball across goal. The unfortunate Pupils# defender could only ert the ball into the empty net, with McLean waiting on a tap in. The game continued at a frantic pace, however, there was no further scoring in the first half and Star went in with a - advantage.Pupils came out with purpose in the second half as they looked to force themselves back into the game, however, it was a howler from Red Star which allowed them back into the match.A square ball across the back resulted in a mix-up between Star keeper Luke Kalache and defender Ben Forbes which allowed Donald McCallum to prod the ball home from just inside the box and Pupils were back in the game at - with eight second half minutes gone.The home side didn’t recover from this and you could sense a nervousness that gave the visitors plenty encouragement. The equaliser arrived with  minutes remaining when good play from Pupils down the right by Soudan saw him get a low cross in which was met by the on-rushing run of Ryan Deans and he finished well to level the score at -.This set up a frantic finish and both sides could have nicked it towards the end. Pupils went close with a headed effort which was clawed to safety while at the other end there was a goalmouth scramble which Star couldn’t convert and both sides had to settle for a draw in the end as referee Jimmy Litster blew for full time.Red Star were dealt a blow as it emerged that captain Aaron Moore suffered a dislocated shoulder. Hopefully this will not keep him out for too long.On Saturday February , Star have another important home game as they look to move off the bottom of the table when they take on Claremont AFC.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a £, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as .

Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":null,"title":"eyesore burns house knocked down","story":"South Ayrshire Councils Burns House, Burns Statue Square.\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailEyesore Burns House is set to be torn down this upcoming year.

Mary McLelland was convicted of throwing the cleaning agent over a -year-old boy’s head and body in Auchinleck. Police objected to McLelland getting a personal licence at the council’s licensing board meeting heard last week, McLelland, , of Main Street, Auchinleck carried out the crime in November . Police Sergeant David Dougan told councillors McLelland was sentenced to a community payback order at Ayr Sherf Court last year as punishment. But McLelland said she was plagued by anti-social behaviour outside at her home in Main Street. She told the board: “I love kids. I regret it.” She claims she has had problems with people “chapping her door” and urinating in her garden. She rushed out to the nearby bus shelter during one incident, she told the meeting.. McLelland said: “I went out. It wasn’t even raw bleach. It is not an excuse. I shouldn’t have done it.” She claimed the bottle was kicked out of her hand and spilled over the victim. But the meeting heard McLelland pled guilty in court. The shop worker said: “I am not in the habit of going out and fighting with kids. “I am a -year-old woman.” She added: “Everybody in this le makes mistakes. Nobody in this world is perfect.” She told the meeting she had phoned the police numerous times to report anti-social behaviour at her property. Councillors adjourned the meeting to discuss whether she should be handed a licence. Ontheir opinion was split with three councillors voting to grant her application and the same number against. Board Chair Councillor Tom Cook had the ruling say and decided to grant McLelland’s licence.

The consultation and engagement exercise – approved by Councillors last year – gives tenants the chance to choose their preferred option for the long-term future of the flats: Refurbish  – this means the Council would keep the flats, decant tenants, carry out identied refurbishment works, and thentenants to their refurbished flats. Rehouse  – this means tenants would be rehoused permanently in suitable alternative accommodation and the flats would be demolished. Rebuild  – this means tenants would be decanted to temporary accommodation and the flats would be demolished before some tenantsto a new-build housing development on the Riverside Place site. The detailed consultation, which is based around inidual one-to-one meetings with more than  tenants, has been planned in conjunction with the River Ayr Tenants Association, which represents tenants in the three blocks. The Council has communicated regularly with tenants in the lead-up to the consultation to ensure they have all the information they need to take part. A further letter has now been distributed to homes in Riverside Place following queries and concerns raised by tenants regarding a letter sent to them by Fort, Seafield  Wallacetown Community Council. The community council’s letter appears to query the three consultation options being discussed with tenants and questions South Ayrshire Council’s interpretation of the expert report approved last year regarding the “essential and advisable” works required to the flats. Councillor Philip Saxton, South Ayrshire Council’s Portfolio Holder for Housing and Community Wellbeing, said: “We are committed to ensuring that our tenants are fully involved in the discussions about the future of their flats, which is why we’re taking such a detailed approach to this consultation. “It’s vital that tenants understand all the facts so they can form their own views about the option that is best for them. That is why we have gone back out to them to respond to the queries and confusion that have been generated by the community council’s letter. “We fully appreciate that the community council may have a view on the consultation, which is why colleagues are meeting with them next week and we’re happy to keep them informed about the consultation and engagement process. “However, our focus – which was clearly expressed by tenants at the recent River Ayr Tenants Association meeting – has to be on hearing the views of those who will be directly affected by Councillors’ decisions later this year: the tenants of Riverside Place. “We thank them for their participation in the consultation and I can reassure them that their views will be taken into account before any decisions are taken about the future of Riverside Place.” Joe Lafferty, Chair of the River Ayr Tenants Association, said: “We have worked closely with the Council over the last couple of years as discussions around the future of the flats have moved forward – and we very much appreciate the approach the Council has taken. “It is for every tenant to consider what is the best option for them and to ensure their voice is heard by those who will be making the decisions about what happens next. Clear facts, easy to understand information and answers to the questions tenants have is what’s needed and that’s exactly what we have got from the Council.”   Feedback from the consultation will be considered by Councillors in June this year.Full details of the Riverside Place consultation are available at  www.south-ayrshire.gov.uk riverside-place .

The Post can exclusively reveal that the developers McCarthy  Stone have thrown in the towel and withdrawn their multi-million pound proposals. Major question marks hang over the building’s future following the bombshell announcement. The news prompted an angry backlash from Derek Hart, chair of Prestwick North Community Council. In an extraordinary outburst he claimed the building has been “plundered and left to rot.” The building provided a retreat for children battling cancer for more than  years. It was opened by Princess Diana in . In  it was sold by owners Clic Sargent after claims of a “challenging fundraising environment”. They sold it to McCarthy  Stone and trousered £.m from the deal. However, since McCarthy  Stone took ownership and unveiled their luxury flat plans they have been embroiled in a bitter fight with neighbours Prestwick Golf Club. The club was opposed to the development on the basis of its scale and design. Other objections included the potential impact it would have had on their historic course and the surrounding conservation area. In addition, there were fears that errant balls could smash into residents’ properties. Plans involved building  flats for people aged over , spread out in a T-shape over four floors. Many would have had sea views and balconies. The proposals were approved by South Ayrshire Council but last year Prestwick Golf Club successfully petitioned for a judicial review, meaning demolition work on the former retreat had to stop. It was estimated that  jobs would be created between the construction phase and posts at the new development. Despite a PR charm offensive from McCarthy  Stone throughout the process and a public exhibition of plans at the  Club in Prestwick’s Main Street, the developers pulled the plug on the project. A spokesperson said: “Following a strategic review last year we are no longer pursuing any new developments within Scotland and have withdrawn our plans for Prestwick.” Derek Hart reckons the decision is a kick in the teeth for all the campaigners who fought to retain the presence of a sick children’s home in Prestwick. He told the Post: “I find this action taken by McCarthy  Stone not only deplorable but a slap in the face to the Save Malcolm Sargent House team who fought bravely to try to purchase it. “Is it not time for South Ayrshire Council to stop and listen to the community  “The community stated that the development would only feather the nests of McCarthy  Stone – and perhaps chemists –as the age group targeted by them were over  years. “There’s been very little input to Prestwick and we are now left with a building that has been plundered and left to rot. “Will we find the same response to the other end of the beach, at the old Gym, I wonder ”He added: “Time after time SAC have allowed developers to build as they wish with barely a challenge to the character ofthe town and how it should look.”The news will be viewed as a major victory for Prestwick Golf Club, who fought long and hard against the development. A statement by the club said: “While we welcome this news we hope that, should a new development proposal for the site be put forward in the future, the design and scale will be more sympathetic to the surrounding area.” The statement said the club was not against the principle of redeveloping the site but was “disappointed” at the scale and design of the proposed development. It added: “We believed that McCarthy  Stone hadn’t listened to the concerns raised by the club.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnPrincess DianaSouth Ayrshire CouncilRoyal FamilyPrestwickAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"shopper yelled get back your","story":"NewsShopper yelled \"Get back to your own country, you Iraqi b******\" to Ayr Lidl workerManus McGhee avoided jail after his foul mouth outburst at the store.ShareByAyrshire Post:,  MAR NewsThe outburst took place at Lidl in Ayr \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA man who was asked to leave Ayr’s Lidl store went back in to racially abuse a staff member, writes Edwin Lawrence.

Super-fit Fiona McBlane was , practised yoga and cycled and was in London lapping up a glamorous working le in the music industry for companies such as EMI and Smash Hits. But during a Christmas visit home to Ayrshire she fell unwell with leg, arm and head pain. Such was her distress she admitted herself to hospital. First the minor stroke hit - on January ,  - and then the searing biggie nine days later. It left her semi-paralysed in hospital for  months, unable to speak, hardly walking and retaining very limited brain capacity. That was when Clan McBlane rallied round to give her the best future they could. They had been advised the best place for her was an old folks home but they stood firm. Once Fiona was fit enough to leave hospital she was brought into the bosom of the family in Prestwick. Twelve years on at the age of , Fiona is battling away and has got to the stage where she has joined the gym at Prestwick Tennis Club. Her loving older sisters Gillian McBlane, , and -year-old Gaenor Hardy have just pounded round the Stroke Association’s Resolution Run with Gillian’s -year-old son Graham to continue raising money for the charity. That added £ to a total now of about £. Gillian, a top civil lawyer in Ayr, and Gaenor, headmistress at Heathfield Primary, assist their parents Jean and Ian who are Fiona’s full-time carers. And Gillian is helped by the other legal eagle in the family, Ayr criminal defence agent Steven Maxwell. Gillian said: “She loved her work and was a real high flier. “People were drawn to Fiona’s fun-loving nature and her great big heart. “Never for a minute did we think she would have a stroke. “At  years old she had lost everything she loved.” Fiona is prone to falling and choking, often passing out. Sometimes the enormity of what has happened becomes too much for her and she struggles emotionally. But Gillian said: “Our parents taught us to look for the positive things in le and not to feel sorry for ourselves. We spend time together and Fiona enjoys the company. “Despite the extent of her disability, she does brilliantly. “Doctors told us that her friends would eventually tail off but Fiona’s haven’t . They keep in contact with her and visit when they can. “People have shown us great kindness over the years in so many ways and this means a lot, helping us immensely. We don’t know what the future will hold for Fiona but we do know that whatever it is we will face it together.” There are , strokes in Scotland every year. Angela Macleod at the Stroke Association said: “Our latest research shows that by training and taking part in a Resolution Run you are helping to lower your stroke risk. “The funds raised by each runner means we can reach out to more stroke survivors and their families to offer the support that they may need to rebuild their lives.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnstrokeAyrAyr NewsPrestwickRunningCharity"},{"url":null,"title":"upper crust roost alloway","story":"NewsAn Upper Crust roost in AllowayAyrshire Post Property of the WeekShareByStephen Houston:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR News\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThere are few better places to bring up a family than the secluded suburban streets of Alloway.

Craig Galbraith worked well playing with, eventual man of the match, Calum Johnson for the first time.In the th minute there was a skirmish in the box after a corner, Johnson cleared the ball but it ricocheted off the incoming player into the net.The Glasgow students had more possession with the wind advantage. With  minutes left, a tremendous fingertip save, by Neil McMillan, pushed the ball over the bar.With four minutes left the away side put the game beyond #Dale#s reach when Matthew Lamont tried to clear a corner shot but unforunately scored an own goal.In high winds and driving rain the game fizzled out.Both sides had played well in the conditions and kept the ball on the deck in addition, referee, Archie Mitchell said it was an easy game to ref with no bad tackles.The match ball was sponsored by Wee Toon Sports and a Carradale spokesperson thanked Food for Thought for the post match hospitality.Tomorrow Carradale travels to Helensburgh for an early kick off at noon."},{"url":null,"title":"machrihanish bay is britains second best beach","story":"The bay, which is the beginning of the longest continuous stretch of sand in Argyll, extending all the way to Westport, was second only to Sandown Bay on the Isle of White in the BBC Countryfile Magazine Awards .After a long and detailed judging process to determine the shortlist for each category, the magazine#s readers and website visitors were given a month to vote for their favourites, with winners announced last week.The magazine#s editor, Fergus Collins, said: #Congratulations to each of the winners – and all the people and places who were shortlisted.#The aim of our awards is to celebrate the best of the British countryside and shine a light on lesser known places, projects and people who are doing great work.#Westport beach looking towards Machrihanish Bay. _cwestport"},{"url":null,"title":"down memory lane march 15 2019","story":"Peter Docherty, born and brought up in the Wee Toon, lives in a first floor flat, in Tangy Place tenement, at the end of the High Street, with a #marvellous# view of all the comings and goings on Campbeltown Loch.Back in , aged , he was an apprentice painter and decorator for a town firm, which he thinks might have been Galbraith and Cochrane.Mr Docherty#s son, also Peter, , talked to the Courier on Monday and said: #Dad told me that the young apprentices were always given the awkward, high up places to paint.#Back then this wall must have been under a ceiling as now the graffiti chipped into the plaster is at waist height.#Painters always used to leave their mark on a building, many will be painted over in people#s houses.#They often wonderedtheir #marks# would be uncovered in the future.#On this wall they could see the names of people who had painted it in the past.#When he saw Down Memory Lane last week dad said he was the only P Docherty in the town at the time.#Peter junior, who visits two to three times a year, said: #I was born in Craigard.

which the papers were presented this year which made alternative motions possible.However what did this year yield The main dferences in the budget came down to the administration of the council proposing £, more for winter gritting, outwith the A which is covered by the contract with BEAR.This was against cuts in the road safety unit, an award-winning safety programme for young children, a cut in youth and adult learning, a cut in environmental warden services, which means a focus on more fines but less time for fly tipping and dog fouling and a cut to music tuition in schools.There were amendments lodged by Councillor Donald Kelly and myself, the SNP group and councillors George Freeman and Jean Moffat.While gritting our roads is important Councillor Kelly and I, along with other council opposition groups, thought the other considerations were important to our communities which strangely enough is also supported by our corporate plan.Alas the gritting won the day.Full motions and votes can be found on the council website.However it was more disappointing that Councillor Kelly and I included in our motion a scheme to change funding due for Helensburgh and Dunoon.Just more than £ million would be moved to the regeneration project of Tarbert Lochgilphead Ardrishaig.This was defeated by the rest of the council which was particularly galling.Money for Helensburgh had been questioned by its community council which felt that too much had already been spent.The money for Dunoon was because of poor procurement processes and a general #I want syndrome#

Lauder, it is said, was the first place he stopped after fleeing from the Battle of Prestonpans.ldquoI suppose we kind of followed in his footsteps, said my friend, ldquoalthough in a very dferent way and totally dferent circumstances of course. Folk round here donrsquot really know the story, but coming from the Pans it gave us an immediate connection.The actual house on Lauder High Street that Johnnie Cope arrived at is now gone, replaced over  years ago. But Lauder must look much as it did on that fateful day when Cope arrived, with his horse close to collapse with exhaustion.Johnnie Cope was the general commanding the British Army at Prestonpans on that fateful day, September , . The battle was a major victory for the Jacobites. Cope fled the scene of battle, but only when it was clearly lost. He eventually arrived at Berwick-upon-Tweed to give news of his own defeat. Ever since, popular tradition has mocked Cope for running away and not standing his ground and dying lsquohonourablyrsquo, as Colonel Gardiner of Bankton House did.This ridicule was encapsulated in a traditional popular song, and the chorus remains well-known:Hey, Johnnie Cope, are ye wauking yet Or are your drums a-beating yet If ye were wauking I wad waitTae gang to the coals irsquo the morning.The song pokes fun at Cope and concludes with a harsh indictment:Now Johnnie, troth, ye were na blateTae come wirsquo news orsquo your ain defeat,And leave your men in sic a straitSae early in the morning.There are earlier versions with slightly dferent words, but the sentiment remains the same: Johnnie Cope ran away and should be ashamed of himself for leaving his men. However, he was later found to have done his duty, and this reputation deemed unfair. But mud sticks, especially when a catchy tune is added to it.This popular song is believed to have been written by Adam Skirving, a farmer at Garleton in East Lothian. There is a story that he visited the battle site a few hours after the fighting. Perhaps he spoke to some eyewitnesses who saw Cope flee up the road to Birsley Brae, and therefore got the idea for the song. The road Cope took as he fled from the battle has ever after been called Johnnie Copersquos Road.Lauder is a short journey from Prestonpansgoing by car. It had been a while since I had last ventured over Soutra Hill and into the border country and I enjoyed the drive despite the wild weather, or perhaps partly because of it.But what was Copersquos journey like as he galloped over Soutra Hill with some of his dragoons  He must have paused at the summit and cast a glance at the view over East Lothian and screwed his eyes to find Prestonpans. The panic and terror by this time would have given way to dferent feelings, I suspect.He rode more or less the same way I took to Lauder but it would have taken him much longer with very dferent emotions. His arrival in the town would have been a bewildering spectacle for the locals. He later continued his flight to Coldstream, which he reached by nightfall.All this was in my head as we headed home to Prestonpans from Lauder the next day. I could almost see the ghosts of Cope and his dragoons gallop past us as we ventured over Soutra.As we drove, I re-told the story to my kids and we sang the song in the car. They know the story and the chorus well, as we have many times ventured along Johnnie Cope Road on the way to the rail station.By the road is Bankton House, once the home of Colonel Gardiner, who did not run but stood his ground, and paid the ultimate price with brutal death.There is a small doorsquocot by the house, and inside you will find a free but almost secret visitor centre created with the support of the Battle of Prestonpans Heritage Trust.The doorsquocot can only be reached via a walkway through the wood from the rail station during the day, and inside lsquoAuld Archiersquo tells the tale of the battle, and the le and death of Colonel Gardiner. On the wall is a model map of how the area looked at the time of the battle, with the route taken by Johnnie Cope clearly marked.Itrsquos all fascinating stuff which had been unexpectedly brought to my mind by the visit to Lauder to see old friends.But it was the emotions rather than the events that I reflected on most.

regulation in the profession as an ldquoanomaly and has urged the Scottish Government to take action to ensure the title of electrician is protected in law.Over  professions are currently protected in law, including registered gas engineers, but not electricians.Mr Halcro Johnston said that he will introduce a membersrsquo bill to the Scottish Parliament aiming to address the issue.In a debate on the subject in October, MSPs from across the parties at Holyrood gave their support for providing protection of title.Mr Halcro Johnston said: ldquoFor too long, the Scottish Government has dithered around the regulation of electricians.ldquoIt has been discussed and discussed again, without any real commitments ever seeing the light of day.ldquoWhen I speak to people about this campaign, the first reaction is usually surprise that anyone can call themselves an electrician without any qualication.ldquoWhen so many other trades and professions are regulated, it seems the position of electricians is more of an anomaly than anything .ldquoMost people donrsquot consult electricians on a regular basis and arenrsquot always confident about the qualications of people they employ. This should provide some additional protection to consumers.ldquoElectrical safety is vitally important. Every year, there are fatalities caused by electric shocks and fires caused by electrical mals. It is important that people carrying out electrical work are qualied and able to do so.ldquoI was pleased to get so much support from across the political parties when this was debated back in October and I would hope that support would carry across to introducing a Bill on the subject.Skills Minister Jamie Hepburn said: ldquoThe serious concerns raised about electricians are being considered fully and we are committed to continuing to work in partnership with all stakeholders.ldquoDuring a debate in Parliament in October last year, I offered to meet with any MSPs to discuss these issues further. Whilst others have made contact, Mr Halcro Johnston has not taken up this offer.ldquoFollowing calls for further regulation, we formed the Electricians Working Group to bring the industry together and attempt to build consensus for a way forward.ldquoAn independent analysis of research, leading to a risk assessment and business case on the way forward, is due to be presented to the Scottish Government later in March."},{"url":null,"title":"we-are-f-says-official-report-on-impact-of-brexit-on-rural-scotland","story":"A document published by Scottish Rural Actionfeatured a side banner on page four with the statement.It was one of a number of banners attributed to participants in a workshop which asked them to imagine what newspaper headlines they might expect to see after Brexit.Amanda Burgauer, SRA chairwoman, said that the exercise had been used as an ldquoicebreaker and that several of the participants had used ldquoearthy language in describing their feelings towards Brexit.The comments are only explained on the following page, saying they had been put forward by those taking part in the workshop event.Ms Burgauer said that she would flag up the ldquodesign and layout issue with the SRA design team.The Scottish Government has said that although the SRA report was funded through its Brexit Stakeholder Fund, it had no editorial role.The report will be launched at an SRA event with cabinet secretaries Mike Russell and Richard Lochhead in Elgin on Monday.Its findings also detailed the potential impact of Brexit on rural Scotland, suggesting that it could lead to ldquost century clearances, with a loss of freedom of movement resulting in signicant depopulation.Further concerns raised in the report, taken from conversations with rural communities, also included the risk of EU funding being lost post-Brexit and potential damage to social cohesion.Speaking about the report overall, Ms Burgauer said: ldquoThis report is about giving voice to a rural point of view that is rooted in Scotlandrsquos people and places, rather than its rural industries.She added: ldquoThere is widespread anger and frustration across rural Scotland, but that anger isnrsquot solely about Brexit.ldquoIt was clear from workshop discussions that Brexit is compounding long standing concerns about rural equity and fragility.ldquoBrexit was described as the lsquostraw that breaks rural Scotlandrsquos backrsquo, with people pointing to structural fragilities across rural communities.ldquoParticipants generally believed that an historic over-reliance on EU funding to lsquoprop uprsquo rural areas makes rural Scotland particularly exposed to future loss of EU support.Speaking ahead of the reportrsquos launch, Constitutional Relations Secretary Mike Russell said: ldquoThe Scottish Government is committed to ensuring the voices of rural communities are heard and I commend Scottish Rural Action for the work it has done to achieve this.ldquoThe findings in this report are stark. Taking Scotland out of the EU against our will removes us from a market which is eight times bigger than the UK alone.ldquoRural communities are deeply worried about the impact of Brexit on their lives. From funding and trade to community le and the workforce, many believe the effects will be nothing short of catastrophic.ldquoThis is sadly yet another example of just how damaging Brexit will be for Scotland.A UK Government spokesman said: ldquoThriving rural areas with strong, sustainable economies and vibrant communities will continue to be a priority for the UK Government when we leave the EU.ldquoWe have committed to establishing a UK Shared Prosperity Fund, which will cover Scotland, to increase productivity in areas where the local economies are furthest behind.ldquoWe have also confirmed that we will maintain the same cash total in funds for farm support until the end of the Parliament."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgows-vegan-soul-food-kitchen-reviewed-by-ron-mackenna","story":"GlasgowLETrsquoS go out for Sunday dinner, I suggest, and to high fives all round we pile in thecar, cruise the motorway, park easily and almost skip down to a basement in Finnieston.

Well, not exactly like this I hope as, like a needle being scratched from a turntable, the opening notes of tonights meal are not the best. Somehow the sweet potato chips come out the kitchen looking tired, very dark and unappetisingly floppy. And they should be able to do chips. The plain-vanilla potato versions are not much better.That great mound of vibrantly yellow turmeric and pineapple sauerkraut is hugely acidic, pungently vinegary, and very tough. Isnrsquot real sauerkraut vegan anyway At this point Irsquove also got to confess to a squeamishness when it comes to all these fake-meat things that populate some vegan restaurant menus, yes probably too many sci-fi movies when I was young.But what is seitan  And was that really a wise choice for a name  Itrsquos wheat and gluten, it transpires. Raw cheese sauce  Itrsquos actually just nuts and juices ndash which to me sounds a damn sight less sinister than the official description which will easily stampede the non-vegan horses.Joanna Blythman reviews: Condita in EdinburghWalnut taco meat  Now, I actually have this in my raw Mexican bowl and after some peering and a cross table consultation with the chirpy waitress we come to the conclusion itrsquos just minced walnuts.Vegan mayo  This one genuinely gives me the shudders but, calm down dear, itrsquos apparently simply soya milk, lemon, salt and vinegar.Back to that raw Mexican bowl then  Great, actually. Fresh, crunchy, textured with what is essentially a mountain of crumbly walnut mash, flavoured with that mayo stuff, light, refreshing and I would definitely have it again.In fact, I positively skip out the place, though thatrsquos partly because theyrsquove turned the tinny ceiling music system over to a whole album of someone called Best Coast and it sounds like an Asbo Family are having a very annoying party in a flat right upstairs.OK, thatrsquos an age thing.

Flaws and all. So itrsquos no breakthrough.Soul Food Kitchen Sauchiehall StreetGlasgow  Menu: Itrsquos vegan, Jim, and just as we know it, seitan burgers, raw cheese and meat-free-mayos.

Atmosphere: Itrsquos a clean, crisp and relentlessly cheery basement made up reasonable successfully of a number of rooms with the added plus of slogans on the walls.  Price: Nothing here to stampede the horses, most mains came in at under a tenner.  Food: To this non-vegan itrsquos pretty good when not doing meat substitutes but the kitchen needs to be much sharper with simple things like side dishes and fresh bread.

This is where a society such as our own, which aspires to provide care and support to all of its citizens, regardless of their special needs is supposed to rise to the challenge.My -year-old niece, Ciara, who has Downrsquos Syndrome, was born with a cocktail of health challenges associated with this condition, including a hole in her heart. Predictably, and at ious stages of her mumrsquos pregnancy the only advice coming from some medical staff was an abortion. The expert care and attention of other nurses and doctors though saw Ciara through the first few dficult years of her le while the love and dedication of her parents and her older brothers and sisters saw her realise her full, human potential. She has blossomed into a beautul and gted young woman who loves Little Mix and Ed Sheeran and who has represented her school and her country at international swimming events.This is the point where I could quote you statistics about the increasing quality of le enjoyed by Downrsquos Syndrome people or about how, on average, they now have a higher le expectancy than before. This, though, would be to diminish the experiences of those whose Downrsquos has come with an assortment of other issues and where the outcomes havenrsquot been as happy. I can only talk about my familyrsquos experiences with Ciara which, from the beginning, have been almost unormly positive ones.The biggest threat to this, though, came quite recently and from an entirely unexpected direction: the Catholic secondary school in England where, during her first three years there, she had enjoyed a very supportive and rewarding educational experience. She made progress in Maths, Science and English but, most importantly, she was happy in a small circle of friends and was included socially.A change of headteacher saw this change drastically when he refused to consider her for entry into the upper school on the grounds that she couldnrsquot meet the entry criteria for sixth form in Maths and English. Appeals to the board of governors were met with the response that ldquofunding was the main issue. When it was discovered that ldquofunding would be provided by the local authority more obstacles were found to prevent her re-joining her friends at her local school of choice. Further, it was discovered that the so-called ldquoentry criteria was not being imposed on other students.Even after an Education and Health Care Plan review stated that she should be included at this school a number of obstacles have been put in her way which her family believe are clear attempts to humiliate Ciara and to sicken them: she must repeat previous years must leave at lunchtime on certain days and was then refused aafter the half-term break because a teaching assistant couldnrsquot be found. Following a legal letter from the local authority the school has now reluctantly agreed to let herbut she must not mix with her th year peers, even at lunchtimes.Parents of Downrsquos Syndrome children all over the UK will recognise several aspects of this story. They arise from a refusal to recognise them as fully human or as being somehow less than fully-deserving of our public services. When we allow a personrsquos basic human dignity to be so easily stripped away due to disability, ill health and old age none of us will eventually escape the natural consequences of this.During Downrsquos Syndrome Awareness weeks we all become sentimental on social media when photographs are posted of smiling, happy children surrounded by love and we duly pitch in with touching messages of support. Yet a curious dissonance exists here in our attitudes to people with Downrsquos Syndrome. Wersquore all happy to sign up to an agenda which supports their basic human rights to be treated equally and as fully human yet seem quite happy to have Downrsquos Syndrome effectively screened out of existence in our modern, inclusive and enlightened world.The charity Donrsquot Screen Us Out has highlighted government figures indicating that % of babies who are prenatally diagnosed with Downrsquos Syndrome are aborted.Based on the most recent figures for Downrsquos births, this is projected to result in a decline of % reported live births of babies with Downrsquos.According to the charity, ldquothese consequences would have a profound long-term effect on the population of the Downrsquos Syndrome community, and enable a kind of informal eugenics in which certain kinds of disabled people are effectively lsquoscreened outrsquo of the population before they are even born.This is not a debate about abortion, rather itrsquos one about who gets to decide what it means to be fully human and how much we erode the rights of those that society deems to be something less. If we can get to a situation where Downrsquos Syndrome is regarded as such an imposition on our nice, normal way of le that we are screening it out of existence then what are the care and spending implications for those Downrsquos Syndrome people who made it to birth  And once we start quantying the human value of these, our brothers and sisters, sons and daughters, then when do we start coming for the aged, infirm and handicapped on grounds of cost and convenience "},{"url":null,"title":"university-plea-to-scottish-government-over-pensions-black-hole","story":"A joint letter from Universities Scotland and the UCU lecturersrsquos union highlights ldquograve concerns following the proposed amendments to public sector pensions by the UK Treasury.The changes impact on the Scottish Teachersrsquo Pension Scheme used by universities north of the Border.The letter states: ldquoYou will know that our organisations have been raising with you and your colleagues our belief in the need for the Scottish Government to make investments additional to the Scottish Budget to support the success of higher education and its contribution to Scotlandrsquos progress.ldquoThe unfunded increase in pension costs faced by Scottish higher education institutions is very dficult to meet from a flat-cash budget settlement.ldquoWe are deeply concerned that this cost will impact detrimentally on students and staff in Scottish universities.The letter says universities have now received notication from the Scottish Public Pensions Agency that the employer contribution to the Scottish scheme will increase even more steeply than expected, rising from . per cent of salary to  per cent from  September this year.It goes on to call for the Scottish Government to use additional money from Westminster that is part of the UK-wide Budget process -

He has noted that department protocol says internal memos explaining charging decisions should not be released.During his confirmation hearing, Mr Barr said he would draft, after Mr Mueller turned in his report, a second one for the chairman and ranking members of the House and Senate Judiciary committees. But the regulations provide little guidance for what such a report would say.The Attorney General is required only to say the investigation has concluded and describe or explain any times when he or Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein decided an action Mr Mueller proposed ldquowas so inappropriate or unwarranted that it should not be pursued.In a letter Mr Barr sent on Friday to the four members of the two Judiciary committees, he said there were ldquono such instances.

We could subpoena Mueller and ask him in front of the committee what was in your final report.

So, it really is vital that we hear from as many people from our communities as possible to make sure we are investing in the right things in the right areas, to best support the current and future health and wellbeing of everyone across Aberdeenshire.”To request a facilitated session, paper copies of the resources or just to ask a question, please email integration@aberdeenshire.gov.ukdata-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Trump Internationals proposal which would also see a minimum of  leisure resort units created alongside community facilitiesincluding a town hall and gym, shops, offices and food and drink outlets\"  Trump’s Menie homes plan recommended for approval viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"crufts success for arnage pupil","story":"An Arnage School pupil is celebrating after taking part in the world#s biggest dog show for the first time.Nine-year-old Skye Smith qualied for Crufts in June  at Dundee Canine Club with her pet whippet, Marvin.Skye’s mum, Kelly, said everyone in the family was “over the moon” to have qualied.The family took Marvin down to the NEC in Birmingham to compete at this year’s Crufts competition, held from Thursday  to Sunday  March.Kelly said: “The place was so much bigger than we expected.”Once at Birmingham Skye and Marvin went on to compete in the YKC --year-old junior handling class against all other juniors that had qualied though out the year.Skye was delighted to come in second place.Kelly added: “At Crufts she had to handle Marvin in a big ring.“She has to keep Marvin between her and the judge at all times, has to know parts of the dog, what his job is as a dog and also has to do a show.“It was a massive achievement and amazing experience.“Skye said that coming second was the best feeling in the world and she hopes she can qualy again for next year.”Skye has been handling dogs since she was just six-years-old and she has been working towards handling at Crufts since then.She also took part in Scottish Junior Handler of the Year in February at Glasgow and came fourth.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.ellontimes webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Rachel Hall from Rothienorman, who was the recipient of a new kidney donated by a living donor\"  Rothienorman woman backs drive viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\"Skye currently trains twice a week with Birkenhills Ringcraft and Banff Moray and Nairn Canine Club."},{"url":null,"title":"disney on ice winners revealed","story":"The winners of our Disney on Ice family pass competition have been announced.The winners are as follows:Julie Young , Helen Gauld , Susan Marshall , Kareen Fraser , Carol Ross , Jillian Clelland , Eric Brechet , Gillian MacPhail , Dawn Campbelland Carol Hekelaar .All winners have been notied of their win by telephone.Congratulations and enjoy the show!data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.deesidepiper webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Trump Internationals proposal which would also see a minimum of  leisure resort units created alongside community facilitiesincluding a town hall and gym, shops, offices and food and drink outlets\"  Trump’s Menie homes plan recommended for approvalviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.deesidepiper webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Police Scotland have many tools available to deal with all sorts of ilegal activity - including off-road bikes.\"  Off-road dirt bikes illegal use of a local estate are to be the subject of increased police patrols. viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"DEES | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"DEES | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"gold star for alehousewells nursery","story":"Inspectors have praised Alehousewells School nursery for their inclusive ethos and welcoming environment.

We are now engaging with the treasury on the issue of revenue support for the sector, and any support she can give to that would be very welcome. In the meantime, we have the prospect of the Energy White Paper coming up. Will she use her office to ensure that the potential for marine renewable energy generation is fully recognised when that white paper comes to publication #Responding on behalf of the government the energy minister, Claire Perry MP, said: “I don’t want to pre-empt the white paper, but one of the things we will show in that is how the ongoing attempts to be technology neutral to try and work across the piece to generate low cost, low carbon and highly competitive technologies will be part of that. We remain interested in marine and tidal as the Rt. Hon. Gentleman knows. Of course we need to discuss with the Treasury any support mechanisms, but I do want to continue to engage with the sector on a long term basis.#Speaking after the exchange, Mr Carmichael added: “White papers outline government’s thinking on policy areas, and are a key stage in influencing decisions made by ministers. Getting something in the white paper on support for the wave and tidal energy would be a huge coup for the industry which is big in the Northern Isles.“The marine energy industry is an innovative area of research, with the potential to add even more to our ability to export renewable energy to mainland Scotland. If the minister is committed to what she said about the policy now being ‘technology neutral’ then marine renewables should get a fair chance to be heard.“With a little more understanding and investment from central government, I believe we will soon reach a point where this industry can support itself, and provide stable, well paid and skilled jobs for many in Orkney and Shetland.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

In the s, his predecessors in the conservative government then regarded our fishermen as expendable. It is beginning to look like this government has taken the same attitude towards our farmers.”Responding on behalf of the government parliamentary under-secretary of state for exiting the European Union, Chris Heaton-Harris MP, replied: “I disagree entirely. The tarf schedule is designed to protect every sector of the economy including agriculture. He then went on to talk about standards, and we are not dropping standards of what we expect in agricultural goods.”Speaking after the exchange, Mr Carmichael added: “The minister can disagree with me all he wants, but he can’t dismiss the views of our farmers and crofters. They know what they are talking about and have genuine concerns about whether food standards will be eroded as a result of cheaper imports. The government must start listening to the experts in this area, and the unions who work on their behalf otherwise we risk undermining an important part of our rural economy.“With only nine days left before we could find ourselves falling into a no deal scenario, the government have got to fix these tarf schedules before they do irreparable damage to our agriculture industry.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

However, Prospect has indicated that this would not be its members’ preferred option and it does not believe it would address their underlying pay issues.“As it stands the claim from the trade union remains a minimum of a double-digit increase effective from April , . A report compiled jointly between HIAL and Prospect on air traffic controller pay at non-HIAL airports found no evidence of a signicant pay dferential with other comparable airports.“At this point, it has not been possible to reach an agreement with the trade union on their pay dispute. Therefore, HIAL and Prospect have agreed to refer the matter to ACAS in a bid to resolve the matter.”However, David Avery, Prospect negotiations officer replied: #Members demands are reasonable and they need to be addressed. They are not seeking parity with Heathrow or Gatwick but other smaller airports.#“They have received a decade of below inflation pay rises while the rest of the industry, in response to a global shortage of controllers, has moved ahead. The company already struggles to recruit controllers and this is having an impact on services at some airports.“By asking for support from ACAS we hope to find a way forward in these talks. However ministers’ instructions to HIAL severely limit the companies negotiating position, so we also need to see these revoked.”As it stands, controllers at seven of HIAL’s eleven sites, including Kirkwall Airport, are due to take strike action on Friday, April .Industrial action short of a strike was also likely to start in April and continue through until August, and include instruction to work to rosters, refusal of non-medical extensions, an overtime ban, and withdrawal of goodwill.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

He set out that, between -, tourism numbers have increased by an impressive  per cent to almost , people with an estimated value of nearly £m.Mr McArthur warned that this success could not be taken for granted and presented its own challenges. As well as urging ministers to resolve the stand-off over RET and provide support for the replacement Orkney’s ageing internal ferry fleet, the Orkney MSP also repeated his call for Orkney’s world-class heritage sites to be backed by world-class infrastructure.Speaking after the debate, he said: #Tourism is one of the few sectors that touches almost every part of the country and it is one where Orkney has been punching above its weight over recent years.#With the natural assets we have and a lot of hard work by those involved in all aspects of the tourism sector locally, Orkney has seen visitor numbers and income increase signicantly over recent years. This success has brought awards and recognition, but it also brings with it challenges.#Everyone knows that Orkney’s reputation for quality requires the tourist experience to be managed carefully. This will involve taking pressure off key sites as well as making more of what Orkney has to offer.#It also needs Scottish Government to step up to the plate, not least when it comes to transport links. The long-overdue introduction of RET would help Orkney remain competitive as a destination, while replacement of the ageing internal ferry fleet is not only vital for the islands they serve but a means of encouraging visitors to explore more widely once they get here.“Ministers also have a role to play, through Historic Environment Scotland, in helping ensure that Orkney’s world-class heritage sites are supported by high-quality infrastructure. Local partners, including Destination Orkney and the Council, must be closely involved but investment through HES is crucial to making this happen.“There is good reason to believe that Orkney can continue playing to its strengths when it comes to tourism and there will be plenty of opportunities over the years ahead showcase our islands.  However, we cannot be complacent about what it will take to maintain and enhance Orkney’s reputation for good quality”.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The partial-asset value of Scottish natural capital was estimated to be £ billion –  per cent of the UK as a whole – in .The study found renewable energy is the fastest-growing natural resource consumed in Scotland, while oil and gas production has halved in less than two decades. Electricity generated from renewable sources was five times higher in  than at the turn of the millennium and now accounts for more than half of all the country’s energy production. Wind is the largest producer of electricity from renewable sources, overtaking hydropower as the main source of renewable energy in . It accounted for  per cent of the electricity generated from renewables up to .Oil and gas production has steadily fallen since , dropping  per cent in less than two decades. In , combined oil and gas production in Scotland was \u2028. million tonnes of oil equivalent, down from \u2028. million tonnes.The Scottish Natural Capital Accounts report said: “The benefits we receive from nature are predominantly hidden, partial or missing from the nation’s balance sheet.

But when the guy propping up the bar is Theresa May’s top Europe advisor, Olly Robbins – the architect of her strategy in Brussels and the ERG’s favourite hate figure – you should safely be able to draw your Brexit roadmap from it.When ITV reported a second-hand overheard conversation in a Brussels bar where Robbins described how MPs would end up being presented with the option of May’s Brexit deal or a long delay, it seemed to offer a key that would unlock the whole process of leaving the EU.After MPs voted against no-deal last week and for an extension to Article , events appeared to be following Robbins’ script perfectly. The Government had hoped to bring the deal back for a third vote this week, with the threat of ­staying in the EU for anywhere between nine and  months looming over Brexiteers, forcing them to fall into line. Personally, I admit to breathing a sigh of relief at the end of last week’s chaos, thinking that a plan was coming together.But nothing has been more corrosive over the past three years than the illusion of government ­control, and some forces are beyond even Robbins’ reckoning. The fact that his plan was so dramatically derailed this week means that a no-deal Brexit – always the legal default – could now happen by ­accident, unless there is an even ­bigger twist in the week ahead.Rather than taking back control, the events of the past week put May’s fate in the hands of either the EU, or pro-EU Tories who could oust her to defeat her Brexit vision.: No-deal Brexit would place food banks in ‘dangerous position’, warns Ian BlackfordNo one in Government predicted John Bercow’s intervention ­ruling out a third vote on the Brexit deal unless there was a signicant change in content or circumstances. That in itself is worrying – the convention that motions can’t be voted on twice in the parliamentary session isn’t an obscure one. No one needs more evidence that Downing Street is floundering, but there it is.His critics say Bercow’s intervention was an attempt to block Brexit and allow the second EU referendum he really wants, or at least rule out a no-deal scenario. By ruling out a vote before yesterday’s EU Council summit, the ­Commons Speaker certainly denied the ­Government its best chance of ­getting the deal through.Bercow’s statement forced the EU Commission’s chief Brexit ­negotiator Michel Barnier to come out the following day and say a long extension needed a “clear purpose”. It also gave time for ­Brexiteers in the Cabinet to ambush May and force her to take a request for a long extension off the table.The spectre aimed at scaring Brexiteers was vanquished, ­leaving opposition MPs as the only pool of votes to pass the deal. May’s extraordinary statement in Downing Street, shting the blame onto parliament, burnt that bridge, too.With ious extension plans being discussed during intense talks in Brussels last night, EU leaders appear to have come to the conclusion that May, and her deal, are finished.If she isn’t in control, to avoid a no-deal Brexit the UK is now in the hands of two groups: Remainers in the Cabinet, and the  governments of the EU.A group of pro-EU Cabinet ­ministers have insisted they would do whatever it takes to stop no-deal. They may now have the time to show they mean it.Both Barnier and French president Emmanuel Macron have said there is a way back,the UK is ready for “deep political change”.This could be a general election or a second EU referendum, but what the EU really wants to hear is that the red lines that have made a deal so dficultare going to be jettisoned, either by May, or her successor.The Remain group in Cabinet includes Scottish Secretary David Mundell, who joined Amber Rudd, Greg Clarke and David Gauke in breaking a three-line whip to abstain on a motion to extend Article  last week. With so little time left, resignation isn’t enough. They would have to become the ‘men and women in grey suits’, insisting the Prime Minister abandons her red lines, or ushering her out of ­Downing Street.The likes of David Lidington would need to lead a government of national unity in all but name, getting a Brexit deal through with Labour and SNP votes that keeps the UK in the single market and customs union. It would likely mean the end of the Conservative Party as we know it at the very least, it would leave it to the next Tory leader to put its surviving pieces back together.: Jeremy Corbyn won’t rule out stopping Brexit as PM arrives in BrusselsEven in Brexit Britain, a week can’t possibly hold that much drama, but a longer extension offers the opportunity.Still, EU leaders can’t give the UK something it isn’t prepared to ask for itself. Conservative MPs lost the chance to push May from office when they failed to do the job before Christmas. The UK’s venerable ­parliamentary democracy has shown itself not to be nimble enough for the last-minute pivot needed, and evenit could, its leaders command too little confidence to bring the public along with them.In EU capitals, an election or a new EU referendum looks like a leap into more uncertainty, which the ­continent scarcely needs. Leaders and officials gathered in Brussels spoke openly about the “crisis” in the UK, and don’t want their fragile politics infected by the febrile mood around Westminster.A no deal Brexit could still happen by accident. The only thing that’s certain is that Bercow and the EU have called time on Robbins’ pub blueprint.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"why scotland s roads aren t ready for electric scooters alastair dalton","story":"Electric scooters are common in parts of Europe and the US and the UK Government is considering whether to allow them on British roads. Alastair Dalton explains why that would be a mistake.They offer a potentially attractive new way of getting about – but also threaten chaos on Scotland’s car-centric road networks.Electric scooters are commonplace in some European countries and US states, and the UK Government is now considering whether to allow them here too.Ministers announced this week they will “consider options for appropriate testing regimes to ensure any such vehicles on the road are safe and fit for purpose”, which could be followed by localised trials.On the face of it, being able to hop on and effortlessly zip about our towns and cities has obvious appeal – especially to non-cyclists.It is hardly “active travel”, like walking and cycling, but could encourage some to switch from cars or taxis on short journeys.Anything electrically powered, which has no emissions on the street, also has to be a positive as part of efforts to cut urban air pollution.However, letting loose a new form of transport on roads still woefully unsuited for cycles could just make things worse for everyone.That’s not to say there’s not a case for them – but the radical redrawing of road space away from the car should be accelerated first.The brave would take their chances scooting among other traffic, though many are likely to be deterred from sharing roads with lorries, buses and taxis, let alone the cars who already pass cyclists intimidatingly close.: Electric scooters on British roads would create ‘dangerous cocktail’There’s also the small matter of scooters’ in wheels not being pothole friendly, causing discomfortnot danger, as shared transport group Comouk has highlighted.Most who scoot are likely to want to stick to the relative safety of pavements and cycle lanes –that is permitted. But here, a dferent risk is created, of scooters colliding with pedestrians.There are far too few cycle lanes they could use, on roads or pavements, and even fewer segregated lanes, albeit cities like Glasgow are adding more.In addition, there is already potential conflict between walkers and cyclists on shared paths, some of which would struggle to cope with more riders, let alone scooters too.Another concern is street clutter. Recent visitors to Berlin and Brussels tell me of large numbers of scooters strewn across pavements.Technology may now enable scooters to be left “dockless”, but this has caused a big problem in places like San Diego.It’s bad enough trying to negotiate pavements already littered with advertising A-boards, so this could cause another hazard.Karen Millhouse, a resident of the Calornian city, emailed me this week: “I think we have more than , dockless scooters in our fair city, and they just keep coming. It is a nightmare, especially for pedestrians and the disabled.”She said Disability Rights Calornia had even filed a class action against scooters blocking pavements.: Alastair Dalton: The ‘electric-bike smile’ is now officialA better plan for Scotland – and the UK – would be to focus on electric bikes first. The main rental schemes in Edinburgh and Glasgow are due to add them later this year, along with other parts of Scotland such as Stirling.Electric bikes are equally effortless to ride, but unlike scooters provide nearly as much exercise as traditional cycling, so have much more to commend them.They also encourage people to cycle further, and have a similar topspeed – mph – as has been proposed for scooters.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"brexit how the flextension deal was reached and what happens now","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...EU leaders stepped in to tell Theresa May what would happenher own MPs voted against her Brexit deal, explains Paris Gourtsoyannis. But what happens next is still up in the airThe UK may have just taken part in its last EU Council summit, and the symbolism was inflicted on the British press pack. Its usual seats at the heart of the summit press hall were snapped up by Chinese journalists in Brussels as Xi Jinping tours Europe. The EU wanted to talk about its bright future - those writing about the awkward present were shunted into a hot, stuffy side room.Right up to the moment Theresa May sat down to ask them for a Brexit extension, EU leaders had talked tough: any delay would have conditions, and would be final. Take it or leave it - we’re washing our hands.But during a  minute grilling, the Prime Minister failed to convince them she had any clear plan of what to doher deal was voted down by MPs again next week. So EU leaders stepped in and wrote one for her.: Brexit: Theresa May’s ‘job on the line’ as Tories lose patienceThe EU took another five hours to hammer out the ‘flextension’ agreed late on Thursday night, with leaders tearing up their own proposal and getting stuck into the drafting of a new one. In the back and forth, several dferent suggestions leaked out over the course of the evening.In the end, it was Brexit that pushed China off the agenda, with talks over dinner replaced by more wrangling about Article . May had been due to eat with fellow leaders instead, summit organisers offered to send the menu of lentil and langoustine terrine and roasted duckling over for her to eat alone.The UK’s future was set without its Prime Minister in the room, not because EU bureaucrats wanted it that way, but because its own government offered no alternative.A no deal Brexit remains a strong possibility, and the EU has designed a scheme that seeks to leave it out of the blame game that would follow. It gives pro-EU forces in parliament two extra weeks to mobilise, and left the door open to a long delaythey can agree on a clear alternative to the Prime Minister’s deal.One of the most signicant things to emerge overnight was how open EU Council President Donald Tusk was about his desire to see the UK change its mind on Brexit.“I am very satisfied, especially that we still have so many options open,” he said in a midnight press conference, adding with a smile: “You know what my personal view is on this.” He later went even further in a briefing with Polish media, saying he wanted the UK to “consider all possible options” - which include revoking Article .The question now is what parliament does with its two week window. Next week, MPs will mount yet another bid to take control of the order paper, so that they can finally vote on alternatives to the government’s Brexit deal. A softer exit inside the single market and customs union, and a second EU referendum are likely to feature. The government will try to bring back its deal, but few have any expectation it will succeed.Meanwhile at Westminster, calls from her own party for the Prime Minister to step aside continue to grow.

There were reports that  pro-EU ministers, including Scottish Secretary David Mundell, were prepared to quit“indicative votes” are not held.MPs were expected to try and force a series of votes on Brexit alternatives next week, but two ministers said they expected the government to offer Parliament a say.And in meetings with opposition figures including the SNP’s Westminster leader Ian Blackford, the Prime Minister’s deputy, Cabinet Office minister David Lidington, is understood to have set out plans for votes on up to seven dferent options for Brexit. Mrs May agreed an extension to Article  of at least two weeks in late-night talks in Brussels on Thursday, opening the door for MPs to demand a change of course.Brexit minister Kwasi Kwarteng said he would “be surprised”the government did not allow MPs a free voteindicative votes are brought forward. And the Business Secretary Greg Clarke said the government would “facilitate” votes to allow “Parliament to express a majority of what it would approve”.Former Brexit minister Steve Baker said indicative votes meant “national humiliation is imminent”, while fellow Tory Brexiteer Mark Francois said: “If there is no government position on any of those issues about the future of our country, then there isn’t really a government.”Tory MP Nick Boles, who quit his local party to avoid probable deselection over his campaign for a soft Brexit, suggested colleagues should ignore the government’s orders about how to votethey were “not in the national interest”.There were reports that the chairman of the backbench  Committee, Sir Graham Brady, visited Mrs May in No  on Monday to warn of growing discontent after being “bombarded” with texts from MPs calling for her to quit.Downing Street would not be drawn on when the Prime Minister intends to bring her deal back to the Commons for a third vote next week.The DUP appeared to end any hopes of the deal passing in a damning statement from the party’s Westminster leader, Nigel Dodds, who said Mrs May had been “far too willing to capitulate before securing the necessary changes which would get an agreement through the House of Commons”. He said: “The Prime Minister missed an opportunity at the EU Council to put forward proposals which could have improved the prospects of an acceptable withdrawal agreement. That failure is all the more inexcusable given the clear isions which became evident amongst EU member states when faced with outcomes they don’t like.”Having agreed an extension that leaves the door open to the UK staying in the EU for longer, European leaders warned they were still prepared to let the UK crash out without a deal. French president Emmanuel Macron said the EU will “not remain hostage to Brexit”. He also renewed attacks on Brexit campaigners, saying: “They told the people, ‘It’ll be easy, it’ll be quick! There were a lot of lies.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"royal mile treasure trove of mary queen of scots documents found","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...A treasure trove of documents signed by Mary Queen of Scots and revealing the #everyday reality of ruling the country# in the th century has been unearthed in a council storage facility on the Royal Mile.A haul of handwritten papers is said to show the doomed monarch “carefully managing the busy commercial le of Edinburgh”, as well as authorising the building of new defences for the city in Leith.The documents, which are set to be the centrepiece of a new exhibition in Edinburgh on Mary’s short-lived rule, have already been conserved and digitised to allow them to be viewed publicly on the council’s online archive. They were discovered by staff in a store at the Museum of Edinburgh, just a few hundred yards away from the Palace of Holyroodhouse, where Mary ruled for six years after ing from France in . The  documents, which are inidually dated, numbered and signed, relate to the rights of deacons and tradesmen in the city, the selling of meat at the Tolbooth and the making of salt in Newhaven.Early conservation work on the documents, which were recently discovered in the Museum of Edinburgh’s own storage facility off the Canongate, has revealed watermarks – one of a goat and another of a flower – which can only been seen when held up to light.It is thought the papers entered the archives of the local authority in the s, but were then “lost” before being rediscovered nearly a century later during conservation work. Intriguingly, some of the documents signed by Mary date from when she was still in France.Experts in the council’s museums and galleries service, which is responsible for the official archives of the city, said the recently unearthed documents revealed an “often overlooked “ aspect of her le.History curator Vicky Garrington said: “Together, the documents shed light on a key part of Scotland’s past. We all know the tragic story of Mary Queen of Scots, her eventful le and eventual execution in , but in these documents we see a dferent side to Mary.“Here, she can be seen carefully managing the everyday affairs of Edinburgh, both from France and Scotland. It’s fascinating to think of her reading through these official papers before carefully applying her signature.“They are staying in storage at the museum for now. But we hope to have them assessed by a conservator and for further research to be done on them by experts on Mary, after which we hope to exhibit them, which will be hugely exciting.”Museums and galleries manager Frank Little said: “We’re constantly reviewing, caring for and researching our collections, and look forward to sharing more of the city’s rich heritage with residents and visitors through our programme of exhibitions and online activities.” Council culture convener Donald Wilson said: “Our museums and galleries hold thousands of historic treasures, many of which are on display in our venues.

I don’t think the Prime Minister is prepared to do that.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"first look at the jarls squad","story":"Plenty of onlookers were already on the streets as the squad made its first procession of the day from Islesburgh Community Centre, past the galley shed on St Sunniva Street and on to the Toll Clock Shopping Centre.In the gloom, the ranks of the Jarl#s Squad looked the part wearing emerald green kirtles with dragon mots underneath simple brown leather breastplates embossed with the same mot.

They then went on to highlight some of the key tenets underpinning the debate such as trade agreements, law and immigration, before making their concluding statements.In the opening gambit for the pro-Brexit team, S pupil Abbi Morgan argued that leaving the EU #would be a hugely positive thing for the UK# and would allow the country to #take control of borders and create worldwide trade agreements#.She went on to add that it would put the UK in a position to #take back its sovereignty# and make its own decisions on important matters. She stated that as a net contributor to the EU, the UK would be better off by £. billion.In the opening address for the pro-EU team, Lois Langlandssaid that #history and past experience as a member of the EU# gave the UK a more secure position for the future and that, in leaving the European Union, the UK would #enter the unknown# and #walk into the future blindfolded#.She said that outside the EU the UK was a #small fish in a big pond# and asked why any country would be interested in providing a free trade agreement with the UK.#The EU as an organisation is extremely wasteful#, he said. #Every  days the European Parliament moves from Brussels to Strasbourg, where it sits for four days # this is estimated to cost nearly £ million a year.#Touching on the issues of freedom of movement as part of the remain team, Chiara MacLeansaid: #Once the UK leaves the EU, British citizens will become third-party nationals, with no automatic right of admission.# She added that, through the new European travel information and authorisation system, all UK nationals over  years of age #would have to pay money to go somewhere they had a free right to go now#.Seth Bennettook up the reins for the pro-Brexit side, arguing that in terms of laws and immigration the EU could pass any laws they wanted and in by doing so #strip Britain of its sovereignty# # which he described as #one of its driving forces#.He believed that Brexit would offer the UK the chance to #increase its spending in education and housing# which could perhaps lead to a #revival of the nation#s once-thriving industries#.Speaking for the pro-EU team, Gracie Buchan said that leaving the European Union would lead to a trade deficit and result in a shortage of daily supplies such as fruit and vegetables.#Keeping food shop shelves full and prices down will be one of the biggest challenges when Brexit comes around,# she said. #Failure to reach some sort of an agreement could see retailers face an average increase of  per cent, particularly in dairy, meat, veg, and fruit.#Closing for the Brexit side, S pupil Joseph Moller said the EU favoured its own agenda and that in terms of per head of population Maltese citizens had  times more representation than UK nationals.He added that, rather than the , jobs that were cited as potentially being lost due to Brexit, the level of employment had in fact risen by one per cent since the referendum and unemployment was at its lowest level since the s.Summing up for remain, S pupil Innes MacNeil said: #Latest reports suggest that deals have been struck with just seven out of  countries, we have gained a lot more than we have spent on the EU, and multinational companies are threatening to relocate overseas, affecting jobs and investments.#Exiting in less than  days# time without any sound withdrawal agreement and just a few trade relationships will result in uncertainty and chaos.#The judges said they were impressed by how confident and informed the pupils were. They also felt the pupils were cohesive as a team and said that they saw some future MSPs and MPs.In the end, the judges awarded the team speaking against Brexit  points while the side advocating Brexit received  to claim victory.Skye, Lochaber, and Badenoch MSP Kate Forbes and Highland and Islands MSP Edward Mountain both fielded questions on Brexit after the debate and were quick to praise the pupils for their efforts.Ms Forbes said: #I certainly think they could have resolved Brexit faster than some of the politicians today # an absolutely fantastic debate based on fact, evidence, respect for each other, lots of confidence. I think I have left with a few top tips for my next debate in parliament!#Mr Mountain added: #I thought it was quite excellent # there#s obviously a lot of research gone into it.

Since then emergency repairs have been undertaken as the building had been unoccupied for a number of years following the deaths of Jim and Sally Gillen, Gracehill’s last postmasters. Happily, a full scheme of restoration is now underway. The first phase will see the building of new chimneys, the replacement of the roof and rainwater goods and repairs to the windows. The building is historically very signicant as it was a purpose built shop constructed for the Settlement in . It is two storey with attics and basement and the layout is much as it was when originally constructed. The central shop area still contains many original features including shelving built into the walls, counters and a large wooden winch wheel for drawing stores up to the attic. Speaking about the restoration David Johnston, chairman of the Trust said: The aim is to restore this unique building so visitors can once again experience what le might have been like in the nineteenth century. “Holiday accommodation with a period theme will also be provided and a tea room will complete the scheme to ensure the future of this wonderful and historic building and hopefully the roof will be good for another  years!

From pizza to pasta, Italian food is right up there with so many people’s tastebuds.As a lover of all things Italian, I was hugely excited when the Balmoral Hotel recently started their ‘Italian Night’, available every Tuesday night from -pm. I am no stranger to the thriving Black’s Road establishment and given the quality of food available in the Lady Anne Bistro and the conjoining Stix # Stones, the special-themed night attracted me to pay a visit once again to the Balmoral last Tuesday night.As ever, we were greeted by a polite and accommodating member of staff on arrival and shown to our table. I was immediately drawn by the décor – a number of Italian flags scattered around the restaurant and a huge blazing fire which was the perfect welcoming as Storm Gareth continued to rage outside.The themed-menu consists of a range of dishes sought to bring out the authentic taste of Italy and I couldn’t wait to peruse my choices. From pizzas to lasagne and pasta, there looked to be something for everyone, with gluten-free options also available.Before we had made our choice, we were presented with a large plate of Italian antipasti – basically a mixture of famous Italian nibbles. Much to my surprise, this is a complimentary touch from the Balmoral on the Italian night, designed to delve you into the full authentic Italian experience straight away.I gazed excitedly at my partner across the table. Where would we start  There were sticks of garlic bread, doughballs, pepperoni, olives and a pasta salad. Add in some jalapenos, peppers with a mouth-watering vinaigrette and mozzarella, it was a sublime clash of flavours which made me feel right in… well Italy! It reminded me much like a version of Spanish Tapas or Chinese Dim Sum which allows for iety and quantity of dferent options. With quality too, the night was off to a flyer with this beautul antipasti starter.On to the main course and after the wonderful starter, me and my partner could not wait for it to arrive. We both went for pizza, and to be honest it would be hard not to given the mouth-watering choices on the menu. A superb handcrafted gourmet pizza range, inidually designed with the finest ingredients for your own authentic taste of Italy – it was simply a no-brainer.After much deliberation, I opted for the BBQ Pizza, which consisted of a BBQ sauce base, mozzarella, chorizo, peri-peri chicken, jalapenos, onions and sweetcorn. Drizzled with just amount the peri-peri sauce, it was a concoction of flavours. A thin-base is always a must for me in order to properly enjoy what is actually on the pizza, instead of having to chew excessive amounts of pizza dough and again this pizza ticked all the right boxes. A BBQ-base and chicken on a pizza is nothing out of the ordinary on a pizza menu but this one was unique, given the intense flavour from the peri-peri sauce. This pizza would put some “Italian” pizza takeaways to shame, quite frankly. It was that good.Across the table, my partner, who is a vegetarian is no stranger to a good old pizza, after all it is entirely possible to enjoy the classic Italian dish without any meat at all. The menu includes a fantastic make-your-own option from an ingredient list with everything you can think of on it, allowing you to be as adventurous as you like. She went for a classic tomato base complete with mozzarella and a generous helping of sweetcorn, peppers and jalapenos. The pizza looked like a veggie’s delight and again it could not be faulted. Not too heavy on the stomach and full of flavour, it was little surprise she deliberately wanted to keep a few slices to take home.The pizzas also allow for additional sides, and it wouldn’t be an Italian night without some Garlic Bread. I simply adore anything garlic and this was what garlic bread should be like – oozing with garlic butter as it was torn apart, you could tell it was handcrafted and homemade to perfection. Our additional side of garlic potatoes also trumped the other side options of skinny fries or a tossed salad. It was a carbs heaven evening overall but worth it for the quality and taste of the food we enjoyed.A packed Tuesday night in the Lady Anne Bistro could only mean other diners, like ourselves, were enjoying the authentic Italian-themed menu on offer. It was something very unique and to their credit, the wonderful team of chefs and staff at the Balmoral are pulling it off to perfection. Most of the pizzas are priced around the £ mark which is more than worth it, just think how expensive it can be to order a takeaway from some well-known establishments. The Balmoral Hotel is excelling and the Italian-themed night is just the latest incentive to what is a fantastic establishment.

The Glen Road man’s first job was as a compositor printer with Pitman’s University Press. However, during these early working days, he undertook voluntary youth work within the greater West Belfast area and soon realised that this was where his future lay. Eventually Pat left Belfast for Leicester University where he achieved his degree in youth and social care, following this up with a Master’s degree from the Ulster University. Pat eventually became a youth worker in charge at St Michael’s Youth Club, Finaghy Road North, where he spent many happy years. During this time, Pat managed a number of the youth football teams, with home games being played at Woodlands playing fields. Pat’s brothers commented that to say he was “vocerous” in his coaching would be an “understatement”. “In fact the story goes that at this time, house prices in Orchardville depreciated by  per cent!”At a time when West Belfast was often in turmoil, the youth club was a haven for young people a place where parents knew their children would be safe. Pat took this onboard and enabled the young people in his care to reach their full potential. Pat developed an insatiable love for sport from a very early age. He joined Davitt’s GAC for a short time before transferring to St Agnes’ where he spent many happy years as both a player and manager. In the course of his time with the ‘Aggies’ Pat, along with many of the players, made those never to be forgotten trips to the continent and of course Shannon events that proved to be hugely enjoyable and deeply spitural ventures. A serious arm break when he was  curtailed Pat’s playing career but he had much success in his managerial roles. Pat, affectionately known as Butsy, also loved soccer and had a long and enjoyable time playing for and supporting Dominic Savio. During the ’s, Pat embraced the basketball scene and in particular St Gall’s basketball club. Pat was committed totally to this new undertaking. In fact, his brother Gerard remembers ing back to Denewood one day and discovering a very large American making himself a cup of tea. Of course Pat had not told Gerard that ‘Soupy’ Campbell would be staying for a few days – a bit of a shock. As a commentator and administrator Pat gave  per cent to this new venture. His famous commentary during lives games in the Andersonstown Leisure Centre is still talked about.On the sporting front, Pat finally finished up as a member of Falls Bowling Club where he spent many happy years as a player, administrator and advisor to the long suffering groundsman. Pat eventually became the club president, something of which he was particular proud of. He also became president of the private greens – a role which again Pat embraced with diligence and total commitment. A spokesperson for Falls Bowling Club described Pat, their th President, as someone with a personality that “could fill the Waterfront Hall”. “His passing has left a gap that we will not attempt to fill.”Married to Shelia since August  , Pat lived le to the full, had a hugely positive influence on many and ultimately made a dference. He will be sorely missed by all who knew him."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"history man joes lifetime in community","story":"HAVING been involved in community development for the best part of three decades, Joe Baker is a familiar face to many in North Belfast, but he is probably most recognised as one of the city’s leading resident historians.Joe has been involved with the Ashton Community Trust virtually since its inception in the early-s and now sits on its board. It was also during that time that he became involved in the Belfast History Project.Throughout his career, Joe has written, and published, books, magazines and newspaper articles for a range of media outlets during his career but, unlike some historians, his expertise grew outside the confines of traditional academia.By his own admission, he didn’t do too well at school, often “forgetting” to get off the bus at the gate. However, after ing to education at the Belfast College of Business Studies in the late s, he enrolled in history classes, which he would go on to utilise with the fledgling Belfast History Project.“I came back from college and started to get people involved in learning about the history of the area,” he explained.“From that, we discussed a number of dferent ideas. One idea we had worked on before that was cleaning up Clton Street Cemetery – which was where we used to drink our cider. It was all overgrown and wrecked at the time, but we all got together to fix it up. We tied in with people like Enterprise Ulster, and then Belfast City Council took it over and a number of volunteers came on board. Through that we developed this interest in local history.“Once the ball started rolling that was it. We started doing dferent educational projects. One of the things we started to discuss was putting a magazine together, which sounds very easy, but at that time there was this new thing coming out called a computer that you had to learn to use. Then you had to learn the computer programmes, which in those days was Pagemaker. Then you had to learn about printing and all the rest of it. Once we go up and running everything just fell into place.”The Belfast History Project has been exemplary in its endeavours, setting up groundbreaking publications and establishing history tours in long-unexplored areas of the city.“One of the good things is that when you look in Belfast city centre now and you see all the tours done here and there – blue badge this, white badge that – we get to look at it and say we did it first,” said Joe with a smile.“We did a walking tour in the Half Bap area and one of the very first tours was cancelled because of a bomb scare – not many tour operators can claim that.”The end of the conflict has ushered in a new age of competition as ious operators compete to sell tours of the ever-developing city of Belfast. While Joe believes the growing interest in local history is “brilliant” he insists branding and profits have often got in the way of fact.“People are trying to put these brands on things,” he said.“At my last count Belfast has nine-quarters. When I was at school,I was asked how many quarters there were andI had said nine I know what would’ve happened.“There is a lot of  stuff like this Tribeca development, which is a lot of nonsense.“They should do the names to reflect the history of the area. It annoys me when people try to put a  history on an area or say things that just aren’t true. We’ve always argued thatyou’re going to do history you should tell the truth. I love to see the tourism industry grow and change, but as long as they stick to a principle of truth.”Having started as a small local initiative, the Belfast History Project has flourished over the years, and now provides tours all over Europe, with their Russian tours booked up for nearly two years in advance. However, with all of its wider triumphs, the Belfast History Project remains a social enterprise, whose key aim is to give back to the community. Local tours and events still run regularly, such as the highly successful historical photographic exhibiton, which recently appeared in the New Lodge – and, as Joe explained, “It’s all about education”.“If we get people into history we can get them into education and guide them along their own path,” he said.“For example, we had a group of kids studying the history of the New Lodge, which grew to Belfast, Ireland and then Europe. They might be kids at the time, and they’ll mess about, but about tenyears later they’ll come back to us and say ‘That was the best project I was ever part of’ and that gives us a buzz.”Joe continued: “I remember years ago that the Barrack area in the New Lodge was just called the Barrack, but younger people didn’t know why it was called that. If you ask them now they’ll tell you it’s because there used to be an army barracks there.“Whenever you do a photographic exhibition and people are learning about their own area, then that’s the start of an educational journey.“As we always say, there is no more fruitful form of education than to raise the interest of people in their own surroundings.“Once you do that it can open up countless other opportunities.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"priceless 1916 artefacts to go on show at opening of new james","story":"AN ORIGINAL  Proclamation along with the printing blocks used to create the document are among the historically invaluable artacts to go on display for the first time ever together when Áras Uí Chonghaile opens its doors next month. The Gaeltacht Quarter-based £. million three-storey building is set to welcome tourists and visitors from Saturday, April  when the centre opens to offer an interactive exhibition, study area, a fascinating library of Connolly’s writings, café and conference facility. The opening of Áras Uí Chonghaile comes three years after a statue of James Connolly was unveiled outside the Falls Community Council to commemorate the th year of the Easter Rising. The bronze statue was unveiled by a great-grandson of the  hero, James Connolly Heron, who described West Belfast as Connolly’s “spiritual home”.The ambitious project, led by Fáilte Feirste Thiar, will host a pageant parade on April , Good Friday, and will leave from Conway Mill, a site where James Connolly organised mill workers during the time he made West Belfast his home. “Aras Uí Chonghaile is designed to celebrate everything James Connolly contributed to Belfast, Ireland and beyond,” explained Fáilte Feirste Director Harry Connolly. “There are five core elements to the centre, starting with the ground floor, world-class visitor exhibition. The first floor of the centre will house the Connolly Library and will consist of the world’s finest collection of writings including books we have secured from when James Connolly spent his time in Kilmainham Gaol. The fourth element of the centre will be an event and conference space, with all the first class facilities you would expect.”Harry told the Andersonstown News that a year-long events programme has also been planned with folk sessions, film club meetings held once a month in conjunction with Sean Murray’s Respect film company, and a series of seminars and lectures.“We are also delighted to announce that Hatch Café will take up residence in the centre as our hospitality partners and will be open to the public,” he said. Áras Uí Chonghaile centre manger Séanna Walsh spoke of how the centre will host a programme of events that will try to emphasise that “It’s not just about Connolly the Irish rebel, it’s as much about Connolly the trade unionist, the guy who organised the mill workers in Conway Street, the guy who went to the States and organised several trade unions there, who all take their lineage right back that far.” Séanna continued: “There will be a major educational element to the centre, we want schools, colleges, universities coming to see the project.“It’s ground-breaking the things we will have on display for the first time: an original Proclamation and also a half Proclamation which was actually produced by the British to use in evidence during the court martial.“Having the seven signatories at the bottom was all they needed, those along with the original printing blocks will be displayed for the first time ever together. “At the end of the day, the centre has to be Connolly in the round. Not the one-dimensional Connolly – the Irish rebel. It’s important to the legacy of the man this centre is seen as a resource by the trade unions right across the island.”Harry said that there is no doubt Áras Uí Chonghaile will become a key part of the city’s tourism trail. “We want to thank our funders Belfast City Council and the wide range of sponsoring trade unions from the States that have pledged and delivered key financial resources which haveallowed the centre to become a reality.” "},{"url":null,"title":"alevel northern ireland school league table","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Bullet holes were plastered over and painted.Shagat Khan, the president of the Muslim Association of Canterbury, said they had not planned to open the mosque so soon but when they saw the crowds gathering after the police cordon was removed, they decided to allow people to enter in managed groups “so the mosque will be alive again”.“Those who lost their families are of course quite emotional,” he said. “And those who were present here during the incident, of course the memories come back.

Because only through patience can you endure.”Prince Hassan said in the Middle East there have been wars every decade.“To feel that this form of violence and cruelty is visited on you, living in this idyllic part of the world, is deeply, deeply moving,” he said.Human dignity is being assailed on all fronts by extremists, he said, and people need to stand together as human beings.Officials say four Jordanian nationals died in the attack, while a four-year-old Jordanian girl is also recovering in an Auckland hospital."},{"url":null,"title":"dungiven family returns screens week","story":"Rare Breed - A Farming Year s to our screens on Thursday at .pm on UTV, and so too does Dungiven family, the McGilligan’s.It’s September, and despite some bad weather, the farmers are keeping busy with sales, competitions and new arrivals.Viewers will see the McGilligan’s make their annual trip to the sheep sales in Armoy.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshThere’s a signicant role for -year-old Cahir, as well as helping dad Sean and granddad Harry, he’s showing the sheep in the sales ring and hoping the buyers will bid on the sheep.UTV’s Mark McFadden narrates the series, sponsored by Dale Farm, Rare Breed – A Farming Year continues on Thursday  st March  at .pm on UTV."},{"url":null,"title":"green light 100m investment new","story":"The largest private residential investment in the North West is set to be approved by Derry City and Strabane District Council planning committee next week.The £m investment by South Bank Square Ltd proposes a  home neighbourhood development at Ballyoan adjacent to Crescent Link and Clooney Road.

plannersrsquo recommendation to refuse permission to develop Northern Irelandrsquos first woodland graveyard outside Downpatrick.The decision to allow those behind the controversial proposal for a -acre site at Loughmoney more time to provide additional information was taken at last weekrsquos meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilsrsquo Planning Committee.Plans for the graveyard, which has split public opinion, were unveiled in September  by Down to Earth Ltd, which hosted a series of public consultation meetings to outline the detail of its proposal.Those behind the lsquogreen graveyardrsquo project, which would be sited off the Ballyculter Road and contain parking provision for  cars, say they are confident that the proposal would have a low environmental impact and offer an alternative to those seeking an environmentally-friendly approach to burial.They argue there are no designations that would preclude a development of this nature and that the proposal will enhance the location by creating and enhancing shared space, supporting good design and improving the built and natural environment.Supporters of the project also contend that the project will ldquopreserve restore and enhance ecosystems, turning an arable field into a nature reserve.In papers submitted ahead of last weekrsquos meeting, planners confirmed they had representations in support and opposition to the proposal, with the planned burial site having no headstones, with all burials recorded on a map.Signicantly, planners confirmed that while there can be no objections in principle to the proposal, those behind the project had not provided the requested additional information.They revealed that while extra time was allowed to comply with the request, no further extension was being afforded with the recommendation to refuse the application now being made.Planners added: ldquoWhile it is considered that the proposal will not create any unacceptable visual or residential impact due to its nature, it is considered further information is required for the consultees which also encompasses a number of concerns raised from interested parties.Planners confirmed Environment and Rivers Agencies are among those who still require further information to enable them to fully assess the planning application and provide detailed comment.Planners had described the information they required as ldquocrucial and pertinent to the application and that it was most unfortunate that it has not been provided.They said while there may be no objection in principle to the proposal ldquoit

Since then Exploris curator Peter Williams has kept a watchful eye over the  month-old old turtle.Mr Williams said: ldquoThe loggerhead turtle arrived at Exploris Aquarium in a critical condition from a beach near Rosbeg, Co Donegal.ldquoSince then we have been working tirelessly to slowly raise the turtlersquos temperature by a couple of degrees every day. Our veterinary team also decided to administer a course of antibiotics as an increase in temperature heightened the risk of a secondary infection setting in.He added: ldquoI am now happy to report that JC is making slow but great progress and is feeding well on a iety of fish and invertebrates. He is also receiving a gelatin diet, full of calcium, vitamins and minerals, which is important for the development of his shell.ldquoAs JC has taken well to rehabilitation we have decided that it is best for him to be moved to a larger space as he will have more room to swim and e.ldquoLuckily he has responded well to treatment and is currently settling in to his new home where visitors to the aquarium will be able to get a glimpse of the vulnerable species as he continues to recover.The future is looking bright for JC as the team at Exploris will continue to monitor his weight over the coming months.

There will also be a dedicated parking area for coaches.Original plans for the new hotel described finishing the exterior of the building in stone slate, with the accommodation centred around a landscaped courtyard. The proposed hotel development also includes plans to upgrade the Inch Abbey Road junction with the Belfast Road.Lidl submitted plans to secure outline planning permission to redevelop the . acre Shanslieve Drive site in January last year.

The development proposal includes plans for almost  parking spaces, eight of which are reserved for mountain rescue team members.A new pedestrian crossing at the Bryansford Road junction with Shimna Road forms part of the proposal and while planners have received  objections, they have also received five letters in support of the proposal.In papers submitted ahead of last weekrsquos meeting, planners confirmed that none of the statutory consultees including the Department for Infrastructure, Rivers Agency, Environment Agency and the local environmental health department, had lodged any objections to the redevelopment of the former school site.They confirm that roads officials are content that the proposed development will not have any ldquoadverse impact on the existing road infrastructure and is acceptable in terms of road safety.Planners have insisted that the indicative designs of both the new store and mountain rescue centre would be inappropriate in this part of the resort.They say it is acknowledged that there are ldquoobvious restrictions for the redevelopment of the existing Lidl store in Railway Street and that there are no alternative vacant sites in the town centre which could accommodate the supermarketrsquos needs.The supermarket giant says it has been looking for alternative premises in Newcastle town centre for over a decade without success and that while properties have become available, none were suitable because they were too small..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Prenter goals just the ticket  ","story":"ST Patrickrsquos Grammar School produced a sizzling display to get the better of a resolute Cathair Dhoire side in a nailbiting showdown at the Athletic Grounds in Armagh on Monday.The Red High had to show great fortitude and tenacity in one of the most exciting and entertaining MacLarnon Cup finals in years as the Derry amalgamation threatened to ruin St Patrickrsquos day.The Downpatrick lads werenrsquot found wanting when the chips were down and two goals from man of the match Tim Prenter mdash one in each half mdash was the main dference between the sides.Prenter was a deserved recipient of the award as he continually stalked the Cathair Dhoire defence at every opportunity and had them chasing shadows every time he went near the ball.Loughinislandrsquos Brandon Boyd opened the scoring for the Red High after only  seconds. Club mate Peter McMullan fielded the resultant kick out and released Ronan Connor to make it - to - after less than a minutersquos play.However, Cathair Dhoire started pushing up on the Red High kick-outs and this proved an effective tactic with scores flowing from Cahir McMonagle, Fergal Mortimerand Ben McCarronto take a - to - lead after just five minutes of free-flowing football.It could have been even worse for St Patrickrsquos as Cathair Dhoire wasted two excellent goal chances with superb defending from Bryansfordrsquos Jack Harbinson denying McCarron with a timely block.The Red High started gaining possession in and around the middle of the park, but they definitely missed the ball winning ability of Saulrsquos Ruairi OrsquoHare in this sector, although he did start at full forward.OrsquoHare picked up an injury while playing for the Northern Ireland U- team in a Centenary Shield game against Wales on Thursday night, but his switch to leading his sidersquos attack worked a treat.With seven minutes of non-stop football gone Prenter, a senior county hurler, left three defenders trailing in his wake as he cut through the Cathair Dhoire cover before drilling the ball low and hard into the bottom corner of the net.Not a bad goal considering there was absolutely nothing on when the Downpatrick player received the ball out on the left flank.The Red High now had a grip on the game and OrsquoHare plundered the next five points for his side, two from frees, but Cathair Dhoire kept in touch with two points from McCarron, leaving the Downpatrick school with a - to - lead after  minutes.The Derry amalgamation sensed blood and towering midfielder Oran McGrath plucked the ball out of the air and ended a bustling run with an improvised finish to the net.Cathair Dhoire were far from finished and unanswered points from McCarron, McMonagle and Mortimer had the sides level after  minutes with all to play for.It could have been curtains for the Red High at this stage, but lsquokeeper Eoin Maginn saved his sidersquos bacon with two wonderful saves.Ruairi Quinn edged the Red High back in front just minutes after being introduced and the impressive OrsquoHare made it a - to - game  minutes.Prenter then finished Cathair Dhoire off with a second sensational goal. McMullan converted a late free after OrsquoHare had been sent off and McCarron grabbed the last score of the game for a battling Derry side.St Patrickrsquos: E Maginn, J Harbinson, E Rooney, L Guiness, P McMullan, R Murphy, B Boyd , C Watson, R OrsquoHare , T Smyth , O Cunningham, N Laverty, T Prenter , R Connor , T Savage.

Photo Colm Lenaghan Pacemaker PressWhile the trophy count is minimal – the British Home Championship being the NI team’s only international silverware of note – the number of fascinating artefacts from the s to the present day more than make up for the bare trophy cabinet.The tours of the stadium are managed by east Belfast man and Cltonville star Stephen Garrett.He said: “As far as I know there weren’t any scheduled tours of the old Windsor Park, unless they were on an ad hoc basis.”Explaining how he got involved in the role, he said: “I’ve a career history of volunteer management and in business development which worked well for going for the role internally.Press Eye Belfast - Northern Ireland th OctoberNorthern Ireland manager and captain press conference at The National Football Stadium at Windsor Park ahead of their FIFA  World Cup Qualier against San Marino on Saturday night.Final touches are made tot he stadium ahead tomorrow nights official opening of the new ground.

The ground is also now the Irish FA’s headquarters and also houses the offices of both the Northern Ireland Football Leagueand Linfield FC.Getting to see more than just ‘good room’When we first moved into our ’s semi-detached house in east Belfast we weren’t keen to show guests anywhere other than the good room and allow them use of the toilet.Then we got an extension, a new kitchen and some aesthetic work done to the house and now every visitor is offered a guided tour.The same could be said for Windsor Park where, since its makeover, fans have been offered access all areas to the new surrounds. Northern Ireland fans and Irish League supporters will of course have treasured memories of the ground down the years since it hosted its first game between Linfield and Glentoran in , but truth be told, it had become something of a relic.Like many the most I’d seen of Windsor Park had been the ‘good room’ and the toilets, but having taken the tour this week I felt privileged to stand in the players’ tunnel, take a seat in the George Best lounge where the high and mighty congregate, and touch the peg where the legendary Steven Davis’ shirt is hung.While getting pitchside was a big moment – including an impromptu pic with Northern Ireland’s leading goalscorer David Healy who was there on Linfield duties – the museum was the part of the tour that really impressed me.Through its artefacts, storyboards and interactive areas the Education and Heritage Centre reflects the passion of the fans, the amazing feats of NI’s players and the rich history of the Irish League.Scoring a penalty past a computer generated Pat Jennings was a highlight, but I reckon he hadn’t been programmed to deal with the Panenka – a cheeky chip down the centreof the goal.One of the interesting pieces of trivia I learnt on the tour had absolutely nothing to do with football.Every now and again a hawk gets let off inside the ground to stop seagulls and pigeons from nesting in the stadium’s upper reaches.Forget VAR technology, Windsor Park has its own hawk-eye.JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Disclaimer  Privacy policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":null,"title":"health","story":".... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia Ltd , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast Newsletter and agreeing to JPIMedia Ltd#s Standard Terms and ConditionsWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia Ltd , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \" addCustomTextToCreateAccountTemplateNewslettersWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia Ltd , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"  \". s .  \". s  \". s  \".after+text+ .+text+ .before+text+ .after+text+  Health   Jobs Cars Homes  Directory  Announcements  Advertise My Business NewsletterRegisterLoginEdit Account\"Sign Out\" --\"    --       News Health Politics Crime Farming Education Business Transport Environment Your Say Opinion Offbeat s News News Politics Crime Farming Education Business Transport Environment Your Say Opinion Offbeat Sport Football Rugby Union Cricket Golf Motorcycling Boxing More Sport Whats On Music Theatre  Comedy Arts TV  Film Eating Out Lestyle Nostalgia People Family Gadgets  Tech Outdoors Travel Cars Read This           Health      Day surgery lsquohubsrsquo should cut waiting lists in NIRadical plans for new day surgery hubs across Northern Ireland have been announced by health chiefs in a bid to cut waiting list times.

It said that there were a series of glaring inaccuracies in the department’s calculations and that there was virtually no cost dference between the cost of wood pellets and LPG for Moy Park’s farmers, who get discounted gas through the poultry processor.The group said that there were then multiple other factors – such as the increased maintenance costs of the complex biomass systems and the increased electricity costs to run them – which made fossil fuels more attractive.Jamie Kidney from wood pellet distributor kWh Supply told the News Letter that he had spoken to one installer of gas boilers which in recent weeks had quoted for the replacement of over  biomass systems. He said that he was aware of another boiler installer which had quoted for a similar number of reversions to fossil fuels.This week there was concern in the House of Lords about whether they should be relying on data from the department which has consistently presided over RHI being a mess since its launch more than six years ago.Mr Kidney said: “The information that DfE peddle is factually incorrect. Their arguments that attempt to justy the dference between RHI tarf of £, in Northern Ireland and £, in Great Britain are nonsensical.“Biomass boilers were all supplied from Europe and they did not cost less in Northern Ireland than in Britain. DfE’s assertion about the cost of fuel is equally illogical.“Incompetence was clearly demonstrated in the structuring and administering of the RHI to the extent that it merited a public inquiry. It is absurd that the department central to the whole fiasco should now be entrusted with the responsibility for the future of the RHI in Northern Ireland.”Meanwhile, no one in government has been able to provide any clarity about what the concession made by the government to get the RHI cuts through the House of Lords will mean.On Tuesday night, NIO minister Lord Duncan persuaded Lord Empey to drop a bid to delay the cuts – a proposal which had support from all sides of the House of Lords – after proposing an independent chairman to examine each case of hardship by RHI claimants.When asked by the News Letter how that would operate, the NIO offered no comment. Stormont’s Department for the Economy said it was “currently considering the issue” andwould give details “in due course”.Sam McBride: Banner backlash is a foretaste of a looming dilemma for

All of this needs hand-braked very quickly and a touch of reality brought to bear,” he said.“The [Belfast] Agreement still holds firm, but we need to find a way of unpicking the damage done by the St Andrews Agreement, because under the original agreementyou didn’t like the way your parties were delivering you could kick them out.“But the changes at St Andrews basically consolidated the position for both of those extremes. We want our politicians to do politics, we want them to share responsibility, butwe don’t like what they’re delivering we want to be able to change them.”Mr Ringland said his concerns around hardening attitudes were raised following an encounter with a leading Sinn Fein politician at ain .“Just after the last NI Assembly elections I challenged a senior Sinn Fein figure. I said ‘you have pressed the hate button during that election campaign and it’s going to be very hard to put this back in its box’. His response was ‘I’ll not take lectures from the likes of you.’ I went back to my we and I said: ‘No matter what I say, there’s no space in their Ireland for me.’“The only way to pursue their constitutional preference is by making this place work, by making Northern Ireland work, and the sooner that dawns – not just with Sinn Fein, but with Irish nationalism as a whole in Northern Ireland and across this island – then the sooner we can get on with making this place a better place for all of us.”Commenting on the ‘civic unionism’ event at Queen’s University last month, Mr Ringland said the message from Sinn Fein president Mary Lou McDonald lacked credibility.Sam McBride: Banner backlash is a foretaste of a looming dilemma for republicans Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“I have been involved in events like this for years, and you just get fed up with the same old rhetoric. They listen but they don’t hear,” he added.“When I first met Martin McGuinness I said to him: ‘I disagree with what you did before butyou are prepared to work for the betterment of all the people in the future, then I will work with you.’ Unionism needs to be challenging but pragmatic in dealing with republicanism.”Having spoken of the need for reconciliation at the QUB event last month, Sinn Fein president Ms McDonald provoked anger from across the political spectrum just weeks later when she posed with an ‘England get out of Ireland’ banner at the St Patrick’s Day parade in New York.try

But the consultants draft stage  report clearly states what weve all known for many years ndash which is that a by-pass must be part of any solution.\"There have been those who claim the Welsh Government dont have the funds for a bypass road. Id remind them that last week saw the opening of the pound million Newtown By-pass, which serves a far smaller gross population than between Barry and Cardf. The Caernarfon by-pass cost could spiral from the original pound. million to pound. million.\"Work towards a positive outcome is further forward than at any time since it was first mooted over  years ago.\"There are a number of other steps still to be taken before the cabinet will eventually decide which by-pass route option and other measures should be surveyed and designed in detail in stage .The council has promised a public consultation of the proposals in the future, giving everyone the opportunity to discuss and comment on the project with officials and consultants. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

That being the case, this council, like many others in Wales, is unable to continue to provide the level of subsidy to outdoor sports provision that it has in the past.ldquoExploring dferent ways of working, including the transfer of responsibilities in appropriate circumstances to community groups is a key element of the councilrsquos strategy moving forward as it addresses dficult budget priorities.ldquoFollowing the successful transfer of responsibilities for five libraries to community-based organisations and looking at a number of successful sports clubs across the Vale of Glamorgan who operate without any subsidy from the Council, it is hoped that the majority of clubs currently using council facilities will be able to continue to provide opportunities for all to participate in sports activities. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The event ran from Saturday March  to Tuesday March .The Vale brewery Tomos and Lilford produced a special beer called ldquoCarnival - Penarth Pale Ale.Meanwhile the two Penarth butchers, Thompson Family Butchers and David Lush Butchers, both created their own special Penarth carnival sausages.The organisers estimated that more than  people took part in costume in the walk through town on Saturday, which saw the coronation of the lsquoFirst Foolrsquo at am. The procession marched from Sully Terrace through town.At .am in Penarth Library, there was a presentation of the head of Bendigeidfran, from The Mabinogion. The head was made by children from Cogan and Penygarth schools.The lsquoFirst Foolrsquo was then sent by train to the Tower of London to bring news of the Carnival to the traditional resting place of the head of Bendigeidfran, where he met the Raven Master.Long distance cyclist Dave Hann was due to cycle to Harlech, north Wales to raise money for the RNLI Penarth, and bring news to Harlech that Carnival had broken out in Penarth.Unfortunately Mr Hann only got as far as Cardigan before Storm Freya made it too dangerous to continue. Organisers have one barrel of carnival ale left and will take it to Harlech by train in the next few weeks to share it and the storybook of the carnival.On Sunday, two rugby teams took part in a ldquotug-o-sausage to decide which butcherrsquos sausage was better. Congratulations were extended to the winners, Team Thompson.Congratulations were also extended to the traders Ener-chi and Lilypad by the organisers, for having the best-dressed shop windows. Particular praise was singled out for the carnival flowers at Holm House Hotel created by Lilypad.Further nights of partying, songs and dancing were spotted in the Albion, St Faganrsquos Castle, and other pubs, bars and venues across Penarth. There were also celebrations on the Penarth Pier on Tuesday night following a Pancake Day event, while wandering bands of musicians like Wonderbrass kept spirits high.The festival culminated in a grand Mardis Gras party on Tuesday, which saw crowds of costumed residents dance the night away.Richard Parry, one of the carnival organisers, said: ldquoToday is Ash Wednesday, the beginning of Lent. Carnival finished last night on Mardi Gras.ldquoThanks to everyone who took part, contributed, encouraged, sponsored, smiled and partied, especially those people who took a carnival Bank Holiday Monday.ldquoIt was fabulous to hear your Carnival Bank Holiday stories, and to all those people who have had little private carnival moments of joy over the festival, thatrsquos what it has all been about.ldquoAnd some people have already said, lsquosee you next year!rsquoldquoThere were lots of people laughing and smiling on the sidelines, telling me they wanted to take part next year ndash just with a little more notice next time. But now itrsquos established, wersquoll be back next year and ready for even more people to join in the fun! article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Wersquore creating work which is not really necessary.If we want to improve the gateway there are other ways of doing it.ldquoIt really doesnrsquot begin to tackle the active travel . I do feel this is about spending the money before next February.Councillors were told the widened roundabout was one part of a wider strategy for transport improvements in Penarth.Charlotte Pugh, senior planner for the council, said the new scheme would transform the area.She said: ldquoThis whole are is going to be completely transformed. At the moment it is not very welcoming to pedestrians.ldquoI think it will go some way to transforming this gateway into Penarth and make it a safer environment.Previous plans to make part of Plassey Street one-way to incoming traffic, and removing the roundabout altogether, were dropped following opposition from the public.The committee agreed to endorse the transport scheme but requested regular updates on the wider transport plans for Penarth. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The PM was forced into a corner, forced to concede that she might have to rule out No Deal and extend Article , and the Labour Party came out decisively for putting this issue back to the people.And this week we saw the Government attempt to win over MPs with a fund it claims will boost less well-off towns after Brexit ndash but in another shambolic aspect to this hapless attempt to bribe MPs into voting for Theresa Mayrsquos so-called deal, there is no cash for Welsh towns.Another example of the Tories letting Wales down, and yet further reason to support the push for a final say on Brexit for the public through a Peoplersquos Vote. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Last month I met with constituents over disruption to local rail services. I know that many of you will have experienced delays and cancellations to services in the weeks following the handover of the Wales Rail Franchise. I understand and share the frustration that these delays have caused. There has been a shortage of rolling stock as a result of a large maintenance backlog following the handover of the franchise together with planned changes to rail services. This has led to a signicant reduction in services and replacement bus services. I have been in contact with the Minister for Transport and Transport for Wales to raise the concerns of constituents. I have been assured that service levels are now back to normal and they do not anticipate any restrictions to services in the coming year. I will of course maintain my interest to see that those assurances are kept. I will update residents again on future plans to deliver improved station facilities, trains and more regular services.As many of you are aware Cardf Bus has recently announced changes to bus services across Cardf and the Vale. A number of bus routes are at risk as part of these changes. The removal of bus links for work, social links and public services, including hospital routes, would have a signicant impact on my constituents.Cardf Bus are not acting to deliberately hurt our communities. Far from being an uncaring organisation Cardf Bus are stuck with a legal framework that stops them from operating on the same basis as commercial competitors. Competitors can cherry pick and target single profitable routes that undermine the wider social propose that most of us want from local bus services. Cardf Councilrsquos Labour leadership has committed to supporting at risk bus services for  years. Unless the Conservative leadership of the Vale Council agrees to Labour councillors amendments to the budget and protects local bus services in the Vale then bus routes will go. The Vale Council leadership could and should act. If they donrsquot then my constituents will suffer.In future, the regulation of buses is the answer. London was the only part of the UK that was allowed to keep a regulated bus service. It is no mistake that it has the best and most coherent service. We now have the legislative powers to regulate bus services here in Wales. The Welsh Government is currently consulting on proposals to reform bus and taxi services in Wales. More information on the consultation can be found at: https:beta.gov.wales improving-public-transport. The consultation closes on th March ndash please do get in touch and take part. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He was animated and passionate, and had clearly forged a close bond with his teacher.The head of Westbourne Prep School, Joanne Chinnock, said: ldquoOur school is a happy place, and wersquove long held the philosophy happy children learn well.       ,params: .pushldquoOur lsquosecretrsquo is the very close bond between the children, from Nursery and Reception classes all the way to the top of the school and the staff, who know each child very well indeed.There are a huge number of after school clubs on offer. Children have the opportunity to learn a wide range of instruments, including the harp, trumpet, piano, violin, drums, guitar and organ.A large set of sports clubs stake full advantage of the the Welsh coast, with frequent use of Penarth Pier, the beach and natural beauty spot Cosmeston Lakes. Sports on offer include swimming, yoga, basketball, touch rugby, dodge ball, gymnastics, cross country, and football.There are even more opportunities to excel in other areas, with offerings including Young Journalists, Nature Club, Art Club, Chess and ldquoMad Science.Westbourne offers the InternationalDiploma Programme in sixth form and GCSEs and IGCSEs for its secondary pupils.Their IB average is - points, high enough to qualy for Oxford University, with two-thirds of all Higher Level grades being s and s, and two-thirds of students receiving a Bilingual Diploma.The GCSE results are equally impressive with  per cent of all grades being s and s per cent the new, harder, grade  and a further  per cent grade s.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The Department of the Economy’s Strategic Energy Framework, which was endorsed by the Executive in , has over the last nine years, led to some very positive changes to the energy generation and supply mix, particularly from renewable sources.However the  year framework is nearing its end and needs to be replaced. The Department is making such preparations as it can on a draft Strategic Energy Framework across the areas of heat, electricity, transport and energy efficiency which it aims to make public some time in the spring. Whether or not this region has its Assembly back to adopt such a framework will remain to be seen, but in the meantime it will ensure the subject remains live and high on the agenda.Brexit and I-SEMThe new wholesale electricity market known as the Integrated Single Electricity Marketwent live on October , . It is designed to deliver increased levels of competition which, it is hoped, will help put downward pressure on prices as well as encouraging greater levels of security of supply and transparency. While the island of Ireland is now integrated more closely with European markets, there is a risk that Brexit could halt this integration. British and Irish business groups and energy trade associations such as the CBI, IBEC, Electricity Association of Ireland, RenewableUK, British Irish Chamber of Commerce and EnergyUK all refer to the delivery of I-SEM, or to the UK’s continued access to the IEM, as post-Brexit priorities for security of supply and or consumer protection. I-SEM is clearly a priority that must be preserved.While Brexit may present challenges and continuing uncertainty, there are certainly opportunities for investment and acquisition in the electricity market as more complex, specialist expertise will be required to effectively trade power on the I-SEM. Policy barriers or inaction cannot be allowed to prevent I-SEM from realising its potential of fully integrating the market by efficiently moving energy from producer to demand.Renewable incentive schemesDespite being on track to hit its target of % of electricity generation from renewables, Northern Ireland risks being left behind. The lack of a replacement for the development support mechanism, Renewables Obligations Certicateafter its closure in April , means Northern Ireland is lagging behind Great Britain which has established the Contract for Dference regime and Ireland, which has started work on its Renewable Electricity Support Scheme . While neither scheme is perfect, doing nothing is not an option. The devolution of energy presented Northern Ireland with the opportunity to shape its own policy but without a government, will the sector and the infrastructure be able to remain fit for purpose GasWith its development over the last  years, the gas network in Northern Ireland, with its low population density, must be seen as a success story. Consumers and businesses have been offered greater choice in terms of price and security of supply. Nevertheless there are certainly further opportunities for gas distributors and suppliers to expand the natural gas network, particularly in the west of the country and east Co Down. So despite the apparent obstacles and challenges, there is opportunity for development and progress in Northern Ireland’s energy sector. The benefits for Northern Ireland will be in terms of security of supply, price and environmental sustainability. Cleaver Fulton Rankin,  Bedford Street, Belfast BT FW.

Since I took on the Northern Ireland role six years ago, we’ve doubled the workforce, become the fastest-growing UK region and are now the biggest office outside London with just over , people,” he says. “Our strategy was to be the leading provider of professional services in the Northern Ireland market but there’s no way we’d be the size we are now had we only focused on that.”Instead Paul built on the legacy of his predecessors and accelerated growth in new, technology solutions, while retaining the traditional accounting, tax and consulting services. Today PwC remains the leading provider of advisory services to the region’s family-owned and owner-managed businesses and multinationals, but has also built an impressive portfolio of cutting-edge technologies, opened the door to signicant export markets and is tackling some of society’s most challenging issues. “We’ve grown in many new areas – blockchain, cyber, cloud-based accounting services – but the single biggest impact has come from developing our distinctive ‘Operate’ ision,” Paul says. ”Operate is our service delivery business, which supports and delivers technology and people solutions to large, often regulated organisations. So instead of just advising clients how to solve their problems, we now do the heavy lting for them.”Run by Ian McConnell, a partner who’s been with the firm for  years, Operate is already attracting global attention. “Clients increasingly don’t want a consulting firm just to tell them what to do: they want a problem-solving partnership.” he says. “In its first year of operation, Operate earned over £m, now has , people and is still growing.”Reinforcing Paul’s confidence to invest in Northern Ireland as a strategic location is a  forecast from TheCityUK that it could become the second fastest-growing financial services region outside London by , helping deliver £bn of additional gross value-addedto the UK economy. But that depends on the ability to recruit the right talent, and he says the challenge now is finding and retaining the skills.That’s an issue that particularly concerns Paul as he looks ahead at the economic picture with Brexit and lack of an Assembly to the fore.“The business community wants clarity and certainty. Ideally we want to see a Brexit withdrawal agreement that then gives the scope for a trade deal that offers Northern Ireland the capacity to trade both with the EU and as part of the UK. The potential competitive advantages and ability to attract investment would be terric and the kind of economic accelerator which we have sought for years, but never managed to gain.“However I do worry about the impact of political stalemate on our long term future. Failure to invest, particularly in education and skills, will impair our competitiveness and make this a less attractive place for business.The decreasing effectiveness of health, environment and infrastructure will mean that talented people will opt to make choices to live their lives where.“In my national role, I see other parts of the country fusing partnerships in innovative and exciting ways between business,education and government. Compared to that, we are already getting left behind. We should be moving forward.”Which brings us to Merchant Square, the £m, , sq ft office development which PwC takes over in . “We have great people and one reason why we’re moving to the city centre is because that’s where they want to be. By the time we’re ready to relocate towards the end of , we will have at least , people moving in to the heart of Belfast.“That makes it important for Belfast too and not just because it’s the city’s biggest-ever private sector office deal. As we were making our decision, the whole Bank Buildings issue was at its height, and we wanted to show our support for the city and its future.” The Merchant Square relocation project is led by Kieragh Nelson, a director who joined the firm in . “We’ve got serious ambitions for Merchant Square,” she says. ”There’s a sense of ‘OK, we’ve just opened flagship offices in London, and Manchester – what more can we do in Belfast how can we make it even better ’ And the vast majority of decisions on how it will look, feel and work are made by the team here. Our goal is to create the most technologically-advanced, innovative and collaborative space for ourselves, our clients, and also for the communities around us.”Doing the right thing is a maxim often repeated in PwC, but it gets backed up. On the morning of our interview, a large group of people from the firm, including Paul, took part in one of their regular ‘Darkness Into Light’ walks to raise awareness of mental health. The firm’s commitment to social mobility has seen a number of employment programmes launched, notably the UK’s first technology degree apprenticeships, with Queen’s University one of five universities selected to run the programme. And it’s expanding its Hive Academy programme, which delivers free technology education to primary and secondary schools, to the Channel Islands.This year the firm challenged itself and created a unique charity partnership – the PwC Challenge – to create innovative suicide prevention programmes.“Our purpose is to build trust in society and solve important problems, and it really does feature in how we look at what we do. We strive to celebrate and share our knowledge widely and unselfishly with our people and communities and not be afraid to take a stand and do the right thing. And we put it at the heart of what we do every day. “Take the PwC Challenge: more people in Northern Ireland have died by suicide since the signing of the Good Friday Agreement than from the violence in the years before. This is a crisis, and it’s one which affects our people, and our communities. So we asked local charities in north and west Belfast, the worst affected areas in the UK, to collaborate and devise really innovative approaches programmes to give opportunities to young people and their families through education, technology, sports, and mental health coaching.“As well as the clubs in PwC which fundraise every year for the challenge, our own people are volunteering every week in ious projects – particularly with our Hive Academy. We want to ensure that people, who are high achievers in many dferent fields, are supported to play their fullest part in society.” For Paul, it’s all about the people. Last year PwC invested around £m on staff development here, and this year, a number of people have begun the first Masters in Operation service delivery, run by Ulster University. “It’s important to support people to develop their careers in ways they mightn’t have considered when they joined. That’s a key building block of our purpose – it drives social mobility, equality and ersity.“It’s true thatsomeone decides they want to head off and join PwC Australia or New York, they can. That’s the beauty of working for a global firm – those opportunities are there. But what I really want to make sure is that you don’t have to leave:you want to live and work in Belfast, and have global clients, work with cutting-edge technology and be part of a firm that’s engaged in society, you can do that too.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/eopen_1.jpg","title":"the open its the biggest thing since sliced bread","story":"Posted on Wednesday March  by Ulster Business With just  weeks until Northern Ireland hosts the biggest sporting event in its history, John Mulgrew speaks to the bosses tasked with organising the legendary Open Championship We’ve come a long way in just a short few years. Despite its huge golfing credentials, especially in the modern game, it had been more than  years since Northern Ireland played host to the Irish Open.That all changed in , when it ed north to Royal Portrush. And that, buoyed on a refreshed and renewed interest in both the tournament, and the sport itself.Now, in  weeks, that same links course will see more than , people flock to arguably the world’s greatest golf tournament and the largest sporting event ever hosted on these shores – The Open – transforming a small Co Antrim town for a handful of summer days.“There is a buzz with everyone at the RA,” Johnnie Cole-Hamilton tells Ulster Business. He’s executive director of championships at the RA – the ruling authority of golf throughout the world, aside from areas such as the US, and organisation responsible for organising The Open.“This will be my th Open Championship, and one reason I continue to be involved is that it’s a challenge every time.”It will see Irish golfing greats, including Open winners Rory McIlroy and Darren Clarke, Graeme McDowelland Padraig Harrington – among others – join the biggest name in sport, Tiger Woods.“One of big drivers to ing to Royal Portrush was the success of the Northern Irish and Irish golfers. They have raised the profile of golf immeasurably. “We are absolutely delighted with the response so far – % of tickets sold in  hours, and sold out within a record-breaking eight weeks.”Johnnie says the decision to choose Portrush, bringing it back to the course after a  year hiatus, was the correct one – buoyed by the support from the community, agencies and organisations. The th Open will be held at Royal Portrush from July -.“In my career, we had a similar scenario, ing to Liverpool for the first time in  years, and we had a very similar response. It ed in , and now Royal Liverpool is firmly on the rota, and I hope that Royal Portrush is similar.”Of course, aside from the golf, both the short-term and long-term economic benefits will trickle down and benefit, not on the surrounding areas, but prop Northern Ireland up on yet another global .According to Tourism NI chief executive John McGrillen that longer-term benefit could be worth up to £m for the wider economy.“There will be , tickets sold for championship days, and % of those sold to people out of state, outside Northern Ireland,” he tells Ulster Business.“It allows us to present an extremely positive image for Northern Ireland, and into key markets across the globe. We will never have experienced the opportunity to provide such a positive image of Northern Ireland. Despite what we might think, there are perception issues.“Northern Ireland has a normalised society and some of the most dramatic golf courses, scenery and landscape to see.“More specically, the fact that the Open will have been here, as one of the world’s top golf courses, will drive up the amount of spend, especially from golf tourism.”That alone makes up around % of Northern Ireland’s tourism intake. John says he wants that to grow to £m by . He says golfing visitors spend around four times that of an average tourist.Johnnie says all signs so far suggest that the Open in Portrush is “going to be an enormous” success. But the process hasn’t come without its challenges – namely theIrish Sea.“This is the first Open Championship we have hosted in my time, in which we have a body of water between our base and our contractor base. There’s getting things across water, and an enormous amount of work on the golf course – new holes, a new road system around the course and a tunnel for the players from one of the new greens to tee. You can’t do that without support from the golf club“The members have been hugely supportive, turning the course upside down, but maintaining integrity and enhancing .”He said, along with the blue light services, local authorities, council and tourism groups, the community in and around Portrush “understands that this will bring great benefits” to the area and Northern Ireland as a whole. “You can overcome dficulties with support,” he says.“Royal Portrush has never had more than , people drive to it, or get the train to it, at the same time. It’s a challenge to make sure we deliver a wonderful Open Championship and a spectator experience.”John McGrillen says the triumph in landing the Open itself was down to the success of the Irish Open in the last few years. “You had more than , people turning out at Portrush… visitor numbers had been dwindling.“That allows us to demonstrate that the course can deal with that many people. Everyoneworked very well, collectively, and that gave confidence to the RA that we would have the capacity to deliver it. The risk factors they had were eliminated because of the success of the Irish Open, and that was very critical.”As for boosting many of the hundreds of businesses in and around the area, John said: “It will do, as it’s showing off Northern Ireland… we have seen a big boost in the number of Americans playing golf. We don’t have to wait until after the event. “The visibility the Irish Open has given us. We have Royal County Down, Royal Portrush and Portstewart – that’s increased signicantly. It’s not just those courses which are benefiting – it’s being spread. People will typically stay in Belfast and travel around.”For John, the best outcome is, of course, an Irish winner. Oh, and clear skies. “A local winner would be phenomenal. It would be fantastic to see Rory win, or Tiger Woods.“If Tiger Woods won the Open in Portrush, that would remain in peoples’ memories forever. While we would love Rory or other locals to win, I would not be disappointed in Tiger winning it.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/west.jpg","title":"major ni firms in eleventh hour westminster plea to avoid no deal brexit","story":"Posted on Friday March  by John Mulgrew More than  of Northern Ireland’s biggest businesses – employing tens of thousands of workers here – have written to MPs in an eleventh hour plea to avoid a ‘no deal’ Brexit.  As Theresa May is due to bring her withdrawal deal back to Parliament next week, with less than a month to go before the March  deadline, a letter from the CBI, signed by  firms, calls on MPs to unite behind a way forward that avoids a hard border and protects peace and economic progress in Northern Ireland.  It says that “local businesses believe that the failure to approve a deal with Europe on the UK’s withdrawal from the EU will have signicant repercussions for the local economy\". “Such a scenario will both hinder indigenous and foreign direct investment, it would result in signicant job losses and will stle opportunities for the next generation across Northern Ireland.  “We therefore urge MPs across the UK to consider the damaging impact on Northern Ireland’s economy and political stability in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  “The peace and economic progress that flowed from the Belfast  Good Friday Agreement cannot be overlooked at this critical time in the UK’s history.

For some there will be little or no change to their daily lives after the UK leaves the EU. But for others, Brexit may have an impact on some aspects of their day-to-day lives. To provide as much practical information for people across Northern Ireland that is currently available, a Brexit section has been created on the nidirect website. Useful public information is being published on www.nidirect.gov.uk brexit on a regular basis. You may have also seen some of the digital advertisements across Northern Ireland or on your social media channels asking you to visit the nidirect website for the most up to date information. The nidirect Brexit section also points to information being published by the UK Government to give people as much information as possible. At this stage, it won’t answer every question that people will have. But it serves as a useful tool to get people to start thinking about what they may need to do dferently once the UK leaves the EU. Included in the www.nidirect.gov.uk brexit is a section on travelling, which includes the most up to date information for motorists. Depending on how the UK leaves the EU, motorists in Northern Ireland may need a Green Card to drive across the border. A Green Card is an international certicate of insurance issued by insurance providers in the UK, guaranteeing that the driver has the necessary third-party motor insurance cover for driving in the country being travelled to. In the event of a no deal Brexit, motorists in Northern Ireland travelling to the Republic of Ireland will need a Green Card as proof of insurance. There’s also the most up-to-date information from the Department of Health on prescriptions, medicines and medical supplies. The Department of Health has already said that there is enough medicines and medical products to meet current needs. Therefore people should not ask for longer prescriptions and should continue to follow their GP’s advice. Likewise, arrangements for the provision of specic cross border healthcare services made between the Department of Health in Northern Ireland and the Department of Health in Dublinshould not be affected by EU Exit as they are not based on EU legislation. There is also information at www.nidirect.gov.uk brexit along with links to further information for businesses, employers and EU citizens, while information on the Common Travel Areacan be found at https:www.gov.uk government publications common-travel-area-guidance You might not have heard about the CTA before, but it gives British and Irish citizens agreed rights and privileges in both jurisdictions. The CTA is not based on EU membership and is a long standing arrangements based on domestic legislation and agreements between the UK and Irish governments and deals with a range of issues. www.nidirect.gov.uk brexit will be updated as and when new information becomes clear and available.
