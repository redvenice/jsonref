[{"url":null,"title":"CHRISTOPHER STEVENS reviews WW1 Final Hours","story":"    Erzberger had been sent by German High Command to negotiate a treaty, but many of his countrymen, including the army’s most senior general, Ludendorff, wanted to fight to the last man.Without the power to sign a surrender, Erzberger had to wait for orders. Meanwhile, back in Berlin, mobs were on the streets and the Kaiser had abdicated. During the chaotic delays, the slaughter in the trenches continued unabated: on November 10, the day before the Armistice, 2,738 men were killed.Expertly restored footage of the peace celebrations brought a spark of relief in this bitterly dour documentary. Men in muddy boots and puttees capered and threw their tin helmets in the air. But even these scenes were intercut with the reminiscences of old soldiers, 60 years later, who had spent their lives trying to reconcile themselves to the horrors they had endured.Haunting portraits of WW1 heroes to be etched into the sand...Heroes of the trenches brought back to life in colour:...Share this articleThe message was very clear. Remembrance Sunday, this year above all, is not an occasion for celebration, much less triumphalism. It is a time for reflection on the sacrifice of many millions of men and women, on the home front as well as on the battlefields.As he signed the papers, Foch foresaw that the peace might not survive the next two decades. In fact, it held for almost exactly 20 years, though Erzberger did not live through it. Months after being wounded by a hand grenade thrown into his office at the Reichstag parliament building, he was assassinated by vengeful naval officers who believed he had betrayed them.  World War WeirdRating: The storytelling style of World War Weird (Yesterday channel) could not have been more different. This magazine of improbable tales kicked off with the bizarre claim that the 1939-45 war might never have happened if British secret agents had not been so careless as to bump off Rasputin the Mad Monk.

Smith escaped a military execution then only to be shot dead later in 1844. Smith’s death spurred a splintering because there was no clear succession plan and led to differences in doctrine, including views on polygamy  The three churches shown here - the Church of Christ (Temple Lot), (left), the Community of Christ (middle), and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Visitors\u0027 Center, (right) - surround a Mormon sacred site known as \u0027Temple Lot.\u0027 Joseph Smith had a revelation from God that the land in Jackson County in western Missouri would be a key place for Jesus Christ\u0027s Second Coming\u0027I think some people are trying to build bridges where there have been walls but that’s not true of everybody, but some people are trying to do that,’ Metzger said. The three churches all own a piece of the around 63-acre parcel, which has gone by many names over the years but is now known as ‘Temple Lot,’ according to R. Jean Addams, an independent historian who has been researching and writing about Temple Lot since 2005. Addams said that the three now maintain ‘cordial relationships.’The Church of Christ owns the 2.75-acre parcel that Smith marked for the temple. According to Addams, when asked about selling it, a senior pastor of the church told him, ‘You might as well as offer a postage stamp for a million dollars. Either way, it’s not for sale.’The three churches declined multiple interview requests from DailyMail.com. Irene Caso, a spokesperson for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, declined to respond to email questions about whether they had tried to buy the land in the past, their relationship with the other two churches or to explain its views on the Second Coming.Calling us Mormons is a \u0027victory for Satan\u0027, says Church...\u0027I wasn\u0027t submissive enough\u0027: Ex-child bride who escaped...Share this article‘Independence, Missouri is an important place in the history of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. We are grateful for the relationships we have with the other churches in the area with whom we share many common beliefs. We appreciate the efforts of the Church of Christ Temple Lot to care for this historically significant property and look forward to continuing to work together with them in the future,’ Dennis Cato, president of the Independence Missouri Stake of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, said in an emailed statement through a spokesperson.Metzger explained that after Smith died, a number of people went to Utah under the leadership of Brigham Young, which is now the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Others followed Smith’s son - Joseph Smith III - and formed the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, which is now the Community of Christ.Another group, which had been in Illinois since 1839, moved to Independence in the 1860s and is the now the Church of Christ.‘When you grow up believing that these certain principles are true and that they’re what God wants you do, then you hold to that, and if someone presents something else, you go that can’t be true, I don’t accept that. And if the person, like Brigham Young in Utah, had authority of God than you didn’t,’ Metzger said.          In 1830, Joseph Smith founded what has been commonly referred to as the Mormon religion. He had a revelation from God that a temple for Jesus Christ\u0027s Second Coming should be built on land, now known as the \u0027Temple Lot,\u0027 in western Missouri. After his death, the religion split into several different branchesIn the past, ‘there was always a tension of saying that they’re wrong and we’re right, and no one was ever pointing to the Lord, they were always pointing to what they had, which is the focus is totally wrong.’Metzger said that now some of that tension has lessened.The Mormon movement was also known as the restoration movement.‘The Lord restored authority and power of his ministry to the earth through the ministering of angels, through John the Baptist, and Peter, James and John, whose ministry continue after the grave,’ Metzger said.Right now, there are no plans to build a temple, according to Tyler Crowell, an elder with the Church of Jesus Christ Living Hope Restoration Branch, who is working with Metzger and Joseph Frederick Smith Jr., to bring the three churches together.‘There’s not much any other group can do who don’t currently own the property so the way it’ll come about is really up to God to bring it to pass,’ Crowell told DailyMail.com in Independence.He added: ‘Each group has its own understanding of the scriptures and each group has taken a little bit different path. What I believe needs to happen is we all need to consider what God’s plans were and find our way back to that common place where we all have the same understanding.’Crowell said the Temple Lot is ‘the place where the gathering will begin to bring together the Lord’s people in the Last Days. It will be where the city of New Jerusalem will be established and it will be where the house of the Lord will be built.’There are also differences between the churches on how to interpret the Second Coming – whether it is literal or allegorical – and how it will unfold.‘There are scriptures that say he will suddenly come to his temple… So we do believe he will come here,’ Crowell said. ‘So I don’t know exactly how that’s going to occur but it says like the sun comes up from the East to the West so everyone will see that together.’Jesus Christ will use the temple, which has yet to be built in some churches’ point of view, in Independence to teach, according to both Crowell and Metzger.The Community of Christ has built their temple on the land they own, according to Addams, the historian. They purchased part of the larger acreage after they returned to Independence, said Addams, who wrote the book, ‘Upon the Temple Lot: The Church of Christ’s Quest to Build the House of the Lord,’ after extensive research. ‘The Church of Christ (Temple Lot) on their particular two and three quarters acres in this 63 and one quarter acre parcel, they have believe that they have the exact spot where Joseph Smith stood at the time that he dedicated the ground on August the 3rd, 1831,’ he told DailyMail.com.‘He set a cornerstone, which was really just a rock, and he blazed a tree.’Addams wrote that after Smith arrived in ‘Jackson County, Missouri in 1831, he announced the Lord’s intention to make this location His chosen place for the gathering of His followers. In this revelation, the town of Independence, Missouri was designated as ‘…the center place and a spot for the temple is lying westward, upon a lot which is not far from the court-house.’Smith and his followers had moved to Jackson County because he had received a revelation that the Latter-day Saints should establish a settlement there, Dr Patrick Q. Mason, a Mormon and author who is a professor of religion at Claremont Graduate University, told DailyMail.com.           Above, people form a human chain marking the spot where Joseph Smith, the founder of the Mormon movement, designated in 1831 for a temple to be built for Jesus Christ\u0027s Second Coming. Smith had a revelation from God that the land would be the \u0027center place’ for the Second Coming. The Church of Christ (the white building pictured) owns the 2.75-acre parcel, which is now known as the Temple Lot  On August 3, 1831, Joseph Smith dedicated a spot for the temple that was to be built as a key part of Jesus Christ\u0027s Second Coming. Above (center and right) are markers for the temple. Smith set a cornerstone, which was a rock, for the temple and (left) is the marker for where that stone was found. He also blazed a tree as well          While the three churches that surround the Temple Lot all have the same roots in Joseph Smith\u0027s Mormon movement, which he started in 1830, there are differences in doctrine and gospel interpretationLocal settlers, most of whom were from the South, were upset with the influx of Mormon settlers.‘This is also part of the politics of slavery at the time, Missouri was a slave state, came in under the Missouri Compromise, many of the settlers were from the South, were slave owners, were as most of the Mormons were from the North so there were cultural conflicts almost immediately,’ Mason explained.‘And in 1833, the non-Mormon residents of Jackson County formed a vigilante group or a mob and drove out the Mormons from the county. So the violent conflict actually went back to 1833.’While the Mormons resettled, the same dynamics began to play out again in 1836. Local settlers claimed that they were ‘religious fanatics,’ and were upset that Mormons were preaching to Native Americans and free people of color. In addition, there were economic and political concerns due the Mormons voting for their own candidates, buying land and doing business with one another, Mason said.By 1838, one of Smith’s top church leaders, Sidney Rigdon, gives a sermon on July 4 that Mason paraphrased as: ‘We’re sick of been pushing around. We’re sick of being driven from our homes – it happened now a couple of different times. He says, we’re going to stand up and fight and he said we will wage a war of extermination against any of our enemies who come against us.’‘That language obviously inflames local tensions and so through the summer and early fall you see both sides – both the Mormons and non-Mormons – form their own militias and sort of the line between a militia and a mob at this time is not entirely clear. Both sides claimed that the other militia was illegitimate, both sides believe that their own militia was legitimate.’In August, violence breaks out at a polling place that then escalates to pitched conflict and open battles – what has been called the 1838 Mormon War – ‘with both sides committing depredations against the other,’ he said.Both Mormon and non-Mormon settlements are burned and looted.Meanwhile, Lilburn Boggs, who Mason said had been anti-Mormon since 1833, is elected the state’s governor.   Seventy and Missionary Gary Wayne Metzger of the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ (left) and Elder Tyler Crowell of the Church of Jesus Christ Living Hope Restoration Branch (right) are working on bringing  the three churches that surround the Mormon sacred site in Independence, Missouri together. The three churches share a history and roots in Joseph Smith\u0027s Mormon movement, but have differences in doctrines and interpretation of how Jesus Christ\u0027s Second Coming will happen. Both Metzger and Crowell, shown here in Independence, say that Jesus Christ will use the temple to teach          Pictured above is a first edition of the Book of Mormon. Dr Patrick Q. Mason, a Mormon and author who is a professor of religion at Claremont Graduate University, told DailyMail.com that the Mormon movement started with the book\u0027s publication in 1830Mason said: ‘He’s obviously sympathetic to the non-Mormon militias. They send him reports of Mormon depredations - some of which were true… At that point, Governor Boggs issues the extermination order saying that Mormons had to be driven from the state or they would be exterminated.’‘It’s clear at that point, I mean the Mormons are outgunned, they’re outnumbered, they can’t win going toe to toe against the state and so at that point the Mormons are forced to surrender their arms, which they do, and turn over their leaders. Joseph Smith narrowly averts military execution.’Mason said that this history would be common to the three churches in Independence.He also explained how the word ‘Mormon’ can to be associated with the Latter-day Saints and the many other denominations that trace their roots back to Smith.‘The word Mormon was never officially the name of the church. It was originally a nickname because the followers of Joseph Smith believed in the Book of Mormon. This additional book of scripture that he produced. Really the movement begins with the publication of the Book of Mormon in 1830. So it’s their enemies or their opponents, their critics who first nickname them Mormonites and then that becomes Mormons,’ he said.‘Originally, it’s a derogatory nickname leveled at them by their critics but pretty quickly, the term sticks and pretty quickly church members use it themselves. Joseph Smith referred to himself as a Mormon so they use that term and kind of co-opt it.’Recently, the leader of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which is based in Utah, President Russell M. Nelson, said they do not want to be referred to as Mormons.‘Essentially the issue now is that the president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints says that when we use the word Mormon we’re obscuring, you know, the object of our worship, who is Jesus Christ. He says we’re a Christian church, we worship Jesus Christ, we don’t worship Mormon, when we refer to ourselves as Mormons, we’re not really being true to being true as our identity as Christians,’ said Mason.‘The leadership of the church has given this instruction and so now a lot of members of the church are trying not to use the word even though it’s hard because it’s so ingrained in our discourse.’          Joseph Smith placed the two stones (pictured) as markers for a temple in Independence, Missouri, designating it as a \u0027center place\u0027 for Jesus Christ\u0027s Second ComingThe Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints - now the Community of Christ headquartered in Independence – did not want to be associated with anything having to do with the Utah church, Mason said.‘Those two churches, the Utah-based church and the Missouri-based church, even though they were close cousins… or maybe especially because they were close cousins, they were constantly in tension with one another throughout the 19th and 20th Century. Now the relationships are much more civil.’The Church of Christ, which has always been a much smaller group, wanted to establish their own identity and not be confused with the Utah church.‘All of these smaller churches always struggle with living under the shadow of the much larger Utah church,’ said Mason.‘It’s the 800-pound gorilla and all the other churches always kind of live in its shadow and have been trying for now 150 years to distance themselves and create their own identity separate from the Utah church.’ "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/11/08/19/06609CF6000003E8-6369085-Republicans_have_predicted_a_crisis_for_the_royal_family_when_Ch-a-1_1541704051700.jpg","title":"Viewers heap praise Charles 50 years ahead curve","story":"    In a major documentary to mark his 70th birthday Charles was shown to be a keen environmentalistOne social media user said: \u0027Charles has always been ahead of the times especially when it comes to the environment #PrinceCharles.Another said: \u0027Prince Charles has an Aston Martin that runs on surplus white wine because it\u0027s more efficient and cleaner than petrol, what a lad.\u0027His sons Harry and William sat in an empty cinema theatre to watch a speech by their father in 1970, described by Harry as \u0027amazing.In the speech Prince Charles shows he was a man before his time, talking about \u0027indestructible plastic containers\u0027 and the \u0027mountains of refuse\u0027 we will have to deal with in the future.After the short clip, Prince William said: \u0027The plastics that comes out.\u0027Now it\u0027s a huge topic and he was saying that back in 1970.\u0027The documentary featured candid contributions from family including his sons William and Harry and wife, the Duchess of Cornwall.A number of fascinating facts came out about the heir to the throne, such as he is a workaholic, and often falls asleep at midnight with a memo stuck to his head. The Prince of Wales also denied he would be a \u0027meddling\u0027 monarch when he succeeds to the throne.

The Prince of Wales is described as a \u0027brilliant\u0027 grandfather who will spend hours crawling on the floor and making silly noises with his little granddaughters and grandsonsIn recent years, Charles is said to have privately expressed his frustration that he doesn\u0027t get to see as much of his grandchildren as the Middleton family, a claim his aides have always furiously dismissed.But his elder son makes clear that he would like to have more \u0027family time\u0027 with his hard-working father.William says: \u0027It\u0027s something I\u0027m working more heavily on, put it that way. I think he does have time for it, but I would like him to have more time with the children.\u0027Now he\u0027s reached his 70th year it\u0027s a perfect time to consolidate a little bit because, as most families would do, you are worried about having them around and making sure their health\u0027s OK – and he\u0027s the fittest man I know but equally I want him to be fit until he\u0027s 95.\u0027So having more time with him at home would be lovely, and being able to play around with the grandchildren. \u0027Because when he\u0027s there, he\u0027s brilliant. But we need him there as much as possible.\u0027          If there is one thing the prince\u0027s family is agreed on, it\u0027s their desire – not that he will ever listen – for him to slow downCamilla adds: \u0027He will get down on his knees and crawl about with them for hours, you know making funny noises and laughing, and my grandchildren adore him, absolutely adore him.

But he\u0027s done an amazing job, and without telling us what he should be doing or the direction that we should go in, he\u0027s just let us learn from the nature of the job, learning from him, learning from Mummy.\u0027The programme reveals how Charles would take his sons litter picking when they were on holiday with him.Harry reveals: \u0027He\u0027s a stickler for turning lights off.\u0027And that\u0027s now something that I\u0027m obsessed with as well, which is insane because actually my wife certainly goes \u0027Well why turn the lights off? You know it\u0027s dark\u0027.\u0027I go \u0027We only need one light, we don\u0027t need like six\u0027, and all of a sudden it becomes a habit and those small habit changes he\u0027s making, every single person can do.

He did take to heart the criticism quite a lot when he was younger.\u0027If there is one thing the prince\u0027s family is agreed on, it\u0027s their desire – not that he will ever listen – for him to slow down.Harry jokes: \u0027He does need to slow down, this is a man who has dinner ridiculously late at night.\u0027And then goes to his desk later that night and will fall asleep on his notes to the point of where he\u0027ll wake up with a piece of paper stuck to his face.\u0027  The Queen and Prince Charles surrounded by guests on stage at the Royal Albert Hall in London during a star-studded concert to celebrate the Queen\u0027s 92nd birthday.

So, he has – and it\u0027s frustrated me in the past a lot – he has a routine.\u0027The only way to fit all this stuff in is things have to be compartmentalised. The man never stops.\u0027I mean when we were kids there was bags and bags and bags of work that the office just sent to him. We could barely even get to his desk to say goodnight to him.\u0027The Duchess of Cornwall says she tried to encourage her husband to \u0027pace himself\u0027 but admits he is too driven to take any notice.She smiles ruefully: \u0027My father once said to me, \u0027As you get older, you\u0027ve got to do one thing and that is pace yourself\u0027. And I would love to tell him to pace himself, but I\u0027m afraid that\u0027s not going to happen.\u0027 Charles neatly sums up the way his life has been mapped out before him, with astonishing matter of factness.He says: \u0027When my mama succeeded and became Queen when by grandfather died so young, aged 57, I ended up becoming heir to the throne at aged four.\u0027And yet his wife says it is a weight he bears lightly.Asked whether the crown is something he often thinks about, Camilla says: \u0027No, I don\u0027t. \u0027I think his destiny will come, he\u0027s always known it\u0027s going to come and I don\u0027t think it does weigh on his shoulders at all.\u0027When she is asked if it is something he talks about, the duchess replies: \u0027Not very much, no. It\u0027s just something that\u0027s going to happen.\u0027Asked to give a message to the prince on his birthday, his sons are quick to reply.Harry laughs: \u0027Please have dinner earlier is my message to him! I would encourage him to remain optimistic because I think it can be very easy to become despondent and negative. \u0027But with hopefully his children and his grandchildren and hopefully more grandchildren to come, he can get energy from the family side and then carry on his leadership role.\u0027William adds: \u0027I\u0027m very pleased that he\u0027s made 70. You know if you ask him if the job\u0027s done, it\u0027s not.\u0027But more than anything I\u0027d like to see his passions and his interests and the things he\u0027s been campaigning for come to fruition completely for him. He hasn\u0027t even reached the point that his natural progression should do – i.e. being monarch. So, you know he\u0027s still got his job to do.\u0027  "},{"url":null,"title":"Queen words Harry difficult Meghans choice wedding tiara","story":"    The Queen had words with Prince Harry over his \u0027difficult\u0027 bride\u0027s choice of wedding tiara, it has been claimed          The diamond and platinum bandeau tiara worn by Meghan is on display at the A Royal Wedding exhibition at Windsor Castle, which a royal source claimed was not her preferred optionMeghan picked the tiara from the Queen\u0027s collection during a visit to Buckingham Palace with Prince Harry.And she gave no hint that it wasn\u0027t her first choice.She described her visit to see the Queen and choose a headpiece for her wedding as \u0027an incredibly surreal day\u0027.\u0027I will NOT be a meddling monarch...

Pheasant. Crumble. Pie. Surely it’s either a crumble or a pie, but it can’t be both?After poaching, you cool and shred the pheasant meat (breasts only), strain and reduce the stock, then spike it with sherry. After making a roux with flour and butter, you use the stock to make a thick white sauce. Then you mix it all together, top with breadcrumbs, cheese and bacon before baking in the oven. It sounds ine! Not having the Ritz kitchens, a palace or a personal chef at my disposal, I decide to make it myself. After all, what could possibly go wrong?So I order a pheasant from C Lidgate, the prestigious West London butchers beloved of royals and Richard Branson, but don’t let that put you off. It comes from Norfolk although not the Sandringham Estate, but that is close enough for me. I poach it as instructed, then boil the stock to reduce.Neither Mr Williams nor Prince Charles mention the scum that gathers on the surface, as is usual when boiling fowl. Perhaps you just can’t have that word in a royal recipe? I skim my scum surreptitiously.The breadcrumbs are an outrageous extravagance, fried in 170g of butter, almost three-quarters of a pack. Even after drying them, they are still a mound of engorged butter bombs. To intensify the decadence, parmesan cheese and crispy bacon are added, before the dish is baked in the oven.So what does it taste like? Really rather delicious, although it is incredibly rich. Savoury, soothing and surprisingly economical, it is exactly the kind of comfort food one might expect the Prince of Wales to adore. White meat only and lashings of dairy, with a crispy topping and a buttery overload all add up to a decadent supper fit for a king-to-be.It is retro nursery food given a touch of luxury — the kind of food that has fuelled the Monarchy for hundreds of years.PHEASANT CRUMBLE PIEFor two people:1 pheasant                                                  £4.95Bacon                                                            70pVegetables \u0026amp herbs                               £2Pack of butter                                           £2(Plus a splash of £10-a-bottle sherry)                                                              Cost £9.65                                                    Houses for sale, properties for sale - Country Life"},{"url":null,"title":"Jeremy Corbyn holds meeting head MI6 time","story":"    Jeremy Corbyn has met MI6 boss Alex Younger, pictured, for the first timeJeremy Corbyn has met the boss of MI6 for the first time amid concerns there could be another snap general election.The Labour leader was given a briefing by the intelligence chief on potential threats to the nation.It comes as the potential for another election has been predicted if Theresa May\u0027s Brexit negotiations fail.Jo Johnson\u0027s decision to quit as transport minister saw pro-EU and arch-Brexiteers in the Conservative Party unite to attack the Prime Minister\u0027s stance.Mrs May also had to deal with a challenge from Northern Ireland\u0027s DUP whose support she needs to command a Commons majority.According to the Daily Telegraph, Mr Younger invited Mr Corbyn to MI6\u0027s headquarters in Vauxhall, south London for an \u0027acquaintance session\u0027.A Whitehall source told the paper: \u0027The feeling was that the time had come for Mr Corbyn to become acquainted with the workings of the intelligence establishment.\u0027The source added he received a detailed briefing on MI6\u0027s organisational and operational structure.Today Mr Corbyn also indicated he felt sorry for Prime Minister Theresa May over the EU withdrawal negotiations but said she was following the wrong path and that Brexit \u0027cannot be stopped\u0027.Asked by German magazine Der Spiegel if he would stop Brexit if he could, the Labour leader said: \u0027We can\u0027t stop it.ANDREW PIERCE: Jo Johnson is a modest, reticent and loyal MP...PETER OBORNE: Mrs May’s deal could spark an eruption that...Share this article\u0027The referendum took place.

But are we confusing readability with literary value? “The fascination of what’s difficult,” wrote WB Yeats, “has dried the sap out of my veins ... ” In the press coverage of this year’s Man Booker prize winner, Anna Burns’s Milkman, we’ve read a good many commentators presenting with sapless veins – but a dismaying lack of any sense that what’s difficult might be fascinating.That’s at least a useful starting point. Appiah defends the idea – which, nearly a century after modernism really kicked off, probably shouldn’t need defending – that ease of consumption isn’t the main criterion by which literary value should be assessed. We like to see sportsmen and women doing difficult things. We tend to recognise in music, film, television and the plastic arts that good stuff often asks for a bit of work from its audience. And we’re all on board with “difficult” material as long as it’s a literary classic – we read The Waste Land for our A-levels and we scratched our heads as we puzzled it out, and now we recognise that it is like it is because it has to be that way. So why is “difficult” a problem when it comes to new fiction?Attacking a literary prize for rewarding a book that doesn’t accord with a critic’s ideas about “readability” is simply philistinism. The question is not where the book sits on some notional sliding scale between “challenging” and “page-turner”: it’s how successfully it answers whatever challenge it sets itself. The question isn’t how difficult a book is, but why it’s difficult. What is it doing with its difficulty? What is it asking of the reader? Does that difficulty reward the reader’s investment of time? You’re entitled, as James Marriott did in the Times, to conclude that in this case the view from the top of Snowdon wasn’t worth the hike. But complaining about the hike per se is to give up on the idea that there might be any case for art that rewards an investment of energy and attention from its consumer.And the way Burns talks about Milkman makes clear that, whether we like it or not, she is doing something with the “difficulty” of the novel. One of the things that has most vexed its critics is the fact that none of the characters has a name. That wasn’t an arbitrary decision. “The book didn’t work with names,” she has said. “It lost power and atmosphere and turned into a lesser – or perhaps just a different – book. In the early days I tried out names a few times, but the book wouldn’t stand for it. The narrative would become heavy and lifeless and refuse to move on until I took them out again.” In other words, it is like it is because it has to be that way.Books can be “difficult” in all sorts of different ways. Late Henry James is difficult in a wholly different way than Finnegans Wake is difficult, and Moby-Dick is difficult in a different way to either of those (mostly because of all that sodding scrimshaw). Sometimes the difficulty is a surface difficulty, to do with vocabulary. A Clockwork Orange, for instance, is a challenge to start with – but once you get the hang of Nadsat, it’s easy as pie. Sometimes it’s a formal difficulty. Alan Hollinghurst’s The Stranger’s Child is written in very clear and easy (though very careful) language but it jumps in time and point of view so that the reader spends the beginning of each section wondering, for a page or two, where and when and who the hell they are. Sometimes, as with Faulkner’s The Sound and the Fury, it’s a bit of both. Sometimes it’s a thematic difficulty: Marilynne Robinson asks her readers to engage with theology as well as psychology Chris Kraus’s I Love Dick has a literary-theoretical element. The Great Gatsby is easy-difficult: it presents the reader with no problem paragraph by paragraph, but to appreciate its thematic architecture takes steady attention.Nicola Barker, a novelist who is herself from time to time accused of being difficult, says: “I see fiction as being ided into two categories. Work that confirms and celebrates and panders and work that confounds and perplexes and challenges. My work challenges – as I’m sure Anna Burns’s does – but this is because we are trying to understand and engage with ideas, emotions and a world that aren’t straightforward or coherent or manageable. Sometimes the form or style of a book needs to mirror the complexity of life. Sometimes we need to try and describe the indescribable. Life is hard and paradoxical. It isn’t always easy. Nor should all fiction be.”She adds that, since experimental writers don’t make much money and don’t attract much glamour, “it’s doubly strange that we get so much stick for trying to innovate and challenge and experiment. Experimental fiction is something you write for the love of it. It is rarefied. But it is important because it often forms the foundation of our creative ecosystem. Other artists (musicians, painters, architects etc) higher up the food chain read us and engage with our ideas and translate what we do.”This year, as every year, there have been versions of the old op-ed standby that the Man Booker is succumbing to pretension or political correctness or snobbery or irrelevance. These all make for pleasingly attitudinal headlines but they ignore the glaring point that every single year you get a whole new panel of judges who make a whole new determination from a whole new batch of books. And the complaint that a particular winner “won’t sell” – another gripe levelled at Burns, as it was at last year’s winner, George Saunders – is also beside the point. Boosting book sales is the happy outcome and, in a way, the purpose of these prizes: but to imply that it’s therefore the judges’ job to choose the book most likely to get the biggest sales uplift from the prize is to let the tail wag the dog.“You want the book to go round the world,” says Gaby Wood, the Man Booker’s literary director. “You want it to reach people. But you can’t work with a patronising idea that normal people won’t be able to understand this. I put the question to a previous panel: ‘Are you trying to reward the book that pushes literature forward the most or are you wanting to select the book that you most want to push into the hands of people all round the world?’ The difficulty comes when, for a panel, the answers to those questions are different books. That has happened, and it can be agonising. This year though, Anna Burns was felt to be the answer to both.”Easy good books will, with a bit of luck, find their audiences easy bad books will do so too, because they are often fun in spite of or because of their badness. Difficult bad books will tend to die in a ditch and difficult good books, without a helping hand, are likely to do so too. Think of prizes like the Folio, Man Booker and next week’s Goldsmiths as that helping hand. Having a panel of serious and thoughtful critics giving a lot of time to noticing something that might otherwise not be widely noticed can’t, surely, be a bad thing. These prizes are set up to reward the best literary fiction. Here, though, something of a definitional abyss opens. What the hell is “literary fiction”?I’ve heard it said, and it’s an attractive position, that “literary fiction needs to recognise that it’s just another genre and get over itself”. Fair enough. Let’s explore that. I think it’s a pious cop-out to declare, as some do: “There aren’t literary books and popular books: there are just good books and bad books.” If we’re going wilfully to retreat from analysis, we may as well fold our tents as critics. There are indeed good and bad books but books also succeed and fail – and are responded to by readers – in relation to the genres they fit into or escape from.Like it or not, literary fiction is a category that we use. And if it is just another genre and needs to get over itself, fine. Let’s work with that. We can identify features of other genres. Aliens and nanobots? SF, more often than not. Guns and hats and dead bodies? Crime. Dossiers and dead drops? Spy novels. So we ought to be able to make some, if necessarily vague, stabs at identifying what the features of “literary fiction” are. Let’s leave aside cultural value judgments about “importance” or “seriousness”. Literary fiction can, like most fiction, be unimportant. It can also be unserious: some of the best of it is. I’d call Italo Calvino’s If on a Winter’s Night a Traveller literary fiction, but it doesn’t strike me as either important or serious. It’s a glorious game.It’s sometimes fuzzily said that literary fiction gives you more on rereading, or that it stays with you, or that it’s “more profound”. That may be true, some of the time – but these things are more likely to be symptoms than necessary features. I’d suggest that the main identifying feature – and in this respect literary writing can and does compass and mingle with any number of other genres – is to do with complexity and depth of attention. That can be moral or psychological complexity – crudely, the goodies and baddies are less clearly delineated – but it can also be, and tends to be in the best work, allied to a greater attention to the form and to the sentence-by-sentence language itself. And where I say that it mingles with other genres, the point I mean to make is that (just like hats, or nanobots) its features can be found in any genre. You could make the case that Iain M Banks’s Culture novels are literary SF, that Sarah Waters has written literary historical thrillers, that Joseph Kanon or John le Carré write literary spy novels, that the metafictional quality of The Murder of Roger Ackroyd is a literary quality, and so on. The examples are numberless.A publishing acquaintance suggests an analogy with music: jazz is more complex than blues. It’s harder to play and harder to appreciate. That doesn’t mean there isn’t lots of good blues and lots of bad jazz. It doesn’t mean that jazz is an innately superior artform. It simply describes a formal difference between the two. Likewise, when we talk about a “literary novel” we usually mean something that demands and rewards close attention – though, as ever, there will be exceptions. The quality of that attention isn’t uniform from novel to novel. You don’t, for instance, read the torrential riffings of a Thomas Pynchon or even a Karl Ove Knausgaard the same way as you do the crystalline exactness of Nabokov. And those qualities will, for reasons that should be obvious, sometimes but not always issue in “difficulty”.If plot is the main engine of the reader’s attention, the author will often (but not always) write in a way that’s designed to draw the reader effortlessly from page to page: windowpane prose, clear and quick. If the author is doing something else, or something as well, they may want to slow you down. They may be interested in a voice, or an atmosphere, or (as modernists and postmodernists are) in jiggering with the form of the novel itself. There’s a decent literary-theoretical argument for formal jinxiness, too. Naturalist fiction presents one account of the world – and it lulls you into the idea that it’s the only one. Marxist critics have made the fair point that a genre frames an account of reality: 19th-century bourgeois realism, say, presents in its very conventions a worldview. It selects – from its subject matter and setting to its forms of narration – a way of seeing things that implicitly normalises them. If the core of your novel is whether the well-off young white people on the plantation fall in love, the social set-up in which they are embedded takes a back seat in the reader’s consideration. Or to take a non-political example, Kurt Vonnegut remarked that he hated to put love stories into his novels because: “If a lover in a story wins his true love, that’s the end of the tale, even if World War III is about to begin, and the sky is black with flying saucers.”So the form of a narrative is a political (or phenomenological) decision rather than a natural state of the order of things. The free indirect style, the omniscient narrator, the stream of consciousness, or whatever your means of telling: all are profoundly artificial and historically determined, and a writer is quite within his or her rights to mix that up a bit – to draw attention to its artificiality, or to explore ways of complicating the reader’s engagement with his or her imaginative world. The novelist and critic Gabriel Josipovici, in What Ever Happened to Modernism?, tends to argue (if I read him right) that it’s not so much a right as a duty.But formal self-consciousness or narrative tricksiness aren’t, in themselves, difficult. Some bestselling literary writers – Ian McEwan, for instance – are full of metafictional touches, embedding books within books and playing around with unreliable narrators. Most people would see Vonnegut’s Slaughterhouse-Five as a work of literary SF – and it jumps around wildly but it’s not a difficult book (I don’t think) to read. And David Mitchell – as radio-friendly a unit-shifter as literary fiction now has – is forever playing with structure and voice. Cloud Atlas, which was what really put him on the map, is a polyphonic novel of multiple genres structured like a Russian matryoshka doll. Yet as Mitchell says, he feels giving pleasure is part of his contract with the reader – a courtesy if you’re asking them to invest the several hours they will spend reading your book.So let’s not assume that challenging work is like some sort of joyless high-fibre diet. Many if not most of the great modernists and postmodernists weren’t just formally challenging: they were outright funny. Samuel Beckett, laureate as he was of existential despair, is wildly funny. So is James Joyce. So, in his pinstriped way, is TS Eliot. More recently, David Foster Wallace is almost dementedly prankish, as is Pynchon. AL Kennedy’s Costa-winning Day, about bomber pilots in the second world war, is a book of high seriousness and some narrative complexity, but is full of jokes. Tom McCarthy’s Satin Island contains, for my money, the funniest gag on that year’s Booker shortlist. And it’s notable that many of those who have enjoyed Milkman commend it not for being solemn or profound but for being funny.All this is not to say that some difficult novels are not truly ghastly. If hypocrisy is the tribute that vice pays to virtue, you could say that pretentiousness is the tribute that mediocrity pays to genius. I remember a colleague on a judging panel surveying the gathered novels and saying, with a certain roll of the eyes: “There’s a lot of ... fine writing in here.” By this he meant overwrought bad writing. The idea of literary fiction – in particular the idea that it is intrinsically high-status or, worse, “important” – is the rock on which many ambitious second-rate writers bark their shins. It’s what gives us plotless novels choked with portentous metaphors and pseudo-profound ruminations, novels that mistake difficulty for accomplishment or, worse, solemnity for seriousness. It’s what gives us, in parody, the “octuple time scheme and sixteen unreliable narrators” of Richard Tull’s unreadable seventh novel in Martin Amis’s The Information. Just because literary fiction doesn’t necessarily tell a story (though it usually at some level does), and frequently spars with its own form, and tends to pay attention to its language, it doesn’t mean that by turning all those things up to 11 you’ve created a worthwhile work of art. And it’s for just that reason that, year by year, we should be grateful rather than indignant that panels of judges on literary prizes labour to bring to our attention those difficult books that really are worth our time.The Waves by Virginia WoolfWoolf set out to “record the atoms as they fall upon the mind” and The Waves is an experiment in doing this without the usual narrative scaffolding. The lives of six characters are told through their revolving thoughts. This can feel hard to navigate, but if you persevere there’s an intense sensory world to be discovered.The Golden Bowl by Henry JamesJames is notorious for his complicatedly meandering sentences and this late novel takes it to a new level. It’s not only the prose that’s difficult, the plot itself becomes more about what characters know about each other than what they are actually doing. It’s the ultimate novel for people interested in charting every nuance and detail of human relationships.Beloved by Toni MorrisonThe legacies of slavery and their intersections with patriarchy might seem subjects too difficult for scrupulous novelistic treatment. Morrison’s book throws the discoveries of high modernist style and the fiery drives of gothic horror at the task and creates something uniquely unsettling and appallingly convincing. Beloved makes readers suffer, but our suffering enlarges our world.The Unconsoled by Kazuo IshiguroIshiguro’s Booker prize-winning The Remains of the Day exemplified the user friendly literary novel for a generation of readers. He followed it with a book so intricate and sly that it feels like the cleverest revenge he could have wreaked on himself and his readers for that earlier triumph.Tristram Shandy by Laurence SterneThis takes nothing for granted about what a novel is meant to be. Ostensibly the autobiography of the narrator, it piles digression on digression and plays tricks with readers’ expectations. But Sterne’s love of life and his commitment to his characters’ psychic curlicues animate every page. Difficulty has never been so much fun.Ulysses by James JoyceJoyce’s extravagant cartography of a single day in Dublin makes every possible demand on the reader, from secret mythical references to diffuse exploration of streams of consciousness. Ulysses made difficulty central to the modernist aesthetic, but Joyce also delights in the baseness of the flesh and is unsettlingly funny and mischievous.A Girl Is a Half-formed Thing by Eimear McBrideMcBride’s title tells us not to believe that any way of describing ourselves and our world should be seen as fixed. Her prose takes us inside bodily experience and the inchoate recesses of personal identity in forensic, giddying ways.The Golden Notebook by Doris LessingLessing’s epochal feminist novel is deeply ambivalent about feminism, as it is about everything else, including its own structure. But it also shows how rich and revealing ambivalence itself can be. By structuring the novel as five interwoven notebooks, Lessing sends her characters wheeling through endless different attitudes towards their complex identities.Doctor Faustus by Thomas MannMann’s tale of a composer and his pact with the demonic elements convulsing his own talent and modern German history is a fierce gateway into the grand European modernist landscape. It’s the complexity of his interpretation of history and culture that makes the novel so compelling.Outline by Rachel CuskCusk follows in the tradition of The Waves in evacuating the novel of what we expect of character and description, instead charting with pin-point coolness the terms of our disconnection from one another. In so doing, the deepest truths that connect people emerge. Cusk’s trilogy has shown how many new types of difficulty we still need and enjoy in the 21st century.• Lara Feigel is the author of Free Woman: Life, Liberation and Doris Lessing (Bloomsbury)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b8ea09b09b31fc8fa5ef124b869dd874cb8bd294/0_35_3414_2049/master/3414.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ba564d4d27373590f5069b4258dc7a63","title":"uk mamils targeted in virtual spin class pelotons 50m splurge","story":"The $4bn US firm wants European domination - starting with middle-aged men in Lycra Peloton, the virtual spin class aiming to be the Netflix of fitness, has already saddled up celebrity fans including David Beckham and Hugh Jackman. Now it is spending £50m in the UK as part of a bid to sign up 1 million members in Europe.The New York-based company has given the exercise bike a high-tech spin, adding a screen on which subscribers can live stream or download classes filmed at the company’s Manhattan studio, while interacting with other Peloton members via social media. Instructors can interact with hundreds of fitness fans riding along at home.Valued at $4bn after raising $550m this summer from investors led by the private equity firm TCV, which has previously backed Netflix, Spotify and Facebook, the company will launch a multi-million pound national TV and digital billboard advertising campaign later this month and is building its first fitness studio outside the US in London’s Covent Garden.David Minton, the director of fitness market analysts DBLeisure, said: “They have got so much money this is like McDonalds doing a national TV ad when it just has one shop. It’s a bit of a landgrab.”Peloton has hired two British instructors who will begin live streaming classes from London next week. It wants to take on up to eight more in the the next couple of years as it uses London as its base for European expansion. It has also signed up six pop-up shops in London and is looking for premises in northern cities such as Manchester.Peloton faces competition from New Zealand’s Les Mills, a company which made its name in the 1990s by creating the Bodypump fitness class. It has been streaming virtual fitness classes to gyms in the UK for several years and offers on demand classes, which can be done at home without equipment.The company has now teamed up with the exercise bike maker Stages to offer a service similar to Peloton’s in the UK.Both firms are trying to catch a ride on a growing niche within the buoyant fitness market in the UK, as ageing baby boomers invest in staying healthy, while younger generations put time and money into ensuring they are selfie-fit.Kevin Cornils, the managing director of Peloton’s international ision, said London was the obvious next step for the company because of the surge in high-end boutique gyms in the capital in recent years.The eager adoption of road cycling by high spending “Mamils” – middle-aged men in Lycra - also offers a potentially lucrative market. The company is trying to tempt them in by hiring pro cyclists such as Christian Vande Velde to lead classes that offer tailored playlists for fans of hip hop or 1980s music.“You have got the Mamil community here which we don’t have in the US,” said Kevin Cornils, managing director of Peloton’s international ision. “They were initially cynical about spin classes but they are ready to spend the right amount of money to get good equipment.

Do you glow with good health? Are you springing out of bed every morning? Are you mindful of every moment? Feeling like each day is truly #blessed?You may feel you are dealing with quite enough questions these days, from “Should I start building a nuclear bunker in the garden?” to “Wait, how long do we have to save the Earth from global warming?” But the question of whether you are living your best life, in which you feel amazing, look amazing, do amazing things and all in a – crucially – photogenic way, has become a modern preoccupation. Facebook and in particular Instagram exist solely so we can demonstrate to our friends that we are living our very best lives, and I believe those apps are quite popular these days. Yesterday I read an article about how getting at least eight hours’ sleep will make me feel my absolute best, only then to read another article about how every successful person wakes up at 5am, and the inherent contradiction gave me insomnia.This fascination has led to the rise of what is definitely my new favourite journalism genre: the daily routine diary. Someone describes every minute of their day so that – it is heavily implied – we can learn from them, because nothing helps you live your best life better than living someone else’s. “I wake at 5am and do some shadow yoga for 45 minutes before drinking a cup of tea made from ginger root and mushroom extract, which I make myself in a pewter bowl I bought while trekking in Tibet. I like to drink it while listening to birdsong,” is the general tone. Mark Wahlberg got stick a few months back when he posted his daily routine on Instagram, which involves waking at 2.30am to fit in three hours of prayer and exercise before dawn an A-list star living the life of a penitent monk. But it was only a slight exaggeration of what these diaries are like, because like most things that are presented as aspirational, they make everyone involved look insane.Last month, Business Insider website published the routine diary of a twentysomething HSBC executive called Melania Edwards in California, who turned out to be living such a perfect life that some doubted either she or her life existed at all. Edwards wakes at 5.30am (lazybones) to meditate, play tennis, drink green sludge (“breakfast”) and “catch up with friends across Europe, Asia and the US”. She perhaps pushed it too far with the description of her evenings, in which she takes a course at Stanford, does yoga and works to help women in Papua New Guinea. “In my spare time, I try to give back,” she explained. Sadly for Papua New Guinea, ever since the article was published, Edwards has been forced to spend her free time giving interviews to sceptical publications, in which she plaintively insists that, “I am a real person.”Melania, I never doubted it. But I did puzzle over who would want to live like her – or any of her fellow daily routine diarists. From fashion blogger Leandra Medine telling the  that she socialises between 5pm and 7pm so as to be in bed by 8.30pm, to Barack Obama’s wild night-time snack of seven almonds, these people may be living their best lives but they never sound like they’re living fun lives.“Maximalising potential” is the aim, although that potential is invariably code for work productivity or exercise. Maximalising one’s potential to lie on the sofa and watch Frasier reruns is, sadly, less advocated. Living life to the full now means exhausting amounts of achievement, asceticism, expensive good health, unstructured jobs and very structured fun. It is a life of outward show as opposed to one of inner contentment.It’s a shame, not least because the greatest routine diaries describe a very different approach – such as Hunter S Thompson’s, in which he wakes at 3pm, and at 6am enjoys champagne, ice-cream and fettuccine alfredo in a hot tub. A 1978 diary shared by the Doctor Who actor Tom Baker begins with him waking in a strange house at 5.15am and ends with him knocking back Valium in a Soho club.We’ve gone from one extreme to the other, which is human nature. But to give all of you something perhaps a little easier to aim for, here is my very own day-in-the-life. 6.30am Woken up by two toddlers jumping on my head.6.31am Pretend to be asleep while simultaneously staring at my phone.7am Get up, give toddlers breakfast, eat half a loaf of bread to wake myself up.7.35–8.45am Wash and dress myself, do the same to one toddler, repeat.8.45am–noon Drop them off at their nursery, drop myself off at my nursery, AKA the office.

Debbie McGee on life without magician Paul Daniels, grief and their unconventional loveLast year it was voted TV’s greatest comedy putdown: in 1995, the spoof TV host Mrs Merton asked Debbie McGee: “What first, Debbie, attracted you to the millionaire Paul Daniels?” Daniels was 56 at the time, a successful magician and not much of looker McGee was 36, his glamorous assistant. It was a brilliantly witty question, delivered by Caroline Aherne – but it doesn’t take long in McGee’s company to realise it was an unfair one.It’s now two and a half years since Daniels died, aged 77, during which time his widow has suffered something of an existential crisis: after all, she lost not only her husband but her professional partner of four decades. “I worried that the phone might stop ringing. I got offered a few things, but they were all linked to losing him. They weren’t jobs that were going to sustain me.”But the phone did ring, and over the past year she has proved herself a successful entertainer in her own right, notably on the last season of Strictly Come Dancing, in which she reached the final with Giovanni Pernice. “Even now, people keep coming up and saying how inspiring I’ve been,” she says. “To think people want to join a gym or a dance class because of you! That gave me a lift. Dame Julie Walters said that, for Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again, the cast got their inspiration from me. It feels amazing.”We meet at her home in Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire. The garden is grand and gorgeous – a lawn sweeping down to the river, swans gliding regally past. (McGee points out that it’s not nearly as grand as the previous house she shared with Daniels, which was set in 14 acres.) Inside, you can’t move for mementoes: a chest of drawers covered in playing cards a surprisingly macho topless photo of Daniels the rabbits they used in their stage act (now pets, rather than professionals). “One is called Hopper Seven because she was born the same week as the Beckham baby Harper Seven. Paul adored the rabbits. He used to sit with the little one on his shoulder while he was on the computer.”McGee shows me around the house. At 60, she is a petite, platinum blond in sparkly sandals and a Prosecco T-shirt. In one room, there is a lifesize painting of her in a wedding dress, which was used in a trick they performed on TV. “It was called the Artist’s Dream – the painting came alive and I stepped out of it.”One of the criticisms of The Paul Daniels Magic Show – which at its peak had 15 million Saturday-night viewers, and was transmitted in 43 countries – was that McGee was largely mute. That wasn’t Daniels’ idea, she says. “That was because the directors at the BBC thought I should be kept in the background.” Still, it is astonishing how much of her time on TV was spent being abused or disappeared by Daniels if he was not cremating her, he was manacling her, stabbing her, locking her in fish tanks and rubbish bins. In one trick he caged her, but for the big reveal she was free – with Daniels himself behind bars. In a rare moment when McGee took the lead, she told the audience: “No, I won’t let him out. See you next week!”Daniels was a Marmite magician. Many loved him for his skill, his stories, his showmanship, his catchphrases (“You’ll like this... not a lot, but you’ll like it”). His detractors found him annoying – defensive, unfunny, boastful, with a hint of small-man syndrome. If he wasn’t counting his acres, he’d be totting up his Ferraris and Bentleys. But McGee insists this was all bravado that the real man was nothing like that. “I think he was totally misunderstood. Paul was from Middlesbrough and people from the north-east are quite abrupt and say what they think. Journalists made him out to be this very hard, conceited person, but he was a real people person. There was no side to him, no snobbery. He was a really kind person.” She looks on the verge of tears.When the film of the Debbie McGeePaul Daniels love story is finally made, it will open against the backdrop of Iran’s Islamic Revolution. If it hadn’t been for Ayatollah Khomeini, the couple would almost certainly never have got together.McGee was a talented young dancer, who attended the Royal Ballet school and got a teaching diploma. She was ambitious, adventurous and wanted to make money. “I said, ‘If I don’t make it in showbusiness, I’ll go and do something else – I’m not going to be poor.’ I loved watching all the Hollywood movies, so I always dreamed of living in a big house.” At 18, she discovered she could make a fortune dancing for the Iranian National Ballet. “I did a bit of research and found out they had loads of money. They were hiring top choreographers from around the world, like Alvin Ailey from New York.” At 19, she set off for Tehran, planning to stay three years. She was paid £550 a week, much more than the £120 she had been earning in Britain. Life was wonderful – until the revolution intervened.McGee says she very nearly didn’t get out. “Have you seen the movie Argo with Ben Affleck? That’s exactly what I went through. I had to pay 10 times what a plane ticket should cost to get home. They were closing the airport that day. When I finally got to the airport, they threw me in an office and said I couldn’t get on the plane. After about an hour, this guy stamped my passport and said: ‘Run’.”Having spent all her savings on getting home, she needed a job urgently. The ballet companies were full, so she auditioned for a summer cabaret season. “I went to a massive audition with about 1,000 girls, and they chose around 50 of us. Eight were put with Des O’Connor, eight were with Little and Large, and eight were with Paul Daniels. I’d never heard of him. I came home and said, ‘I’ve got this contract for four and a half months with this guy called Paul Daniels, what does he do?’ My parents said, ‘Oh, he’s a magician.’ Well, I didn’t like magic because I’d only seen bad magic.”McGee adored Daniels from the off. “We had an instant chemistry. He made me laugh.” Even though he was much older than her? “He had so much more energy than me, anyway, and a joie de vivre. I never really thought of his age.”But Daniels did. For a number of years, their relationship was on-off. They worked together throughout, but Daniels would regularly suggest they split up. “He’d say that the press would call me a gold-digger and crucify me. He kept me at bay. He said, ‘Go and find someone your own age.’ ” He was right, of course: “Even though we were married far longer than most other people in showbusiness, they continued to say I was a gold-digger.”Early on, McGee decided to play second fiddle to Daniels. “I was extremely driven, career-wise. But when we got married I looked around, and the people who work apart don’t stay together in our business. I was offered tours of musicals, but I didn’t take them because I didn’t want to be away from Paul for six months. I don’t have any regrets about that.”Documentary makers and reality television shows were fascinated by their relationship. In 2001, Louis Theroux made a programme about them, When Louis Met Paul And Debbie, spending months in their company. McGee says it took them a while to realise that, while traditional TV likes to show stars at their best, reality shows were set on exposing their flaws. “Afterwards Louis said that, on the final morning, his exec producer told him: ‘Go in heavy, there must be a crack somewhere’, and he said, ‘No, I really like them, and there isn’t.’”Daniels was eccentric and old-fashioned in one memorable scene from the Theroux documentary, McGee delivered his breakfast cereals to him on a trolley like a hotel waitress in another, he literally whistled for her. But above all, what emerged was the love they shared. McGee insists it’s the best PR exercise they ever did.Not everything they did was as successful. In 2007, McGee and Daniels took part in a celebrity version of Wife Swap with Vanessa Feltz and her partner Ben Ofoedu. This time, Daniels came across as a humourless tyrant, demanding three cooked meals a day and complaining that Feltz didn’t dress for supper as McGee did. “It’s the only programme I’ve ever regretted doing,” McGee says. “I could feel the manipulation.” But she will defend Daniels to the death, and beyond. “Even now, Vanessa says Paul is brilliant and intelligent. They were just very uncomfortable with each other.”Documentaries often failed to show everything they had in common, she says. Both came from working-class families with a fierce work ethic. (Her father worked in a factory that made wedding rings her mother had a part-time job in a factory making transmitters.) Both were determined to be successful and to enjoy the fruits of that success. Neither of them wanted children. Daniels already had three boys from his first marriage, and motherhood never appealed to her. “People who wanted children either said they wanted to recreate themselves, they wanted somebody to look after them when they were old, or there was a void in their life that they wanted to fill. And I didn’t have any of those feelings.”McGee’s mother and sister Donna are staying with her for a few days. Donna, who helps manage McGee’s affairs and is a dead ringer for her, rustles up a plate of smoked salmon sandwiches for us. It seems that magic has now become the family business. Donna’s son James Phelan has become a magician, as has Paul’s son Martin, who works on cruise ships and has incorporated part of Daniels’ routine into his act. Meanwhile Daniels’ grandson Lewis, a student at Liverpool university, has started dabbling. “Paul would just love it,” McGee says.Is she close to all three of Daniels’ sons? “I’m close to two of them. The third one, Paul, doesn’t talk to me.” Soon after Daniels died, according to his eldest son, Paul Junior, McGee shut the Paul Daniels Magic Party Shop that Paul and Paul Junior had opened in Wigan in 2007. In October 2016, Paul Junior told the Sun on Sunday: “Debbie McGee is nothing but a false witch who will struggle to survive without my father’s name attached to her.”By the time she appeared on the Mrs Merton show, she was no longer simply Debbie McGee she was “the lovely Debbie McGee”. She cites this epithet as an example of Daniels’ genius for branding from the first show they did together, he introduced her this way. “That’s how his brain worked. He knew that would get me noticed.” (Some years ago, Daniels bought her a 1930s boat, which he renamed The Lovely Debbie McGee. Was that another branding exercise? “No, that was just him being lovely. The boat was called It’ll Do at the time.” Today, it is berthed close to McGee’s house.)This awareness about their brand even extended to his famous hairpieces, McGee says. She lets me in on a well-kept secret: Daniels wasn’t actually bald when he started wearing wigs – he was planning for the future. “When I first met him he had loads of hair, even though he wore a wig. He was a realist. He always said his wig was a business plan. He was a bit older, around 30, and he saw younger people coming up, and his hair was very slowly receding, so he thought, ‘If I start wearing a wig now, by the time I’ve gone bald nobody will know that I’ve just plonked a wig on.’” She says he took great pleasure in his wigs. “He used to sneeze at parties and it would go across the room. He’d do anything to make people laugh.”In 1994 the show was axed after 15 years. Daniels and McGee had fallen out of fashion, making way for a new generation of illusionists such as David Blaine and Derren Brown, less redolent of a bygone era of seaside shows and double entendres. At times, Daniels sounded bitter. In 2014, he complained: “I have not seen anything new on television in about 20 years.” It was 20 years, exactly, since the BBC had pulled the plug. But McGee insists the move away from television gave them a new life. “It freed us up. Paul said he didn’t realise how much pressure he’d been under because, until that point, 12 months a year for all those years, he had always been researching for the TV show. We could start going on holiday. It was liberating.” The live shows and lucrative corporate work allowed McGee to develop her side of the act. Rather than the magician’s assistant, she became more the magician’s partner, joining the Magic Circle and performing tricks in her own right.They worked until the very end. Daniels was diagnosed with a brain tumour a month before he died, and was weak only for the final five days of his life. “He just slipped away. We were lucky.”After Daniels died, McGee says it took her a year to sleep normally. “You wake up in the middle of the night, and that’s your grief.” How do you come to terms with it? “I don’t know… You just learn how to live without them. You have to accept that they’re gone. The toughest time for me is in the morning, because we always had breakfast together and sat and talked. Somebody said to me, ‘Change your routine’, and that really helped. So when I’m not working, I get up and go out to the gym, and have my breakfast there.”It has been a slow, complicated process, she says. “When somebody dies, first you feel somebody’s dropped you in the ocean and you’re treading water and you don’t know which direction to take. There’s no steering wheel. I’d always been focused, knew what I wanted, where I wanted to go, and suddenly all that went.” Does she get any comfort from doing magic? “Since Paul died I can’t face it. I can’t even bear to think of being on the stage.”It’s time to leave – McGee has to record her Sunday show for Radio Berkshire, where, inevitably, she is trailed as “the lovely Debbie McGee”. She gives me a lift to the railway station in her Range Rover – the biggest thing she has bought since Daniels’ death. As she drives, I mention one thing we’ve not talked about: sex. Daniels was obsessed with the subject, oversharing about everything from his number of conquests to the bedroom games he and McGee would play. Did she get upset by his boasts about having had 300 lovers? “Oh no!” She smiles. Did he talk to you about them? “Well, some of them I knew, obviously. But you don’t talk about 300 of them, that’s for sure.” Could she compete with him for lovers? “Definitely not. Definitely not. People thought he was cocky and conceited, but that’s what was so lovable about Paul – he was who he was. When he said things it wasn’t to show off. He just told the truth.”In his memoir, Under No Illusion, Daniels wrote of an occasion when he had written a Do Not Disturb sign on his back because he was working. “Eventually I went to bed and Debbie was lying stark naked on the bed – eat your heart out fellas! She was wearing the sort of sleeping blindfold you get on long-haul flights. Printed on it was Do Not Disturb. But further down her body she had a sign that said ‘Disturb!’”Did she wish he was a tad more discreet? She laughs. “I just accepted that was Paul.” Was it all true? “That bit was. That’s why we were married for so long. We were very unpredictable, we made each other laugh. We were always leaving jokey notes. There’s no way he could have done anything when he saw that note because he was laughing so much.”We arrive at the station. McGee has spent so long talking about Daniels she’s barely mentioned her own ambitions. She says she’d love a chat show on Radio 2, more reality TV, maybe even a new man at some point. For the first time, she says, she is beginning to see herself as Debbie McGee, rather than the quieter half of a celebrity couple. Over the past year she has become a regular on the small screen, competing in the quiz show Impossible Celebrities, and walking the Camino de Santiago for the BBC reality show Pilgrimage. “The TV work has helped give me more of my iniduality. I am beginning to feel like my own person.”I ask if people treat her differently. She nods. “The public were always lovely to Paul and me. I think it’s because we were approachable. They would come up and say, ‘I used to love watching you when I was a kid.’ But they weren’t affectionate. Now I can walk into a shop and a lady will walk up to me and give me a hug, not saying anything, and just walk away.”• Commenting on this piece?

Check out kitsch memorabilia, clothing with Chinese motifs, and Hong Kong-made backpacks In the narrow, lantern-filled streets of Central and Tsim Sha Tsui (TST) – under looming mirrored skyscrapers and a hot tropical sun – Hong Kong becomes a city dedicated to eating and shopping. Visitors on a consumption high lurch from buzzing dim sum restaurants to bustling markets, gorging on truffle wontons and debating exactly how often they’d use a 10-part porcelain tea set back home. Of the hundreds of Cantonese restaurants, aromatic medicine shops and colourful boutiques stocked with local goods that line the city’s streets, the following examples in particular capture the essence of Hong Kong with aplomb.Ho Lee Fook Directly translating as “good fortune in your mouth” in English, the name of this colourful Cantonese restaurant sounds a lot like the exclamation diners make after tasting the tender roast wagyu short ribs with soy glaze, the Taiwanese chicken or the threadfin fish with Jamaican-Chinese jerk rub. The Hong Kong theme is strong throughout – think a giant shimmering bronze dragon covering one wall, while the steps leading down to the restaurant are lined with hundreds of golden toy cats raising a single paw in salute. It’s no reservations, so avoid prime time – or factor in a few strong cocktails at the bar while you wait.Jimmy’s KitchenIf only walls could talk. Jimmy’s Kitchen has been around since 1928 and has been serving western food to celebrities, politicians and particularly homesick expats for nearly a century. Today, this icon from the colonial era is packed every night with locals who come to immerse themselves in the nostalgic decor and delightfully old-fashioned attitude to food. Popular with megastars like Cary Grant and John Wayne back in the day, its menu has barely been updated since the 1950s – think steak and kidney pie and baked pork knuckle. And it is hard to imagine anywhere else in Asia where you can wallow in the past and order a steak diane, a baked alaska and white Russian for dinner.Goods of Desire With quirky bed linen, novelty stationery and posters big enough to jazz up entire rooms, Goods of Desire has been the go-to store for cool furniture and lifestyle items with a Hong Kong sense of humour since the days of the British. Launched by two architects aiming to repackage Hong Kong heritage brands into kitsch furniture, fun fashion, and quirky art for the younger generation, it has also been deliberately provocative over the years, with a number of slogans aimed at the city’s notorious Triad gangs. Today it’s beloved by tourists and the city’s legions of expats, who stock up on Hong Kong memorabilia before they head home. Try the PMQ (Police Married Quarters) branch for its tiny dim sum restaurant and potent drinks list.Vivienne TamShe designed her first womenswear collection in 1993 and over the past two and a half decades, Hong Kong-raised designer Vivienne Tam has become a household name. Today she’s the territory’s most famous fashion export, and has been credited with paving the way for Chinese designers in western fashion capitals. You’ll see why in her seven sleek emporiums that are dotted around the city.

The movie, tipped by some for Oscars recognition, will be released later this month.According to Dick Schulz, a freelance director who was present and tweeted about the conversation, which was about race in America, Mortensen said: “For instance, no one says ‘nigger’ anymore.”“The movie is amazing,” Schulz wrote, “but at the Q\u0026ampA after Viggo Mortensen just dropped the N-Word and the oxygen immediately left the room.”He added: “I have no idea why this isn’t a big news story. Viggo is wildly talented but that kind of behavior needs to be publicly checked.”Schulz also wrote that “it was one of the weirdest things I’ve ever witnessed”.Other Twitter users who were present at the Q\u0026ampA confirmed the events described in Schulz’s tweets, the Hollywood Reporter said.Mortensen told the Reporter he was making the point that many people casually used the slur in the period in which the movie is set.He also said he had “no right to even imagine the hurt that is caused by hearing the word in any context”, added that he intended to “speak strongly against racism”, and said he was sorry he used the word."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/54e081b960061b5b8dda7181955330c27b1f0230/0_189_5669_3402/master/5669.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2bc272447df393c72d8acba506eead49","title":"wallace gromit producers hand stake in business to staff","story":"Peter Lord and David Sproxton, who founded the UK’s biggest animation production company while still at school, are set for a multimillion-pound payout as part of the deal, under which they will together continue to own a quarter of Aardman Holdings, the company’s parent group.From their early days making hand-drawn animations which they sold to the BBC while still teenagers, the pair now oversee an international group responsible for animated feature films such as the Oscar winning The Curse of the Were-Rabbit and this year’s Early Man, as well as video games and adverts for companies from DFS to Chevron.On Friday, the company brought out its first major console game 11:11: Memories Retold, which follows two characters on opposing sides of the first world war, and Shaun the Sheep Movie: Farmageddon will be released next year.It also makes millions from merchandising and licensing the rights to characters, putting Shaun the Sheep and Wallace \u0026amp Gromit on everything from cafes to cushions around the world.Aardman Holdings is expected to make sales of £30m this year and profits of about £2.5m, similar to last year, boosted by income from selling the rights to Shaun the Sheep, who now appears on theme parks in Japan and Sweden.Sproxton and Lord told the  the employee ownership scheme was being funded out of the company’s cash reserve which stood at £18m in December last year, according to the latest accounts filed at Companies House.Sproxton said: “We are balancing what we are comfortable taking out and what doesn’t stress the company out. We have been thinking about this a long time and built up considerable cash reserves so we could do this without borrowing any money.”Employees will own their majority stake in the business via a trust, similar to the way the John Lewis Partnership is organised.The 140 employees, and freelancers, of which there are currently 180 working for Aardman, will also continue to receive a share of profits. Anyone who has worked for the company for at least three months of any financial year is entitled to a bonus.Staff will have an input into the running Aardman via a workers council, while the senior team will sit on a new board of directors which will lead the business and decide on the staff bonus, reporting to the trust’s board.The company is aiming to appoint a replacement for Sproxton, who acts as managing director, within the next year after which he will step back to become a consultant to the business. Lord will remain in his role as creative director for the company for up to five years, but a new creative head of feature films will be hired.“We’re not quitting yet,” said Lord. “We are doing this because we love the company and because we love it we think this will be the best things for it. This is not about David and I leaving. It is a continuity deal.“We always believed that independence was our strong suit. We didn’t have to dance to anybody else’s tune and could make our own decisions.”Sproxton and Lord made their first animations after meeting at Woking Grammar School, using cut-outs from magazines and an ageing clockwork camera owned by Sproxton’s father, a BBC producer and keen amateur photographer.They sold their first clips to the BBC’s Vision On children’s programme while in sixth form and continued to treat animation as a summer job while at university, creating the hand-drawn Aardman character that gave the company its name in 1972.Wallace \u0026amp Gromit creator Nick Park joined Aardman in 1985. He met Sproxton and Lord while he was at the National Film and Television School, where he was working on his student film, Wallace \u0026amp Gromit’s first adventure, A Grand Day Out.Park, the creator of some of the company’s best known output including Shaun the Sheep, will retain a key role in the company sitting on a new executive board. He will also continue to receive idends and royalty fees related to his creations from subsidiary companies such as Wallace \u0026amp Gromit Limited, of which he is a co-owner with Aardman Holdings.Sproxton and Lord hope that employee ownership of Aardman will encourage the team to come up with more creative ideas and ways of working once they have a stake in the company’s future.It is also intended to put less strain on the business financially than a management buy-out backed by debt or sale to a major studio might have done.Brexit and changing trends in the film and TV industries have created difficulties in the market, despite a mini boom for creative producers thanks to the battle for subscribers between Netflix, Amazon and the traditional players.Sproxton and Lord believe employee ownership and the company’s varied slate of work will protect Aardman in the future when Brexit could make the UK film industry more vulnerable than ever to US imports.Lord said: “Our desire is to produce British animated films. The world audience have got American films coming out of their ears. We believe in a different voice, a different culture with different references and sense of humour, aimed at a global market but British.”Sproxton and Lord’s gobbledygook-speaking, shape-shifting, brown clay stop-motion character featured in short films made for BBC children’s art shows Take Hart and Hartbeat in the late 1970s and early 80s. New episodes, crowdfunded by fans, launched on Morph’s own YouTube channel in 2014 and were broadcast by the BBC the following year.Aardman worked on the stop motion animation in the groundbreaking music video for Peter Gabriel’s 1986 hit.Park’s 1989 Channel 4 mockumentary short matched animated zoo animals to a soundtrack of people talking about their homes. It beat Park’s own A Grand Day to the best animated short film Oscar the following year and spawned the popular early 1990s TV advertising campaign for Heat Electric.Aardman’s best known characters made their debut in Park’s student film A Grand Day Out, first broadcast in 1989, and featured in the TV follow ups The Wrong Trousers, A Close Shave and A Matter of Loaf and Death. Park picked up Oscars for The Wrong Trousers, A Close Shave and the 2005 Wallace \u0026amp Gromit feature film The Curse of the Were-Rabbit.Aardman’s first feature-length production, directed by Park and Peter Lord and released in 2000, featured the voices of actors including Mel Gibson, Jane Horrocks and Miranda Richardson and is the highest-grossing stop motion animated film ever, ahead of The Curse of the Were-Rabbit, with global box office takings of nearly $225m (£172.5m).Shaun the SheepDeveloped from a character first seen in A Close Shave, the children’s show debuted on the BBC in 2007 and became a global TV hit, now running to 150 episodes. TV spin-off Timmy Time and Shaun the Sheep Movie followed a second feature film, Farmageddon, is due next year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0aaa237a9bf61d7224d1a207da7b5f142a929452/0_611_3597_2157/master/3597.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=05f4fc59356bd82011b2f5cfc02d1bc9","title":"yotam ottolenghis curry recipes","story":"A mild and buttery squash curry, a richly spiced fish dish with lime salsa and my take on korma made with tofu and cauliflowerWe’ve come to use the word ‘curry’ as an umbrella term for almost anything cooked in a spiced sauce.

But, to me, ‘curry’ is just a shorthand for a collection of dishes that I love. All of them make clever use of spice to create a nuanced concoction that is both complex and comforting.

Seasonal pumpkins, sweet potato – or any root vegetable, really – can be used instead of the butternut. The sauce can be made one or two days ahead: just add a splash of water to reheat, because it tends to thicken as it sits.1 medium butternut squash (1kg), cut in half lengthways, deseeded, then cut into 1.5cm skin-on half-moons3½ tbsp olive oilSalt and black pepper1 onion, peeled and roughly chopped 1 large carrot, peeled and cut into ¼cm-thick rounds4 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed1cm piece fresh ginger, peeled and roughly chopped1½ tsp tomato paste1 tbsp mild curry powder½ tsp garam masala1 small baking potato, peeled, halved and cut into 5mm-thick slices1¾ tbsp soy sauce½ tbsp maple syrup 100g baby spinach1½ tbsp coriander leaves, roughly chopped 1 red chilli, thinly sliced (deseeded, if you prefer less heat)2 tsp black sesame seeds1 lime, cut into 4 wedgesHeat the oven to 240C (220C fan)425Fgas 9.

an incident the Football Association might yet investigate in relation to concussion protocols.Brighton gave warning that they could still threaten when Jose Izquierdo forced Neil Etheridge into a full-length stop, but Cardiff’s perseverance paid off as Bamba secured their second win of the season."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/42aa73e478bbb3e0feae904e9e0d9967cdc726c6/0_260_4888_2933/master/4888.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=575de6d1dd942b118e11f5a9f043d0d5","title":"manchester city amnesty international football leaks","story":"Manchester City’s Abu Dhabi owners are brazenly trying to “sportswash” their country’s “deeply tarnished image” by pouring money into the Premier League club, according to Amnesty International.Over the past week, Der Spiegel has published a series of allegations based on information obtained from the whistle-blowing platform Football Leaks that have painted a very different picture of the club than the one displayed on the pitch, claims the club denies.According to the German magazine, City have spent much of the last decade trying to get around European football’s Financial Fair Play rules with inflated sponsorship deals, an elaborate image rights scheme and hidden contracts.One of those sponsorship deals was struck with Arabtec, the largest construction company in the United Arab Emirates but a firm that has been repeatedly criticised by Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch for its poor treatment of migrant workers.Der Spiegel claims City’s heirarchy ignored warnings from its own public relations experts about reputational damage and increased scrutiny to sign a three-year, regional sponsorship agreement – worth £7m a year – with Arabtec in 2014.Attempts to reach Arabtec for comment have failed, although the company is no longer listed as one of City’s regional partners.“The UAE’s enormous investment in Manchester City is one of football’s most brazen attempts to ‘sportswash’ a country’s deeply tarnished image through the glamour of the game,” said Amnesty International’s Gulf researcher Devin Kenney. “As a growing number of Manchester City fans will be aware, the success of the club has involved a close relationship with a country that relies on exploited migrant labour and locks up peaceful critics and human rights defenders.”Der Spiegel has reported further on the unusual workings of City, detailing among other things a project called Longbow whereby the club allegedly sold the players’ image rights to an organisation funded by City’s owner, Sheikh Mansour. There is also the matter of the former manager Roberto Mancini who led City to their first Premier League title in 2012 and played a crucial part in their rise to Europe’s football elite. On signing for the club he allegedly not only agreed an annual salary there but also a further, more lucrative basic deal as a consultant with Al Jazira, a club also controlled by City’s owner.Sheikh Mansour is a member of the Abu Dhabi royal family and deputy prime minister of the United Arab Emirates (UAE).City have declined to comment on Der Spiegel’s allegations beyond sticking to a general statement that they believe the reports are based on “hacked and stolen” material and are part of a “clear and organised” attempt to smear the club."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de56353ffb9bf64905a71a6b821048f319efff63/0_850_3384_2029/master/3384.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8cd9b018a32d6944596f2299c445c479","title":"steph houghton england stage set celebrate 100th cap","story":"Phil Neville says he is determined to celebrate his captain’s career when she wins her 100th cap against Sweden on SundayHumility. It is a word that keeps cropping up in conversations about Steph Houghton and a quality that is certain to ensure England’s captain can expect the warmest of ovations when she receives her 100th cap at Rotherham on Sunday.“I want to make it a special day,” said Phil Neville as the Lionesses’ coach prepared for the friendly against Sweden. “Steph’s so humble that she doesn’t want a fuss, she doesn’t want it to be all about her but I’m determined to celebrate her international career.”Given that Houghton’s husband, the former Bradford and Bolton defender, Stephen Darby, has recently been diagnosed with motor neurone disease, it is likely to be a particularly emotional occasion. “What Steph’s going through is horrific but you’d never know she just gets on with things,” said Neville. “She’s a brilliant player – and an even better person.”As he patrols the technical area in front of a sellout 12,000 crowd at the New York Stadium, England’s coach will quite possibly reflect on his fortune in inheriting such an impressive captain and central defender. It is not lost on him that Houghton’s career has involved her negotiating the sort of character‑building hard yards that some younger counterparts in a newly professional sport no longer need navigate.Now 30, she developed resilience early after becoming the first girl to play for the school team at South Hetton primary in County Durham – at centre-forward. After coping with complaints from parents of overlooked boys, making her senior debut for Sunderland Ladies at 14 must have been a relative breeze.As part of a side from which the then coach, Mick Mulhern, produced a raft of current England players including Lucy Bronze, Jordan Nobbs and Jill Scott, Houghton’s game went from strength to strength. Even so, a subsequent move to Leeds involved juggling football with studying and part-time work while her progress was slowed by a broken leg swiftly followed by a torn cruciate ligament.This thought crystallised when his twin sister, the England netball head coach, Tracey Neville, brought her squad to meet their footballing counterparts at St George’s Park last week. “The netball team came here and saw what’s normal for my players,” he said. “But it’s not normal for them. They don’t get half of what my players get. We’ve got every resource here but my big challenge is to make sure we remain humble and keep our feet on the ground.”That is precisely what Houghton did as she earned high-profile moves to Arsenal and, more recently, Manchester City in addition to becoming an England regular under first Hope Powell and then Mark Sampson. It was the latter who handed her the national armband, explaining that the first woman to adorn the front cover of Shoot! magazine “epitomised the values I want from my team, the hard work, the ambition and the honesty”.Although he never contemplated replacing her, Neville has admitted he initially struggled to bond with his captain. “I didn’t really feel a connection with Steph until we met for a coffee in Manchester during the summer,” he said. “From that moment though we’ve become close she’s a special person.”Houghton is also integral to his blueprint for winning the 2019 World Cup in France but Neville will use this month’s friendlies for experimentation as he strives to introduce new faces and increased competition for places. After seeing the debutants Chioma Ubogagu and Georgia Stanway shine and score during Thursday’s 3-0 win against Austria in Vienna, further rotation seems likely on Sunday. England’s manager will demand another victory though Peter Gerhardsson’s Sweden – ranked ninth in the world to the Lionesses’ third – should offer a considerably trickier test than Austria. Pia Sundhage’s successor has implemented a more attacking, very much possession-based, style and the manner in which Neville’s players respond could offer a revealing insight as to exactly how far England’s own passing game has evolved since his installation last January.But whatever happens, and whether she likes it or not, Sunday will be all about Houghton."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/37cf1b9c8d312b6d39d5cb5dbb49c45021540067/152_0_1417_850/master/1417.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e2957179a4191d366271c7df7d145ae0","title":"cardiff city v brighton premier league live","story":"Sol Bamba’s controversial 90th-minute goal gave Cardiff a crucial comeback victory over Brighton, who had Dale Stephens sent off in the first halfOur match report has landed, so I’ll leave you with that.

Instead they will spend the next fortnight enjoying the residual impact of football’s greatest high - the late winner.“Thoughts on anything?” says Phil Podolsky. “Seen from the vantage point of 2018, The Sopranos is an allegory about the failure of educated US liberals (Melfi) to grasp, let alone defy, the actual, literal evil that’s staring them in the face, to the point of becoming its enablers and accomplices.” Cardiff move up to 16th, until 4.45pm at least, with a hard-fought win over 10-min Brighton.

Bamba’s overhead kick hit the post, Paterson’s follow-up was deflected onto the bar, and finally Bamba rammed the loose ball into the roof of the net! Brighton will feel Bamba was offside in the buildup, not once but twice Cardiff will not give a solitary one. Sol Bamba has won it for Cardiff!89 min Cardiff win a corner on the left. It’s taken short and worked to Camarasa, whose stinging low shot is palmed behind by the ing Ryan. The resulting corner falls to Manga, whose shot on the turn is headed away by the ing Duffy.87 min Camarasa, 25 yards out, chests a bouncing ball down and hits a booming shot that is patted down by Ryan and claimed at the second attempt.84 min Hoilett curls an ambitious effort well wide. At the moment - and I know we could be in KeeganRomania territory - Brighton look the likelier scorers.82 min Izquierdo almost wins it for Brighton! He charged infield from the left and smashed a rising long-range shot that Etheridge tipped over the bar at full stretch. It was a really good save because the ball wobbled in the air and he almost ed past it.81 min Izquierdo overruns the ball after leading a Brighton counterattack. As he did so, he lunged at the ball in an almost identical manner to Stephens in the first half. But because his boot slid off the side of the Cardiff player, rather than going straight into him, nobody batted an eyelid. It wasn’t even a free-kick. I’d like to see it again but there is an argument he was as reckless (sic) as Stephens - or, to flip it round, that Stephens was just unlucky that studs and ankles aligned as they did when they made his challenge.80 min “Re Roy Allen (67 min) I think the relentless onslaught of ing, cheating and general conning of the officials means they’re naturally settling on a middle ground of distance between blatant ‘simulation’ and properly dirty tackling for red cards,” says Michael Gibson. “It can’t help but shift the parameters. And despite all the complaints that follow every defeat, mark my words it suits every manager for this to be something they know they can influence!”79 min Apart from a five-minute spell after Harris hit the bar, Brighton have been relatively comfortable since going down to 10 men in the first half.77 min Cardiff make their final change, with Bobby Reid replacing the impressive Joe Ralls.76 min Brighton have looked a bit livelier on the break since the younger, more mobile Andone came on for Murray.75 min “Being Welsh (but not from Swansea), I’m very happy to have Cardiff ‘representing’ us in the Premier League,” says Matt Dony. “I love the city, I’ve always had a soft spot for the club, and yet, Warnock does present a challenge. He’s good at what he does, and he’s useful for a soundbite now and then, but he doesn’t half get on my wick. I dearly hope they stay up, though. Since Swansea blazed a trail (and, for those first few years, what a trail it was!) we’ve gotten awfully used to seeing Welsh involvement in top level football. It’d be a crying shame to lose that again.”72 min Etheridge’s punch falls for Izquierdo, who blooters a difficult volley miles wide from 25 yards.71 min Cunningham is booked for a cynical foul on the breaking Andone.70 min “Poor call from the ref,” says Ceri Rees. “Stephens was the player in possession, he got to the ball first. His studs did come up a little after playing the ball but then they always will. Football has gone too soft.”I wouldn’t argue with that. I don’t think a challenge like that should be a red card, but I still think it was a reasonable decision by the standards of today.69 min Sean Morrison, who had that clash of heads with Bissouma, is going off with blurred vision andor concussion. Lee Peltier will replace him.67 min This is a big last quarter for Cardiff. It’s not a great sign if they can’t win at home to 10-man Brighton. All due respect.66 min “Yellow,” says Roy Allen. “I think that sums up my view on the red card decision. I really think that English refs are increasingly out of step with other nations. They’re a few years behind.”I agree with you up to a point, and was pleasantly surprised by the leniency shown by the referees during the World Cup. Is it English refs or English culture that’s to blame, though? 64 min Cardiff are looking more dangerous now. Murphy’s excellent cross is vitally headed away by Dunk, under pressure from Paterson.63 min Ryan makes a point-blank save from Paterson, though it wouldn’t have counted as Paterson had been penalised for a foul on Murray. That’s Murray’s last contribution: he is replaced as the lone striker by Florin Andone.60 min After a slow start, Kadeem Harris has been the liveliest attacker on the pitch. He made the equaliser and almost scored a beauty there.59 min: Harris hits the bar for Cardiff! That was a brilliant effort from Harris. He moved infield from the right, along the edge of the area, before hitting a big left-footed curler across goal that beat Ryan and clattered off the bar.58 min Morrison is receiving treatment after a clash of heads with Bissouma. He looks a bit groggy but is going to continue.56 min Gunnarsson’s long throw bounces around the area before Knockaert lumps it clear.54 min Cardiff are in danger of looking a gift horse in the coupon. They have been far too tentative in possession since half-time.51 min  “Any thoughts on anything?” says Adam Kline-Schoder. “Not really mate, other than the fact that this match is definitely Brightoning up my weekend. I would say that I’ll see myself out andor apologise for that joke, but you did ask.” 50 min Gunnarsson’s stinging half-volley is blocked on the edge of the area. Brighton have set up for the second half in a 4-4-0-0-0-0-1 formation.49 min “Afternoon, Rob,” says Bill Hargreaves. “Perennial as the grass, football takes the stage again. Is there a touch of the Neville Southall in that Callum Paterson? They probably use the same barbour.”48 min It’s surprisingly quiet at the Cardiff City Stadium. At the moment you can even hear the players’ shouts.47 min “Reading the excellent article by Stuart James and looking at the images, I’ve come to the conclusion that if you are serious about getting relegated you should wear white socks,” says Kevin Ryan. “I know that other clubs like Arsenal and Chelsea wear them but they’ve got lots of money and good sponsorship deals no doubt with kit suppliers. My team, Newcastle, look bloody awful in those white socks and they seem to play like the socks they are forced to wear. Fulham the same and Huddersfield. Who went down last year? Swansea, Stoke and West Brom, all wearers of those awful white socks. I rest my case.”The socks are not the issue here, dude.46 min Peep peep! Brighton begin the second half.Any thoughts on the red card? Any thoughts on anything?Peep peep! Those three added minutes passed without incident. Brighton will be happy to hear the whistle - they started the match authoritatively before the unwelcome twist of Callum Paterson’s equaliser and Dale Stephens’ red card. Cardiff, up against 10 men, have a great chance of winning for only the second time in the league this season. See you in 10 minutes.45 min Three minutes of added time."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ef139ca8eea20094ee7e483920681029581689c8/137_0_3279_1968/master/3279.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=78a6e2b1f261bcedf4d78997f9defd53","title":"leicester v burnley fa cup first round and more football clockwatch live","story":"In the Championship Derby, who could have ended the day top, have gone 1-0 down at home to Aston Villa, John McGinn the scorer.“Here in the Bhutanese league we’ve got the practically named Transport FC,” writes Angus Northey. “Maybe they specialise in parking the bus.

No-one can.”In further Cup shock news, Oxford City are 2-1 up at Tranmere, with both goals coming from the gloriously-named Kabongo Tshimanga.In the search for FA Cup shocks Stockport County, ninth in the National League North, are 3-1 up at League Two Yeovil.Yoshida was in an offside position inside the area, and not far away from the path of the ball. But he didn’t touch the ball, and he wasn’t in Foster’s way or in his line of sight. You could argue that two wrongs have made a right there, but that’s still two more wrongs than a referee should ideally be making.Southampton have a goal disallowed for puzzling reasons! Redmond passes across the area, Austin tucks it just inside the post and the Saints scream away in celebration! A good 30 seconds of jubilation later they realise it’s been disallowed. The only possible explanation for the decision is that the referee wanted to square things after the penalty thing. I didn’t see a foul, or even the vaguest possibility of offside.At Huddersfield Felipe Anderson has an effort with his right foot from the left edge of the penalty area that curls beautifully, but also rises disappointingly way over the bar. That is absolutely a penalty. On Sky, Phil Thompson says “the referee bottled it because it was against the home team”.At Southampton, Nathaniel Chalobah has been brought down in the penalty area, but Watford have not been awarded a penalty. He is still protesting.It’s been a day of two kits for Leicester, who played the first half in this one:And are currently playing the second half in this poppy-enhanced version (hat-tip to Eoin Jones for spotting this):“Out here in Zambia we have some great names,” writes Oscar Millar. “I watched the young green buffaloes lose 3-0 this afternoon. I appreciate their youth may have been a factor. At least they have a degree of physical prowess associated with their name, god knows how the ‘A M Welding academy’ in ision 1 get on.”Gabbiadini finds Austin inside the penalty are, but he a) misses, and b) is offside.Hernandez, on at half-time for West Ham, has a good chance less than three minutes later, but Lossl comes out to get in his way.Less than a minute into the second half Manolo Gabbiadini tries to curl the ball over Foster from 25 yards, and it goes just over the bar!Here’s a video of today’s pre-match march in Leicester:Bong! 4.04pm! Action has resumed in most games around the country!The half time whistle has now gone at Newcastle, the last of the top-flight games to reach the break.Then Newcastle run down the other end, and Perez, clean through to the right, drives across goal and wide!Newcastle very nearly had a three-goal lead to take into the break, but instead it’s only one! Bournemouth have a free kick on the right, and Dubravka does well to tip over Cook’s header. Then from the corner Lerma stoops to flick the ball across goal and in at the back stick!Actually it was Callum Wilson’s header, and very nearly an own goal!What a chance for Newcastle! Ki takes a free-kick from the left, Schar wins the header and it’s excellently saved by Begovic, who had very little time to react.It’s half-time at Southampton, where the home side lead Watford 1-0.“Delighted for Rafa and Newcastle with a two-goal lead,” writes Hubert O’Hearn. “Worried for Rafa and Newcastle as the January transfer budget probably gets trimmed with every goal or win.” They have a January transfer budget?Another significant injury, this time sustained by Huddersfield’s Chris Loewe, who is being loaded onto a stretcher as I type.That’s a cracking cross from Kennedy, and a bullet header from Rondon flies into the top corner!A first-half tactical switch for Watford, where the captain Troy Deeney, back from injury, has replaced Will Hughes.Of those FA Cup games that have so far featured goals, 12 are on course for home wins, the away side are winning in three and there is one score draw.Another great chance for Southampton, and this one’s excellently saved by Ben Foster! It’s a low centre from Bertrand on the left, and Armstrong turns it towards the near post but is thwarted by Foster’s trailing leg.Southampton’s defending is ludicrously inept at times, but Watford don’t seem to be in the mood to punish them. Pereyra has just had a shot, but it was from outside the area and easily saved.Another chance for Southampton! It’s a ball chipped in from the left, and Yoshida heads over the bar from 12 yards or so.Greg Conboy emails to remind me of the Banana Slugs’ great claim to fame:Chance for Huddersfield! West Ham give the ball away very foolishly in defence and a single, easy pass plays in Mounie, whose firm shot is saved at the near post.Smith is still receiving treatment, and hasn’t been moved onto the stretcher yet. There will be at least five minutes of stoppage time here.A long delay at Newcastle, where Adam Smith has gone down and seems in considerable pain. He’s clutching a knee, and as a stretcher comes on his game is evidently over.“Sheffield Derby? Manchester Derby? The only derby this weekend is The West London Derby,” writes John O’Donnell, “and Rangers v Bees looks a bit one sided too, unless they are Killer Bees of course.” They might be – Neal Maupay has put them 1-0 up at QPR.Hoedt’s header from a corner is well saved, and the second corner goes to Pereyra, who lingers on the ball, is dispossessed and it rolls to Gabbiadini, who slides it in. The weather in Southampton is totally atrocious, with rain falling as thick as fog. “My favourite mascot mismatch in professional sports is the NHL’s Anaheim Ducks v San Jose Sharks,” writes Leo Addor. “No contest whatsoever. In collegiate sports, UC Santa Cruz Banana Slugs v anyone they play.”Banana slugs? The nicknaming committee needs to take a long, hard look at themselves.Eleven minutes gone at Reading and it’s already 2-1 to Ipswich, the away side taking the lead for the second time through Freddie Sears.Rondon has given the home side the lead in the seventh minute, converting a low cross from the right at the second attempt!Alex Pritchard has given Huddersfield an early lead against West Ham! I haven’t seen it yet, but apparently some dodgy goalkeeping was involved.Early chances for Huddersfield and Watford, both thwarted by decent saves.BONG! It’s 3pm, and it’s football time!“Magpies vs Cherries may be one-sided, but it kind of pales in comparison to Indomitable Lions (Cameroon) vs Squirrels (Benin),” writes Enna Cooper. “Indomitable anything is always going to win really, isn’t it? Even Magpies vs Indomitable Cherries would be unlikely to go well for the magpies.”Here’s an update on Sergio Aguero’s hair. From which we learn:“I can think of no nickname match up in football more lopsided than the Magpies versus the Cherries,” writes JR. “I mean have you ever seen a tiding of magpies set upon a cherry tree? Let’s just say calling it one-sided is an understatement.”A quick search tells me that standard corner flags arewere in use at Leicester and Cardiff today, but the special version was used in yesterday’s Sheffield derby, so perhaps it’s a Football League thing.Here’s a poppy-festooned commemorative Remembrance Sunday corner flag at Derby County. Is this a thing? I’ve never noticed them before, but then this is the kind of little detail I routinely entirely miss.Cardiff have taken a riotous lead over 10-man Brighton in the 90th minute. More on that one here:Life as a Maidenhead defender must be pretty tough at the moment. They have lost their last six games 3-0, 2-0, 3-1, 6-0, 7-0 and 2-0, and they are now 4-0 down to Portsmouth in the Cup.“Check out the Leicester Mercury live feed,” writes Ross Tarbard, “there’s a lovely rainbow shot of the King Power which I think rivals that on the blog currently.”I imagine it looks something like this:And finally, the line-ups at Leicester:Meanwhile at Newcastle, these are the selected players:Here are the Huddersfield and West Ham teams:The team news is landing, and here are the starting line-ups for Southampton v Watford:In the early FA Cup game, 2008 champions Portsmouth are 3-0 up at Maidenhead at skipping merrily into round two.And so Saturday rolls around once again, and another afternoon packed full of footballing fun. This week is rendered even more interesting than normal, if such a thing is even possible, by the addition of some FA Cuplicuous fun, though there are only four 3pm kick-offs in the Premier League and none of the establish enormoteams are involved, with five of the eight top-flight sides in action currently residing in the bottom half.You may at this point be requiring a great big list of all the day’s key games, and so here are all this afternoon’s fixtures in the Premier League, Football League, Scottish Premiership and FA Cup (all 3pm unless stated), plus a moody establishing shot of Southampton’s St Mary’s Stadium with a rainbow overhead:"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b4b9c03017f37cf5ae4abb6e10f1b8b1883dbc9d/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=033fdcb54cea5cd77db99e2bbf13e4bb","title":"have you already finished your christmas shopping","story":"One in five people in the UK get their Christmas present shopping done before December starts.

Colvin was brave, bold, any edge of recklessness blunted by the fact that her work really had achieved what most journalists dream of when they start their career – saving lives by bearing witness.An eye patch, worn since she lost her sight in one eye to a Sri Lankan rocket-propelled grenade in 2001, became her introduction and trademark. She was also known for her quick wit and sharp tongue. When I first moved to Kabul, grappling with the professional and emotional challenge of pivoting from years reporting about China’s rise to covering Afghanistan’s long and tragic war, I both hoped and feared that I would meet her at the Kabul bar where she drank during trips to the country.I suspected she would find me both dull and timid (I barely skirted the margins of wars she covered in their bloodiest intensity), but I never got a chance to find out. Like many others, I overestimated how long her luck would hold.The attack in Homs aimed to silence her and deter other journalists from following in her footsteps, but this autumn, as the brutal civil war staggers towards its 8th year, she has reappeared across screens, in newspapers and on bookshelves.Hollywood biopic A Private War, a serious biography – In Extremis – and a powerful documentary – Under the Wire – have all come out within weeks of each other. Just months earlier, a thinly fictionalised French film was released that also explored her life and work.For a 56-year-old who was hugely respected for her work, but hardly a household name, this reworking of her life is an extraordinary tribute to her legacy.It is perhaps not surprising that the men who ordered her slaughter thought that the loss of another reporter would be treated as no more than a passing tragedy in her homeland America or her adopted home of Britain.But although journalism generally is not well respected, with reporters languishing alongside lawyers and politicians at the bottom of “least trusted professions” lists, there is an enduring fascination with journalists who go to war or sites of disaster – not under orders to fight or provide aid, but as observers.They have proved fodder for art for decades, from the satire of Evelyn Waugh’s Scoop to the tragedy of Cambodian genocide chronicle The Killing Fields to the hit play Chimerica, which had at its heart a journalist covering the Tiananmen Square massacre (although until recently, the protagonists have all been men).Some of this enduring fascination may be respect for and curiosity about courage. Colvin wore her own fears extremely lightly. “Bravery is not being afraid to be afraid,” she once said. But there was no question that she would go where others would not, cross borders, stay on in war zones even as others with impressive track records of their own left.In 1999, when she and two other women chose to stay on in a besieged compound of refugees in East Timor – as diplomats and most other reporters left, afraid of the mob – she could literally claim to have kept men, women and children alive (although she was not given to boasting and left it to others to chronicle her achievements: “Her courage saved 1,500,” read one front-page headline).Westerners have perhaps never been further from the realities of war. With the last generation of second world war survivors and veterans heading into their final decades, and the military now a small professional corps, many Britons do not personally know anyone who has endured the dreary but terrifying daily grind of conflict. Seen through screens, violence is both compelling and insubstantial.For those who get one step closer, it spawns grinning selfies in redundant flak jackets on the margins of conflict, boasts of helicopter rides and stories of relative – but still safe – proximity to death.When violence cannot be escaped or forgotten, it seeps into life in a much more dangerous and destructive way. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and its terrible damage is talked about today much more openly than when Colvin began her career and waged her own battle with the illness.Like most stereotypes recycled in good and bad art, this cliche of the damaged hero or, occasionally, heroine provides a convenient dramatic engine for films and television, with traumas often picked over in extreme detail in films about war in particular. Few people who see war first-hand are not altered in some way by the experience, even if they escape an official diagnosis of trauma.Colvin’s life story had an innate drama with obvious appeal in that tradition. Her attraction to extremes of danger and delight, of violence and emotion is reflected in the title of Lindsey Hilsum’s recently published biography, In Extremis.Exceptional in almost everything she did, she saw more violence and brutality than most soldiers, her reporting had huge impact, and she moved in circles most people only read about in the pages of magazines.Her friends stretched from the Kennedys to the editor of British Vogue, via literary, media and cultural celebrities. One early boyfriend was Lucien Carr, the man who Jack Kerouac would describe as the “glue” of the beat generation.Colvin came of age professionally at a time when there was both more confidence in the power of journalism to transform than there is today and a flowering of a more personal, immediate style. She epitomised both.Yet she paid a huge personal price for her work, grappling with alcoholism and PTSD, and her personal life was as volcanic as her professional life was successful.An exploration of Colvin’s life is an exploration of critical questions about humanity and war, the impact of violence, the power and limits of empathy. It means thinking about the role and responsibilities of the media at a time when this is being fiercely disputed.And there is the fact that she is a woman. There is an enduring cultural fascination with women who go to war as soldiers, reporters or medics, curiosity about what draws them to such an overwhelmingly male world and how they manage there.Any woman who has been needled by leading questions after just one trip to a slightly unstable area is aware of this. Colvin knew it intimately and played on it. When her editors asked what had happened to the male reporters as she hunkered down with the refugees in East Timor, she virtually shrugged down the phone. “They just don’t make men like they used to,” she replied.Although often absent from films and books about war, women have been reporting on the front lines for decades. Clare Hollingworth, who worked for the Daily  and died at the age of 105 last year, got one of the biggest scoops of the last century, breaking the news that the second world war was about to start by driving blithely into Germany in a borrowed diplomatic car and observing tanks preparing to attack Poland.Like many female reporters who came after her, Colvin used misogyny to do some of her best work. Where women are seen as powerless, inconsequential, men are often incapable of treating female journalists as real adversaries and give them a relatively free pass.Publicly, Colvin had little time for feminism, quoting famed reporter Martha Gellhorn’s line that “feminists nark me” in one article. Yet in private she was acutely aware of the constant demand that she outshine men to get the same opportunities. She thought a lot about differences between her coverage and that of men who dominated – and still do, although the number of women is increasingly – the trade.One reason her reporting was so powerful is that it eschewed many of the traits tied to the trade’s macho image. She had no interest in military hardware, in picking out guns or helicopters or artillery.She focused instead on what happens when metal hits flesh, the fate of women and children besieged, starved or fleeing. Rather than gathering stories too often dismissed as “soft” from survivors in refugee camps, she took extreme risks to document the horrors at the heart of conflict. “Maybe we feel the need to test ourselves more, to see how much we can take and survive,” she wrote of female journalists.Her best work illuminated the cost of war through the pain of iniduals: a teenager shot dead as she tried to race down a sniper alley for food, the details of her tiny gold earrings, her fist clenched, in the agonies of death, around a handful of earth.The various projects coming out this autumn were driven by people who knew and loved Colvin and wanted to preserve her legacy. Hilsum was a longstanding friend, although she wrote the honest biography Colvin probably would have wanted, not a hagiography.Photographer Paul Conroy was with her when she died, badly injured in the same attack, and swore to tell the story that she died trying to report. The documentary Under the Wire is based on Conroy’s book about that final reporting trip. He was also a consultant on A Private War.In Conroy, a Liverpudlian ex-soldier, she found someone as courageous, committed and funny as her. Their backgrounds and social circles were wildly different, but they became a tight unit at work. The stress of war can tear people apart, but the intensity of facing death and the worst of humanity together can seal powerful relationships.As an admirer of Colvin’s work, and a woman in a trade that could do with more of us, I am thrilled to see her story celebrated, her sacrifices remembered and the story she died trying to tell returned to screens and pages of our newspapers.But I am also a little wary of how, particularly in the film and much of the media coverage, the courageous reporter shades so fast into tragic heroine, with the woman behind both stereotypes sometimes lost along the way. There is no question Colvin struggled with the physical and mental scars of witnessing so much conflict, had an often painful and messy personal life, while her early death was a tragedy.But her life was not a bleak unfurling of misery. Colvin was charismatic, beautiful and funny, she found purpose and meaning in her work and took huge pride in her success and reputation.One line from the biopic in particular struck me as a certain kind of betrayal of the life Colvin chose. “Maybe I would have liked a more normal life. Maybe I just don’t know how,” Rosamund Pike, who plays Colvin, says.By the accounts of all her friends, Colvin was living exactly the life she had chosen for herself. She fled the stultifying normality of her small-town upbringing, driven by huge ambition and carried by her talent into a world of power, glamour and fame. She embraced being the boldest person at a frontline, the most charismatic at a party. Also emphasised in the movie and media coverage is her childlessness. Colvin tried to conceive with both her husbands and certainly wanted a child enough to try IVF. But in life she was far more sanguine than her celluloid counterpart. “She always loved kids, but was very philosophical about the fact that she had led a life that made it very difficult to have them herself,” Hilsum quotes a close friend saying. “She didn’t say she wished she had led her life differently.”The clearest and most rounded picture in the sweep of new releases emerges from Hilsum’s book. Colvin herself, courageous and often tortured, rises again from its pages. She kept a journal for most of her life and that gave Hilsum extraordinary access to the vulnerable woman behind the glamorous exterior.It also catalogues the bravery, sometimes shading into recklessness, which meant she was always one step ahead of everyone else. Her icy calm in situations that would pin most people to the floor in terror, her willingness to take risks, may ultimately have doomed her. But it meant that she reached places that no one else did.It is not all heroism. Both the book and A Private War are surprisingly blunt about the callous calculations of the industry that sends civilians to cover war. They damn the Sunday Times in particular for turning a private compulsion to go further into a modus operandi.“You’re their prize pig,” says a friend on screen. Hilsum is less direct and acknowledges that Colvin was to some degree complicit. She tells us that Colvin wrote about the loss of her eye for the paper before it had even been operated on.Colvin’s bosses knew, Hilsum writes, that “Marie’s risk-taking was getting them the best stories”. Courage made her vulnerable “not just because such reporting put her in danger, but because she and her editors let it define her”.The reason she took those risks and the horrors she tried to expose and combat in her life’s work are brought to life in the documentary Under the Wire in all their gritty, painful clarity, with a force that even the best prose struggles to match.The film seems unrelenting because it covers a short period of horror, but there are glimpses of Marie’s sharp wit, her joy and charm. And it captures the horrors she tried to share with the world and the times when she made a difference.A Private War is perhaps the easiest to pick apart, because of constraints of time and genre. Rosamund Pike slips into Colvin’s skin entirely, in a portrayal praised by friends and former colleagues. However, it deals largely with the violence she covered and the trauma it left behind, and captures little of her sense of fun or ordinary life.Yet for me that was redeemed by a focus on the people to whom she devoted her working life, the civilians caught up in and crushed by war. In western films about war, its victims are too often treated as little more than props or backdrop in a heroine’s personal journey.Matthew Heineman, the director of A Private War, is a documentary-maker and ensured that all the survivors in the film – widows shelled in a basement in Syria, Libyans roiled by the sudden explosion of war – had lived through the events that they recreated in the film.They are given screen time, and tell their own stories, directly to viewers who would perhaps not hear them outside a Hollywood film.I went to see it with another veteran journalist, who knew Colvin and had worked in several of the places she reported from. He went in braced for cliches, but emerged shaking.While Colvin might have been bemused to see herself celebrated on such an incredible scale, she would almost certainly have been glad to see the terrible suffering in Syria brought to wider attention again. She was killed there because she cared and wanted others to as well.“Part of me thinks Marie is looking down saying, ‘Hey, what’s all the fuss, this is what we do,’” said Hilsum. “But I also think she would be glad that people were talking about Homs again, and hope that maybe some of the attention would be focused on Yemen and other under-reported conflicts and the people suffering in them.”In Extremis is published by Vintage (£20).

Plus, a thrilling Turnage premiereHow do we deal with the amoral chess game of Così fan tutte amid the ruckus of #MeToo? The short answer is that it was never easy. Two women, tricked into infidelity by a bet two men who condemn their lovers as if their own behaviour counted for nought all pawns of a sleazy kingpin, Don Alfonso, who’s seen all, done all before. Mozart, accused of frivolity from on high, constructs a brittle symmetry out of foibles and lies, supremely aided by Lorenzo Da Ponte’s libretto. First you think it’s about misogyny. (“All women are like that”, as the title tells us.) Eventually you realise it’s about life itself, set to glorious music. Everyone gets their comeuppance.In an updated staging by Oliver Platt, Guildhall School embraces the uneasiness head-on, absorbing it into the drama rather than hammering out crass contemporary parallels. This is wise. It leaves the humour, from slapstick to pure nasty, intact, while embedding the plot’s squeamish portrayal of women into every exchange, every lunge. Despina (a wonderfully animated Zoe Drummond), a barmaid in Don Alfonso’s gleaming steel-and-neon bar, readily takes cash from Alfonso (Christian Valle) but shows anger at being entangled in his cheap sport.Guglielmo and Ferrando, in their daft rocker-cum-mariachi disguises, complete with droopy moustaches and grizzly wigs, launch themselves at each others’ girlfriend as if by god-given right. When one sees the other succeeding, physical tension runs high: a near fight breaks out. Sometimes played as indistinguishable, here they are sharply delineated, Ferrando really quite sensitive, Guglielmo brawny and knowing. Filipe Manu and Benson Wilson, both from New Zealand, made a convincing partnership.Dorabella (Carmen Artaza) and Fiordiligi (Alexandra Lowe), one quick to succumb, the other more resistant but falling further, are shaped more strictly by Mozart’s music, their arias detailing their responses. Both Artaza and Lowe, in the first of two casts drawn from GSMD’s intensive postgraduate opera course, show rare, eye-catching talent, in singing and acting. Neither is fazed by the director’s stipulations: Dorabella sings while splayed on a pool table Fiordiligi has to wipe the bar with a J-cloth while performing Per pietà, one of opera’s most elaborate arias. If you’re riddled with guilt and desire, shame and horror, it’s not a bad idea to do some cleaning.Stylishly designed by Neil Irish with lighting by Rory Beaton, this Così is a terrific showcase for Guildhall, crisply conducted by the head of opera, Dominic Wheeler, and nimbly played by the orchestra, with elegant fortepiano continuo by Manon Fischer-Dieskau. You can never say too often how worthwhile (and affordable) these polished conservatoire productions are, with singers poised for big careers and talents to spot. In the next few weeks, catch the Royal College of Music (The Marriage of Figaro), the Royal Academy of Music (Semele) or the Royal Northern College of Music, Manchester (Suor AngelicaGianni Schicchi). Book early. They sell out.One name on Guildhall’s roll of gold medallists is that of the Welsh soprano Natalya Romaniw, soon to make her debut in the role of Mimi in English National Opera’s La bohème. Last week she was an electrifying soloist in the world premiere of Testament by Mark-Anthony Turnage (b1960). Written for the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra and its Ukrainian music director, Kirill Karabits, this 25-minute work explores themes of war and displacement via texts (sung in English) by three Ukraine-born poets who  the imperial, Soviet and modern eras: Taras Shevchenko (1814-61), a literary hero forced into exile Vasyl Stus (1938-85), who died on hunger strike in a hard-labour camp and Serhiy Zhadan (b1974), the cult voice of post-independence Ukraine today.Turnage’s choices are strong and urgent. So is his music, at times stark and explosive, as at the start of “Weep, sky, weep”, yet lyrical too, with evocative, sombre low woodwind, piano, celesta, harp and bells. Turnage has a large catalogue of works. This shines out. The German premiere follows in Weimar on 9 December. The BSO and Karabits, expertly mastering an unfamiliar programme, also played music of other Ukrainians: Glière’s sumptuous Sirens and Prokofiev’s War and Peace Symphonic Suite. Their encore was Glière’s Russian Sailors’ Dance. The percussionist thrashed his tambourine with such thrilling jubilation in the closing bars I quite worried for him, or it.In this month of memorial, the London Sinfonietta performed Olga Neuwirth’s music for the early pacifist film Maudite soit la guerre. Released in 1914, Alfred Machin’s silent movie is as much about betrayal as warfare, wrapped up in touching sentiment. Neuwirth reflects this in her scoring for nine instrumentalists and sampler, with snatches of whispered guitar, tolling bells and pub piano.

The referendum took place. The issue now has to be how we bring people together, bring people together around the principles of our economy, our rights and that we don’t turn this country into some kind of offshore tax haven on the lines that Donald Trump might want us to.”Corbyn said any Brexit deal brought to the Commons by the government would need to be measured against Labour’s six tests for a withdrawal agreement. He said: “We will test the government against our six questions. Our six points will be put to them and we will vote accordingly.“If it means we vote against the government, we vote against the government. If it’s defeated, it means they’ve got a choice – either go back and negotiate something better or resign.“They’re questions about the benefits to every part of the UK. They’re questions about the Northern Ireland border, they’re questions about the kind of regulatory framework in which we’ll live.“I think those things are very important and, surely, it’s the duty of parliament and duty of the opposition to hold the government to account on this and that’s what we’ll do.”But the Labour MP Wes Streeting called on the party to make the “full-throated case” for a people’s vote.“Labour cannot sit by and allow the choice to be between the economic ruin of a hard Brexit or the loss of sovereignty under Theresa May’s deal, with Britain subjected to EU rules but with no say over them,” he said. “As with any fork in the road, there is always the option of turning back home.“We know this is a mess made by the Tories, but the Labour party can’t just sit back and watch. It’s time for all of us in the Labour party to make the full-throated case for a people’s vote with the option of remaining in the European Union.“That leadership must now come from the top, or our party may never be forgiven for the consequences that follow,” he added.At the party conference, Labour delegates left open the possibility of backing a second referendum if it could not force a general election. Chris Leslie, another Labour MP, called for the public to have the final choice and accused Corbyn of a “dereliction of duty”.“With even Tory ministers recognising Brexit threatens the poorest in society, our public services and Britain’s place in the world, to have a Labour leader just shrug about it, then go awol, is nothing short of a dereliction of duty,” he said.The Labour MP and former leadership contender Chuku Umunna said in a tweet that the party would never be forgiven if it ignored the wishes of Labour members and opted not to call for a second referendum.“We can stop this Tory Brexit but, ultimately, it should be for the people to decide,” he said. “A large majority of Labour members, supporters and voters not only want a people’s vote but to change our country in the EU. If the party sets its face against this, it will never be forgiven.”Corbyn, a longstanding Eurosceptic, has seemingly been mindful that a significant amount of Labour voters opted to leave in the June 2016 referendum.In the Der Spiegel interview, he criticised the neoliberal economic policies that are fundamental to the EU, saying working conditions had deteriorated in deprived areas of the UK, despite being protected by European legislation, and committed the party to enhancing workers’ rights in government.About 700,000 people rallied for a new Brexit referendum last month, the second largest march in recent memory, with consternation centred on the government’s apparent failure to secure an acceptable deal.However, there are concerns that a second referendum could embolden the far right in the UK, while Eurosceptics point to examples where votes within EU member states rejecting greater federalism and austerity have been overturned in what they say is yet more evidence that there is a “democrat deficit” within the union."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c71b472115ac0a1fd5d3d56de6fd83c01f37433/571_2231_3355_2013/master/3355.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f16a9424d2a9402cc386d086d1c8cfab","title":"one day six operations three kidneys organ donor chain brought together","story":"A year after their life-changing surgery, we bring together six people in a kidney donor circle for the first timeOn the morning of 13 September 2017, Martha Myers was being prepared for surgery at north London’s Royal Free hospital. Stayin’ Alive was playing in the background. The anaesthetist had asked what she would like to hear, and she’d requested the Bee Gees – calming, “happy music” that took her back to her youth in Colombia. Meanwhile, 130 miles north, in Nottingham City hospital, Ryan Mace grappled with a pair of green surgical stockings, worrying that his gown would reveal his bottom as he walked to theatre. He’d wanted to do something like this since he was a teenager and now that the moment was here, he was ready. Back in London, south of the river at St George’s hospital, Steve Abbott had woken up feeling anxious. But his was a good ward to be on, full of high-spirited football chat that kept his mind off the day ahead. When the time for the operation finally came, he squeezed his son Ben’s hand before being wheeled away.Martha, Ryan and Steve were in perfect health. But over the course of the morning, surgeons at the three hospitals tussled gently with fatty tissue and chopped through blood vessels to remove a kidney from each of them. The organs were packed in ice and whisked down corridors, then handed to couriers eager to get on the road.Later that day, the theatre staff were back at work. Martha’s kidney had arrived in Nottingham, where it was transplanted into Ryan’s best friend, Lee Bennett. Ryan’s kidney went down the M1 to south London, and was given to Steve’s son Ben. And Steve’s kidney made the short journey across the Thames to be stitched into Martha’s husband, David. The circle was complete.This is the strange magic of kidney donation chains. If you need a transplant in the UK, you can join 5,000 other people on the national waiting list for a kidney from a deceased donor. Or, if you’re lucky, a partner, relative or friend might offer you one as a living donor (for many people, as long as they have been fully assessed, it is possible to live healthily with only one kidney). But if you and they are incompatible by blood group or tissue type, a transplant may not be possible.Instead, you and your would-be donor can join the UK Living Kidney Sharing Scheme (pdf). Four times a year, in what’s known as a matching run, a sophisticated algorithm works out chains linking incompatible pairs such as Martha and David, Ryan and Lee, and Steve and Ben. Reshuffled into compatible pairs, everyone in the chain who needs one ends up getting a kidney – not from their friend or loved one, but from a stranger.The process relies on logistical masterminding by staff at the UK’s 23 transplant centres, as much as it does on the mind-boggling computer science it’s built around. Ideally, all the operations in a chain are scheduled to take place on the same day, within eight weeks of a matching run, and only after everyone has been painstakingly assessed to ensure the matches will work and they are well enough for surgery.It’s a curiously under-recognised scheme, among the general public at least, but its impact is growing every year. The first UK kidney exchange took place in 2007, with a two-way swap between four people. In 201718, 127 of the 1,010 living kidney transplants carried out – one in eight – came about as a result of the sharing scheme. It’s also a British success story: the UK far outstrips any other country in Europe in this field, carrying out about half of all the transplants made possible by sharing schemes.Just over a year after their surgery, five of the six members of one chain have agreed to meet to talk about their experiences and be photographed for the . (The sixth, Steve, lives in the US and joins us via FaceTime later he will be digitally added to the magazine’s group shots.) Though some patients and donors matched in chains end up exchanging cards or letters after the transplants are complete, only a tiny proportion ever meet: anonymity is an important part of the process.“Nice bunch of good-looking people!” says Martha as she and David come into the photo studio, where Lee and Ryan are waiting with their partners. As the writer who arranged this, I had been apprehensive about the meeting, fearing it might be awkward. But when I introduce 43-year-old Lee to Martha, 60, as the man who got her kidney, she grips him by the hand, pulls him to her in an embrace and begins to sob softly. “Nice to meet you,” he says, a broad smile on his face. “I’m looking after it for you.” They get chatting. Was he ever on dialysis, Martha asks: she supported her husband through nearly nine years of it before his first transplant in 1999 when that kidney began to fail, she was determined to donate one herself, rather than see him so ill again. No, Lee says, but he was on the brink: “You came up trumps just in time.”Ben slips into the room 10 minutes later, all but unnoticed as the group exchange recovery stories and praise for the NHS. He and Ryan, his donor, greet each other with a warm blokeishness, a firm handshake and an exchanged, “All right?”There’s an easy amiability in the room. David, 70, is an amateur expert on all things kidney-related and quickly established as the unofficial elder statesman of the group, while Ben, 27, is affable, dry-witted and hungover. Their conversations reveal a shared understanding of ill health and the joy that successful treatment can bring.“With my first transplant,” David announces to the group, minutes after arriving, “I knew it was from a woman because the minute I started peeing I was sitting down on the toilet.” They talk about the thing they all remember about the day of the surgery: one of the donors had misunderstood the instructions to drink only clear fluids and enjoyed a cup of tea with milk in the morning, causing an unnerving last-minute delay. “I was literally yards away from the operating table,” Ryan remembers. “All I could think about was Lee.”The culprit, it’s soon revealed, was Martha, winningly irrepressible whether she’s holding forth on the need for greater kindness in the world or sniffing back tears. “I love her,” Lee’s wife Karen says to me at one point. “I want to take her home.”Away from the bustle of tea being made and the photographer arranging his shots, Lee and Ryan sit side by side, legs crossed identically over their knees. They have known each other only five years, but consider themselves best friends. Both grew up in villages near Nottingham, and later worked out that they had played rugby against each other at school. “We’ve got the same silly sense of humour, similar interests. We just hit it off,” Ryan, 42, says. “He’s such a relaxed person – I’ve learned a lot from him.”But in the time they’d known each other, Lee, who runs a kitchen design business, had been getting increasingly ill. At the age of 28, soon after returning from honeymoon, he discovered he had polycystic kidneys, an inherited condition that his mother, who died when he was 18 of a brain tumour, had suffered from, too. Karen would have given him a kidney if she could, but already knew she had only one good one herself. Ryan, who works for the Royal Air Force in recruitment and selection, was quick to step in. “For me, it was a no-brainer,” he says. “The experts told me I was going to be fine, so why wouldn’t I try to help somebody? Seeing how Lee’s health was deteriorating, there was never a question in my mind.”He cried after seeing Lee for the first time post-surgery. “It was just relief, I think,” he says. “The big thing for me was his eyes. As we’d got closer to the date of the operation, they were quite dark and sunken. When I saw him afterwards, it was like a different guy.” He has kept his green surgical socks looking at them makes him smile. Lee still finds it hard to grasp that a friend would do what Ryan did. “It’s taken me back to being twentysomething again,” he says. “It feels like a miracle cure.”The main business of the kidney is to remove toxins and excess fluids from the blood and turn the waste into urine when they don’t, those things remain in the body, causing symptoms including high blood pressure, extreme tiredness and persistent headaches. Left untreated, kidney failure is eventually fatal. Aside from a transplant, dialysis – which filters the blood using either a machine or the inside lining of the abdomen – is the main treatment but it only partially compensates for lost kidney function, is disruptive to daily life and can cause unpleasant side-effects. Transplants save and transform lives.“Kidney disease and dialysis affect everything that we would take for granted in life,” explains Lisa Burnapp, NHS Blood and Transplant’s lead nurse for living donation. “They can impact on your work, your ability to have children, what you can eat and drink, where you go on holiday.” And while the average wait for a kidney from a deceased donor has fallen to just over two years, a living kidney is preferable – because it comes from a healthy person and can be transplanted in a planned fashion. It’s often described as the Rolls-Royce of transplants.I joined Burnapp at Guy’s hospital in London on a sunny morning earlier this year, as she looked through the results of a matching run carried out the day before. The algorithm, developed by Glasgow University’s school of computing science, identifies several different types of swap. There are circular exchanges between either two or three pairs, but also chains started by altruistic donors – people who simply want to donate a kidney to anyone who needs it, rather than for someone close to them. These are gamechangers, Burnapp told me, because one of them can enable up to three transplants to take place, with one kidney ending up with a patient on the main waiting list.Altruistic donors on the register used to be given the chance to opt into the matching runs. But from this year, in a bid to increase transplant numbers, they have been added automatically – unless there’s a high-priority, difficult-to-match patient on the waiting list for whom they’re a “golden ticket”.We peered at Burnapp’s laptop: the matching run had been triggered at 10.39am plus 10 seconds. One hour, 32 minutes and 32 seconds later, the algorithm had sifted through 271 patients and their pairs to identify 82 transplants, including 17 three-way exchanges. It’s the highest number of transplants yet to be identified in a run. Exciting, said Burnapp, and proof that efforts to develop the scheme are working. “To me it’s really heart-lifting, because these are patients who would never see a transplant. It just means everything, really.”Since the living kidney scheme started in 2007, about 2,000 patients have registered on it, and more than 900 people have benefited from a transplant – including 19 children, the youngest aged three. As well as meeting a chain who have had surgery, I want to speak to a pair who are currently going through the process. I meet Richard and Maureen Ventre at the Royal Liverpool hospital with their donor coordinator, Ann Strong, 12 days before Maureen is due to give a kidney that will mean Richard gets a much-needed transplant. The retired managing director of a family construction business, he was diagnosed with a collapsed kidney in 2016. It was a shock: unlike a lot of kidney disease, his problems came on quickly. “It’s like you’ve got a nice lively battery in you and all of a sudden it’s just gone,” he says.He and Maureen met in the heatwave of 1976, working a summer season in a grand Georgian hotel in Torquay. He was a 23-year-old student from Liverpool and she, aged 17, had come all the way from Glasgow. The scousers, geordies and Glaswegians always seemed to gravitate towards each other, they remember, and one night they found themselves out on a double date. Today, they have the calm, quiet closeness of a couple who have been married for almost four decades.Six years ago the Ventres lost the eldest of their four children, Tim he drowned in a pool in El Salvador at the age of 30. He was a traveller, Richard explains, and they would love to follow in his footsteps south-east Asia, maybe, off the beaten track. They aren’t sure that will be possible now, but they keep it in mind.Maureen, who worked until recently in admissions at a local college, is twinkly-eyed and chatty, but when I ask about her decision to donate, her face crumples up with tears and no words come out. “It’s just obvious,” she eventually mutters. “No, it wasn’t hard.”In fact, she and Richard, 59 and 65 respectively, are compatible, so her kidney could have gone straight to him but they decided to use the sharing scheme in the hope of getting him an even better match. This is encouraged: the more pairs in the pool, the more transplants are likely. They are now in a long altruistic (and anonymous) donor chain: Richard’s new kidney will come from the altruistic donor and Maureen’s will go to a patient in another pair, whose donor’s kidney will then go to someone on the waiting list.At 8am on the dot on the morning of their surgery, Strong gets a call on her mobile from the hospital Richard’s kidney is coming from everything looks OK there. She checks in with the centre that will receive Maureen’s kidney it’s also good to go.I join her in theatre later. The kidney must be cut and cauterised away from the yellowy fat that surrounds it until only the vein, arteries and ureter are holding it in place the persistent snipping of the cutting tool rings out in the cool hush of the room. The keyhole surgery is done via three 1cm incisions, the surgeon, Ajay Sharma, wielding the instruments while the registrar holds the camera (the kidney will come out of a larger cut, around 7cm long). They stand almost shoulder to shoulder, never taking their eyes off the large screen above them, the pink of the tangle of kidney and fat it shows reflected in their glasses.Dan Ridgway, the second surgeon, watches from the sidelines. “These are the ones that keep me awake at night because, essentially, you’re a healthy person having an operation you don’t need,” he says. “I don’t even call them patients. They’re VIPs.” In the afternoon, he’ll be the one fixing Richard Ventre’s new kidney into place.Once the arteries are clamped and cut, it’s crucial for the health of the kidney that it’s removed as soon as possible. The time each is done is recorded on a whiteboard. “Time on the board, artery one,” Ridgway says. “12.06,” comes the instruction from Strong to a nurse. At 12.09, they repeat the process for the second artery. The vein is cut last, and suddenly, at 12.10, a bowl containing the kidney is thrust towards Ridgway. His task now is to swiftly cool it and flush out the blood. A tall man, he sits hunched over a trolley at the foot of the operating table, sets the kidney in a bed of sterile ice and uses tweezers to locate an artery. Hanging beside him is a bag of perfusing fluid – the liquid used to wash out the kidney – and once he has the artery between his thumb and forefinger, the registrar inserts a tube. The fluid rushes in and the water in the bowl gradually turns red as the blood flows out. The kidney gets paler. “It’s lovely to see it come to life when they transplant it,” Strong says, “because it goes in that colour and then pinks up.”Ridgway skilfully peels away the remaining fat and clips it off with long, curved scissors. “A good-sized kidney,” he says, giving it a little squeeze.The organ is triple-bagged, floating in perfusing fluid, and Strong buries it in an icebox. Ridgway gets a text from the surgeon who has removed the kidney that is going to Richard Ventre. “Everything fine,” it says. “Good luck.”Down the neon-lit corridor, the courier is already waiting for us and, as soon as the paperwork is filled in, she’s off, back down in the lifts and towards the hospital where the next patient in the chain is waiting. It’s 12.31pm. You can get a kidney pretty much anywhere in the UK in four hours, Strong says. Couriers will often use blue lights, and the organs are flown between cities for longer journeys. “Every hour counts,” she says. “The longer it’s out of the body, the slower it might be to work.”Just after 4.30pm, Ridgway – who’s been to Anfield to buy a Liverpool away kit for his son during the surgical break – pops his head into Strong’s office: the donated kidney has arrived. We fetch it from the ward and Strong hands him the box with a cheery, “It’s all yours.” He lopes into the lift, heading straight up to theatre. In the office, Strong reclines in her chair and beams. “There you go,” she says. “It’s great, isn’t it?”When we meet, David tells me he hadn’t wanted his wife to donate a kidney. “I just didn’t want her to go through it,” he says. “But she made me realise I had to do it – not just for myself, but for her.” They got together six months after Martha arrived in England from the Colombian city of Bucaramanga to study business in 1985, and married five years later. “Three months down the line, he got ill and the best years of our lives for having a family were gone,” she says. By his last year on dialysis, David was so weak that he was forced to close his successful design and artwork consultancy, aged just 49. “What kind of life is that for the two of us?” Martha had asked of the prospect of her husband going back on dialysis. “I didn’t think that I could cope with more,” she says.When he woke up from surgery last year, David couldn’t believe how well he felt. “I was sending texts, emails,” he says. “I felt great.” He listened to music on the radio a lot in the days that followed and frequently found himself in tears, overwhelmed by the realisation of what Martha, and the kidney exchange scheme, had made possible.“Some people say, ‘You’re unlucky because you’ve been ill so long’,” he says. “I’m lucky. I’m lucky that Martha came into my life and I’m very lucky that I’ve got this kidney. I’ve got a chance for us to go and enjoy ourselves.”This was Ben’s second transplant, too he suffered kidney failure at the age of 19 and his mother donated directly to him three months later. Early in 2016, the recruitment consultant was told by his doctors at St Helier hospital, in Surrey, that that kidney might only last another six months. He professes not to have minded the two months he spent on dialysis before his first transplant (“I got to watch Come Dine With Me for four hours three times a week and eat really nice sandwiches”) but this time, with a partner, a demanding job and a football team full of teenagers to coach, he was desperate to avoid it.The delay was difficult, but Ben was told that Ryan’s kidney – “a big juicy one” – was, in fact, a better match for him. “It’s working wonderfully,” he says. Of everyone in the chain, he’s the least given to dwelling on the emotional side of what he’s been through, though he does remember crying at his first dialysis session, struck by the reality of how ill he was.I spoke to Ben’s dad, Steve, on the phone. Although he lived overseas and ended up travelling back and forth to the UK seven times in a year as a result, he was determined to donate. “He’s my son,” the 55-year-old builder said. “Simple as that. You don’t like to see your kids suffering.”Steve hoped his kidney would give someone a good life but had never really thought about who might end up with it. “As long as Ben got his kidney and he was fine, you could have put it in a pie and cooked it, for all I cared,” he said. But when Ben gets hold of him on a video call at the photoshoot and David tells him how grateful he is, something shifts. “When I started speaking to David it sort of sunk in a bit,” he tells me later. “It was done for Ben, but I have helped someone else have a normal-ish life.”David, meanwhile, is thrilled to discover that his kidney came from a fellow Chelsea fan. He emails Steve that evening, and later shares the message with me: “It is an incredible feeling to think that someone like you has made this incredible gift for a loved one and you have ended up helping not one but two people,” it says. “A million thanks to you.”A few months after their surgery, I catch up with the Ventres. Richard’s kidney is working well and he’s started playing a bit of golf again. Maureen still feels lethargic at times, but she’s enjoying walking and swimming, and hopes to return to yoga soon. They are due to spend their 39th wedding anniversary at the hotel in Torquay where they met, their first trip back since the 70s. And they still hope to travel to some far-flung destinations one day, if the doctors approve.Meanwhile, the members of our six-strong chain plan to keep in touch. Ryan and Ben have been chatting online about their recruitment work David and Martha want to take Ben and his dad to a Chelsea match next time Steve is in the UK, maybe even get a box. Martha and Lee are meeting for a drink when he’s next in London, and she hopes to arrange a reunion for everyone a year from now.When they met, Lee told the group he’d thought he’d only be interested in meeting Martha, his donor. “But having met everybody it’s strange how it all feels interlinked,” he said. “None of it would have happened if it hadn’t been for everyone.”• For more information, go to organdonation.nhs.ukabout-donationliving-donation Hear Rachel Williams talk about the story behind this article on the new  podcast, Today in Focus, later this month, at the.Commenting on this piece?

Hannah Letters was one of them. She talks about how she got back on trackThe bullying started when Hannah Letters was 11. “I struggled with the transition to secondary school and found it hard to make friends.” Her classmates made snide comments about her appearance. When her mother was diagnosed with cancer, the comments got worse. She was sent messages on social media, telling her that no one liked her. “One of the girls turned and said to me, ‘If you had looked after your mother better, she wouldn’t have got cancer.’ I had such low self-esteem by then, anything she said I believed. I started to blame myself.”By the time she was 13, Letters was self-harming. The bullies were constantly on her mind and she would wake up screaming from nightmares. She wasn’t happy with the response she got from her school, and “each time my mother or I complained, the bullying got worse”. When the bullies physically attacked her, it was the last straw for Letters’ mother. She took her off the school roll. That meant her school was absolved of its legal responsibility to provide her with an education. She became yet another statistic: one of the 16,000 children aged 11 to 15 who, each year, “self-exclude” from school due to bullying.By then, Letters was a wreck and could not contemplate starting a new school. “I felt worthless, stupid, ugly and fat – I didn’t see the point in being alive. I had no motivation to learn.”Her mother’s attempts to home-school her soon floundered. Letters spent an entire year feeling too afraid to leave her home in case she ran into any of her old classmates. Her weight dropped dramatically and at 14, she tried to kill herself.Letters is now 17. Confidence radiates from her. She is a healthy weight and speaks so articulately and with so much dignity, it is difficult to believe she is still so young. A year ago, she started a BTec in applied science and is planning to study medicine at university and become a neurosurgeon. The calm assurance with which she says this makes it clear she will allow nothing to stand in her way.Her transformation began when an education charity, Red Balloon, took Letters on as a student at one of its “learner centres” three years ago. The charity combines educational programmes with therapeutic support and is the only one of its kind in the country. Each year, it helps traumatised and severely bullied children – most of whom, like Letters, have self-excluded from school – to get back on an academic track, make friends and reconnect with society, with the aim of them returning to mainstream education, training or work.“The chances that they would do that on their own is negligible,” says Carrie Herbert, a former teacher who founded Red Balloon 22 years ago in her own home. She had seen these children failed, repeatedly, by the education system – and she knew that without any qualifications they would suffer negative consequences from the bullying potentially for the rest of their lives. “In this country, children who bully get a funded education and the children who are bullied do not. Our students would have been on the scrapheap. They go back out into the world rescued.”The key to the charity’s success, she says, is that children are allowed to negotiate their own curriculum. “These kids have had a terrible experience and been out of school for years. When they arrive, they can’t look at you, they fidget, they shield their faces, they wear hoodies. We ask them what they are interested in. We aim to get them back into a love of learning.”Letters says: “The teachers at Red Balloon don’t treat you like a child. They teach you so you can progress in what you want to do. It’s very relaxed. You feel respected, and can trust them.”Teachers go by their first names and there are no uniforms. Half of each school day is devoted to nurturing the child’s wellbeing, involving therapy sessions and group communication. “Our aim is to return them to mainstream school, knowing how to build relationships and how and why relationships break down,” Herbert says. “They arrive with no self-esteem so we want them to leave with a good track record in education, knowing they’re competent and can problem solve. And finally, we want them to leave with friends.”It is this aspect of the course that has had a huge impact on Gaby, 16 (not their real name). The trans teenager had suffered verbal and physical homophobic bullying for years at school, despite repeatedly reporting the abuse to teachers. By the age of 14, Gaby had started to self-harm and at 15, attempted suicide. “I couldn’t see any other way out. Other people hated me so much, I hated myself.”After the suicide attempt, Gaby self-excluded from school. Two months later, they started learning online with RBAir. Within a month, they had stopped self-harming and experienced a dramatic improvement in their mental health. “At first the other students didn’t know I was trans because they couldn’t see me, and then later when we met up, they had already accepted me for who I was. Plus, when you have been bullied yourself, I think it makes you more tolerant and open-minded.”Three months into the programme, Gaby was discharged by the NHS from weekly therapy sessions. They left Red Balloon and restarted mainstream education in September. Letters is feeling equally positive about the future. “I feel a lot of hope.” Her mother, who has recovered from her cancer, is a constant source of support. How to parent a bullied child, by Carrie Herbert of Red Balloon1 Talk to the school, and try to get alongside them. “Tell the head, ‘I’m really interested in having my child in this school and being educated.’ Then talk about their strategies for tackling bullying. Ask how you can help. Education is free in this country, but sometimes you have to fight for it. If the school says it is your child who is the problem, ask them: why aren’t they dealing with the problem then?”2 Don’t take your child off roll. If the school threatens to prosecute you because your child isn’t turning up, go with it and say in court: “My child is not at school because he or she was being bullied and here’s the evidence – all the letters and emails I have written.” If you take a child off roll, you are abandoned, she says. “You get no speech therapy, no counselling, you can’t access children’s mental health services – your child has effectively gone missing.”3 Don’t criticise your kid. “They hate it. It doesn’t matter if it was sarcastic or a joke. Never ever say it. Instead, listen to your child. Believe what they say. Unconditional love builds self-esteem.”• You can donate to Red Balloon at  redballoonlearner.org. In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org.

Five years on, as they gear up for their opening game against the same opposition in St Lucia on Saturday, this time in a World T20, they will be hoping to avoid a similar fate.This time around, the personnel look rather different. Of England’s 15-strong squad, eight did not play in the last World T20 in 2016, and the batter Sophia Dunkley and left-arm spinners Kirstie Gordon and Linsey Smith have never worn an England shirt.In particular, England will feel the loss of their world-class wicketkeeper Sarah Taylor, who is staying at home in an effort to manage her anxiety condition and Katherine Brunt, the all-rounder who has been ruled out the tournament after scans confirmed a flare-up of her long-standing back problem would not allow her to participate.“We’re a very different team to the last 20-over World Cup in 2016,” Knight added. “In T20 we’ve become a lot more consistent. We’ve played some really exciting cricket recently and chased down 180 a few times. Now it’s about trying to do it on the world stage.”Brunt’s role as a bowling all-rounder who has batted as high as No 4 for England in T20s this year makes a like-for-like replacement difficult. She will be replaced by the Middlesex batter Fran Wilson, who is unlikely to arrive in time for the opening match. Moreover, Taylor’s reserve, Amy Jones, may be almost equally as deft but has yet to prove herself with the bat in the shortest form, with a highest score of 30 to her name.England are the 50-over champions and ranked third in T20, so go into the tournament as strong contenders but much will hang on the performance of their batters. In June, against South Africa at Taunton, the world record total in women’s T20s was broken twice in the same day: women’s T20 cricket is rapidly becoming a batter’s game. England will take heart from that performance, in which they reached 250 for three, thanks to a 47-ball century from Tammy Beaumont. Her opening partner Danni Wyatt has also flourished of late, having hit two T20 centuries in the past 12 months and the Wisden cricketer of the year, Nat Sciver, has also been in fine form, leading Surrey Stars to victory in the Kia Super League.Given Brunt’s absence Sciver, the all-rounder who took 10 wickets in the KSL with her medium pace, is also likely to play an important role with the ball in a squad dominated by spinners. The loss of Brunt may open the way for either Gordon or Smith to make their debut, with the coach Mark Robinson hoping his surfeit of left-arm spinners – the 19-year-old Sophie Ecclestone makes up the trio – will make up for any failings in the fast-bowling department.“We’ve got a bit of a union going on,” Ecclestone said. “We help each other out in training with field settings and general left-arm spinner chat.”England are somewhat fortunate in that they have been drawn in the relatively easy Group A, alongside West Indies, South Africa, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. Australia, New Zealand and India (plus Pakistan and Ireland) make up Group B. England’s biggest group challenge looks to be against the defending champions, West Indies, who dismissed them for 116 in their warm-up, winning by five wickets.Should England top the group they are likely to face New Zealand in the semi-final. While the Kiwis sit above them in the rankings, England’s utter dominance over them in the summer, culminating in a seven-wicket win in the Tri-series final, should leave them confident of victory. A bigger concern will be ensuring they avoid a semi-final against Australia and thus any chance of a repeat of their 2016 encounter in India, whereby they collapsed horribly and lost by five runs.Format\u0026nbspRound robin within groups top two in each group qualify for semi-finalsGroup A Bangladesh, England, Sri Lanka, South Africa, West Indies (hosts and holders)As three-times champions and the No 1 ranked side, Australia pose a formidable threat. With a batting lineup so long the ’s top-rated female cricketer of 2018, Ellyse Perry, features only at No 7, it is easy to see why they are the favourites. Their bowling unit is also threatening, with the young left-arm spinner Sophie Molineux, who finished as leading wicket-taker in their whitewash of Pakistan last month, looking to make her name during the tournament.All 23 matches will be broadcast live, with the decision review system in use for the first time at a T20 World Cup. The standalone tournament, the first of its kind, should be another step forward for the women’s game."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bcfbb5e6f4f613097e61d3c079cc5e168bf8fa10/77_143_2048_1228/master/2048.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1b7f2c4e9e97d3372343db50998d9d6d","title":"sports quiz week manchester city united f1 wayne rooney","story":"Who scored?

It is the way the emotional Liverpudlian would want it, belligerently defiant all the way to the last bell, whenever it is rung, at 35.If “Bomber” conjures up a 34th win to round out a career that began 11 years ago on a Nottingham Saturday night on which Amir Khan and Kell Brook shared a dressing room but few pleasantries, he will surely leave to thundering applause from all around the Manchester Arena. If he loses, he will do so in a doomed blur of leather.Bellew – who came in less than a pound below the 14st 4lb limit on Friday, and a pound heavier than the champion – declared: “I feel fantastic. Fat boy is in shape. Usyk is in the deep end. There will be war. He’s a formidable champion, one of the pound-for-pound kings of the world. We’re going to create madness.”A Bellew victory is unlikely, whatever the enthusiasm of his British backers. Usyk, younger and frighteningly fresh, arrives with all four cruiserweight belts after wrenching the WBC and WBO versions from the grasp of the similarly awesome Murat Gassiev in August, which brought to a rousing conclusion the World Boxing Super Series tournament at the weight just below heavy – where Bellew made such a dramatic statement in two stoppage wins over David Haye, closing out his rival’s own excellent career.Now it is his turn. Can the British fighter who produces almost as many words as punches say goodbye in style? He expresses no doubts or apprehension. He is convinced he can do again in the ring what is least expected of him and live out another fairytale to go with the heroics he portrayed on his film debut two years ago in Creed. Bellew played the part of “Pretty” Ricky Conlan in that film, a source of much merriment (and no little pride) to his friends.But he is back in his serious job now. These punches are for real and Bellew, a canny boxer, will do well to stay out of the way of those thrown by a 31-year-old foe with few battle scars, a technician who has stopped 11 of his 15 opponents, with aggregated rather than lightning power. It could be a long night.When Bellew ventured to Quebec five years ago to confront a more established ring monster in Adonis Stevenson, he also made the requisite noises. He was going to destroy the knockout ogre they were calling Superman but whom Bellew preferred to characterise as “a small man with a huge ego”. Superman, the WBC’s and Ring magazine light-heavyweight champion, hardly lost an exchange or a round and dropped and stopped Bellew (dazed on his feet in a neutral corner) in round five.Bellew turned 31 on the night of his most crushing ring experience. Five Novembers later, he vows to make his farewell a night to remember.So, why? Because he can. He’s still fit, strong and, for one night at least, has the fire to compete. His best chance is an early stoppage.As for Stevenson, he is 41 and still knocking opponents out. And eerily, on 1 December in Quebec, he fights another 31-year-old, 15-0 Ukrainian called Oleksandr – Gvozdyk – in the 10th defence of the light-heavyweight title he put on the line against Bellew in the same city in 2013.Symmetry would suggest wins for the two older men might lead to a rematch. As far as Bellew is concerned, that will not happen. He says he is through with boxing after this and heading off to Hollywood again, for a less stressful but no doubt as colourful new life."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7c7ec2710608904245e067dabbec62a0ad1a9dcd/0_17_1930_1158/master/1930.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=41b40fe7650b3bb95b7fc02d81a0d0fb","title":"england v new zealand all blacks rugby union international live","story":"62 min: After an exchange of kicks, McKenzie was then on Read’s shoulder and darts through midfield, past Underhill, outpacing George and leaving Daly on the deck. But just as he looked up for support there’s Farrell to bring the All Black No 15 down on the 22. Great stuff. Danny Care has replaced Youngs and TJ Penerara is on for Aaron Smith. 61 min: McKenzie on halfway with men outside tried a grubber through but it spooned off Farrell’s boot and went backwards. the full-back managed to clean things up and then Barrett sent a big kick into England territory. “Don’t knock blokes with mullets. After all, they’re just guys without mullets who decided to wear a mullet.” Hard to disagree with John Nugent. That looked awkward, he almost miskicked it, but the ball got through the posts and New Zealand have the lead for the first time. 58 min: England offside, Farrell and Ioane exchange some choice words, Barrett points to the posts. To the left of the field, just outside the 22.57 min: But some excellent work at the breakdown, wins the turnover and Youngs is able to box-kick clear. Still on the 22, mind. Williams and Hepburn on for Moon and Sinckler as it’s all change in the front row for both teams. 57 min: George with a truly awful lineout throw gifts the ball back to New Zealand and England are in trouble. 56 min: Excellent kick from Barrett, from right to left, gets the ball back in the England 22. Ofa Tu’ungafasi replaces Karl Tu’inukuafe in the All Black front row.55 min: A delay on the throw, however, means New Zealand get the ball back with Barrett pumping a kick into their back three. Daly responds with his own up and under and then Retallick trues to restart New Zealand’s charge. 54 min: Oh dear, Damian McKenzie. Good ball off the back of the scrum and then from his own 22, as Barrett passed back to him, he puts it out on the full. England lineout. George to Itoje methinks. 51 min: Scott Barrett has replaced Liam Squire at No 6. One less mullet. More emails from around the world...“Watching in Ningbo, China. Made a special trip just to find a bar to see this.Been getting my students into rugby, talking about this game all week. Gonna be Eng 41-31 NZ,” writes Tim d’Arville.“That said, NZ do often seem to punish teams straight after the break, so lets see what happens here!”And Jeannie Jones in Hoi An: “Thanks for a great commentary I’m a kiwi currently holidaying in Vietnam, unable to find any tv coverage of the game - very grateful for your updates!”50 min: Itoje grabs another lineout, from a slightly higher throw. Thye maul doesn’t work so Youngs throws a dummy, rolls his body around the tackler and gets within a metre. But Itoje’s offload off the next possession is dropped by Sinckler. 49 min: Itoje is George’s man and they attempt another driving maul but NZ hold out. Sinckler has a go but is denied. The All Blacks have conceded a penalty, though. Farrell again goes for touch and a lineout on the 5m line. 48 min: Ioane was isolated defending a long kick forward. England’s chase was excellent and Ashton and Te’o gobbled him up, winning the penalty. The hosts take the lineout, 5m out. Garces had his hand in the air for a penalty but Smith  it back to Barrett who from the edge of the 22 just floated it through the posts. His first ever international drop goal.46 min: Gainline, gainline, gainline. New Zealand are hitting it and getting across every time. England defending inside their own 22. 44 min: Double replacement for New Zealand with Laulala and Coles on for Franks and Taylor. Seems odd to do that now. 44 min: New Zealand, though, have the momentum and the ball. Similar to how they finished the first half. After a little break from Barrett, Read attempted a little first-time offload to Ioane on the touchline but it flew out of touch. 42 min: What a let off for England! McKenzie as first receiver, a little step inside into Barrett who feeds Aaron Smith. But then with a 2 v 1 and 10m out, Read’s pass to Savea is shocking and the openside drops the ball. 41 min: Daly clutched onto Barrett’s restart and made a small gain over the 22 before Youngs sent another of those box-kicks towards McKenzie. His take was a little clumsy but NZ kept hold of the ball, building possession. Another is that England missed 23 tackles in that half, and New Zealand just three. The players are back on the field for the second-half and Jamie George has replaced Dylan Hartley. Andrew Hurley, meanwhile, has a different take on Sam Underhill’s first half...“It’s so funny as a non-English supporter to watch analysis of English players - usually it’s lauding Itoje who is like a 16th player for the opposition with the amount of penalties he gives away, but he’s loved for his youtube contributions. Similar today with Underhill – some highlight reel tackles, but two pens given away and missed a shocking tackle on Crotty for the NZ try. But Sky etc reckon he’s great...”Always helps when you get a big cut on your face, Andrew.Some shout outs to our global audience, following Tom Mayfield’s email... “A tip for Tom in Virginia from me in Indianapolis. He could sign up to Florugby, on which site I’m watching. By the way, I’m not sure why tipping rain would be advantageous to England - it rains plentifully in New Zealand also!” writes Stephen in Indianapolis.

Merci beaucoup, but worried that it was all a horrible mistake caused by the weather! Are England really playing that well?

Well, maybe start by signing up to our free and excellent weekly email on all things rugby. Do the needful here...A truly excellent 37 minutes of rugby from England who will feel a touch annoyed they shipped those 10 points at the end there. That’s give New Zealand a way back into the game and it was notable as we ticked towards the break how much Barrett started passing, as opposed to kicking the ball. His influence steadily growing.Up until that point, it had been all England. Purposeful and inventive. They were consistently getting over the gainline and the lineout was very impressive, both on their own and in challenging New Zealand. Underhill is going through some serious work off the ball and Farrell, up to that silly restart, was excellent. So too Young, whose box-kicks have proven an effective weapon, especially in this weather. Barrett trims England’s lead to five points. 40 min: Penalty for New Zealand with England up too quickly after a fine break from Goodhue who, after being tackled, was driven a further 15m downfield. Read, this time, wants a shot at the posts. Bang in front of the posts, it’s a sitter for Barrett.40 min: Farrell puts the restart straight out. Sloppy stuff as we approach half-time. Shields is back on the field for Lawes, who made eight tackles in the time he was on. Some shift. The right decision by Read. Crotty did the hard work, bursting through the midfield and got within 5m. Some iffy defence on England’s part. They were briefly held up but eventually it’s passed out to McKenzie on the charge who runs into a hole, on Te’o’s left side, to collects Barrett’s inside pass and cross over almost unguarded and New Zealand have their score. Barrett converts. 37 min: Shields is on the exercise bike and ready to come back on. 36 min: But some magic from McKenzie opens up some space and he offloads to Crotty. Ioane and Goodhue then combine down the left wing to get into the England 22. Underhill again with a monster hit. May was able to intercept but Garces was playing advantage for an offside and NZ have a penalty around 10m out, in a central position. Read elects to go for the set-piece, not the posts. 33 min: Retallick with half a break but Youngs was hanging on his shoulders and the big lock was brought down. Goodhue, who we’ve seen little of, and Whitelock try to puncture some holes as it’s worked towards the right flank. But England have NZ going square andor backwards and Underhill’s tackling has been fantastic. 32 min: Itoje winning more excellent lineout ball and England are doing everything right. But Ardie Savea is a colossus at the breakdown, winning a penalty as May was unable to release the ball. Tom Mayfield gets in touch: “Here in Virginia USA, 100 channels on NFL, NBA etc not one on Rugby. Travesty, reading you on my phone, thank you for detailed reports. Go England.” My pleasure, Tom. 30 min: England looked to be mounting an overlap down their left wing, up against Squire and Taylor, but Slade elected to kick. Drilling a 50m effort deep into NZ territory. In other news, Ryan Crotty is on for Sonny Bill Williams who looked in some discomfort. 29 min: Ben Smith on the move, darting through the England defence and moving from the left to right-hand side. He attempts to offload to Taylor but the hooker knocks on. England clear and then, in reply, Barrett kicks into acres off space on the right wing. England now countering. An excellent take from Jeremy Dresner, here: “Beauden Barrett’s suggestion of a mullet compliments his team’s powers right now. It’s obviously strong at the back but not quite all there for the All Blacks right now.”27 min: Shields is off the field for a head assessment. 26 min: Wonderful from McKenzie with a little chip and chase through midfield. He gathered and then fed Barrett who planted a grubber and had the England defence on their heels but Ashton got his hands on the ball. Early replacement for England with Courtney Lawes on for Brad Shields. He doesn’t look particularly injured. Textbook stuff this. Solid lineout throw by Hartley into Itoje who gathered and then England drove with Hartley receiving the ball at the back of the maul as it twisted towards the line. The All Blacks had no answers and the captain was able to e over. Farrell converts. 22 min: Youngs, again, with a box kick picking out McKenzie. The full-back spilled that one, with Ashton breathing down his neck, forward into Barrett’s arms who was standing in an offside position. Daly blasts one deep into the New Zealand 22. England lineout about 10m out. 20 min: England won the scrum and Youngs cleared. From the lineout, despite some intense pressure – an early tenet of this game – Barrett gets his hands on the ball and dinks a little half-volley into space but England recover. 18 min: Aaron Smith tries to get Retallick on the charge but Itoje’s line speed was fantastic and a real clash of the titans. New Zealand finally getting their hands on the ball, and work some possession, before Barrett delivers an up and under which Youngs knocks on just outside the 22. New Zealand scrum. 16 min: After an exchange of kicks, New Zealand attempt to get some backline sets in their own half but Williams spills the ball. A break in play as Hartley is having a contact lens replaced, which also happened last week.

He wants to think everything through because you need to press the advantage when you have the first move, and I get that, but is he really going himself a favour by being behind? His opponents have succumbed to the pressure of time in the past. He won’t, in all likelihood, but if he really does not leave anything to being risked, what about the time?

The alpha male of his 32-strong group, David is the battle-scarred king of the swingers, although maintaining his status means that every moment is spent sniffing out dissent. If the younger males aren’t beating seven bells out of each other, they are banding together and plotting to dislodge their leader, coming at him with sticks or lobbing clods of earth at his head.Viewers mourning the absence of old-fashioned bloodletting and gore in the autumn schedules should look no further than the new David Attenborough series, Dynasties (Sunday, 8.30pm, BBC One). Not since House Stark crumbled in Game of Thrones have we seen such vicious backstabbing, ruthless power moves and brutish, bruising violence. Just because we don’t see sibling incest doesn’t mean it isn’t happening.Two years in the making, the opening episode follows a gaggle of critically endangered chimps in Senegal where water is scarce and breakfast consists of termites teased out of sandy mounds using grass stems. Theirs is a gritty tale of loyalty, duplicity and the dogged struggle to survive. The burghers of Westeros have nothing on these fearsome beasts. David has been the leader of the group for three years but allies are increasingly thin on the ground and the junior males are restless. No wonder all hell breaks loose when a trio of chimpettes saunter by, their swollen rear ends signalling that they’re ready for some hot lovin’. Far be it for me to pass comment on a person’s downstairs department, but their glistening lady parts resemble a flash sale at Krispy Kreme doughnuts. The young ’uns are keen for some action, but David knows he must be the one to seal the deal. Failing to father the next generation is to confirm he isn’t the ape he used to be and that his power is on the wane.If David is basically Game of Thrones’s Ned Stark, doing good by his family and friends while struggling to assert his authority, the younger, obstreperous male, Luthor, is the odious pipsqueak Joffrey, poised to slaughter his enemies, torture their sons and force himself on their daughters. For every scene featuring a sweetly jug-eared infant, there are 10 more of snarling teens beating up elderly chimps and cooking up a violent coup. Such is the hardship and brutality on display that the occasionally anthropomorphised touches are entirely welcome, although when we are introduced to “an alpha male known as David”, you fully expect a young chimp to swing by shouting: “Oi! Dave, fancy a pint?”Attenborough’s narration delivers harsh truths about life and death in his customary avuncular, seen-it-all tones, all set against a rumbling soundtrack that conspires to make your heart swell one minute, and then smash it to bloody smithereens the next. Shot in eye-watering closeup and unafraid of showing us nature’s cruel underbelly, Dynasties is quite the departure from Planet Earth’s elegant, widescreen splendour.Pull up the drawbridge and ready the direwolves. Winter is coming."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c660dd4cf5c01f4cf3efbfa7cce1ac1d9eb4624d/0_14_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e84d089014e041690b16bad01fb00908","title":"georgia election recount stacey abrams brian kemp","story":"Stacey Abrams and Brian Kemp are locked in a dispute amid allegations of voter fraud – something that has plagued Georgia in its historyGeorgia’s hard-fought and bitter governor’s race still isn’t over.Nor was it just a gubernatorial campaign pitting rightwing Trump acolyte Brian Kemp against insurgent Democrat Stacy Abrams and her bid to become the first African American woman governor in US history. Instead it was a battle years in the making, and it was not so much about who to vote for – but who could vote at all.Kemp has declared victory and handed in his resignation as secretary of state – the very office that oversees this contentious election. The outgoing governor Nathan Deal, has declared him the victor.There’s just one catch.Abrams’ campaign team is still counting the votes. Her campaign manager, Lauren Groh-Wargo, said from the campaign headquarters Thursday: “All of the votes in this race have not been counted. All the voters of Georgia deserve to be counted before the now-former secretary of state announces his victory.”According to a statement posted on the Georgia secretary of state’s website while Kemp was still in that role, counties have until 9 November to verify provisional ballots and until 13 November to certify the results.After Kemp’s resignation, National Association for the Advancement of Colored People president Derrick Johnson released a statement, filled with refrains echoed by other legal experts, civil rights figures and Kemp’s adversaries during and prior to the election.He said: “Kemp’s actions during the election were textbook voter suppression. His actions were strategic, careless and aimed at silencing the voting power of communities of color in the state.”Consider these numbers.• In the three months leading up to election day, more than 85,000 voters were purged from rolls under Kemp. During 2017 a huge 668,000 voters were purged, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.• Of those 2017 numbers, investigative reporter Greg Palast told Salon, 200,000 people left the state, died or moved out their district, making them legitimate cancellations. However, through litigation, he got the entire purge list. “Of the 400,000 who supposedly moved, our experts will tell a court that 340,134 never moved – wrongly purged,” Palast told the , saying people had been purged for not voting in an election or two.• Furthermore from 2012 to 2016, 1.5 million voters were purged – more than 10 percent of all voters – from records, according to a 2018 report from the Brennan Center for Justice. In comparison, 750,000 were purged from 2008 to 2012.Kemp took office in 2010 and he and fellow conservatives argue the law requires ineligible voters who move or die to be cleared from rolls. But voting rights advocates say the removals disproportionately affect groups who tend to vote at lower rates, like minorities and low-income voters – the same groups who generally support Democrats.It’s a fundamental problem that stretches back into the history of Georgia and the wider south where racial tensions and the fight over who can vote persists from the days of civil rights struggles.Sophia Lakin, a staff attorney on the ACLU’s Voting Rights Project, points to the fact that until 2013 Georgia was covered by a section of the Voting Rights Act that stipulated it submit election changes to get “pre-clearance” from the federal government – a protection meant to protect minority voters.She said: “It was a hugely important part of maintaining fair voting practices in places in this country that had a long history of discriminating on racial grounds.”But with those protections now gone for the last five years – that covers Kemp’s period in office – many activists say minority voting rights have been threatened again.Legally, it has been lawsuit after lawsuit in Georgia.Before the 2016 general election, Common Cause, a nonpartisan grassroots organization, and the NAACP filed a lawsuit against Kemp, seeking an injunction to block Kemp from more voter purges based on a registered voters’ failure to vote.Voter purges aren’t the sole concern for critics of the conservative, Trump-endorsed candidate.Abrams’ team also claims the race is too close to call because of other forms of voter suppression lobbied by her adversaries – all ones that could have cost her the governorship.Days before early voting began, a civil rights group sued Kemp “over the state of Georgia’s discriminatory and unlawful ‘exact match’ voter suppression scheme”, resulting in 53,000 pending voter registration applications which they claimed affected mostly minority voters.The “exact match” policy is when a voter’s application has to match – without an errant dash, space, hyphen or period, for example – the information listed in social security or driver’s license databases. On the first day of early voting, a bus full of African American senior citizens on their way to a voting center were turned back. Organizers called it “live voter suppression”.A few days before the election a white supremacist group released racist – and fake – robocalls impersonating Oprah Winfrey, just as she arrived in metro Atlanta to stump for Abrams.Then there was the announcement Kemp was looking into unfounded hacking allegations against Democrats just two days before the election.On election day, Abrams’ fears seemed to come true. witnessed long lines in various parts of metro Atlanta, where the majority of counties lean Democrat. MIT’s Election Performance Index for 2016 suggested Georgia ranked 49th out of 50 for wait times to vote.In the state’s second largest, hotly contested – and traditionally Republican but becoming Democratic – Gwinnett County, an entire polling location at Annistown elementary school was offline when the doors opened at 7am. The county cited issues with the express polling machines that make the electronic ballots, said Joe Sorensen, a county official who showed up at noon.The NAACP sued successfully to keep two polling precincts near the historically black colleges Spelman University and Morehouse College open until 10pm.“It’s easy to vote and hard to cheat in Georgia,” Kemp said Thursday. But on election day, a local news channel claimed even Kemp had difficulties voting, with his vote card coming up as “invalid”.The current high stakes impasse between the two front-runners is actually a sequel.A similar scene played out in the lead up to the 2014 midterms when Abrams was the then-Democratic minority leader in the Georgia house and Kemp the secretary of state. In an effort to increase voter registration among minorities, young adults and unmarried women, Abrams launched the New Georgia Project. According to the non-partisan organization’s website, the aim was to target more than 700,000 unregistered Georgians who happened to be people of color.Kemp accused the organization of voter fraud. Leaked audio from a Republican breakfast in Gwinnett county, now Georgia’s most erse, recorded Kemp as saying: “You know the Democrats are working hard, and all these stories about them, you know, registering all these minority voters that are out there and others that are sitting on the sidelines, if they can do that, they can win these elections in November.”At the moment, Kemp is holding firm. Since the night of the election, he has said: “The math is on our side.” He implied that the argument over voting in Georgia is over.Abrams disagrees. The Georgia Democratic party filed a lawsuit Thursday to extend the deadline for absentee ballots in Dougherty county, a southern county affected by Hurricane Michael in October.“That’s probably the election for Kemp.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fcefaad77593a2e61f5f31ea2b2e96ad03ffe871/36_448_3453_2072/master/3453.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=088efe9d1dbc7704f10c0ec187c3774a","title":"beyond the cenotaph communities prepare for armistice centenary","story":"From Shetland to St Helier, UK events will join thousands of global commemorationsShortly before 7pm on Sunday, Geoffrey Priest will make his way to a point close to the top of Saxa Vord, a hill near the northernmost tip of the Shetland island of Unst, armed with some kindling, a small amount of paraffin and a blowtorch.“It’s a pretty wild place in the winter time,” says Priest, and a force five wind is predicted for Sunday. But as a joiner who “can put my hand to most things”, he is confident he will be able to light the beacon that will be the centrepiece of the island’s commemoration of the centenary of the armistice.It’s an important thing to do, says Priest, “because there were so many folk that fought in the war from Unst, and quite a few who lost their lives here.” In total, 600 Shetland men lost their lives in the first world war, a higher proportion than anywhere else in Britain.The Unst beacon may be Britain’s most northerly tribute to the dead of the Great War, but it will be just one of many thousands of acts of commemoration taking place across the UK – and much further afield – to mark the centenary on Sunday. The Queen, Theresa May and the German president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, will mark the event at the Cenotaph in London on Sunday, and more than 70 world leaders will gather at the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, but for many, the most moving ceremonies of remembrance will be small and local, reflecting the terrible loss experienced by so many communities around the world.It is impossible to know how many events will be taking place on Sunday. In Britain alone, the government-backed site Armistice 100 has recorded more than 2,600 ceremonies – bell-ringings, church services, parades, exhibitions – in communities scattered across the map, but these are likely to be only a fraction of those planned.An initiative called Battle’s Over lists more than 1,000 commemorative beacons and a similar number of churches and cathedrals ringing bells, while more than 2,000 inidual pipers will play tributes in locations including Denmark, Canada, Australia, Somaliland and Iran.The War Memorials Trust estimates that there are more than 100,000 memorials in the UK, and expects the majority of them to be the focus of an act of remembrance this weekend, a spokeswoman said.In Jersey, the torch used to light the beacon at the St Ouen headland will be carried from St Helier by 14 motorbike riders in a “solemn and respectful” tribute. Players at the women’s international football match between England and Sweden in Rotherham on Sunday afternoon will wear black armbands and poppies and stand in tribute while wreaths are laid in the centre circle before kickoff.The pastor of a church in Olean, New York state, marked the announcement of the armistice in 1918 by dashing from his house and ringing his church bell 100 times the town will mark the centenary by repeating the feat on Sunday. New Zealand will mark the moments after its commemorative silence with a national “roaring chorus” – a jubilant cacophony of bells, sirens and car horns in echo of the spontaneous outburst that accompanied the news of the end of war a century ago.In Beeston Regis, a village near Sheringham in Norfolk, the parish council has printed and distributed a booklet about the village’s wartime connections, ahead of services, a beacon lighting and a tea dance at a school on Sunday evening.The village had signed up to take part in the commemorations, “but to be honest with you that was just Last Post, light a beacon, ring the church bell,” says Roy Beckley, the council’s vice-chair. “I just said, ‘I don’t think we’re going to get many people out by our village sign or wherever on a dark night in November. We’ll need something to attract them. So we’ll have a tea party.’”With a population of only 1,700, they are expecting 170 at the party, including families and people of all ages. The fare, says Beckley, “will be very simple and based on 1914 stuff. I suspect there will be egg sandwiches, tomato sandwiches. We don’t want anything that wouldn’t have been around – samosas and chicken legs and all that stuff.“But we think we have not done a bad job on this commemorative thing. For a little parish, we try to do things properly.”A similar spirit has inspired the residents of Burton-in-Lonsdale, Cumbria, which lost 20 men in the war and where local organiser Mike Biles estimates 70 of the 600 villagers have been directly involved in planning its commemorations. As well as film screenings, an exhibition and a “heritage” football match, Sunday’s commemorative events will be followed by a “trench stew” supper and wartime singalong at the pub.People felt it was important that the commemorations weren’t merely solemn, Biles says. “There has to be some hope coming out of it – it can’t all be doom and gloom and Wilfred Owen. I can imagine that the guys that didn’t make it back would like to think there was some purpose, and it wasn’t all bad.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4f55e9de3ac215a4c5fa91e375e7ab1d12daceae/0_286_4622_2773/master/4622.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9c8c29331417408df625da250fbe1735","title":"germany france uk us and saudi arabia have khashoggi tapes","story":"Turkey has shared audio recording of Saudi journalist’s killing, President Erdoğan saysAnkara has given recordings on the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi to Saudi Arabia, the US, Germany, France and Britain, Turkey’s president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has said.Khashoggi, a critic of de facto Saudi ruler Prince Mohammed bin Salman, was killed in Saudi Arabia’s Istanbul consulate last month in a hit which Erdogan says was ordered at the “highest levels” of the Saudi government.Speaking as he left Turkey to attend first world war one commemorations in France, which are being attended by the US president and European leaders, Erdoğan said for the first time that the three European Union states had heard the recordings.“We gave the tapes. We gave them to Saudi Arabia, to the United States, Germans, French and British, all of them. They have listened to all the conversations in them. They know,” Erdogan said.The CIA director, Gina Haspel, heard an audio recording of Khashoggi’s death when she visited Istanbul, two sources told Reuters last month. A senior Saudi envoy was also played a recording, a source familiar with the matter said. Erdoğan did not give details of the contents of the tapes on Saturday but two sources with knowledge of the issue have told Reuters that Turkey has several audio recordings.They include the killing itself and conversations pre-dating the operation which Turkey subsequently uncovered, the sources said. These had led Ankara to conclude from an early stage that the killing was premeditated, despite Saudi Arabia’s initial denials of any knowledge or involvement.Saudi Arabia’s prosecutor Saud al-Mojeb has since said Khashoggi’s killing was planned in advance, although another Saudi official said Prince Mohammed had no knowledge of the specific operation.

When Italy finally emerged from its crushing triple-dip recession in 2015, Brescia, an important European industrial hub some 50 miles east of Milan, enjoyed uninterrupted growth.But business leaders argue that the budget contains little to spur growth and investment, and will instead lead to an economy based on “handouts”.Pasini said it would also diminish a programme introduced by the previous centre-left government known as Industry 4.0, which is credited with enabling companies to expand and compete in global markets: it provided tax incentives for innovation, training and the purchase of new machinery.Giordano Riello, the founder of three electronics companies in the Veneto region, who has benefited from the programme, said the coalition government lacked long-term economic vision.“What we need is investment in infrastructure, factories and materials … not giveaways to make people happy for only a brief time,” he said. “I’m really afraid to invest in my country right now as there is no future vision. All we have is populism, and you don’t develop with populism.”There are warnings that measures including the so-called dignity decree, introduced in July by the M5S leader, Luigi Di Maio, to curtail temporary job contracts and penalise companies that shift production abroad, could have the opposite effect.“The labour market decree makes it much harder to hire temporary workers, yet such contracts are a crucial part of employment,” said Francesco Giavazzi, an economics professor at Milan’s Bocconi University. “As for taxing companies for delocalisation – modern firms try to optimise the value chain by building firms around the world. If you don’t allow them to do that, they will move everything abroad.” The move to lower the retirement age was aimed at making more jobs available to young people, but companies might instead use it as an excuse to reduce labour costs, Giavazzi added.Licia Mattioli, chief executive of the jewellery company Mattioli and a vice-president at Confindustria, the confederation of Italian industry, said the slowing economy was a result of uncertainty as well as anxiety over the costs of servicing the country’s debts.She also criticised the budget for lacking a clear investment strategy, especially for much-needed infrastructure projects. The coalition partners, for instance, are currently locked in battle over TAV, a high-speed rail project linking Italy and France that M5S opposes and the League supports. Mattioli is worried about it being cancelled: “Not only will it mean €9bn worth of investment for our country, but it gives us a high-speed link to Europe.”The looming budget standoff also poses an acute dilemma for the European commission,  of EU law, which rejected Italy’s draft spending plans in a historic moment last month. For long-serving EU officials, the power to reject the budget of the third-largest economy of the eurozone makes a lot of sense – until it actually has to be used.The commission is seen to be in a lose-lose situation: if it rejects the budget again, officials fear it will provide ammunition for the League’s anti-EU crusade being led by the deputy prime minister, Matteo Salvini. But allowing the plans to pass would send a message that the EU’s common-currency rules do not matter.The decision to let France and Germany off the hook in 2003 for breaking the eurozone’s fiscal pact is judged to have been a hugely damaging mistake that poisoned relations between large and small eurozone members. So far, the other 18 members of the eurozone have backed the commission against Italy, but that has done nothing to ease the wrangling.In front of the cameras, EU ministers and officials have taken a softly-softly approach, but behind the scenes there is anger about Rome’s spending plans. One senior European source said the fight with the EU was political, and accused Italy’s government of misleading its public by suggesting economic bounty was around the corner.Italy’s budget “is not only a mistake, it is a lie”, the source said. “What Salvini wants to prove is that he is not sticking to the rules.” The source believes the Italian government is seeking to emulate the economic policy of the US, but that it lacks America’s structural economic strengths, such as high productivity and high employment rates.The EU’s Rome-watchers take little comfort from the fact that Italy’s rising bond yields may prove a more effective sanction than decisions by Brussels technocrats. “You can get away with a crisis until the moment the markets say enough is enough,” said a senior EU official.As crunch time approaches, Pasini is urging Italian leaders to take heed of business concerns. “Firstly, Europe is essential for Italy and its industry. I hope our politicians understand this and that we don’t reach a point where the country becomes isolated,” he said. “Secondly, we hope they modify some of this budget.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7fedbadad2f4cb0e61f2322420ea0d09670381d6/0_187_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0c0efd9e9c6b5064772e89209238fd3d","title":"the secret lives of trees what to expect in autumn","story":"It’s the season to get lost in beautiful shades of reds, yellows and oranges – but do you know the science behind these vibrant displays, or the role fungi play in the season?“The trees are in their autumn beauty,” wrote the Irish poet William Butler Yeats. “The woodland paths are dry.” Immersed in rich colour and deliciously crunchy underfoot, a woodland walk in autumn is surely one of the most pleasurable and relaxing activities offered by the British countryside.Yet, those excursions are not always quite as straightforward as they appear. For one thing, British trees are rather complicated in their leaf-shedding habits and really vary according to location – autumn takes a while to arrive across the whole country.In the Scottish Highlands, for instance, the woods of the glens are already steeped in golden yellow as early as mid-September. Their canopies are also susceptible to immediate demolition should an early Atlantic storm pass through.In Derbyshire, many woods can often be cleared of vegetation by late October – yet, at the same date in Norfolk, which is more than 300 metres lower in altitude, there are oakwoods looking as emerald green as they did in midsummer. Come November, many trees seem to have barely cast a leaf.Another interesting thing about that leisurely autumn stroll is the environmental intensity that underpins it. Poet John Keats may have famously called it the “season of mists and mellow fruitfulness”, but it is anything but. What really drives those glorious colours in the trees is the stress of hard work.The element of almost all plants responsible for making summer so green is chlorophyll. But as well as being the miracle worker that turns sunlight to sugar during photosynthesis, chlorophyll is also a precious protein. Before they shed their leaves at the end of season, deciduous trees devote themselves to breaking it down and storing it away for another year.Sugar also plays a part in one of autumn’s most dramatic changes. It reacts with proteins in leaf cells to produce an antioxidant called anthocyanin. It is this red-pigmented agent that supplies the slow-burning glow of British woods. Ironically, the more stressed the trees are, the richer those reds seem to be. Autumn foliage is often more intense, for example, after sharp frosts.Of course, there’s more to the season’s full palate of colour. When you think of the lemon and burnt-biscuit fingers, say, of horse chestnuts, or the dull copper carpet that covers the floor of a December oakwood, those browns and yellows are what happens when a tree’s foliage loses all its chlorophyll.But what really makes autumn such a spectacle is that all these extraordinary colours occur together: so you might get the crimson of London planes colliding with the emerald of holly and ivy, or the scarlet berries of hawthorn and dog rose at the same time as the infinite earth tones of toadstools.Mushrooms may be the most modest player in this infinity of colour, but they supply the other great engine of autumnal change. It is the season when we get to see the extraordinary fruiting bodies, the so-called “toadstools” of fungi. It seems more than coincidence that these bizarre organisms are substantially made from the same stuff as insects – chitin – because, like insects, they have a gift for unexpected appearance. Suddenly they bulb up among tree roots, or emerge out of the heartwood like some chest-bursting creature from Ridley Scott’s Alien.These are the parts that digest the organism’s vegetable diet and then traffic it through the woodland floor. They also play a part in the development and maintenance of the canopy, because fungi in woods forge essential partnerships, whereby the roots of the trees interconnect with what are called mycorrhizal fungi. This link between trees and fungi enables them to share vital nutrients.In a single kilo of woodland soil there can be six miles of hyphae. Beneath an inidual wood, there will be many millions of miles of these fungal networks, and they are at the heart of the extraordinary demolition procedure that is at autumn.Without fungi, the world would be buried in this vegetable junk and life would stagnate for the lack of carbon dioxide.So next time you stroll along a woodland path in autumn with trees changing colour, remember that it’s these incredible underlying, unseen essentials that make everything around us possible."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3684184.1541167032!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"no more buck passing or dithering dublin needs a new boss","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tIllustration: Fuchsia MacAreeThere’s a classic trope in horror films where the protagonist sets aside the norms of rational behaviour and goes down into an unlit cellar, or gets into a car with an obviously unhinged stranger, while the audience can see the terrible event about to unfold and are willing the victim to retreat.It’s a feeling that will be familiar to any long-time observer of Dublin local authority proceedings. Impending disaster is painfully apparent and yet, time and again, councillors willingly and wilfully hurl themselves lemming-like over cliffs to lose their limited powers in the ravine at the bottom.In 2001, councillors – all councillors not just Dublin ones – lost their powers over waste collection and disposal, following their failure to ratify plans for waste disposal facilities, or any form of waste charging. As a result this power was transferred to council management, hugely unpopular bin charges were introduced, and the Poolbeg incinerator, which all parties opposed, was built.More recently, the failure to agree a route for the Liffey cycle path, which had been six years in the planning, resulted in the scheme being removed from the control of Dublin City Council and handed over to the National Transport Authority.In this case it wasn’t just the councillors (who couldn’t agree traffic ersions past their constituents’ houses) who were to blame, but also council officials, who produced endless iterations of the scheme, one of which saw double-decker buses rerouted through an existing apartment block.The most recent, and one of the most damning failures or officialdom to get to grips with decision making, is the College Green plaza refusal farce. The council tip-toed around the issue for a decade, tinkering with selective traffic restrictions, musing over fountains and statuary, but never really grasping the problem, which required getting buy-in from Dublin Bus before the project went to An Bord Pleanála for approval – a step which itself should have been taken years before.Surely there’s a better way of getting things done in the city. Could this dithering, bottling, buck-passing and procrastination be solved by Dublin having a directly elected mayor?“The central power, the most important point, of having a directly elected mayor, is that they have a ‘bully pulpit’,” Dr Deiric Ó Broin, DIT academic and co-author of the upcoming book Mayoral Governance in Dublin, argues.“The elected role gives them the authority to argue for more investment in the city, for keeping a more appropriate share of the money generated in Dublin. And they have to deliver their job is on the line. If they don’t deliver they may not be re-elected. That concentrates minds.”However, the concept of a mayor is one thing, the reality of the role and its functions is quite another, Ó Broin says.“The big issue is what powers the mayor would have and where would they come from. There is no point if the mayor is just a lord mayor, as in they have significant ceremonial but minor functional role, but who lasts for a five-year term.”Dublin city chief executive Owen Keegan agrees. “If it is to be successful the directly elected mayor has to have real powers, but he or she can only have real powers where the powers are taken from somewhere else. This notion that there’s some unallocated power that you can give to the mayor has no basis in reality – all power is already allocated.”And there isn’t much power within the hands of the council to give to a new mayor, Keegan says. “Since local government is weak here, the power and functions would have to come from central government, and that is a real issue because if there’s a directly elected mayor who is responsible for energy, and communications and transport in Dublin it doesn’t leave very much for the central Government to do.”Another vexing issue is what physical area would be governed by the mayor. “Culturally and politically we are obsessed with counties and county boundaries. I could see an argument for a city-only directly elected mayor and that gets away from that problem, but I don’t see how a city-based mayor could have responsibility for transport in Dublin, which crosses local authority boundaries,” Ó Broin says.This issue of boundaries played a large part in the collapse of the last mayoral plan. In 2013, then minister for the environment Phil Hogan decided, despite there being no legal requirement, that the councillors in all four Dublin local authorities would have to be in favour before Dubliners would get a chance to vote in a plebiscite on whether or not to have a mayor.The following year Dublin City, Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, and South Dublin voted overwhelmingly in favour of the proposal but it was vetoed by Fingal, whose councillors felt they would be the poor country cousins, largely ignored by a city-focused mayor who would only be after their airport.As Gerry McGuire, a Labour councillor at the time, said there would be “no chance of getting a pothole fixed in rural Fingal”.Hogan showing great fortitude in keeping a straight face said he was “disappointed” as he was “the greatest proponent of devolution probably in the history of the State”.Last year the Government revived the mayoral proposal, making provision for a plebiscite this year, but it has recently kicked the can down the road, and kicked it out of the capital, determining that regional cities would vote at next year’s local elections on whether to have a mayor, but in Dublin it would first be referred to a citizens’ assembly for the capital.It seems like another unnecessary hurdle given that a similar forum spent five months formulating proposals for the mayor’s role in 2013, and, at that time surveys showed public support for a Dublin mayor was up to 80 per cent.Even if Dublin does get a mayor, what the Government appears to be proposing is a toothless role, either a mayor with the same powers as the current lord mayor, except elected, or an “executive mayor” who would take on some of the functions of the council chief executive.A plebiscite to decide whether there should be a mayor is unnecessary, Lacey says. “If the Government is serious about making progress let them legislate for it now. There is no need for a plebiscite. Successive governments never sought permission as they systematically dismantled local government in the past, so let them just repair it.”However, Lacey does not believe it’s necessary that the mayor would be all-powerful from the outset. “Calling for the full range of powers to be set out in advance is misguided. This is a position and a role that needs to be established and then given space to evolve.”But he says he can see particular areas where a mayor could make achievements straight away which might seem minor, but would be significant.“A mayor could initially have responsibility for natural resources. For example there isn’t much point in Dublin City Council cleaning the river Dodder in Donnybrook, if it’s not being cleaned first in Tallaght. Or sports capital grants – it makes no sense for a civil servant sitting in an office in Kerry to decide what local sports organisation in Dublin gets a grant.”Then, he suggests, other powers could be added such as waste and traffic policy, which should be “brought back under control of the council anyway”, he said.Ó Broin cites the system in Copenhagen as one where the mayor having control of these services works well. “The mayor has responsibility for education, welfare, labour services, welfare, climate change and a range of municipal services – Denmark, and Scandinavian countries in general, have very good, empowered local government.”Further afield, Boston and Toronto are recognised as good examples of mayor-led cities, he says. While our nearest neighbours have had some successful mayors, in some British cities, including Stoke-on-Trent, they have scrapped the office.The London model, Lacey believes, is not the system that should be copied in Dublin. “I don’t think the London model is a good one, with an all powerful mayor and a fairly toothless assembly. I’d like to a see a mayor working in partnership with a much smaller council – 24 or even 18 councillors. We should reduce the four councils to a manageable size, and give them more responsibility.”Keegan thinks the London model has worked well, particularly in relation to the mayor’s transport and policing supervisory functions, but he is with Lacey on the reducing in numbers of councillors from the current 63 in the city.“I am impressed by cities that have a small number of full-time councillors. In many cases they have executive functions. I think these councils, with a large number of councillors, make everything very difficult. Dublin City Council is too large. We are twinned with San Jose, where there’s a mayor, and I think they have eight or nine council members.”Keegan, however, remains unconvinced of the merits of having a mayor in Dublin. “I am a little bit concerned that the next ‘big idea’ is the directly elected mayor, and we’ll all lorry into that with great enthusiasm, but I have seen very little convincing analysis as to why this is such a good idea.“It’s been presented as a panacea to everything that’s wrong in Dublin, that will automatically be made right the day after we have a directly elected mayor.”Dublin doesn’t get credit for its success he says. “I don’t accept the notion that Dublin is a basket case. On many parameters Dublin is a very successful city. A good litmus test is the multinationals. They come here because they can attract people to live here. Of course it has problems with transport, and housing but these are problems of success. There was no housing affordability problem when we were in the depths of recession.”The “mad rush” towards the directly elected mayor idea reminds him of the “mad rush” to set up Irish Water. “Water supply was and is a major challenge but there was a notion that if you set up a separate utility everything would be hunky dory, but its implementation left a lot to be desired.”If the implementation of the mayor is poor, Dublin could find itself losing more than it gains, Keegan says.“There are strong arguments for a directly elected mayor, and I’m not saying there isn’t scope for improvement in the city’s governance, but there is a danger if we rush into this it won’t achieve any of its objectives, we’ll lose the things that work, and we’ll be worse off.”Each of the proposals in this Capital Ideas series has been put to a group of three experts for an initial “back of an envelope” evaluation. They are: Frances Ruane, former director of the Economic and Social Research Institute Caroline Spillane, director general of Engineers Ireland and Cliff Taylor, economics columnist with The .Caroline Spillane I have reservations about this plan, particularly due to the size of Dublin relative to the country as a whole. One person would have responsibility for 40 per cent of our population. The powers of this office would need to be carefully defined.The proposed mayor would be in a position of power for only five years, which could lead to short-term thinking.Cliff Taylor This proposal has surfaced in various forms over the years and fits into a common theme that restructuring institutions or posts can fix problems. This could be a good idea, but the job spec, powers and budget are key. The benefit depends on how it is structured – and who is elected, of course.It is a useful proposal but to work it requires a new vision for local government, something talked about for years and years but never delivered.Frances Ruane Cities with elected mayors seem to work well. However, in Ireland, this would have to be set up as part of a rebalancing of central and local government, if it is to work. If the city itself does not have decision-making power, then adding a mayor will not solve the problem.Meanwhile, Dublin City Council should work on its governance and adopt an integrated problem-solving planning approach. This must involve all four authorities working together. That would involve no serious resource costs.How can we improve Dublin city\u0026rsquos infrastructure, services and daily life?

Savour that moment because this may well be the very last time this particular ritual will ever happen.If all goes according to a plan laid out by the European Commission, the last-ever mandatory clock change in the European Union will take place in 2019. Member states must notify the commission by April of next year on whether they want to opt for permanent summer or permanent winter time. Whether all 27 states are prepared to go along, however, is not yet clear.This weekend, the Department of Justice (which has responsibility for everything to do with timekeeping) is announcing plans for its public consultation here on the proposal.A recent European Commission online public consultation across the EU found 84 per cent of citizens were in favour of ending the changing of clocks in spring and autumn.The commission trumpeted the fact that it had got 4.6 million responses, the highest number ever received in an exercise of this sort, and that 84 per cent of those backed the change to a single year-round time.Less loudly advertised was the fact that engagement varied significantly from country to country three million of those responses came from Germany, representing almost 4 per cent of that country’s population. In contrast, less than 0.25 per cent of Irish people bothered to respond.The question now is whether inidual member states will agree to proceed along the lines advocated by the commission, which has stated a preference for summer time to be applied universally. There is potential for chaos, with a patchwork of time zones emerging across continental Europe.Initial polling, for example, suggests people in the Netherlands and Denmark would prefer permanent winter time, while Germans want summer time.“We are not proposing that the whole EU either switches to summer or winter time,” said transport commissioner Violeta Bulc at a press conference last month. “All we are proposing is that we do it together.”But clock-switching on the Dutch-German border is hardly the desired outcome.An intriguing twist from the Irish perspective is whether the UK, at a moment of heightened political tension, will view this as a symbolic opportunity to flaunt its newly acquired independence.Brexiteers’ enthusiasm for such a stance may be dimmed when they realise it would mean Britain sharing a time zone with Brussels and Berlin for almost half the year.But understandably, media coverage here so far has focused on the prospect of travellers from Dundalk to Newry having to adjust their watches – or of people nipping across from Lifford to Strabane in search of an extra hour’s drinking time.For geographical and historical reasons, Ireland and the UK have been on the same clock since Dublin Time was abolished in the wake of the Rising in 1916.We moved in lockstep with the UK when it experimented with year-round summer time in the late 1960s, and any recent proposals for change, such as one mooted in a Private Members’ Bill rejected by then minister for justice Alan Shatter in 2013, have been contingent on decisions made at Westminster and, more recently, in Brussels.So what would the changes mean? If Ireland opts for year-round daylight-saving\u0026nbsptime, then dawn won’t break in the west of Ireland until almost 10am in mid-December. However, if “winter time” is maintained throughout the year, sunrise in Dublin will occur well before 4am in June, and the stretch in the evenings will be a lot less grand, with sunset happening before 9pm even in midsummer.Those are the extremes, but where permanent summer time offers real gains is in the “shoulder months” of November, February and March, when the majority of people will have much more daylight at the end of their school or working day without too much negative impact in the mornings.There has been a broad attempt across the world in recent decades to do away with annual time-shifts, based on data about their negative health effects and on a more general sense that an additional hour of daylight in the evening is more valuable than one in the morning.Meanwhile, the main rationale for the current system – reduced electricity usage – has been rendered less important by the introduction in recent years of energy-efficient electric lighting. Lifestyles have also changed enormously since the current system’s introduction a century ago, and even since the last experimental change 50 years ago.Flexible working time, increased leisure opportunities and longer retail opening hours all have an effect on how we spend our day.The main impediment to change, it seems, is institutional. In the US, legislators in California and other states are also pushing for year-round daylight-saving\u0026nbsptime, but they need to persuade the federal government before they can proceed. As in the EU, American legislation allows each state to decide its time zone but forbids inidual states from choosing when or if to change their seasonal clocks. Whether the gridlocked US political system can respond remains to be seen.Here, the Department of Justice’s public consultation asks three questions. Do you want to stop changing the clocks twice a year? If the clock changes stop, do you want to remain on summer time or winter time? Is staying on the same time as the UK more important than your choice of summertimewintertime?“It is very important that as many citizens as possible respond to this consultation and express their views so that the Government may take account of public opinion when considering this proposal by the EU,” says Minister for Justice Charlie Flanagan, clearly implying that the Government will take account of public opinion without being bound by it.Ultimately the success or failure of the proposal may come to be seen as a test of the EU’s ability to act quickly and decisively on a simple issue which will have an almost immediate effect upon people’s lives. The process so far has been startlingly fast, but the national consultations may be a different matter, depending perhaps on the views of the people who get up early in the morning."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3692556.1541788287!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit downing street rejects dup s betrayal claims","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDUP leader Arlene Foster with UK prime minister Theresa May. Photograph: Charles McQuillanPA WireDowning Street has rejected claims that British prime minister Theresa May is preparing to “betray” the Democratic Unionist Party by accepting a backstop that could leave Northern Ireland under different customs and single market rules to the rest of the United Kingdom.In a letter to DUP leader Arlene Foster and her deputy, Nigel Dodds, Mrs May said she could not accept that there would be any circumstances in which a Northern Ireland-specific customs backstop could be allowed to come in to force.“The prime minister’s letter sets out her commitment, which she has been absolutely clear about on any number of occasions, to never accepting any circumstances in which the UK is ided into two customs territories. The government will not agree anything that brings about a hard border on the island of Ireland,” a Downing Street spokesman said.Ms Foster said she interpreted the letter as a signal that Mrs May was ready to accept that there would be Northern Ireland-specific elements in the backstop she is hoping to agree with Brussels.“The prime minister’s letter raises alarm bells for those who value the integrity of our precious union, and for those who want a proper Brexit for the whole of the UK,” she said.Mrs May’s cabinet is expected to meet early next week to consider a draft withdrawal agreement including a compromise proposal on the backstop. If ministers back the deal and EU member states approve it, it could be signed off at a special EU summit in late November.Downing Street has consistently maintained that a UK-wide customs backstop would remove the need for a Northern Ireland-specific backstop. But the prime minister’s letter makes clear that the backstop will include Northern Ireland-specific requirements for regulatory alignment with the EU.The DUP’s Brexit spokesman Sammy Wilson said Mrs May was guilty of a “total betrayal” of promises she made to ensure that there would be no border in the Irish Sea after Brexit. Mr Wilson made clear that the DUP’s 10 MPs at Westminster could not vote for a Brexit deal that included such a backstop.The prime minister’s prospects of winning a parliamentary majority for a Brexit deal dimmed further on Friday when Jo Johnson resigned as transport minister and called for a second referendum. Mr Johnson, whose brother Boris was one of the leaders of the Leave campaign in 2016, said Britain was “barrelling towards an incoherent Brexit” that would leave the country trapped in a subordinate relationship to the EU.Mr Johnson said that, now that it was clear what leaving the EU actually looked like, British voters should be allowed to make the final choice about how to proceed.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward. I can\u0027t imagine celebrities would want to be associated with Philip Green. He\u0027s in a tricky situation.

evaluate the impact of reducing the number of free-to-use ATMs on vulnerable consumersAn inquiry into consumers\u0027 access to financial services has been launched by MPs amid concerns some vulnerable customers are finding it increasingly difficult.The Treasury Committee will scrutinise whether certain groups of people are excluded from obtaining a basic level of service from providers.It will also examine whether vulnerable consumers pay more for financial services products.\u0027Almost everything has changed in banking since the financial crisis\u0027Nicky Morgan, who chairs the Treasury Committee, said: “Vulnerability, as defined by the FCA (Financial Conduct Authority), is where someone who, due to their personal circumstances, is especially susceptible to detriment, particularly when a firm is not acting with appropriate levels of care.“With customers expected to take more responsibility for their financial planning and resilience, bank branches closing and the number of free-to-use ATMs falling, it\u0027s becoming increasingly difficult for vulnerable customers to access certain financial services.“The committee will examine the practicality of the FCA\u0027s definition, the effectiveness of attempts by financial services providers to prevent increased financial exclusion and whether a premium is placed on products such as travel insurance for vulnerable consumers.“As part of this inquiry, we\u0027ll be holding sessions outside of Parliament to hear from vulnerable consumers who have interacted with financial services providers.”Bank branch closures reach ‘alarming’ rate of 60 per month Bank pairs bank branches with customer service. It worksEx-Barclays boss Antony Jenkins says bank branches will be blitzedQuestions the committee will consider include how financial services firms define vulnerability.It will look at the training in place at financial services firms in relation to vulnerable consumers and consider the merits of having a “duty of care” for financial services providers and examine whether this would increase protection for vulnerable customers.The committee will also examine which customers are most disadvantaged when bank branches close and consider whether there is evidence to suggest that bank branch closure leads to increased financial exclusion.It will also evaluate the impact of reducing the number of free-to-use ATMs on vulnerable consumers.Other aspects of financial services the inquiry will look at include how firms ensure their information is accessible to people with low literacy levels the use of the Post Office\u0027s services in areas where bank branches have closed the systems in place for power of attorney at financial services providers, and whether certain barriers which lead to people not having a bank account.The inquiry will also examine whether vulnerable consumers pay prohibitively more for certain financial services products, including travel and home insurance.The committee also wants to know how technological innovation could help those who cannot easily access physical financial services branches.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

By mid-December, one bitcoin was worth close to $20,000 (£15,000), but that was the high water mark before the tide turned.A year later, bitcoin is trading at around a third of its peak value but some cryptocurrency analysts believe the market might be on the verge of mirroring the gains it experienced in late 2017. The only caveat is that it might not be bitcoin that leads the charge this time.Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne, who was behind the online retail giant becoming\u0026nbspone of the first places to accept bitcoin back in 2014, said\u0026nbspthat he still expects\u0026nbspthe mass adoption of cryptocurrency, without specifying\u0026nbspwhich one.Speaking to bitcoin enthusiast Naomi Brockwell on her YouTube channel, Mr Byrne said he remained highly sceptical of the traditional financial system. When asked if he saw bitcoin becoming a worldwide currency, he pointed to countries like Venezuela that have experienced significant financial turmoil in recent years.When people start getting into it is when their own financial systems collapse, he said.

So at this stage, it’s difficult to predict exactly what will happen.Looking longer term, Mr Ostler said bitcoin is expected to experience steady growth over the next year, with the panel of experts predicting an average\u0026nbspvalue of $16,732 by the end of 2019. “With bitcoin being very stable and within a range between $6,800 and $6,100, it is hard to suggest anything will change until it breaks this range, said cryptocurrency trader Craig Cobb, who forms part of the panel.leveled out in recent months (CoinMarketCap)But if it\u0027s not bitcoin, a\u0026nbsphint at what this next break-out cryptocurrency might be was given earlier this week by Blockchain, the world\u0027s most popular bitcoin wallet. On Tuesday, the company announced it would give away $125m-worth (£96m) of the Stellar cryptocurrency as part of a major initiative to encourage its use as a mainstream form of payment.Stellar is currently not even in the top five cryptocurrencies in terms of its total value, according to CoinMarketCap, but while it may be lesser-known, its backers say it is more technologically advanced and better suited to large-scale usage.\u0026nbspethereum cryptocurrency has a market cap of around $22\u0026nbspbillion (Getty Images)Another cryptocurrency that could see massive gains in the coming months, some experts say, is bitcoin\u0027s closest rival ethereum.

In the first half of 2018, 2,692 shops closed, while 1,569 opened – leading to a net loss of 1,123. The closures were mainly seen in the areas most affected by online shopping, such as fashion and electricals, while a shift to “in-home leisure” saw pubs taking a hit and 340 stores in the restaurant, catering and entertainment sector disappearing. Why the death of the high street is good for men – and bad for womenPhilip Hammond to announce £1.5bn plan to support high streetDebenhams to close 50 stores putting 4,000 jobs at riskAsos sales soar as online retailer leaves high street rivals behindSome of the UK’s biggest retail brands have been rocked by financial difficulties this year, with many forced to close branches. House of Fraser\u0026nbsprecently\u0026nbspcollapsed into administration after a Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA) aimed at cutting costs failed to impress creditors. The chain was subsequently bought by Sports Direct founder Mike Ashley, but he has been unable to save all stores. Meanwhile, Mothercare announced earlier this year that it would close 50 stores under a CVA, and Marks \u0026amp Spencer said it would close 100 shops over the next four years.Lisa Hooker, consumer markets leader at PwC, said: “The continued rate of store closures reflects the new reality of that many of us prefer to shop online and increasingly eat, drink and entertain at home. The high street is adapting to an overcapacity in retail and leisure space resulting from these channel shifts.“Openings simply aren’t replacing the closures at a fast enough rate. Specifically, the openings across ‘experiential’ chains, such as ice cream parlours, beauty salons and vape shops, haven’t been enough to offset closures in the more traditional categories.”Ms Hooker warned that the turmoil facing the sector is “unlikely to abate”. “Store closures in H2 due to administrations and CVAs already announced will further intensify the situation,” she added. “The British high street is in urgent need of new ways of thinking and new forms of retail. Encouraging this should be a priority. “However, it remains to be seen if recent packages of support for the high street and reductions in business rates for smaller retailers will be sufficient to stimulate this.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The European Commission – the heart of the Brussels empire, the “EUSSR”, – was always going to project a weak economic future for the UK post-Brexit, wasn’t it?A\u0026nbspgroup led by the malevolent Jean-Claude Juncker was\u0026nbspalways going to show the remaining 27 nations of the EU prospering while Britain, out of the club, stumbles helplessly.Such is the conspiratorial temper of our times that such reactions to the latest forecasts from the commission, showing precisely that, are sadly inevitable.UK set for weakest growth in Europe, European Commission warnsBut it’s still a silly conspiracy. For the commission’s forecasts for the UK are not, in fact, wildly different from those of others.The commission sees UK growth in 2019 of a paltry 1.2 per cent. The most recent average forecast from a range of UK forecasters – UK banks and economic consultancies – is growth of 1.4 per cent.That would leave us with faster projected growth than Italy – but still below every other EU economy.It’s true that the Office for Budget Responsibility in last week’s Budget projected growth of 1.6 per cent next year. But this was mainly due to the boost to demand from the chancellor’s extra spending on the health services and his income tax cuts. The OBR expects growth to fall back in 2020 to 1.4 per cent.The idea that the commission has produced some ridiculously pessimistic outlier forecasts for the UK doesn’t stand up to scrutiny.The commission thinks growth in the eurozone and the EU will slow down too in 2019, but not to the extent that it will in the UK.There’s another vital piece of context. The commission’s forecasts – like those of the OBR – are based on the presumption of a smooth Brexit next year, where we secure a withdrawal agreement and remain in the single market and customs union until the end of 2020.The weakness in almost all forecasts essentially reflects assumptions that the UK economy is slowing due to weakening household demand, feeble business investment and lacklustre exports.That may, or may not, be borne out.But in a sense it’s a red herring when thinking about the economics of Brexit.The really important forecasts to bear in mind are those of a severe economic shock in the event of a no-deal Brexit and long-term damage to our potential growth rate as a result of a Brexit in which we leave the single market and customs union.On this credible economists and forecasters are united.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Shoppers are increasingly staying home and ordering online“Help,” cried the retail industry.No wonder. Ten years ago this month Woolworths went pop. Dark clouds seem to have been bubbling and spitting over the high street ever since. That was underlined by a report by PricewaterhouseCoopers, the professional services firm, showing that a net 1,123 stores vanished from Britain’s top 500 high streets in the first six months of this year.\u0026nbspThe numbers probably won’t surprise anyone given the high-pocalypse we’ve witnessed among some of retail’s biggest names this year, including the likes of Toys ‘R’Us, Maplin, Poundworld and House of Fraser.\u0026nbspBritish high street is losing 14 shops a day, new research showsTowns with ‘unhealthy’ high streets have lower life expectancyWhy the death of the high street is good for men – and bad for womenHowever, closures have actually been outstripping new openings since 2010, and the gap is widening.Of course, the British Retail Consortium steamed in with a call for the government to take urgent action on business rates, beyond the tinkering contained in the chancellor’s recent budget.\u0026nbspThe levy is linked to property values and so hits bricks and mortar operators a lot harder than online outfits, which run their operations from out of town in places where you can buy land for a handful of coppers and a Mars bar.\u0026nbspIt has become the industry’s bête noire, and the trade body wouldn’t be doing its job if it didn’t make a fuss about it. But even if you completely eliminated it, the trend would likely continue, albeit perhaps at a slower rate.Britain\u0026nbsphas\u0026nbspembraced internet shopping like almost no other nation, and that isn’t changing.\u0026nbspIt’s so much more convenient to have the retailer come to you\u0026nbspwhen the alternative is\u0026nbspslogging around the high street trailing children who’d rather be somewhere else and hoping you get finished\u0026nbspbefore the traffic wardens notice\u0026nbspyour car is illegally parked. Doubly so\u0026nbspif\u0026nbspyou’re time poor. Most Britons are. We\u0026nbspwork some of the longest hours in Europe.\u0026nbspPwC’s head of retail, Lisa Hooker, pointed out to me that 20 per cent of non food items are now bought online. The number is set to increase to 30 per cent by 2021. That says it all.So does this mean the high street is in terminal decline? Are the debates over its future worthless?\u0026nbspNot necessarily. Hooker made note of the fact that all the reliable surveys show that there is still a demand for bricks and mortar shops.\u0026nbspConsumers\u0026nbspjust use them less than they used to, and they want them to operate differently, alongside and as a complement\u0026nbspto their online excursions.\u0026nbspThat means the future will have to be made up of smaller premises that operate as mini showrooms, alongside “experience”\u0026nbspretailers such as vape shops and ice cream parlours, which have been doing well. As have\u0026nbsp(hooray!) book and record shops, which have been\u0026nbspmaking a come back.Encouraging short term “pop up”\u0026nbspstores to open temporarily\u0026nbspalongside them them could help\u0026nbspdraw people in.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Coca-Cola has paid £3.9bn for Costa Coffee.

The truth is that ministers have dithered and delayed for far too long. We now need urgent action.”Nuclear waste could be buried underneath national parks, say MPsSue Ferns, senior deputy general secretary of Prospect union, called the decision “devastating”.“Government has ultimate responsibility for ensuring a secure and stable supply of energy throughout the UK,” she said.“The truth is that ministers have dithered and delayed for far too long. We now need urgent action.“Our analysis shows that if the Government were to take a 50 per cent\u0026nbspstake then there would be a net benefit to the public purse, so there really is no excuse not to.”Shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey said Labour supports Moorside as they see nuclear as a key part of the UK’s energy mix, but said the government should have stepped in to support it.A Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy spokesman said Toshiba’s withdrawal was “entirely a commercial decision”.“Nuclear has an important role to play as part of the UK’s erse energy mix as we transition to a low-carbon economy, but in each case projects must provide value for money for consumers and taxpayers,” they said.“This government remains committed to new nuclear through the Industrial Strategy Nuclear Sector Deal as well as consenting the first new nuclear power station in a generation at\u0026nbspHinkley Point C.”Critics of nuclear power said the government should see the new circumstances\u0026nbspas an opportunity to move away from nuclear to cheaper technologies such as wind and solar power.“Shifting away from expensive, complicated technology towards cheaper and easier-to-build renewables gives the UK the opportunity to build an electricity system that will keep bills for homes and businesses down for years to come,” said Dr Jonathan Marshall, head of analysis at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit.“Cancelling Moorside does leave a gap in the UK’s decarbonisation plans, but one that is more likely to be filled with the technologies of the future rather than the past.”Additional reporting by PA.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It worksEx-Barclays boss Antony Jenkins says bank branches will be blitzedQuestions the committee will consider include how financial services firms define vulnerability.It will look at the training in place at financial services firms in relation to vulnerable consumers and consider the merits of having a “duty of care” for financial services providers and examine whether this would increase protection for vulnerable customers.The committee will also examine which customers are most disadvantaged when bank branches close and consider whether there is evidence to suggest that bank branch closure leads to increased financial exclusion.It will also evaluate the impact of reducing the number of free-to-use ATMs on vulnerable consumers.Other aspects of financial services the inquiry will look at include how firms ensure their information is accessible to people with low literacy levels the use of the Post Office\u0027s services in areas where bank branches have closed the systems in place for power of attorney at financial services providers, and whether certain barriers which lead to people not having a bank account.The inquiry will also examine whether vulnerable consumers pay prohibitively more for certain financial services products, including travel and home insurance.The committee also wants to know how technological innovation could help those who cannot easily access physical financial services branches.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

In the first half of 2018, 2,692 shops closed, while 1,569 opened – leading to a net loss of 1,123. The closures were mainly seen in the areas most affected by online shopping, such as fashion and electricals, while a shift to “in-home leisure” saw pubs taking a hit and 340 stores in the restaurant, catering and entertainment sector disappearing. Why the death of the high street is good for men – and bad for womenPhilip Hammond to announce £1.5bn plan to support high streetDebenhams to close 50 stores putting 4,000 jobs at riskAsos sales soar as online retailer leaves high street rivals behindSome of the UK’s biggest retail brands have been rocked by financial difficulties this year, with many forced to close branches. House of Fraser\u0026nbsprecently\u0026nbspcollapsed into administration after a Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA) aimed at cutting costs failed to impress creditors. The chain was subsequently bought by Sports Direct founder Mike Ashley, but he has been unable to save all stores. Meanwhile, Mothercare announced earlier this year that it would close 50 stores under a CVA, and Marks \u0026amp Spencer said it would close 100 shops over the next four years.Lisa Hooker, consumer markets leader at PwC, said: “The continued rate of store closures reflects the new reality of that many of us prefer to shop online and increasingly eat, drink and entertain at home. The high street is adapting to an overcapacity in retail and leisure space resulting from these channel shifts.“Openings simply aren’t replacing the closures at a fast enough rate. Specifically, the openings across ‘experiential’ chains, such as ice cream parlours, beauty salons and vape shops, haven’t been enough to offset closures in the more traditional categories.”Ms Hooker warned that the turmoil facing the sector is “unlikely to abate”. “Store closures in H2 due to administrations and CVAs already announced will further intensify the situation,” she added. “The British high street is in urgent need of new ways of thinking and new forms of retail. Encouraging this should be a priority. “However, it remains to be seen if recent packages of support for the high street and reductions in business rates for smaller retailers will be sufficient to stimulate this.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Sterling dropped more than 0.3 per cent against the greenback to $1.3021, and fell 0.21 per cent against the euro to €1.1471.

While growth for the third quarter on the whole was lifted by 0.6 per cent - the fastest rate since 2016 - economists said this was likely to be a one-off. With “persistent Brexit uncertainty and the financial squeeze on consumers and businesses likely to weigh increasingly on economic activity in the coming quarters”, according to Suren Thiru of the British Chambers of Commerce. Meanwhile, Schroders senior European economist Azad Zangana said the economy is not forecast to pick up in the near term. “We expect UK fourth quarter growth to be very weak as Brexit paralysis truly takes hold,” he said. “Assuming the government can successfully negotiate the withdrawal agreement with Brussels and ratify it in Parliament, then we could see a rebound in growth early next year. “However, a failure to complete a deal which would mean a no-deal or cliff-edge Brexit, is likely to cause a further slowdown in activity, which could be enough to tip the UK into recession.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Construction grew 1.7 per cent\u0026nbspafter deep falls in output during the snowstorms early this year.But services, which make up the bulk of the UK economy, contracted 0.1 per cent during\u0026nbspthe month.In the third quarter, business investment fell 1.2 per cent, the worst three-month performance since early 2016.It was also the third quarter of contraction in a row – marking the worst run since the last recession.Surveys suggest Brexit-related uncertainty is causing firms to freeze spending.\u0026nbspWorst run in a decadeThe Bank of England expects growth in the final quarter to decelerate\u0026nbspto 0.3 per cent.However, there was slightly better news from the ONS on UK trade, with the statistics agency reporting\u0026nbspthe trade deficit fell to £2.9bn in the three months to September, down from £6.1bn.Export values were up 3.8 per cent in the period, outstripping import growth of 1.7 per cent.Net trade is therefore estimated to have provided a 0.8 percentage point boost to overall GDP growth in Q3, after dragging\u0026nbspin the second quarter.Chancellor\u0026nbspPhilip Hammond\u0026nbspsought to accentuate the positive elements in the data, arguing the quarterly growth rate was evidence of the “underlying strength in our economy”. Speaking on a visit to Fuller’s Brewery in London, Mr Hammond said: “We are building an economy that works for everyone, with 3.3 million more people in work, lower unemployment in every part of the country, and wages rising at their fastest pace in almost a decade. Now our focus is on locking in this progress and ensuring people’s wages can continue to rise.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

University has found.\u0026nbspAlmost half of first-year students surveyed in the North East, South West and East Midlands said they began searching for accommodation for next year in October and November of their first term.Nearly four in ten said they felt “very” or “extremely” pressured to start looking for homes when they did and to secure somewhere quickly, according to the survey of more than 3,200 freshers. \u0026nbspA fear that there will not be enough properties for all the university undergraduates is partly fuelling the panic, students say, and some are rushing to secure affordable student houses near to campus.Many universities have increased the number of students they admit in recent years since the cap on student numbers was removed - and some argue this has increased the competition for housing.\u0026nbspEmily Marcovecchio, who has just started her second year at Falmouth University in Cornwall, said: “The university keeps bringing in more people but they don’t have enough housing.”\u0026nbspMany of her peers struggled to secure houses in the student town. “Before you had a foot in the door, it was gone. It was a battle. Some people could not find anything until March,” she said.\u0026nbspAnother first-year student, from the South West, said: “It very much felt like a race. You have no negotiations with price as there are more students than properties.”\u0026nbspGrace, a student at the University of the West of England (UWE) in Bristol, started looking for a house just over a month after she started university as she wanted something affordable.\u0026nbspShe said: “It was stressful having to speak to people that you really do not know about budgets.\u0026nbsp“I am from a low-income family and we had very different ideas about what we wanted to spend. It was hard trying to negotiate that.”Grace said they were made to pay a holding deposit straight away and they were only given a week to sign the contract. “It was all very rushed and it was quite scary committing.”Over recent years, a number of student unions have run campaigns to encourage first-year students not to rush into signing contracts to ensure they have enough time to make the right decisions. \u0026nbspEva Crossan Jory, the National Union of Students (NUS) vice-president for welfare, said: “There is a culture now in a lot of universities – outside London – where students sign before Christmas.“This is quite a big issue on a lot of campuses. Students think they won’t have a house for next year.”Students in Durham, Bournemouth, Birmingham and Bath experience this rush, she said.Created with Sketch.Student news in pictures Show all 34Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.South Korean policemen detain student protestors during a protest against South Korean President Park Geun-Hye outside the National Assembly in Seoul, South Korea.Filipino demonstrators face off with anti-riot police during a protest near the US Embassy in Manila, PhilippineHundreds of protesters including Indigenous People, students and militant groups marched towards the US Embassy to protest against the presence of US military troops and condemning the violent dispersal which left at least forty people hurt including twenty police officers and three people who were run over by a police vanA federal judge in Mexico has ordered that a once-fugitive police chief be held on charges of kidnapping in the disappearance of 43 studentsA man holds up a photograph of a missing student with a caption reading \u0027We are missing 43,\u0027 during a meeting marking the 25-month anniversary of the disappearances of 43 students in the southern state of Guerrero, in Mexico City.

What’s left? A show that makes breathlessly little sense and is rarely even fun. The people who brought you Walking with Dinosaurs have now brought you Lumbering with Primates. This is less a musical than an amusement park ride perpetually needing repairs, a feat of projection design (Peter England) with occasional dance breaks. (Alexis Soloski)A car wreck of clichés like that simply can’t put a feminist story across meaningfully. Or any story, really — and that’s a bigger problem than the bad score and sluggish 20-foot marionette. I find it hard to believe that the book is by Jack Thorne, who won a Tony Award last season for writing Harry Potter and the Cursed Child. (Jesse Green)I won’t give away details of the beast’s mighty, fatal fall, except to say that it works until it doesn’t. McOnie and Thorne make the mistake of taking the story a beat too far, ending the musical on a note of Ann’s self-empowerment. That’s nice and all, but there’s a big, dead gorilla somewhere out there who isn’t feeling so empowered. King Kong once again turns Disney Princess, when what’s wanted is a Scream Queen. (Greg Evans)The gender politics are an incoherent mix of the old and the new. Ann (Christiani Pitts) is transformed from a passive victim into an ambitious starlet who still has a heart of gold even though she’s willing to compromise her conscience at every turn for the chance of becoming “Queen of New York”. This is the title of one of the show’s highly derivative musical numbers that could be imported directly into the next Forbidden Broadway\u0026nbspspoof.Even when the songs by Eddie Perfect jibe with the story, they rarely make emotional sense. King Kong\u0026nbspdoesn’t simply come up short as a stage translation of a landmark horror film. It actually manages to fit around this failure one of the most ludicrous Broadway musicals in recent memory. (Charles McNulty)King Kong, the creature, is a truly marvellous feat –\u0026nbspof design, of engineering, of choreography, of performers and operators and stage managers functioning at bomb-diffusion levels of precision –\u0026nbspand King Kong, the show is, beyond its spectacle, generic. It’s an amped-up blockbuster with largely forgettable songs, many of them of the belt-and-inspire variety. It’s thunderous and technologically impressive, carefully calibrated to contemporary sensibilities (ie, it’s hooked up to an IV of girl power), and as slick and shiny as an oil spill. As with, say, Space Mountain, the idea is just to go along for the ride. (Sarah Holdren)The truly frustrating thing about King Kong is the waste of it all. Why did this story, whose central figure necessarily cannot sing, need to be a musical at all, much less one that suggests a late-run Simpsons parody? Have the success of War Horse and Thorne’s own Harry Potter and the Cursed Child –\u0026nbspand the bellyflops of Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark and Cirque du Soleil’s Paramour –\u0026nbsptaught us nothing? King Kong looks down on its huckster villain, film director Carl (Eric William Morris, overplaying an unplayable role), for taking an awesome creature and surrounding it with mediocrity for a gawking New York audience – but that’s exactly what this production does itself. In the sad eyes of the second act’s chained and stooped Kong, you see flickers of a show that might have been. (Adam Feldman)In a moment before the end of Act 1, Carl\u0026nbsprealizes\u0026nbsppeople won’t believe Kong exists unless they see him with their own eyes. “He’s not a film,” he declares. “I thought about it all wrong — he’s theatre.” It’s a meta moment, because he’s right: The Kong puppet is an impressive feat you’ll need to see for yourself. The rest of the show, though,\u0026nbspdoesn’t command that sort of attention.\u0026nbsp(Jessica\u0026nbspDerschowitz)Created with Sketch. Show all 17Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The first film in which Joel and Ethan Coen shared both producing and directing credits previously Joel had always been credited as director and Ethan as producer. A largely pointless remake of the classic Ealing comedy, this has some funny moments and Tom Hanks gives a committed performance in the Alec Guinness role – but one can’t help but wonder why they bothered.The film that preceded \u0027The Ladykillers\u0027, this was the siblings’ first job as writers-for-hire. Tapping into a similar vein of screwball comedy to Preston Sturges\u0027s work in the Forties, it has a formidable cast: George Clooney, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Geoffrey Rush are excellent. Yet this is a rare Coen comedy that does not stand up to a repeat viewing.Audiences felt misled by \u0027Hail, Caesar!\u0027 due to its panoply of Hollywood stars and laugh-heavy trailer. The result was a huge discrepancy in enjoyment between the critics and the punters. A love letter to the golden age of Hollywood, this is one of their lighter efforts, but some of the recreations of film styles of yore are dazzling.This one finds the lads in a playful mood: a spy caper populated with idiotic characters portrayed by the likes of George Clooney, Brad Pitt and John Malkovich (the latter’s pronunciation of “memoir” is a highlight). The plot is less important than the dialogue, characterisation and jokes. Pitt shows a real aptitude for comedy as a dim-witted fitness instructor.Some see \u0027True Grit\u0027 as a poor man’s \u0027No Country for Old Men\u0027, but this is a more faithful adaptation of the Charles Portis novel than the John Wayne version. The Coens, so often accused of cynicism, have rarely produced anything more heartfelt. Hailee Steinfeld, in her breakthrough role, is staggeringly good as a teenager attempting to avenge the murder of her father.There are those who consider this gangster flick — released in the same year as Scorsese’s \u0027Goodfellas\u0027 — to be the Coens\u0027 peak achievement. Slow and contemplative, the film contains two of the greatest moments in the entire Coen filmography: John Turturro in the woods and Albert Finney under the bed. Scorsese would later direct the pilot episode of \u0027Boardwalk Empire\u0027, a television show with more than a hint of \u0027Miller’s Crossing\u0027. The opening 11 minutes of the Coens’ sophomore effort — before the title even appears — is one of the most beautiful, hilarious and perfectly executed sequences in modern cinema. Nicolas Cage didn’t enjoy the experience of making \u0027Raising Arizona\u0027 since the filmmakers allow their actors very little leeway in terms of improvisation. Holly Hunter has rarely been better and this contains some of the funniest Coen scenes.The Coens attempt at a family film (“you know, for kids”) that was expected to make waves at the box office but proved a flop, perhaps partly as a result of its idiosyncratic title. This is a comedy with shades of Sturges and Frank Capra. The flashback involving the tailor might be the most perfect gag in the entire Coen canon.John Turturro stars as Barton Fink, a playwright attempting to write a screenplay in a deserted hotel while wrestling with his demons andor John Goodman. Sharp, with a good dose of pathos, it deservedly won the Palme d\u0027Or in 1991. That the Coens decided to make a film about writer’s block while they themselves were struggling to complete \u0027Miller’s Crossing\u0027 means there\u0027s a personal element to it, too (“I’ll show you the life of the mind, says Goodman\u0027s Charlie Meadows).A favourite with fans, this begins in a 19th-century Eastern European shelter and ends with the disclaimer that “No Jews were harmed in the making of this motion picture”. In between, we are treated to the Coens’ most personal film, pitched somewhere between the \u0027Book of Job\u0027 and Saul Bellow’s \u0027Herzog\u0027. Michael Stuhlbarg is mesmerising as a Minnesotan physics professor who sees his life fall apart in 1967.The title may be a reference to Sullivan’s Travels, and the plot inspired by Homer\u0027s \u0027The Odyssey\u0027, but this is an astonishingly original musical that stands as the most joyous film in the siblings’ filmography. The soundtrack won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year and this sepia-tinted tale of convicts on the run during the Great Depression never fails to lift the spirits.The maverick filmmakers burst onto the scene with one of the most accomplished debuts in the history of the medium. Shot in just eight weeks, this is a startlingly violent neo-noir with moments of pure horror and that streak of bleak fatalism that would become a recurring theme.Quite possibly the film of the decade, \u0027Inside Llewyn Davis\u0027 stars Oscar Isaac as a folk singer struggling to make ends meet in and around the Greenwich Village scene of 1961. For anyone who’s ever embarked on a creative pursuit and was worried that talent alone might not be enough, this is more terrifying than any horror.The Coens most underrated film, \u0027The Man Who Wasn’t There\u0027 was inspired by a poster showing various haircuts from the 1940s that the brothers came across while shooting \u0027The Hudsucker Proxy\u0027. Billy Bob Thornton has never been better than he is playing Ed Crane, a quiet barber who suspects his wife of having an affair and becomes embroiled in the kind of classic noir perfected by Billy Wilder.1517 3. No Country for Old Men (2007)A crime classic cut from the same cloth as \u0027Fargo\u0027 and \u0027Blood Simple\u0027, this adaptation of Cormac McCarthy’s novel won Best Picture, Best Director, Best Supporting Actor and Best Adapted Screenplay at the Oscars. It is the Coens’ most taut film and their most critically acclaimed this century. Javier Bardem as Anton Chigurh is a cinematic villain for the ages.Deftly blending comedy and horror, this timeless crime caper propelled the Coens into the mainstream and spawned a widly successful television series. The screenplay won an Oscar so, too, did Frances McDormand (wife of Joel) for her terrific performance as the pregnant police chief investigating a double homicide in Minnesota, birthplace of the filmmakers.Creedence. White Russians. Bowling. We end where we began, and while some will argue that the Coen brothers have made deeper, wiser and worthier films – that’s just, like, their opinion, man. This is their funniest work and, after a lacklustre reception, its reputation has grown to the point where it is now the quintessential cult movie. More importantly, for large swathes of us, it is absolutely guaranteed to ensure a good mood. The film, like its hero and the brothers behind it, abides.The first film in which Joel and Ethan Coen shared both producing and directing credits previously Joel had always been credited as director and Ethan as producer. A largely pointless remake of the classic Ealing comedy, this has some funny moments and Tom Hanks gives a committed performance in the Alec Guinness role – but one can’t help but wonder why they bothered.The film that preceded \u0027The Ladykillers\u0027, this was the siblings’ first job as writers-for-hire. Tapping into a similar vein of screwball comedy to Preston Sturges\u0027s work in the Forties, it has a formidable cast: George Clooney, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Geoffrey Rush are excellent. Yet this is a rare Coen comedy that does not stand up to a repeat viewing.Audiences felt misled by \u0027Hail, Caesar!\u0027 due to its panoply of Hollywood stars and laugh-heavy trailer. The result was a huge discrepancy in enjoyment between the critics and the punters. A love letter to the golden age of Hollywood, this is one of their lighter efforts, but some of the recreations of film styles of yore are dazzling.This one finds the lads in a playful mood: a spy caper populated with idiotic characters portrayed by the likes of George Clooney, Brad Pitt and John Malkovich (the latter’s pronunciation of “memoir” is a highlight). The plot is less important than the dialogue, characterisation and jokes. Pitt shows a real aptitude for comedy as a dim-witted fitness instructor.Some see \u0027True Grit\u0027 as a poor man’s \u0027No Country for Old Men\u0027, but this is a more faithful adaptation of the Charles Portis novel than the John Wayne version. The Coens, so often accused of cynicism, have rarely produced anything more heartfelt. Hailee Steinfeld, in her breakthrough role, is staggeringly good as a teenager attempting to avenge the murder of her father.There are those who consider this gangster flick — released in the same year as Scorsese’s \u0027Goodfellas\u0027 — to be the Coens\u0027 peak achievement. Slow and contemplative, the film contains two of the greatest moments in the entire Coen filmography: John Turturro in the woods and Albert Finney under the bed. Scorsese would later direct the pilot episode of \u0027Boardwalk Empire\u0027, a television show with more than a hint of \u0027Miller’s Crossing\u0027. The opening 11 minutes of the Coens’ sophomore effort — before the title even appears — is one of the most beautiful, hilarious and perfectly executed sequences in modern cinema. Nicolas Cage didn’t enjoy the experience of making \u0027Raising Arizona\u0027 since the filmmakers allow their actors very little leeway in terms of improvisation. Holly Hunter has rarely been better and this contains some of the funniest Coen scenes.The Coens attempt at a family film (“you know, for kids”) that was expected to make waves at the box office but proved a flop, perhaps partly as a result of its idiosyncratic title. This is a comedy with shades of Sturges and Frank Capra. The flashback involving the tailor might be the most perfect gag in the entire Coen canon.John Turturro stars as Barton Fink, a playwright attempting to write a screenplay in a deserted hotel while wrestling with his demons andor John Goodman. Sharp, with a good dose of pathos, it deservedly won the Palme d\u0027Or in 1991. That the Coens decided to make a film about writer’s block while they themselves were struggling to complete \u0027Miller’s Crossing\u0027 means there\u0027s a personal element to it, too (“I’ll show you the life of the mind, says Goodman\u0027s Charlie Meadows).A favourite with fans, this begins in a 19th-century Eastern European shelter and ends with the disclaimer that “No Jews were harmed in the making of this motion picture”. In between, we are treated to the Coens’ most personal film, pitched somewhere between the \u0027Book of Job\u0027 and Saul Bellow’s \u0027Herzog\u0027. Michael Stuhlbarg is mesmerising as a Minnesotan physics professor who sees his life fall apart in 1967.The title may be a reference to Sullivan’s Travels, and the plot inspired by Homer\u0027s \u0027The Odyssey\u0027, but this is an astonishingly original musical that stands as the most joyous film in the siblings’ filmography. The soundtrack won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year and this sepia-tinted tale of convicts on the run during the Great Depression never fails to lift the spirits.The maverick filmmakers burst onto the scene with one of the most accomplished debuts in the history of the medium. Shot in just eight weeks, this is a startlingly violent neo-noir with moments of pure horror and that streak of bleak fatalism that would become a recurring theme.Quite possibly the film of the decade, \u0027Inside Llewyn Davis\u0027 stars Oscar Isaac as a folk singer struggling to make ends meet in and around the Greenwich Village scene of 1961. For anyone who’s ever embarked on a creative pursuit and was worried that talent alone might not be enough, this is more terrifying than any horror.The Coens most underrated film, \u0027The Man Who Wasn’t There\u0027 was inspired by a poster showing various haircuts from the 1940s that the brothers came across while shooting \u0027The Hudsucker Proxy\u0027.

The film, like its hero and the brothers behind it, abides.After an earlier production in Australia and with the addition of a largely new creative team, the producers (led by Global Creatures) of this $35m\u0026nbspBroadway epic, based on the classic 1933 film, have re-envisioned the story in striking theatrical terms, using dazzling projections, super-sized puppetry and lush underscoring to create one thrill ride of a show. Topping the list of visual wows is the magnificent, moving and oh-so-expressive title character who, alas, is not eligible for a Tony.\u0026nbsp(Frank\u0026nbspRizzoThis is a rare time I can honestly say that while King Kong the musical is a wretched mess, I would recommend King Kong the stage spectacle. He\u0027s not a film, exclaims Carl Denham in a moment of revelation from the megalomaniacal movie director, a vanilla villain in Eric William Morris\u0027 insipid performance. I thought about it all wrong. He\u0027s theatre! That might not be 100 per cent accurate, but either way, the ape is simply amazing.

But for cash-strapped countries like Pakistan, there are few alternatives, as\u0026nbspKim Sengupta\u0026nbspexplainsClick to followThe IndependentThe Chinese state holds a 99-year lease on the Sri Lankan port of HambantotaAn international conference took place last week in Gwadar, a dusty Pakistani town perched on the edge of the Indian Ocean –\u0026nbspan unlikely place, one would have thought, for Imran Khan’s government to invite dignitaries from 26 countries. But the real aim was to display a vision of the future – a mighty port city and commercial centre for the region which would put Dubai and Bahrain in the shade.Not everything went according to plan. While the delegates were being shown around the site of this projected\u0026nbspmega city, gunmen on motorcycles shot dead three workers and injured five others constructing homes in the suburbs for future residents. It was the fourth fatal shooting in the area in recent months\u0026nbspmore than three dozen builders had died in a series of attacks, with the Baloch Liberation Front, a group seeking an independent Balochistan,\u0026nbspbeing\u0026nbspheld responsible.The development of Gwadar is a matter of vital importance for a Pakistani government trying to rescue an economy which is\u0026nbspin dire straits. It has\u0026nbsprepeatedly claimed that violence in the area has been brought under control. On a trip to the town two weeks ago, however, my colleagues and I were only allowed to move around under army escort.Huge protests in Pakistan after Christian woman on death row releasedBut separatist strife is not the only issue with\u0026nbspGwadar. The port\u0026nbspis a prominent part of the $60bn\u0026nbsp(£46bn) China-Pakistan Economic Corridor\u0026nbsp(CPRC), which in turn is part of Beijing’s global Belt and Road Initiative,\u0026nbspa massive and\u0026nbspcontroversial mission which has become a huge geopolitical talking point.To the Chinese government and its supporters, the Belt and Road\u0026nbspproject – set to be established in Asia, Africa and parts of Europe,\u0026nbspwith offshoots in Latin America –\u0026nbspis a purely strategic infrastructure programme which will spread trade and the benefit it brings across many lands.To its\u0026nbspgrowing number of detractors, the real aim is to spread Chinese\u0026nbsphegemony using commerce in tandem with the naval bases\u0026nbsp– the\u0026nbsp“String of Pearls”\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspBeijing is building on the Pacific and Indian Oceans. The covert motive, it is claimed, is to spread “debt-trap diplomacy”\u0026nbspby providing finance and then extracting advantage when debtor countries have difficulties paying back. The most notorious example of this so far is Sri Lanka ceding a port, Hambantota, in return for the waiver of $1bn on loans.This is a good time to ask the Saudis for favours, they wouldn’t want to turn anyone away with the bad publicity they are gettingChina is Islamabad’s long-term, staunch backer and is\u0026nbspincreasingly important – especially as a previous ally, the US, is now courting India, the country with which Pakistan has been locked in rivalry since both states became free from British colonial rule more than seven\u0026nbspdecades ago.There is also the crucial economic factor:\u0026nbspPakistan is greatly in need of money from its friends. Two weeks ago, the country’s new prime minister, Imran Khan told The Independent\u0026nbspin an interview about the stark reality of the financial situation. While many international political and business leaders had pulled out of an economic forum in Riyadh following the murder of\u0026nbspjournalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, he had to go because, he admitted,\u0026nbsp“We are desperate for money ... The reason I have to take this opportunity is because we are a country of 210 million people and we have the worst debt crisis in our history.” Without funding from abroad, he pointed out, “we actually won’t have in another three months enough foreign exchange to service our debts or pay for our imports.”Imran Khan (second right)\u0026nbspattends\u0026nbspthe opening ceremony of the Future Investment Initiative\u0026nbspin Riyadh last month (AFPGetty)Khan wanted to attract investors at the forum to Pakistan. But the main aim was to secure Saudi largesse. Failure to get funds from the kingdom as well as from China would mean turning to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for Pakistan’s 13th bailout – accompanied by\u0026nbspinevitably\u0026nbspharsh strictures on public spending, with the population already suffering from an austerity package.Khan secured a very welcome $6bn\u0026nbspfrom the Saudis after meeting the crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, the man who has been accused of being complicit in Jamal Khashoggi’s death (though he denies any knowledge). “It sounds callous, I know,”\u0026nbspsaid a senior official in Islamabad, “but this is a good time to ask the Saudis for favours, they wouldn’t want to turn anyone away with all the bad publicity they are getting.”As well as the loan pledge, Pakistan got an agreement for Saudi Arabia to invest in a new oil refinery in Gwadar. A Saudi delegation visited the port and, according to petroleum minister Ghulam Sarwar Khan,\u0026nbsp“showed an interest to immediately invest in the refinery”. The agreement will be signed by the kingdom’s oil giant Aramco and the Pakistan State Oil company, but, he said, “we sat down and held discussions and it was principally decided by both sides that it will be a government to government agreement.”Gwadar can become a strategic port on the edge of the Indian Ocean (Amanda Coakley)This week Khan was on a trip to China during which he sought further funds to add to the $6bn Beijing has loaned Pakistan since last year to prop up its foreign exchange reserves. There were recriminations after Pakistan’s national television channel used a caption saying “begging” instead of “Beijing”. It was due to an unfortunate typographical error, the broadcaster said in its apology.Beijing is expected to acquiesce, but it has also repeated its call on Islamabad to carry out the type of structural reforms the IMF\u0026nbsphad also demanded in response to Pakistan’s latest appeal for help.There has also been annoyance in Beijing at criticism of the Belt and Road\u0026nbspfrom Pakistani officials, including Khan himself when he was in opposition, as well as two officials in his government. Abdul Razzak Dawood, an adviser to the prime minister on commerce, had held that some of the deals made were unfair to Pakistani companies. The railways minister, Sheikh Rashid, has wanted to cut the size of the Karachi-Peshawar rail line, saving $2bn from the $8bn budget.There are also claims, in Pakistan and abroad, that the Belt and Road\u0026nbspis one of the main contributors to Pakistan’s economic problems. Beijing has insisted that Pakistan buy Chinese equipment for projects, which has denuded foreign exchange reserves. Beijing has then extended loans to cover the purchases, which, in turn, has sent debt soaring further.AFPGetty)The IMF has insisted that any loan it gives to Pakistan is not used to pay off the China debt. The organisation’s managing director, Christine Lagarde,\u0026nbsphas stressed\u0026nbspthat there must be “absolute transparency” over this. The US, too, has demanded similar stipulations. Washington has long been hostile towards the Chinese project, charging that Beijing is using it to hold nations in thrall.Relations between the US and Islamabad are at a particularly low ebb\u0026nbspat present, in any case. Successive American presidents have threatened to cut aid to the Pakistani military unless action was taken against the Taliban and other violent Islamist groups which\u0026nbspthe west (and the Afghan government) claim are fed and watered in Pakistan and sent to carry out murderous attacks in Afghanistan. Pakistan has always denied the allegation.Donald Trump’s first tweet this year said that the US “has foolishly given Pakistan more than $33bn\u0026nbspin aid over the last 15 years, and they have given us nothing but lies \u0026amp deceit, thinking of our leaders as fools”. The US administration announced in September that it was cutting $300m in aid to Pakistan’s military.The Chinese are concerned by armed insurgency across the border in Balochistan where they have been in confidential negotiations with rebel groups for some time. However, with the Gwadar plan, it is the possibility of being drawn into a wider confrontation, if Saudi Arabian investment\u0026nbspin the port is confirmed,\u0026nbspwhich is a cause of unease.Created with Sketch.

The scope for sectarian trouble\u0026nbspspreading to Balochistan was illustrated last month when 14 Iranian border guards were abducted by an extremist Sunni group Jaish al-Adli. Pakistani security forces say they have failed to find the kidnapped men, leading to warnings of action being taken by the Iranians.The Pakistani government has stressed that the Saudi money did not come with political strings attached and, in his interview\u0026nbspbefore he went to Riyadh, Imran Khan spoke of his regret at Mr Trump tearing up the nuclear deal with Iran and pursuing punitive measures against the country.Gwadar is a prominent part of a $60bn\u0026nbspinfrastructure project between China and Pakistan (Amanda Coakley)The prime minister said that Pakistan\u0026nbspwould like to be an intermediary between Saudi Arabia and Iran. Yet the Saudi-led Sunni block were unhappy when the Pakistani parliament, under the previous government, refused to take part in the current war in Yemen. Islamabad was privately warned that it would have to choose sides sooner rather than later. There have long been reports that Saudi Arabia has “bought” a nuclear bomb from Pakistan to act as a counter against a “Shia bomb” produced by Iran – and the Islamic Military Counter Terrorism Coalition, set up by Riyadh and led by a Pakistani commander, General Raheel Sharif,\u0026nbspprimarily exists to counter Shia forces.According to Theodore Karasik, at Gulf State Analytics, a Washington consultancy firm, “Saudi moves and investments in Pakistan are a set and established policy that seeks to better integrate Islamabad into Riyadh’s camp.”Robert Emerson, a British security consultant, says:\u0026nbsp“China have invested heavily in Pakistan, but it is also engaging in a substantial way commercially with Iran. It is understandable that they do not want to see a Saudi presence imported into Gwadar, just over a 100km\u0026nbspfrom the Iranian border.“But China also now has problems with Belt and Road. There has been consistent opposition from the US, Japan, India and others and now we see some of those countries which were going to take part in it are having second thoughts.”China urged to close mass detention camps for Uighur MuslimsPakistan to plant 10 billion trees to combat decades of deforestationPakistan invites Saudi Arabia to join China’s Belt and Road corridorA number of states, including Malaysia, Nepal and Myanmar have pulled out of Chinese-financed programmes. Recent elections in the Males saw the defeat of the Beijing-backed President Abdulla Yameen under whose rule the nation has accrued $1.3bn debt to China, more than a quarter of its GDP. The opposition – whose candidate, Mohamed Solih, won at the polls\u0026nbsp– had warned of being sucked into a “serious debt trap”.In Colombia there has been widespread local opposition for eight years to the building of the $4bn Ituango dam, part funded by the Chinese, in an area with propensity for landslides. This year 26,000 people had to be evacuated after heavy rainfall led to a landslide environmentalists have been warning about.Saudi moves and investments in Pakistan are a set and established policy that seeks to better integrate Islamabad into Riyadh’s campIt has now been almost a decade since China overtook the US as Africa’s biggest trading partner. Nine countries have signed Belt and Road\u0026nbspagreements with Beijing and 20 others are engaged in talks to do so. The Chinese government pledged $60bn in preferential loans and investments at an economic forum for Africa three years ago.African countries, so far, have been readily receptive to the Chinese loans which have been pouring in. But concerns have been raised too,\u0026nbspwith the Centre for Global Development finding, for instance, that Djibouti, where the Chinese now have a military base, has seen its foreign debt swell from 50 per cent to 85 per cent of GDP with the largest amount by far owed to China. The Chinese company CMPort, the same one which built Hambantota in Sri Lanka, now under Chinese control, is building a port in the country at Doraleh.China also has aspirations for Europe to be the final destination for the land route of the Belt and Road, with the aim that every day trains from Chinese trading cities would arrive at distribution points in Duisburg, Madrid and London.But six months ago 27 out of 28 European Union ambassadors in Beijing\u0026nbspsigned off a report saying the project “runs counter to the European Union’s agenda for liberalising trade and pushes the balance of power in favour of subsidised Chinese companies”.In September, Brussels launched its response to the Belt and Road: the building of infrastructure across Europe and Asia with Federica Mogherini, the head of European Union foreign policy, describing it as the “European way” of connecting the two continents.But the European Union may not remain unified in its approach. The Hungarian ambassador did not sign the report in Beijing and now Britain appears to be keen for China deals. In December last year Philip Hammond, on a visit to Beijing, said, “I was privileged earlier this year to represent the UK\u0026nbspat the first Belt and Road forum and one of the things we will discuss is the opportunity for closer collaboration in delivering the ambitions of the Belt and Road programme.”Like Imran Khan’s Pakistan, Theresa May’s post-Brexit Britain cannot ignore Beijing at a time of economic hardship, however the true cost of this Chinese connection will\u0026nbspunfold in the future.belt and roadShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

He spent his youth surfing on the margins of society, before floundering\u0026nbspon\u0026nbspthe seas\u0026nbspof a troubled marriage. Since then, he has taken up the only\u0026nbspsensible function now left open to him – to offer opinions on everything under the sun. By Andy MartinClick to followThe IndependentThe prince’s purpose flows from his inability to quite fit into time and spaceIt wasn’t quite a\u0026nbsproyal wave. More like a royal glance. To be honest,\u0026nbspI might have waved, or possibly saluted, or at least stood to attention. Not long ago, the Queen drove right past me in her Regal Roller on Lisson Grove. Lots of police outriders and suchlike. A chauffeur of course. But I saw her and she saw me. Then she took a right on Rossmore Road and she was gone. But she had bestowed upon me the royal gaze for a fleeting instant. So I know she’s real and, more importantly, so am I. There was a mutual confirmation of existence. Which was strangely reassuring.But where does Prince Charles fit into this great unreality show? The answer is that he doesn’t. Not really. He is, and always will be, the odd man out. And that may well be his saving grace. It is a little-known fact that the young Prince of Wales was once a surfer and a windsurfer.\u0026nbspA fugitive from landlocked society. But even right out on the margins he was always marginal. More of a wannabe.He definitely got wet a few times\u0026nbspand was to be seen, all too briefly, walking on water.\u0026nbspI know that for a while, back in the late 1970s, he was even president or patron of the British Surfing Association and held a reception for the British surfing team before they left to compete in South Africa. He made some remark about a lot of the surfers having abundant moustaches and were they for the purpose of keeping you warm in the water? Not exactly Oscar Wilde, but good try, your royal highness.We know that the heir apparent was no fan of the cold showers at Gordonstoun. Maybe he even started surfing in Scotland. But\u0026nbspit was at Cambridge that he attained the zenith of his theatrical career with brief appearances on stage as an eccentric prince of some kind. He was either in a dustbin or was wearing dustman’s kit. He always said his inspiration was the Goons (Spike Milligan, Peter Sellers, and Harry Secombe), and knew “The Ying Tong\u0026nbspSong” off by heart, but even the most benevolent reviewers of the period would have to conclude that he was a Goon manqué.It was while at university that the idea got about that he had several butlers constantly in attendance, one for the royal toothbrush, another for buttoning the royal waistcoat and what not. This still seems\u0026nbspunlikely, given the limited accommodation, even at Trinity College. I saw him wandering the streets with his security guy way back when. No sign of Jeeves plural then anyhow. The flunkeys story probably got mythified out of all proportion. Clearly he has them. Actual stats hard or futile to ascertain.1948 Charles is born.

Kim Jong-un takes over in North Korea2012 Evidence for the Higgs\u0026nbspboson is discovered2017 Inauguration of Donald Trump2018 The prince’s 70th birthdayMaybe he should have become a serious historian. He would almost have fitted in amid the aggressively non-conformist refuseniks of the Senior Common Room. But didn’t he get a lower second? I guess that ruled him out. Shame really.He had his military period, like his old dad, but he never really took to life on the ocean wave, any more than to surfing. His career as Top Gun ended when he crashed a plane and had to be grounded for his own safety. But he still looked good in a uniform. So he thought he’d give marriage a shot. It was always going to be on the agenda at some stage. Future king has to think of passing on the baton at some point, always assuming someone has passed the baton on to him of course.Diana: she looked the perfect fairytale bride. A match made for global television. The prince and the princess. Sometimes one regrets that life does not resemble a fairytale in almost any particular. Unless, that is, the phrase “living happily ever after” can be taken to include mutual indifference, rancour, animosity, affairs galore, escapades of all sorts, falsehoods and confessions. James Dean argued that it was necessary to live fast, die young and be a good-looking corpse. It’s more glamorous, more Hollywood. So it could be that Charles missed his shot there too.Perhaps he was just not that cut out for marriage after all. Not everyone is. Perhaps no one. Why should he be more than another? He had a go at lover. Tried his hand at the difficult genre of the erotic utterance. Maybe he should have revised his Liaisons dangereuses beforehand.Having spent a certain amount of time floundering in his sea of troubles, far from the shores of public affection, Charles paddled back in with a degree of enlightenment and therefore took up the only sensible function now left open to him, a job with no known required qualifications, that of philosopher royal. His task was to offer opinions on everything under the sun.He succeeded in demolishing – theoretically – most modern architecture, anything after about 1900, but especially tall buildings, of which there are quite a few these days. He had a good point of course. He often does. Glass carbuncles were never going to be that popular.In the letters that have come to be known as the “black spider memos” he offered his advice to any number of ministers about matters ranging from homeopathy to foreign affairs. Which, technically, he is entitled to do. The sad thing is that, so far as can be determined, no one took any notice of him. Or perhaps did the exact opposite.Inspired by his old mentor, Laurence van der Post, he became a farmer-ecologist-conservationist. To be honest,\u0026nbsp his produce in Waitrose\u0026nbspis very\u0026nbspgood. The organic pears taste\u0026nbsplike pears of yore. Crunchy yet juicy. The “Duchy” business model is probably about as relevant as Disneyland to the state of agriculture as a whole, because the finances are all out of whack. After all, to some extent we\u0027re\u0026nbsppaying for the pears twice (and they weren’t cheap anyway)\u0026nbspbecause we are\u0026nbspsupporting the royal family through\u0026nbsptaxes. In that sense, Prince Charles has given the idea of living off the land a whole new meaning.Created with Sketch.Royal wedding ceremonies: through the years in pictures Show all 40Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.140 Royal Wedding - Harry and Meghan, 2018Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex and his wife Meghan, Duchess of Sussex emerge from the West Door of St George\u0027s Chapel, Windsor Castle after their wedding ceremony240 Royal Wedding - Edward and Alexandra, 1863Edward, Prince of Wales (later King Edward  VII), and his bride, Princess Alexandra of Denmark, after their wedding340 Royal Wedding - Princess Patricia and Commander Alexander Ramsay, 1919Princess Patricia of Connaught, driving from Westminster Abbey, with her husband Commander Alexander Ramsay, after their wedding ceremony440 Royal Wedding - Elizabeth and Albert,1923Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon (later to be Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother) and Prince Albert, Duke of York (later to be King George VI) on the balcony of Buckingham Palace after their wedding ceremony at Westminster Abbey540 Royal Wedding - Prince Henry and Lady Alice, 1935The Duke and Duchess of Gloucester on their wedding day.

Which would depend on the next generation moving out of the way. It’s not a good position to be in. It makes you think too much of those Snoopy cartoons where he is being a vulture in a tree, poised to swoop. It works in the cartoon though.Even if Charles is hemmed in by senior members of his family on one side and the upcoming juniors threatening to overtake him, I still have doubts as to whether Charles is that impatient to be king. Charles, as a historian, has read his Walter Bagehot, the great theorist of the British constitution (which does not in fact exist).Judi Dench, Tim Minchin, Harriet Walter, David Tennant and Paapa Essiedu\u0026nbspas part of a special production of Shakespeare Live! from the RSC in\u0026nbsp2016 (Getty)He knows that the role of the monarch is to be the “decorative” or “dignified” part of the constitution. I still can’t see that happening. According to Bagehot, the monarch enjoys three rights, “the right to be consulted, the right to encourage, the right to warn.” Charles will still stick his oar in, in other words, but the reality is that he will be more constrained as king than as prince. The Prince of Wales – and there is no shortage of precedent here – can get away with just about anything and he’s still prince. The prince is virtually obliged to misbehave. The king, on the other hand, is required to be kingly. He doesn’t get to write so many letters, erotic or otherwise. He would effectively have even less power than he has now.Is Charles up to the job? The job-that-is-not-a-job. Charles wants to be king but knows that he never quite can be, even if he is. What\u0026nbsphas proved to be endearing about Charles and strikes a universal note is that he is still looking for the thing he is really good at. He has had a go at just about everything and has succeeded brilliantly in the realm of failure. The philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre described a man as being someone who is not what he is and is what he is not. I’m still not sure what that means exactly but Prince Charles seems to exemplify this uncertain and paradoxical status to a high degree.\u0026nbspPrince Charles feels \u0027regret\u0027 at being \u0027deceived\u0027 by paedophile bishopBahraini royal sued for £35m in UK over deal to meet Bollywood starsJapan’s Princess Ayako gives up royal title as she marries ‘commoner’ He once – briefly – had a go at Hamlet, on stage, with the Royal Shakespeare Company. He\u0026nbsputtered probably the single most famous line in all tragedy:\u0026nbsp“To be or not to be, that is the question” – putting a crazy over-emphasis on the final word. And Charles himself is more of a question than an answer, an enigma inside an anomaly. King of infinite space or quintessence of dust?He is not too sure. Who are you?” a child once asked him. “I wish I knew,” he replies, in a Jonathan Dimbleby documentary.\u0026nbspA prince with a touch of imposter syndrome. He is, after all, only the “apparent” heir and fears that the real one may yet pop up and take his place. Charles makes me think of someone who is always a bit betwixt and between, a round peg in a square hole, neither one thing nor another, but still, all the same, continuing to give of his best and give it a decent shot anyway. He is, you have to say, a trier.The black spider letters were once memorably described as being “as controversial as back copies of the Beano” (credit to Stephen Glover in the Mail). I have to admit, though, to a sneaking affection for the Beano. And, similarly, for those great old double-breasted suits of his, and his archaic way of speaking, all of that, in a spirit of nostalgia. Which suggests why he was never really going to make it as a surfer – he prefers to swim against the prevailing current.The first Charles took that too far and ended up with his head on the block, but if you had to pinpoint a king who looks like some kind of plausible precursor, it would have to be King Canute, sticking his throne down in the sand and trying to hold back the tide.\u0026nbspWe know that he has passed on his board to Prince Harry, who once went surfing in Cornwall. Maybe he will take over as president of the British Surfing Association.Terry Eagleton once said of the Prince of Wales that “he wants the kind of change radical enough to do away with polluters and modernist architects, but not radical enough to do away with himself”. But what he wants or doesn’t want is not really the point. If modern capitalism is all about “creative destruction”, then the feudal principle (and primogeniture) he embodies stands as a kind of counterweight or counterpoint to transience, a symbol of persistence or resistance (even if manifestly unfair and absurd). In the age of information and Donald Trump, he looks like someone who wouldn’t be well-equipped to tweet in the middle of the night. On the other hand, he could probably speak up for Gaia and communing with trees in a way that the average world leader might well shy away from.The prince’s purpose flows from his inability to quite fit into time and space.\u0026nbspWhether willingly or not, he has become the representative of all those (which is everyone, at one time or another) who feel rejected or excluded or left out in the cold or just waiting for a door to open that remains stubbornly closed. His charitable endeavours, on behalf of refugees and other fugitives from fate, reflect this role. Prince he may be, but he is already king of an immense and populous realm, the great and lonely kingdom of outsiders.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It\u0027s very much a continuation of the styling OnePlus used on the OnePlus 6 earlier in the year. That was the first to break with the metal-back styling of phones since the OnePlus 3 and opt for a glass enclosure front and rear.\u0026nbspThis looks as smart and stylish as the last model – which is very stylish, by the way –\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspalthough it\u0027s a little thicker from front to back (8.2mm instead of the OnePlus 6\u0027s 7.8mm), it feels very comfortable in the hand, not least because it\u0027s narrower than the last model.Still, it squeezes in a bigger 6.4-inch display\u0026nbspbecause the screen proportions are different: This is a 19.5:9 ratio screen. There\u0027s a notch at the top, but it\u0027s pretty minimal, like a drop of water when it\u0027s just about to gain enough critical mass to drip from the bathroom tap, no bigger than that. It looks cute.This teardrop notch is one obvious change. The second comes when you flip the phone over. Unlike on the OnePlus 6, there\u0027s no fingerprint sensor just below the dual cameras.Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 43Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Designed by Pierpaolo Lazzarini from Italian company Jet Capsule.

Pick up the phone and the fingerprint icon lights up on the dark screen. Touch it, and it responds with a neat animation, like a fizzing electrical sphere, and unlocks to the home screen. It feels like the future.Huawei has a similar technology, though a less glitzy special effect, on the Huawei Mate 20. Huawei\u0027s feels just that bit quicker, but this is far from slow. It\u0027s not as fast as a conventional fingerprint sensor, but at least there\u0027s the cute animation to entertain you –\u0026nbspand it\u0027s still only a fraction of a second.Also, it sits in just the perfect place, right at the bottom of the display, in the middle, while the Mate 20 Pro sensor is quite a bit higher.That other Chinese brand, Xiaomi, also has an in-screen fingerprint sensor on its new Mi 8 Pro handset, though that requires a little more pressure.Top tip: when you\u0027re enrolling your fingerprint, think about what angle you\u0027ll actually be unlocking it from. My vertical thumb print wasn\u0027t very effective. I registered it again coming at it from the angle that it turns out I would actually pick the phone up by and it worked like a dream.OnePlus has beaten smartphone heavyweights Apple and Samsung to introduce an in-screen fingerprint sensor (OnePlus)Overall, the fingerprint unlock is pretty reliable, though it doesn\u0027t work as consistently as, say, Face ID on the iPhone XS. But it does the job more than nine times out of ten, so enough to keep you coming back to it rather than turning to the other ways to unlock the phone, such as facial recognition (consistent but not as much fun) or tapping in a PIN code.When it unlocks, you get to see the display in all its glory. It covers 86 per cent of the front of the phone. You can even obscure the notch if you want, or at least set it so the display colours itself black on either side of it, so it blends in. But with such a pretty notch, why would you hide it? Well, only because it gives the screen a little more symmetry, near-matching bezels at top and bottom, it suddenly looks like.The 6.41-inch display on this phone is bright and colourful, looking eye-searingly vivid in some wallpapers (which I love the look of, by the way). The wallpapers even bear the OnePlus slogan of Never Settle, a reminder of the plucky Chinese brand\u0027s positive attitude.It\u0027s a pin-sharp OLED screen, with 401 pixels per inch, that\u0027s the same as the iPhone 8 Plus and rather more than the iPhone XR. And it has OnePlus specialities like reading mode which turns the screen monochrome as though it were a Kindle.\u0026nbspIt completely dominates the front of the phone and you\u0027ll be glad to know it\u0027s robust –\u0026nbspit\u0027s made of Gorilla Glass 6.OnePlus mobile phones are seen on display during a press briefing in Mumbai, India, July 31, 2018 (REUTERSFrancis Mascarenhas)As far as the rear of the phone is concerned, there are two finishes to choose from, Midnight Black (it means matte black) and Mirror Black (it means, oh, you can work it out). Both are attractive.One of the most interesting things about the design is what\u0027s not there:\u0026nbspThe headphone jack. OnePlus is hardly alone in dropping this connection but nonetheless it\u0027s something that many fans have not been happy about, not least because the company championed the headphone jack one the OnePlus 6. Mind you, it means the phone has a bigger battery than last time, which on balance, is a decent trade-off.OnePlus hasn\u0027t introduced waterproofing here, either, something which is a real boon in technology generally. So, don\u0027t drop it in the bath. And, be warned, this phone can feel slippy in the hand.Something else that\u0027s absent is wireless charging. Now, scores of phones have had this capability and until recently it\u0027s gone largely unused. But the truth is that wireless charging pads are an unsung hero of the tech world, providing a genuine improvement in convenience that, once used, is hard to give up on.Wireless charging is especially good at disguising limited battery life because the simplicity of putting it on a pad feels much less of a commitment than digging out the right cable and plugging it in.So, although the company hasn\u0027t ruled wireless charging out for future phones, it\u0027s a shame it\u0027s not here now. Especially as the rear of the phone is glass, not metal.\u0026nbspStill, OnePlus prides itself on charging the battery fast, and that\u0027s definitely the case with the OnePlus 6T, which quickly goes from empty to enough to get through a day in around half an hour. That\u0027s part of the argument against wireless charging, of course, that it\u0027s not as fast.Battery life is strong with a full charge leaving you with a third of a battery by the end of the day, often more. As mentioned, this battery is bigger than on the OnePlus 6.Performance is good, too, thanks to the fast Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 chip and plenty of RAM to keep everything speeding along. It has the latest version of Android on board, Android Pie 9.0. OnePlus uses its own Oxygen OS set-up which is accessible and attractive.The camera is a crucial element on every smartphone now and I found the OnePlus 6T camera to be a moderate improvement on the last model. The hardware is the same, but algorithms and software have been enhanced to better photograph faces, text, food and night scenes, OnePlus says.The front camera is high-resolution, 16MP, and has similarly had a software uptick to make selfies sharper.The rear camera hardware is good - a pair of sensors with 16MP and 20MP resolution respectively - but sometimes I found the images were low on detail in places. Low light was less of a problem than on many phones but I didn\u0027t feel the camera quite on the level of the best in the market, such as the Huawei Mate 20 Pro and iPhone XS. Then again, those phones cost a lot more.Which is a part of the story for OnePlus. Although the latest phone is not as super-cheap as its handsets were when it first arrived on the scene, the price ticket here, £499, is impressive. Especially since the storage on board is 128GB, where many rivals have 64GB as standard, still.Camera apart, there\u0027s not much you miss out on with this phone (well, wireless charging and a headphone jack but they aren\u0027t dealbreakers) and there are some elements, such as the in-screen fingerprint sensor, which hardly any other phones can match. Add to that the strong performance, great battery life and fast recharge, and the OnePlus 6T is a deeply appealing choice.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Sterling dropped more than 0.3 per cent against the greenback to $1.3021, and fell 0.21 per cent against the euro to €1.1471.

While growth for the third quarter on the whole was lifted by 0.6 per cent - the fastest rate since 2016 - economists said this was likely to be a one-off. With “persistent Brexit uncertainty and the financial squeeze on consumers and businesses likely to weigh increasingly on economic activity in the coming quarters”, according to Suren Thiru of the British Chambers of Commerce. Meanwhile, Schroders senior European economist Azad Zangana said the economy is not forecast to pick up in the near term. “We expect UK fourth quarter growth to be very weak as Brexit paralysis truly takes hold,” he said. “Assuming the government can successfully negotiate the withdrawal agreement with Brussels and ratify it in Parliament, then we could see a rebound in growth early next year. “However, a failure to complete a deal which would mean a no-deal or cliff-edge Brexit, is likely to cause a further slowdown in activity, which could be enough to tip the UK into recession.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Check out our handy tips for dealing with the demand:1) Make sure you are ready and waiting with the web page up at least five minutes before sales open on Saturday at 10:30am.\u0026nbsp2) Do not let your computer, phone or whatever device holds the key to your happiness run out of battery.\u0026nbsp3) Register your details with the website you are booking from in advance, if you can, but don’t panic if you haven’t left enough time as your tickets will be held while you fill out your information4) Check how many tickets you are allowed to buy in one purchase. If you try to buy more than the limited number, your booking may be cancelled without notice, meaning no-one gets to go.5) Get your friends to try too, but stay in contact in case you all succeed and end up with a bunch of tickets you didn’t want. If you do need to sell any on, do so at face value. No-one likes a tout.6) Be patient and avoid refreshing or switching between browsers. Stick with one tab and have some faith!

The Queen and the massed ranks of the old British establishment will gather, as ever, for the Remembrance Sunday service at the Cenotaph, exactly a century after guns finally fell silent on the western front.This being a special anniversary, there’s also a special Songs of Praise\u0026nbspfrom\u0026nbspthe BBC (which in 1918 was still four years away from its birth, and so couldn’t cover the actual arrival of peace). This is followed by Home Front Heroes, in which celebrities, inevitably, reflect on the family’s wartime history. Then there’s another service at Westminster Abbey, plus a special documentary about that installation of ceramic poppies at the Tower of London in 2014.\u0026nbspBut the televisual guns do not fall silent, such is the abiding fascination with the “war to end all wars”. There’s 100 Year of the RAF, tail-end johnnies flying in on Friday night and Dan Cruickshank’s Monuments of Remembrance on Tuesday, which tells the story of the architecture of all those gracious cemeteries and memorials that have been such centres of attention again.\u0026nbspPeter Jackson’s astonishing WW1 documentary is like no otherProbably the best, and most original, of the many documentaries devoted to the First World War is They Shall Not Grow Old. This is more of a feature film in fact, created as it is by Peter Jackson (best known for directing the Lord of the Rings trilogy). You may have seen the advance publicity: original film has been cleaned up, colourised, converted to 3D and rendered with an almost contemporary look. Thus that faded, jumpy black-and-white conflict is transformed into something that might have been videoed last week (not that we have any shortage of wars nowadays anyway).Of course, something of the same has been done with The Second World War in Colour and similar series, but nothing as ambitious as this, nor so well put together with audio from old soldiers’ remembrances. Even those suffering from a touch of war weariness after four years of anniversary broadcasting will appreciate the depth of effort that has gone into this. Now all we have to do is get ready for the 1939-45 show.People Just Do Nothing was, and is, one of the funniest things to come out of Hounslow, or anywhere.\u0026nbspIt’s about a bunch of idiots in a UK garage (or something) crew who run a pirate radio station. The police raided them at the end of that last series but, as one of the mugs tells us in this (sadly) the final series, the audience was so pitifully small that he virtually let them off. By the way, a feature film is on the way, plus a tour or two.\u0026nbspBBC3 (BBC)In mockumetary style, PJDN is a superbly scripted and enacted chronicle of fecklessness, corruption (ironically or not), drug abuse, evil, delusion and, above all, astonishing stupidity. It’s hard to pick out one of them who are last among equals, so to speak, but I suppose it has to be the scene-stealing Chabbuddy G, aka the Mayor of Hounslow, aka the Brown Casanova, aka the Ultrapaneer, aka Alan Brown Sugar, aka Asim Chaudhry. By the way, Chabuds has a girthy book out, “How To Be a Man”, in such he celebrates his success, especially as a lover: “Hey, sugar face, wanna make some beige babies and live the Ukip nightmare?”Chabuds joins MC Grindah (Allan Mustafa), Mish (Lily Brazier) CJ Beats (Hugo Chegwin), and DJ Steves (Steve Stamp) also try to pit their minuscule wits against a hostile world. So bad are they at it that the BBC has even promoted them to BBC2, from their previous existence on BBC3, which transformed itself into a mighty digital comedy incubator when most\u0026nbspexpected it to curl up and die (This Country and Murder in Successville were other great achievements).\u0026nbspThis week Kurupt FM try to replace their pirate radio kit that the police confiscated. In a small homage to Only Fools and Horses,\u0026nbspChabuddy styles himself as Dahl Boy goes hustling. The genius of the British has always been improvisation...I can easily recommend The Little Drummer Girl, which maintains its high standards in this, the third episode. Obviously, rather like the real-life Mossad officers and Palestinian terrorists that feature at the heart of this drama, I can’t reveal too much about what you’re going to see, but you may rest assured it is gripping, beautifully shot and stylishly acted, with standout performances from Michael Shannon (Israeli spymaster Martin Kurtz) and Florence Pugh (a high-tensile alloy of petulance and steel as the reluctant spyterrorist).Though I suppose nothing will surpass the 1979 dramatisation of Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, this Le Carre dramatisation is certainly a fine piece of craft, on a par with The Night Manager. Fine viewing, then: no secret about that.Carre\u0026nbspbook (BBC)The animal kingdom is full of endearing creatures that are more or less endangered. (In fact we homo sapiens are actually the most pathetic, seeing as we know we will die out because we’re killing our own planet, but can’t be bothered to do much about it. But I digress.)There can be few more charming things on four trotters than the tapir, and specifically the rare Malaysian tapir, which is basically a pig with a gigantic schnozzle. They look stupid, and they are, and the pair featured in The Secret Life of the Zoo don’t even seem too much keen on mating. No wonder they’re dying out.Last, there’s no shortage of sport out there if you want to desert the western front. International rugby kicks off on Saturday, with England playing the All Blacks maybe the highlight. Sky is also offering, live, the UnitedCity Manchester Derby on Sunday.

The referendum took place. Article 50 has been triggered. What we can do is recognise the reasons why people voted Leave.How did Jeremy Corbyn get into politics?Theresa May is bluffing about a no-deal Brexit, Keir Starmer sayLabour says it will vote down a ‘blind Brexit’ dealVoters in every Labour area now support Final Say referendum on BrexitMr Corbyn said the Brexit vote was triggered by\u0026nbsppeople who were totally angered by the way their communities had been left behind.He\u0026nbspalso indicated he felt sorry for the prime minister\u0026nbspover\u0026nbspthe impossible task of reaching agreement with Brussels and uniting the Tory party,Mr Corbyn said: I am a decent human being, I feel sorry for anyone in distress. But the best way for anyone to alleviate distress is to take yourself away from the source of it.The Labour leader said his party would fare better in the talks, as it would not be trying to\u0026nbspface towards the deregulated economy of the United States.We would want to make a new and comprehensive customs union with the European Union, one that would obviously protect the Irish border - that\u0027s crucial - but also ensure that our supply chains worked in both directions, he said.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Floral tributes left for Leicester City\u0027s late owner Vichai Srivaddhanaprabh, are pictured ahead of the club\u0027s English Premier League football match against Burnley, at the King Power Stadium in Leicester, central England.

How could it be implemented? And what would the impact be on the economy?\u0026nbspBen Chu\u0026nbspexplainsClick to followIndy PoliticsFrench lessons? France has a 35-hour working week, implemented in 2000Labour, under Jeremy Corbyn, has been making encouraging noises about the idea of a four-day working week for some months now.\u0026nbspAnd this week things seemed to move on a bit further for the opposition party as it was reported that the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, has spoken to the cross-bench peer Lord Skidelsky about the possibility of an inquiry into the topic.\u0026nbspBut what’s the argument for such a reform? How could it be implemented? And what would the impact be on the economy?Why would we want to move to a four-day week?Many advocates cite greater work-life balance. Working one fewer day a week would free workers up to look after children, elderly parents or simply to have more leisure time.But Mr McDonnell has talked about the move in terms of productivity – or a worker’s output per hour.He argues that British workers work the longest hours in Europe and yet are among the least productive.Give workers four-day week and more pay, unions sayThe four-day week could transform our lives and our economy Schools consider four-day week in cost cutting driveThat’s\u0026nbspborne out by the data we have.The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development\u0026nbspestimates that UK workers put in an average of 1,681 hours a year in 2017. That compared\u0026nbspwith 1,514 in France and 1,356 in Germany.\u0026nbspYet the Office for National Statistics calculates that GDP per worker in the UK is lower than both those countries.Labour’s lesson seems to be that one way to boosting our weak national productivity is actually to give people less time in the workplace to encourage them to work more efficiently while they are there.\u0026nbspWhile this might sound fanciful it’s not totally outlandish. One recent study from New Zealand showed that when workers moved to a four-day week at one firm their per-hour productivity did indeed rise.The argument is that a better work-life balance makes people more motivated, perhaps by reducing productivity-sapping illness and stress.How could it be implemented?This is a key question. For whatever the theoretical merits of a four-day week for productivity, ordering the entire economy to shift immediately to such a radically different working time structure would clearly be massively disruptive.Angela Merkel’s economic success may be more about luck than strategyEmployers would have to reconfigure shift patterns dramatically, in some cases having to hire many more workers. Think in particular of public services like schools and the health services. Think of the retail and transport sectors.\u0026nbspAlso, around 15 per cent of the UK workforce is now self-employed. It’s hard to see how the state could practically compel those 5\u0026nbspmillion self-employed workers to limit their working week to four days.One policy possibility\u0026nbspa Labour inquiry might consider is whether\u0026nbspto offer tax breaks or other kinds of support to firms that offer four-day working to employees, hoping that this could\u0026nbspencourage the practice to spread.What would be the impact on the economy?That would depend to a large degree on those productivity effects.\u0026nbspThe size of the economy is the value of the output of goods and services produced over a certain period. Working fewer hours would, as a first order effect, seem likely to reduce the volume of those goods and services, thus contracting the economy.\u0026nbspBut if we could produce more of that output in a given period that negative impact would be mitigated, perhaps even wiped out altogether.And\u0026nbspeconomies are dynamic too.\u0026nbspIf we could increase our productivity\u0026nbspgrowth rate\u0026nbspthrough a shorter working week the economy could, theoretically, be larger over the long run.\u0026nbspCritics argue that the productivity impacts are unproven, and that France, with its 35-hour week, has higher unemployment and a more rigid labour market than the UK, something that seems to be particularly unfair on young people.Yet it’s also worth noting that in the late 1900s UK workers put in on average more than 2500 hours a year, almost 50 per cent more than today. But our economy is far larger than it was then due to productivity growth.\u0026nbspThe big-picture historical lesson is that it’s certainly not impossible for average living standards to rise even as average hours worked falls.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Construction grew 1.7 per cent\u0026nbspafter deep falls in output during the snowstorms early this year.But services, which make up the bulk of the UK economy, contracted 0.1 per cent during\u0026nbspthe month.In the third quarter, business investment fell 1.2 per cent, the worst three-month performance since early 2016.It was also the third quarter of contraction in a row – marking the worst run since the last recession.Surveys suggest Brexit-related uncertainty is causing firms to freeze spending.\u0026nbspWorst run in a decadeThe Bank of England expects growth in the final quarter to decelerate\u0026nbspto 0.3 per cent.However, there was slightly better news from the ONS on UK trade, with the statistics agency reporting\u0026nbspthe trade deficit fell to £2.9bn in the three months to September, down from £6.1bn.Export values were up 3.8 per cent in the period, outstripping import growth of 1.7 per cent.Net trade is therefore estimated to have provided a 0.8 percentage point boost to overall GDP growth in Q3, after dragging\u0026nbspin the second quarter.Chancellor\u0026nbspPhilip Hammond\u0026nbspsought to accentuate the positive elements in the data, arguing the quarterly growth rate was evidence of the “underlying strength in our economy”. Speaking on a visit to Fuller’s Brewery in London, Mr Hammond said: “We are building an economy that works for everyone, with 3.3 million more people in work, lower unemployment in every part of the country, and wages rising at their fastest pace in almost a decade. Now our focus is on locking in this progress and ensuring people’s wages can continue to rise.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It uses the Snapdragon 845 processor and runs on a customised version of Google\u0027s Android operating system.All are features found on rival high-end phones that can cost more than £700, but Xiaomi is to sell the Mi 8 Pro starting at £499, as part of a strategy it calls honest pricing.Xiaomi opens Mi Stores in UK and USWang Xiang, the firm\u0027s senior vice president, said: Today we witness a new chapter in Xiaomi\u0027s global expansion journey, underpinned by our global ambitions.We are thrilled to make great strides by announcing our arrival in the UK.By bringing a range of our amazing products at honest pricing we want to offer more choices and let everyone in the UK enjoy a connected simple life through our innovative technology.The company will face stiff competition to establish itself in a crowded market, with three new iPhones, two Google Pixel 3 handsets and devices from Samsung, Sony and fellow Chinese firms Huawei and OnePlus being released in recent months.As well as the Pro, Xiaomi will also launch its budget Redmi 6A device for £99, which it claims has a battery that can last for up to 19 days.The Chinese firm is also bringing a range of its other gadgets to the UK, including its Band 3 wearable fitness tracker and an electric scooter.These products will go on sale in a physical Xiaomi Mi store, which will open at the Westfield shopping centre in Shepherd\u0027s Bush, London, on November 18.Mobiles expert Ru Bhikha said the firm\u0027s arrival in the UK should be taken seriously.Since releasing its first smartphone in August 2011, Xiaomi has rapidly gained a strong foothold in the market - so much so that it\u0027s already the fourth largest handset manufacturer in the world, he said.Xiaomi\u0027s highly anticipated arrival in the UK therefore threatens to put a big cat amongst the pigeons - by combining top tier design and performance with relatively modest pricing, it poses a real threat to the market.Looking at Xiaomi\u0027s success so far, it\u0027s hard to see how its winning combination of high-end smartphones with lower-than-expected prices won\u0027t drive similar results over here.Thursday\u0027s launch marks the arrival of a significant new kid on the block, and there is no doubt that in finally coming to the UK, Xiaomi means business.Additional reporting by agenciesShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Because she doesn\u0026rsquot know what she\u0026rsquos going to get.

It was the largest democratic exercise that we have seen.Coventry was above the national average, and around 56 per cent voted to leave.We have got to follow through with that referendum. The damage that will be done to democracy if we don\u0027t implement it would be severe.Asked whether the transition period - meant to end in 2020 - should be extended as Theresa May proposed in October, the majority of the people interviewed by Express expressed their concerns.\u0026nbspOne resident said: \u0026ldquoI think it\u0026rsquos totally wrong.

But there are no guarantees that Eurotunnel wont have any disruption next year.As part of a raft of No Deal notices last month, the Government said that companies such as Eurostar, which only holds a UK licence, could be affected unless inidual agreements are struck with the countries it goes to.It advises taking out insurance for Eurostar tickets that cover any Brexit disruption.Under No Deal, UK driving licences would no longer be valid in the EU so holidaymakers would need to buy an international driving permit, available at the Post Office for £..The Government said: You may be turned away at the border or face other enforcement action, for example fines,you don’t have the correct IDP.And you could need a Green card  too - a translation of your car insurance policy - which you can get from the Post Office.But providing ministers secure the -month transition period as planned, this should stay the same.Holidaymakers are delaying booking their ferry crossings for next summer because of Brexit fears, Brittany Ferries said earlier this week, with bookings down  per cent.Dover to Calais and other ferry routes could be impactedchecks have to be made at borders in the event of a No Deal Brexit.But there are unlikely to be any extra delays for tourists, as Brits already get their passports checked en route anyway.No changes should be needed for anyone booking a package deal - unless your booking is with an EU-based firm and made outside the UK, in which case you may not be protected.There was a drop in the pound after Britain voted to leave the EU, meaning Brits will have to stump up more money to get their euros when going abroad on the continent.Buttheres a Brexit deal signed in the next few weeks, the pounds value could increase and make next years a bit cheaper again. A No Deal could see it drop again, pushing up prices.Brits will be able to continue to enjoy free healthcare when travelling in Europe after Brexit, it was confirmed last year.As part of the Withdrawal Agreement, officials have negotiated to use the European Health Insurance Cardacross EU’s  remaining member states – not just the country they’re living in.Pet owners should speak to a vet as soon as possiblethey want to take their animals to Europe after Brexit, Britains top vet warned earlier this week.Brits will need to pay up to £ for the right to take pets on holidaywe leave the EU with No Deal.If we do get a deal in the next few weeks it should be able to continue as normal.Most UK networks say they have no plans to bring back roaming charges after we leave the EU.The bloc scrapped them last year, but there have been fears it could cost more to call and use the internet abroad in future.Ministers have said that any increases again would be limited.Brits could be forced to apply for US-style waivers after Brexit to go on their hols, Theresa May has admitted.Unveiling plans last month to pre-screen EU tourists as part of her new post-Brexit immigration policy, the Prime Minister conceded the arrangements were likely to have to be “reciprocal”.The US currently charges  for every ‘ESTA’ waiver form – raising the prospects Brits will be forced to shell out each time they want to fly to the Costa del Sol.The EU are set to decide within weeks whether the Brits will need a visa in the event of No Deal."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT000447874286.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"toby young creepy tech giants social media","story":"In fact, it’s when they are at home that they are most at risk — alone in their bedrooms and in front of a screen.Yesterday The Sun told how the ­Children’s Commissioner for England, Anne Longfield, released some hair-raising statistics about how closely ­children are monitored by the increasingly creepy tech giants.By the time the average British child reaches the age of  they are likely to have posted more than , times on social media, providing companies such as Facebook, Pinterest and Instagram with a treasure trove of valuable ­personal ­information about themselves.But it isn’t just the messages they send to each other.Their day-to-day movements are tracked on their phones and smart watches, their school reports are stored on education databases and their digital medical records are kept by the NHS.It’s asthey’re living in , George Orwell’s dystopian novel about the future, except instead of being monitored by the surveillance state, they’re being spied on by hundreds of Big Brothers.And most of them have not got a clue that it’s happening.Last year, the NSPCC published a report showing that  per cent of young people in the UK have taken a naked or semi-naked picture of themselves, which suggests privacy is not uppermost in their minds.I know from personal experience how dangerous this casual attitude to social media can be.At the beginning of the year, I had to step down from a government job and resign from the boards of several ­charities when some silly things I’d said on Twitter were dug up by my enemies.But eventeenagers were aware just how easily their posts could come back to bite them, they probably wouldn’t ­curtail their online activity because tech companies have become masters of getting people hooked on their sites.Sean Parker, founding president of Facebook, let the cat out of the bag, revealing that social media s deliberately set out to turn people into addicts by exploiting their weaknesses.The reason there are “like” buttons, according to Parker, is because every time a user’s post is liked it creates “a social validation feedback loop”.“We need to give you a little dopamine hit every once in a while, because ­someone liked or commented on a photo or a post or whatever,” he said.We already know just how effective these psychological techniques are when it comes to adults.But our children are so much more vulnerable than us adults.Tech companies such as Instagram, Snapchat and Tumblr are supposed to enforce a minimum user age limit of , but few bother — and research suggests three quarters of ten to -year-olds have a social media account. Should parents be worried  Absolutely, say the experts.The National Crime Agency estimates that about , people in the UK pose a threat of some kind to children online — and the number is rising all the time.It adds there has been a  per cent increase in the referrals it has received about people uploading images of child sexual abuse since .Just as alarming is the damaging effect that smartphones and social media have on children’s mental health.According to Jean Twenge, professor of psychology at San Diego State University, the number of US teens who took their own lives increased by  per cent between  and .And , like me, you have a teenage daughter there is even more reason to be worried.Compared to the early s, nearly twice as many American teenage girls now end their own lives. In the UK, a quarter of -year-old girls experienced signs of depression, according to a study of , young people.Overall, Professor Twenge found that the generation she calls “iGen” — those born after  — are much more likely  to suffer from mental health issues than their millennial predecessors.“What happened that so many more teens, in such a short period of time, would feel depressed, attempt ­suicide and commit suicide ” she asks. “The sudden rise of the smartphone.”If you’re not convinced by the advice of the experts, just look at the behaviour of the people who’ve made their fortunes from peddling this digital crack cocaine.Bill Gates, the billionaire founder of Microsoft, stopped his children from owning a phone until they were  and the late Steve Jobs, co-founder of Apple, would not let his kids play on iPads — even though he invented them.Apple recently introduced a new update that tells you how much time you are spending on your screen each day.That’s a step in the right direction, but don’t expect the company to do too much more. Last year, Apple sold nearly a quarter of a billion iPhones, helping to make it the world’s most valuable brand.The leaders of the tech giants are enriching themselves beyond their ­wildest dreams — not just at our expense but at the expense of our children.So it’s pretty clear they won’t be doing anything to help. And that means that, for now, it’s down to us.We have a choice. We do not have to let our children use their services.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

When seconds seemed to halt people held their breath lest they be heard in the stillness. At last a woman sobbed and the breakdown helped release the tears which others had with dficulty held trembling on their eyelids. Many were weeping at the end of the two minutes.” The King — just like our Queen did for more than half a century and now Prince Charles — placed the first wreath at the Cenotaph on behalf of a grateful nation. After a short service at the Cenotaph, the Unknown Warrior’s coffin was carried into the Abbey.A tin helmet, a side-arm and the King’s wreath lay on top.The King, with his generals and admirals of the fleet, stood at the grave as the coffin was lowered and covered in the earth from the Western Front.Outside, hundreds of thousands of people waited to file past the Cenotaph. Such were the numbers that it took them up to six hours to walk the three-quarters of a mile from Trafalgar Square to Westminster Abbey.The outpouring of grief saw The Cenotaph almost buried in wreaths of mainly green and white flowers — Poppies were not introduced until the following year.In the four days that followed in , one and a quarter million grieving families filed past the Cenotaph, placing an astonishing , wreaths on the new memorial to the Glorious Dead.They carried on down Whitehall, which had been closed to traffic, to pay their respects at the grave of the Unknown Warrior.They called it the People’s Pilgrimage and the only other outpouring of grief to come near was the death of Princess Diana eight decades later.A spokesman for the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, which is responsible for arranging tomorrow’s ceremony, said: “When we saw the pictures of the first Armistice in  we wanted to create a People’s Pilgrimage for today.”So the People’s Procession was born, where descendants of the men and women who served in the Great War could remember them.The Royal British Legion held a ballot and ten thousand people won their place in the mile-long walk that starts on the Mall at .pm.They will follow the , military veterans of all conflicts who will march past the Cenotaph from .am.

But it will be flawed –– and Mrs May should say so.I admit this sounds odd: Why would a Prime Minister admit that a deal they have negotiated isn’t great ButMrs May tries to say that this agreement is perfect, and that there is no risk of any part of the UK getting stuck in the backstop — which would leave it in an EU customs union but with no say over the trade deals the EU is doing — then she will easily be disproved.Mrs May should take a leaf out of the book of Attorney General Geoffrey Cox, who as a hugely successful trial lawyer knows a fair bit about persuading people of his case.He told Cabinet on Tuesday that when it came to quitting the backstop “a unilateral right would give the UK greater scope to establish its case, as the other side would have to prove the contrary”.But he went on to acknowledge that negotiating a unilateral right to get out of the backstop was highly unlikely in the time available and a mutual review mechanism could be made to work.Cox’s essential argument is about managing risk. Every option on Brexit now carries with it risk.The challenge is to work out how to best manage these risks. The risk with accepting a legally binding backstop in the withdrawal agreement is that the UK ends up being unable to get out of it cleanly.It would be direthe UK ended up leaving the EU in a way that tied it to the EU for ever.But set against this must be the risk of no deal, and the disruption that would cause. To make matters worse, the Government has done absurdly little to mitigate no deal.The reason that even Cabinet ministers who loathe where the negotiations are heading do not want to go for no deal is they know how unprepared the country is for it.At the same time, there is a risk thatthere is no deal, Parliament would either insist on a second referendum — that would harden isions and toxy our politics — or cancel the process altogether, creating a dangerous democratic deficit.Frankly, the argument that Mrs May’s withdrawal agreement is less bad than the alternatives will be pretty much the only thing going for it.It will be hard for her to make this argument as so many of the deal’s problems are self-inflicted.She triggered Article  without knowing what the UK wanted she has wasted much of the past  months in a negotiation with her own Cabinet the failure to plan properly for no deal has weakened the Government’s negotiating position.Even the Parliamentary arithmetic has been made worse by Mrs May. If she hadn’t called that election, there would be a Tory majority and she wouldn’t be so reliant on the DUP.But it is the argument that her deal is less bad than the alternatives that is keeping the Cabinet on board and it is her best — and, possibly, only — way of getting the House of Commons to vote for such a flawed agreement.THE bad news for Theresa May is that it doesn’t get any easier once she’s got a deal with Brussels.For she will still have to get this withdrawal agreement through the House of Commons.With the DUP unhappy and  Tory Brexit ultras expected to vote against the deal, as well as Jo Johnson and other Tories who want another referendum, it will be extremely tough to get it over the line.“I can’t quite see where the majority comes from,” admits one Cabinet minister.But there is growing talk that the way to get the deal through might be to bring it back a second time, with the markets – which expect a deal – freaking out.As this Secretary of State says: “Do you get it through the first time  Maybe not.He did little to hide his irritation at being moved from his job as universities minister because of his opposition to Mrs May’s plan to tinker with tuition fees.But his resignation is a blow to the PM – and not just because of his attack on her for “a failure of British statecraft not seen since the Suez crisis”.His departure will put more pressure on those ministerial colleagues who privately share his view that a second referendum is needed, to go.With both Johnsons voting against the withdrawal agreement, it will become even harder to get it through the Commons.SO will any of the Cabinet resign over Theresa May’s Brexit plan  At the moment, ministers believe not.One of those who spoke against the May approach at Cabinet tells me the mood of the meeting was “resigned rather than resigning”.Another predicts critics of what Mrs May is doing “will make their point, then retreat”.This is not to say people are happy. Penny Mordaunt, the International Development Secretary, warned that voters wanted a “definitive end point to Brexit” andthey didn’t get it, that risked “feeding a narrative of betrayal, fuelling Ukip”.In private, ministers rail against Mrs May and the way she is handling the negotiations. Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt has been heard to complain that the UK is making it far too obvious it is in a desperate hurry to get a deal.It is certainly true that by advertising its need for a quick agreement, the UK is almost inviting the EU to ask for more.Tellingly, there is renewed – and increasing – talk among ministers of having a new leader in place to do the next set of negotiations.There is little love for the backstop. And interestingly, Chancellor Philip Hammond argued in Cabinet this week it would be better to extend the transition than trigger the backstop.He argued that the backstop could do damage to supply chains and said “it could be better to extend the implementation period than have a bad backstop”.A problem with extending the implementation period is that it would mean free movement would continue – and the UK would still be sending huge amounts of money to Brussels every year.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She said: “Even on holiday we used to look for McDonald’s. We’ve been to ones in Exmouth, Exeter, Weston-super-Mare and Bristol.” The married pair, who have both been retired for around  years, have no hesitation in recommending McDonald’s to others. Tom even said that one of the charges levelled against the takeaway chain by critics - that much of its food can lead to people being overweight - is wrong. “I just want to say that all this nonsense about McDonald’s making you fat is rubbish, he said. Look at us.” But the fact Tom and Pauline remain slim and fit in their eighties may be down to the other parts of their daily routine.  Every day they enjoy walking into the centre of Bath. But explaining their visit to McDonald’s, Pauline added: “We walk . miles every day to get here. “We pop in for a coffee at .am and then go to look round the shops. “At ish we come back for what we call a snack.” Tom almost always goes for a Big Mac, while Pauline samples more of the menu’s iety - enjoying the Big Mac like her husband, but also chicken nuggets or a BBQ chicken wrap, depending on her mood.  “It’s the friendliness,” Pauline said. “The staff are always so helpful.“We feel like part of the building - part of the furniture.“We always feel as though they know who we are and they’re so kind.“Mind you I always say thank you, and I think that goes a long way.“It’s like a second home to us.” The couple are not “pub people”, Pauline added, and they value the community they find at McDonald’s.But there is a time of the day when they’re not as keen on visiting.“We like it in the mornings when it isn’t so busy,” Pauline said. “It’s a bit hectic at dinner time.”McDonald’s franchisee Paul Pearson, who owns and operates the Southgate and Weston Lock Retail Park restaurants in Bath, invited Tom and Pauline to the cutting of a cake on November  to mark the Southgate branch’s th birthday.He said Tom and Pauline were the perfect symbols of the dference McDonald’s could make in a community.

So imagine how tough it can be when youre serving  roast dinners in each of your restaurants every week and not just the extended family. Thats the task faced every week by the expert chefs of The Toby Carvery. Millions of families sit down to tuck into a delicious roast dinner every week - wherever they are in the world. So ahead of Remembrance Sunday - and in a bid to help readers who tackle the job of cooking the Sunday roast each week - weve brought The Toby Carvery together with the chefs of The Royal Navy to get their top tips in the above video. Toby Carvery - the Home of the Roast - has long been a supporter of the armed forces, offering free meals to troops on Armed Forces Day.  And in the above behind-the-scenes clip on board HMS Northumberland, Toby Carvery Chef Trainer James Smith joins forces with the Royal Navys Chef Mitchell to lt the lid on how best to cook meats, roast potatoes, Yorkshire puddings and even gravy. Toby Carvery Chef James hails The Royal Navy for creating that home-from-home roast dinner experience at sea in the clip, saying: For many families, roast dinners are that one time everybody gets around that dining table. A really good roast dinner is just like having a really big hug on a plate!  Meanwhile, The Royal Navys chef Mitchell explains how important the traditional meal is to troops across the world. He adds: Ive cooked for Royalty and some of the biggest dignitaries of the Armed Forces, but every Sunday - guaranteed - ships across the world are having a roast dinner. Below, weve shared the top tips from the guys on the key ingredients to help families across the country cooking up a roast. Meats  Toby Carverys Chef James says: One of the tricks we use at Toby is to bloom our meat for a minimum of four hours first of all. So we take them out of the packaging and that lets the joints re-oxigise. We then load them into ovens and cook them really slowly. Letting them rest at the end is a key step to getting perfect beef. Yorkshire puddings  Were famous for our seven centimetre Yorkshire Puddings at Toby Carvery, reveals chef James. The trick to Yorkshires is making sure youve got really hot oil. Then add your batter to the oil and get them in the oven as quickly as you can. Roast potatoes Its all about the ruffling, chef James says, shaking a tray of uncooked but peeled and chopped spuds.  You want to shake them up and make sure you break the edges of the potatoes up. Then that will give us a really nice, crisp roast potato. Gravy  Chef James says: Theres nothing worse than thin or lumpy gravy! Consider adding cranberry sauce, mustard or horseradish. Meanwhile, The Royal Navys Chef Mitchell adds: We always go for a nice smooth, thick gravy. We normally put in a bit of red wine to give it a dferent taste. Ive even put Marmite in!Find your nearest Toby Carvery at www.tobycarvery"},{"url":null,"title":"jealous girlfriend drove partners ex","story":"NewsJealous girlfriend drove partners ex to suicide bid by sharing intimate snaps of herRachel Dale, , discovered graphic pictures of the victim on her partners phone and shared them with her , Instagram followers, a court heardShareByAmy Walker:,  NOV Updated:,  NOV NewsRachel Dale posted the explicit pictures on Instagram \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA jealous girlfriend drove her partners ex to a suicide bid after she shared explicit photos of her on Instagram. Rachel Dale, , from Tameside, Greater Manchester, discovered the graphic images on her partner’s phone on her birthday. She warned the victim they would be all over the Internet tomorrow before sharing them with her , Instagram followers. The pictures were deleted after eight minutes but had already been circulated on social media forums and ious online chatrooms. The unnamed victim was so devastated by the disclosure she tried to take her own le, reports the Manchester Evening News. She was treated in hospital before being allowed home.  At Tameside Magistrates Court in Greater Manchester, Dale, of Stalybridge wept as she admitted an offence of disclosing a private sexual photograph with intent to cause distress under ‘Revenge Porn laws.’ But she walked free with a suspended jail term after she claimed the offence occurred after she had been made redundant from another clothing firm where she had been a retail buyer. The court heard that Dales boyfriend had a brief relationship with the victim - several years ago, before he met Dale - and that she sent ious explicit pictures of herself to him. The woman had asked him to delete the images just a day after she sent them but the court heard the explicit pictures remained on his phone.  Prosecutor Ashley Seetal told JPs: “In October this year the defendant finds these pictures of the victim onphone before uploading them to Instagram, a popular social media site. “The Instagram account which the images were uploaded on was a joint Instagram account used by the defendant and . This had been set up and was used to promote the business which they worked together on. “The account had , followers. These pictures were uploaded and made public, this means that the images can be seen by all , followers. “Prior to uploading the images to Instagram, the defendant sent the victim a message and in that message she alluded to posting the pictures online and in one message she said: ‘They will be all over the Internet tomorrow.’  “The images being uploaded of a graphic and intimate area, were shared to a number of group chats and social media chats. “The victim did attempt to take her own le, this was a serious attempt and she was taken to hospital and received treatment. The images when posted onto Instagram, the popular social media site, were viewable to a number of followers and the wider public. There is evidence of serious distress and serious signicant psychological harm.” A probation report read to the court said Dale ‘accepts full responsibility’ and has ‘saidshe could turn back the clock she would.’She claimed to have been suffering from anxiety at the time - having been made redundant days earlier.  “She has been in this relationship for two and a half years. She says the relationship is good but she does have some concerns about the status of the relationship,” the report said. “She was working full time and working with her partner on the side on their own business, which she invested in financially, as well as investing her own time and effort. “She has not told her family in fear of their reaction. She has got a stable lestyle. She has concerns, she is not surethe relationship will continue long term. She still has to work things out with the business. “She is not sure how successful it is going to be. Whilst the victim had slept with her boyfriend, this hadn’t previously played on the mind of the defendant and the two parties have little to do with each other and were at an amicable level.  “But she went out celebrating the night before as it was her birthday and on finding the photo on the phone, she says she acted on impulse with intent of seeking revenge. She said she was quite distressed and said ‘there were no other options at the time.’ In mitigation, Dale’s defence lawyer Gavin Clarke said: “This is a lady who on October  this year was in a relationship with her partner for two and a half years. “They have a shared account due to their business together. At .am she has been awoken by a number of images sent from a third party, from the victim, sent to her partner at the time. “She sees these images, graphic and explicit images and she is devastated, she is mortied. She then texts the victim and pre warns her. Yes, she does upload those to an Instagram profile.  They are up there for - minutes. They are not up there for eight months, they are not put on a streaming site. “They are uploaded to an Instagram account with between , to , followers. It was posted for between  and  minutes at . in the morning. In terms of how many people who have viewed those, the numbers are going to be extremely limited. “The person who followed the account would have to be on that account at that time. They would have to be looking at that particular account. There is no preplanning, this is a spur of the moment. This young lady, as soon as she calmed down, she realised the error of her way and took it down, that’s the end of the story. “I accept there has been some humiliation but this is very dferent to revenge, this was a spur of the moment. She was going about her own business, finds this on her partners phone and reacts there and then. This was not out of revenge or some kind of hatred.  “This is a young lady of , who has never appeared before the courts before and I dare to say I don’t think she is ever likely to came back to this court again. This offence is something she genuinely regrets. Dale was sentenced to  weeks jail suspended for a year and was ordered to pay pound in costs and surcharges. She did not comment after the hearing.

Initially things looked bleak for the -year-old pooch, who lay in the dirt for months behind a warehouse in Calornia, across the street from his former home. He had no food or water, relying on the good will of passing truck drivers to give him sustenance. But the landscape company who owned the building he slept behind had a duty to clear the area of trash, meaning his makesht water bowls would be taken away frequently. A delivery driver who noticed the dog had been there for a long time created an Instagram account in June and dedicated it to the poor old boy she would see on her route.  Every day I see him hungry and thirsty waiting for any truck driver with enough heart to give him something to eat or drink, she wrote. It breaks my heart and I wish I could help him but my situation simply will not allow me to bring him home. It’s hot so I poured my last bottle of water in a styrofoam hamburger container. I can go and get food and water he cannot. If you know anyone that can help him please tag them. The social media profile caught the attention of Love Leo Rescue, whose volunteers managed to coax the dog into their car and drive him two hours to the centre, the Dodo reports.  Rescuers, who named the dog Larry, noticed that despite his lack of food and water, his stomach was quite bloated. A trip to the vets revealed that Larry had Cushings disease and for a month and a half he lived at the vet clinic while getting used to his medication. In that time he was kind of sad, and a little depressed and reactive with other dogs, Sasha Abelson, president of the rescue centre, told the Dodo. As the medication began to work, Larrys personality was revealed and he became much happier - and was moved to a doggy day care centre.  Larrys health issues are now managed by monthly medication, which will cost his owner  a month. This has meant its proved more dficult than initially thought to find him a forever home - despite intense interest from the media and on the internet.

What’s more, eventhey don’t mutate as occurred in the case outlined here,released into the wild either by design or mistake these foreigners can cause havoc to local ecosystems.In a letter to the scientic journal Nature in , a group of German scientists began ‘it has been rumoured that an unidentied crayfish…of marbled appearance and uncertain geographical origin that was introduced into the German aquarium trade in the mid s, is capable of unisexual reproduction ’.The authors ended by warning that: ‘This crayfish…could become a menace to European freshwater systems, as the release of even one specimen into the wild would be enough to found a population that might out-compete native crayfish’.Now,  years later, this all-female crayfish has escaped into the wild.  Identied as a descendent of the fresh water slough crayfish from Florida, it is now called the marbled crayfish or Marmokrebs. So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per celland the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs. Millions of the animals have invaded the countries lakes, rice paddies and swamps and are threatening its seven endemic crayfish species.It is only a matter of time before this scenario is repeated in other locations, destroying valuable ecosystems and eliminating indigenous species."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 37","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Sir,It is always a delight when a letter awakens a landowner.James F Lithgow#s insult about ‘blow-ins’ is a typical trait. I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers# attention to the Facebook page #Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging# The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The  jobs in aquaculture will not last longmass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a -year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start againan alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued  It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September , it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The  parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause #irrecoverable damage#.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

Star lost possession in midfield and Connor Crawford’s clearance was closed down by the Kings Park forward whose shot beat Kalache from the edge of the box and the hosts took a - lead on the hour mark.This visibly knocked the confidence of the Star team and Kings added a second goal when poor play again from Star trying to break gted possession to the hosts and once again their striker was on hand to make it - and give Star a mountain to climb in the last twenty minutes.Star didn’t give up however and could have been back in the game when the ball fell to Gregor Peacock in the box, the ing striker hit the shot and the ball was saved by the Kings Park goalkeeper.Kyle Selfridge went close to claiming a late leline but his free kick from twenty yards cannoned off the bar and the game finished - to the home side.The Star management team were disappointed as that’s the first time the Lochgilphead side have failed to score in the league in more than two years.On Saturday November  Red Star play host to Campbeltown pupils in what looks like another tough league match.

The infamous #Jacobs Report# was published in , proposing six options, of which the government chose the cheapest for reasons of #cost-effectiveness#.The option selected would involve the installation of mitigation netting along with the upgrading of the old road at the foot of Glen Croe.Road closures, however, have continued as material has to be cleared and netting repaired after every major slip # adding to the cost each time.The ongoing work has failed to satisfy many people living locally, and following last months closure Jane Gauld, owner of the Slanj restaurant in Tarbet, launched an online petition to press for  a more permanent solution in the form of a bypass tunnel through the hills.Earlier this week more than , people had signed the petition.And, in a rare show of unity Argyll and Bute Council members last month voted unanimously to press for government action for a permanent solution the the Rest problem.One prominent campaigner for a permanent engineering solution at the Rest has been Inveraray hotelier Donald Clark, who said: # This should have been achieved many years ago. Mitigation lessens damage and closures but never guarantees full protection.#The choice of using the Old Military Road as a ersion route was the cheapest option in The Jacobs Report and was a flawed choice.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13549120.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_JS134733004.jpg","title":"ayrs station hotel cannot afford","story":"NewsAyrs Station Hotel cannot afford more delay, says MSP Brian WhittleOfficials have been urged to make a quick decision on the future of the Station Hotel, with some trains now running south of the town againShareByStuart Wilson:,  NOV NewsStation Hotel \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA decision on the future of Ayr’s Station Hotel must not be kicked down the road, insists an MSP. Brian Whittle says officials must act with more urgency than ever following the resumption of services south of the town. The surprise call to send trains back on the route to Stranraer was made by ScotRail bosses on Thursday. Their decision followed a morning test run on the track beneath the crumbling hotel. But South of Scotland member, Mr Whittle, warned: “Just because the trains are running again, no-one should feel we can put off making a decision about the Station Hotel’s future. “A general unwillingness by South Ayrshire Council and others to think about the future of the building were what got us into this mess and I’m not prepared to see action put off again. “The Station Hotel can’t be allowed to sit abandoned for a minute more than is necessary to make the decision. “People who rely on the railway can’t afford any more dithering and delay.”  Work to stabilise the B-Listed structure continues this week with a scaffolding being erected. One source close to the works said: “The roof is a big problem and is nowhere near being tackled yet. “It remains to be seen what the structural engineers will want to do but saving it is a very big job.” Limited services are now running to Stranraer for the first time since council chiefs threw up an exclusion zone in August. Buses will continue to operate for the services that haven’t been reintroduced, and for services between Ayr and Girvan. The existing timetable for services between Ayr and Glasgow Central remains in place. Alex Hynes, ScotRail Alliance managing director, said: “We know it has been a challenging time for our customers, so we are pleased to be able to restore some services between Ayr and Stranraer. “We are working flat out with South Ayrshire Council and our task force partners to get all services to and from Ayr back to normal as soon as possible.” Bill Reeve, chair of Ayr Station Task Force, added: “Theof rail passenger services between Stranraer and Ayr is a welcome step towards resolving this issue. “While we remain mindful there is still work to be done to restore the complete service it is good that hard work by both South Ayrshire Council and the ScotRail Alliance has now made this first step possible. “The Task Force partners continue to work together to ensure we can bring back a full timetable as quickly as possible and we thank businesses, commuters and the local community for their continued patience while we do.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnScotrailSouth Ayrshire CouncilGirvanAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13548879.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_JS166431538.jpg","title":"beith juniors president says club","story":"NewsBeith Juniors president says club are ready for Scottish Cup day with Ayr UnitedThe Mighty president, John Boal, says Ayrs large travelling support will be given a warm welcome at Bellsdale Park.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  NOV NewsBeith president John Boal\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailBosses at Beith Juniors today insisted they are ready and able to host Ayr United in the Scottish Cup.

Lieutenant Walter Tull, was Britain’s second black professional footballer who had signed up with Rangers, and trained as an officer cadet in Gailes, Ayrshire. Walter- along with millions of other soldiers- will be honoured on Sunday, November  in a nationwide gesture of remembrance. A large-scale portrait of Walter Tull designed by sand artists Sand In Your Eye, will be drawn into the sand on the beach and washed away as the tide comes in. And the public will be asked to join in by creating silhouettes of people in the sand, remembering the millions of lives lost or changed forever by the conflict. The project is the latest collaboration between the National Theatre of Scotland and - NOW, the UK’s arts programme for the World War  centenary, and will use  beaches all around the UK as their canvasses for the mass art-work. Each of the beaches taking part in the project will commemorate a dferent WW casualty.  Walter Tull was born to Alice Elizabeth Palmer, from Kent, and Daniel Tull from Barbados, the son of a slave, on April , . After the death of his parents he and his brother Edward were placed in a children’s home in Bethnal Green. Edward was later adopted and it is believed that he went on to be Britain’s first black dentist after taking over his father’s practice on St Vincent Street in Glasgow. Walter, however, began playing football with Tottenham Hotspur in , and after touring South America with them he was offered a contract, making him the second black professional footballer in Britain. When playing for Tottenham and later Northampton Town he faced a lot of racial abuse and prejudice, yet he went on to have a successful football career. In , Northampton Town began negotiations to transfer Tull to Glasgow Rangers. However, the First World War broke out before Tull could play a game for Rangers. He enlisted as a private in the Footballers’ Battalion of the British Army, where he was quickly promoted to be a sergeant. He took part in and survived the Battle of the Somme, after which he was sent to England to recover from illness. He then went to train as an officer cadet in Gailes, Ayrshire. Although black officers were not allowed in the British Army at this time, he was commissioned in May , thus becoming the first black combat officer in the British Army. He died in battle in France in , during the last major German offensive. His body was never found.

The incident along with other concerns has sparked a proposed shake-up of taxi and private hire rules. The middle seat in the front could be ditched from fleets of larger vehicles following a public consultation. The public are going to be askedpeople should still be allowed to sit in the front of vehicles. The consultation will also questionthe number of passengers sitting up front should be reduced to one. South Ayrshire Council’s Leadership Panel heard last week how the middle passenger was seated too close to drivers. A report presented to councillors said the close proximity left drivers open to accusations of “inappropriate conduct. Explaining one incident reported to the council,licensing team leader Morag Douglas said: “There were concerns that a driver was threatened by young girls who booked a private hire. “They left without paying and stated thatthe driver took any action the driver would be reported to the police for inappropriate conduct.” She said the council received other gripes from drivers about what a tight squeeze it is with two passengers in the front. Ms Douglas told how drivers said having “two larger people in the front seats” meant it is dficult to control the car without touching middle seat passengers. All eight seater vehicles licensed by the council have two passenger seats in the front and six in the back. Depute council leader Brian McGinley said: “It is as much about protecting the drivers as the passengers.” He added: “We need to be cautious and make sure that whatever we come up with doesn’t have unintended consequences.” Glasgow and Edinburgh City Councils don’t permit passengers in the front seats of taxis. Feedback from South Ayrshire Taxi and Private Hire Operators’ Forum members suggested the inidual drivers should decidethey want passengers up front. The members also told the council there should still be an option to have two passengers seated in the front. There are  licensed taxis and  private hire vehicles in South Ayrshire.

They will both have entrances facing out over the car park beside Boots and have attracted seven objections. Landowner Red Button is already quids in after getting permission to reduce the size of the car park and build a Costa coffee unit. But planners say only two car parking spaces will be lost in this application. Originally it was planned to build just one larger store on the loading area but permission has now lapsed. A report before next Thursday’s South Ayrshire Council planning committee says: “It’s considered the proposal will not have an adverse impact on the residential character or amenity of the locality. “Accordingly, the application is recommended for approval.” Objectors in Academy Street and Academy Court have hit out over traffic concerns, the impact on local homes, of servicing the other units and why the town needs more retail space when some units are empty. Resident Mark Inglis called for the entrance into the entire precinct to be shted to Portland Street. He said: “There are around  children who are being dropped off and picked up or making their own way to school or nursery and the additional traffic will increase the risk of signicant harm to children. “There is also a sheltered housing complex directly opposite the proposed development with some infirm and elderly people within, the additional traffic on Academy Street I believe will also pose a risk to them and their well being, and increased risk of accident and perhaps fatality.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilTroonAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"and-the-winner-of-pet-idol-2018-is","story":"AFTER months of voting, we can now reveal the winner of Pet Idol  is..... eight-year-old Alaskan Malamute, Ava.Readers of the Borderand our sister paper the Peeblesshire News voted in their hundreds for their favourite pet this year.And owner Sandra McConnell, who lives in Hall Street Innerleithen, is \"delighted\" to have scooped the pound prize and the coveted title.She told us: \"I am absolutely delighted Ava has won the competition.\"My friend Claire Mahon sent in the entry form for me as we just fancied giving it a go this year.\"We are very pleased people have voted for Ava ndash she is such a lovely dog, with a nice nature.\"Sandra, who is a night support worker at St Ronans House in Innerleithen, got Ava when she was a pup from a breeder in Kilmarnock.She added: \"I would like to thank everyone who voted.

This is a very concerning piece of news, especially given the fact that the Tesco bus also serves the health centre.ldquoIt comes at a time when we are being told that we need to use public transport more because of dire warnings about the impact of climate change and when massive house building will lead to gridlock unless newcomers can be persuaded onto buses.Mr Turner added: ldquoEast Lothian generally, and Musselburgh in particular, is now renowned for its excellent bus services so this announcement comes as a blow and runs counter to all that has been achieved on the public transport front in the last few of years.ldquoLetrsquos hope that the council, working with the operators, can come up with a proposal to replace the extremely useful Tesco bus, and in doing so letrsquos try to serve some places that are currently remote from buses ndash Edenhall Road and the Muckletts, for example, both had buses until a few years ago and theirwould, I am sure, be welcomed by elderly residents.ldquoI think the Tesco bus should be replaced by something very similar, perhaps marketed as the Musselburgh community bus. It should not just parallel other bus routes, which is what the Tesco bus does, but should serve some of the residential areas that are cut off from buses. Goose Green is another area remote from a bus route.A Tesco spokesperson said: ldquoWe have made the dficult decision to stop the provision of the T and T bus services to and from our Musselburgh Extra store.ldquoUnfortunately the services make a loss, which means we are no longer able to provide them.ldquoWe have worked with local bus providers to ensure that all affected areas will continue to have a bus link that connects them to our store, including a newly introduced  bus from Longniddry to Fort Kinnaird.ldquoOur priority now is to ensure our customers who use the bus are aware of our decision and of all these alternative routes so that they are able to plan their journeys.ldquoWe apologise for any inconvenience this causes.A spokesperson for East Lothian Council said: ldquoEast Lothian Council was notied of Tescorsquos intention to withdraw the T and T services in September and we are fully aware of the impact this may have on the local community. We actively engaged with local providers and Prentice coaches are implementing changes to the  service, which will start on October  from Longniddry to Fort Kinnaird via the Tesco turning area and will now mirror the times of the T T to allow connection from other services.ldquoOperators looked at the T  service the general conclusion was that a straight like-for-like service was not commercially viable due to the numbers using the service.ldquoThe council is not licensed to operate the running of service work and our own fleet is at full capacity however, we will continue to discuss options, which will include community buses as a way to support residents who are affected.Ross Prentice, managing director of Prentice Coaches Ltd, said: ldquoWe are starting a new bus service, the , on Monday.

She is originally from another European country but has made Haddington her home, with her husband and two wonderful children.Her explorations of nearby woods led her to discover an unusual grave amongst the trees. It is a grave of a horse, buried in the th century. It was this grave she had offered to show me. To get there we had a beautul walk along a secluded section of the banks of the Tyne. It was the trees I noticed first, of course, which were dotted along the banks of the river.Autumn was just then beginning to brush the trees with its colour, and it was one of those evenings when the setting sun seemed to take its time, bathing the land in bright streaks of orange light. Along the way, Marije paused and said: ldquoThis is my tree.It was a beech tree of signicant age, its branches arching over the Tyne, asfishing. She showed me her sitting place, underneath its embracing canopy. Here the roots curved to make a natural seat. Her older son spoke of seeing kingfishers, and sure enough, this was a perfect place to absorb the majesty of the Tyne as it flowed towards Haddington. Another beech of similar age grew close by. Their branches entwined, making it look like they were sisters holding hands.But I sensed then there was more to Marijersquos connection to this place, although I then had no idea just how powerful her story was.When we finally got to our destination in the woods further upriver, the light was too weak to penetrate the trees. The old grave of the horse was shrouded in darkness.Yet with the help of mobile torches we could view it, and for sure the grave was interesting and worth a story in its own right. I vowed to find out more about its background as we headed back to Marijersquos house in the dying embers of a sunset.When we reached her house we were treated to wonderful hospitality. It was then that Marije told her story of the beech tree.Not long ago she had been diagnosed with cancer. She faced the possibility of being taken by this cruel disease. Numbness and disbelief at first overcame her, then there was the realisation that le might be very short and she would have to leave her two young children.She walked to the beech tree soon after her diagnosis and sat cradled by its roots. Despite having family and friends whose love and support was invaluable, Marije explained it can also be a desperately lonely feeling. ldquoWe all know we canrsquot live forever, she told me, ldquobut to face the reality of my end at such a young age and with children was unbearable.ldquoI went on that walk to the tree in the most dire situation, she told me. ldquoI felt a connection as I sat under the tree, I really felt her old wisdom and energy.Her love for her young children is what gave her strength in the worst of times. The tree seemed to symbolise this powerful bond, its roots deeply holding it safe.ldquoPeople talk about mother nature, Marije said, ldquoand I understand why. When my hair fell out, I lsquogave it backrsquo to nature, underneath the beech. I know it makes me sound weird, but it really helped me.It is not weird, of course. Trees are full of wisdom, not in the sense of actual words but in the spiritual sense. Beech is said to be the matriarch of the wood, sometimes called the mother of the forest. It is a good listener. Our best ideas and inner reflections can come when we sit under the embrace of an old tree even science tells us this now.Sadly not everyone wins the fight against cancer, but thankfully Marije recovered after treatment. The experience has left her treasuring every single day and taking no sunrise for granted. And she is thankful to her beech tree, which was her companion and confidant in those times of emotional agony. It remains for her a place of contemplation and peace, where she can give thanks and absorb the joy of being alive.ldquoI cherish every day now in ways I didnrsquot before, she told me. ldquoI think it is important to allow our kids to feel the connection with nature. That means being in nature, and respecting it. After all, we are all part of it.This was the real story of that walk on that day a story of incredible bravery, pain, love and determination by a young mum I now have the privilege to call a friend."},{"url":null,"title":"labour-ties-bring-meeting-to-a-halt","story":"Prestonpans businessman Ferhan Ashiq had applied to increase the size of an alcohol display ndashand for a name change ndash at one of his stores.But Councillor Jim Goodfellowimmediately recused himself from the application because of his friendship with Mr Ashiq, who is a member of East Lothian Labour Party.After a short adjournment, Councillor Fiona Dugdale , convenor, also declared an interest.Remaining Labour councillor John McMillan, however, said he did not believe his relationship with Mr Ashiq, who has shops in Musselburgh and Prestonpans, could have an impact on his ability to make a decision, while Conservative councillor Jane Henderson said she did not know him.The boardrsquos legal adviser described the situation as ldquounusual but said the board was no longer quorate and Mr Ashiqrsquos application would have to be continued to the next licensing board for a decision.But a bemused Mr Ashiq noted: ldquoWhen it comes to the next meeting I will know most of the board members there.Legal adviser Carlo Grilli advised Mr Ashiq to send his father, whose name was on the application, and an agent instead.The application was to change the name of Mr Ashiqrsquos Prestonpans store on Redburn Road from Day-Today to Day Todayand increase the alcohol display from . square metres to . square metres."},{"url":null,"title":"rare-bottle-of-whisky-to-be-auctioned-for-combat-stress-charity","story":"It is one of only , matured in an American bourbon barrel for eight years, with a cask strength of  per cent alcohol.The auction is part of a fundraiser for Combat Stress, the veteransrsquo mental health charity, and is being organised by the music group the Flying Aspidistras ahead of their concert of remembrance, Now the Guns are Silent, at Gosford House on Sunday.The occasion will be a reflection on the harsh reality of war and the suffering felt beyond the battlefield.Kilchoman distillery on Islay has bottled this special single cask to coincide with the centenary of the end of the First World War.More poignantly, it is also to commemorate the sinking of two troopships, the SS Tuscania and the HMS Otranto, with the loss of nearly  men, in the waters around Islay in .Ailsa Fortune, the events organiser, said: \"The war affected every community in Scotland, from Islay to East Lothian.\"The end of any war leaves many broken lives.

This is a direct result of the Scottish Government slashing council funding over this period, with East Lothian Council having suffered cuts of around pound million in the last five years.ldquoEast Lothian Council has done its utmost to protect the budget.ldquoThe Scottish Government needs to recognise the impact its cuts are having and give local authorities the funding they need to protect services, including road maintenance.The county is currently covered by km of roads, ranging from class A routes to unclassied lanes.And an Annual Status and Options Report, produced on behalf of East Lothian Council, has revealed that  per cent are currently in need of repair.The report, which looks at the impact of future funding on network maintenance in the long term, warns that the current level of investment of pound.million a year will mean that more than  per cent of the roads will be in a state of disrepair in  yearsrsquo time.And it reveals that, as an asset, East Lothian Councilrsquos carriageways depreciate in value by poundmillion every year.It also found that nearly km of rural public roads in the county were in poor condition and needed immediate investigation and possible treatment.The report said: ldquoThe level of investment on public roads in East Lothian has not been sufficient to limit the decline in the overall condition of the network.It revealed that additional investment of pound.million over the next  years could signicantlyimprove the state of the roads, with fewer than  per cent likely to need repairs by the end of the decade.Peter Forsyth, asset manager for East Lothian Council, said that the recommendation for operating the carriageways following the report was to continue with the current level of investment.In a report to the councilrsquos policy and performance review committee, he said the costs of corrective treatments, in particular carriageway reconstruction, were ldquoprohibitive and a preventative treatment approach should ldquomitigate the need to invest signicantly.But he warned: ldquoShort-term under-investment could result in major long-term expenditure necessary to recty major defects which could have been addressed earlier.Councillor Jane Henderson , leader of the opposition, said: ldquoOur road infrastructure assets are vital and dficult decisions will need to be made.ldquoWithout investment now the amount of money needed in the future will be a greater problem the old expression of lsquoa stitch in time saves ninersquo was never so apt.ldquoThe decision on how much to spend on roads now will inevitably mean choices.

Irsquove no reason to touch anyone in that way.He said he had never been spoken to by park management about any complaints made against him and he was let go without any explanation.Following all the evidence, Sherf John Cook agreed to the defence motion to acquit Salinger on a charge of sexual assault on a woman which was alleged to have taken place at his previous employment at the Cakes  Shakes outlet in Musselburgh.The sherf also acquitted Salinger of a second alleged offence of making inappropriate comments and sexual gestures towards another woman at the same place.But the sherf told Salinger he was ldquosatisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he had sexually touched the two teenagers at Seton Sands and said to think otherwise would be ldquofancul.Sherf Cook added that the offences had been ldquodeliberate sexual assaults and not accidental and that the pots and pans excuse was ldquoinherently unlikely.Sherf Cook deferred full sentence on Salinger for the preparation of social work reports and a restriction of liberty order assessment.The sherf also placed Salinger on the sex offendersrsquo register for a period still to be decided.Salinger was found guilty, following a summary trial, of sexually assaulting a teenager by seizing her by the bottom and squeezing it at Seton Sands Holiday Park on an occasion between March  and May .He was also found guilty of pressing his body against a second girl, placing his hands on her waist, and rubbing his groin against her at the same location and between the same dates."},{"url":null,"title":"celebration-of-the-life-of-inspirational-north-berwick-teenager-held","story":"Reon McSherry, , who had battled leukaemia, sadly passed away last Thursday.His family said: ldquoReon was an inspiration to all who knew him and will be forever missed.Reon, of North Berwick, was diagnosed with leukaemia in April  and required a bone marrow transplant.

Young anyway, when the Old Man in our tiny kitchen tugging a stocking of skin from the tail of a fat-faced old monkfish chuckled at the raspy, sandpapery sullen-looking dogfish we had enthusiastically brought up from the beach.You could sell that as rock salmon, in some restaurants anyway, he said. And this, he added pointing to the firm white Monkfish tail, as prawn.He was a lover of all fish, was the old man, though we kids recoiled at the monsters of the deep that scuttled around the empty bath or were expertly filleted on the slab, but he wouldnrsquot have recognised the name stone bass. Simply because I donrsquot think the marketing people had invented it by then.Shade fish, salmon-bass or even meagre, apparently not being glamorous enough anymore. But he would have approved of what the Fish People Cafe have done to it tonight. Seared at such intense heat the skin is crisped, the meat underneath running from an appetising golden to creamy and juicy white.Debs has just said how much she is enjoying it and the deep, dark spinach it sits on. The fish Irsquom eating is from the actual genuine sea and not farmed ndash though fish have been farmed since pre-Roman times.My John Dory was landed at Fraserburgh, two more juicy fillets, lightly browned, a sea of peas and a spiky, interesting masala spiced shrimp butter to fire it punchily into le. Flawless.There were fat crumbed and deep fried batons of monkfish to start, more glamorous than prawn nowadays, then a smoky fishcake with paprika mayo, lime and caper berries.Luca polished off a bowl of marinated anchovies, boosted I suppose by the Fish Cafe Kitchen, with the addition of chilli lemon and parsley. A very good and very confidently prepared meal.Irsquove reviewed this cafe before, squeezed in as it is beside the underground station on Scotland Street, all glass front, polished wood and on this chill November school night warmed by a glowing storage heater right under our table.I think its the same waiter too, calm, relaxed and friendly. He tipped us off as we came in not to park on the pavement outside the tube station or wersquod get a ticket.The restaurant gets its fish from its own fish shop which is also squeezed into this little stretch in the shadow of possibly the worldrsquos most expensivemulti-storey car park.Wersquore here tonight simply because of the number of people who have said to me in recent months how much they enjoy coming to the Fish People Cafe, and that stone bass is usually mentioned in the same sentence. So thatrsquos a double bonus really.Itrsquos very unusual in Scotland, even today, for any restaurant to maintain a buzz over the years and amidst the endless wave of kiss-me-quick new openings. Itrsquos even more unusual in Scotland, where too many restaurants still seem to want to sell what everyone  does, for a restaurant to take a single dish and make it their own.One thing that hasnrsquot really changed since the Old Manrsquos day and something he used to regularly marvel at is how few genuinely good fish restaurants there are.Donrsquot get me wrong. At the Fish People Cafe they clearly know how good they are, and itrsquos reflected in the prices. Fish shop next door or not. That fish cake to start was pound., probably too much in my view, the monkfish batons a tenner and the John Dory pound.. Thatrsquos top end pricing. In a cafe.But as I like to repeat ad tedium: the correct price is the price people will pay and come back again. This place has managed to top that by not only getting customers to come back again but also having them rave to all and sundry in between about just how good it was. Impressive.The Fish People Cafea Scotland StreetGlasgow  Menu: Itrsquos all about the fish seared stone bass, John Dory from Fraserburgh, monkfish from Tarbert ndash a fish restaurant for grown-ups.  Service: One waiter smoothly, professionally and in a relaxed and unobtrusive manner running the whole front of house. Excellent.  Atmosphere: Itrsquos a small place with a high bar, hard surfaces, lots of glass, wooden tables. It shouldnrsquot work but somehow therersquos a glittery charm to it.  Price: The best fish restaurant in Glasgow can charge the top fish prices, easy to hit a tenner for a starter and nudge pound for a main. But worth it.  Food: That seared stone bass is making a name for itself, faultless handling of the John Dory with a great masala spiced butter and peas. Excellent.

I noticed it one day when I went to collect my son. This would have been around .I mentioned it to a friend. She and I were in the same womens group and a friend of hers had died from breast cancer. The brass plaque beside the tree was mottled and not very well looked after.One day I saw my friend cleaning it. She told me that her friend who died had been active in the feminist economic movement and she was cleaning the plaque in her memory. The Glasgow Womens Library got involved and they campaigned for it to be Tree of the Year in .The Suffragette Oak makes me think about the forgotten history of these women: the hard work and striving that went unnoticed. Thanks to these women who went that extra mile, we now have the vote ndash we have a voice.The tree was badly damaged in a storm last year and the council had to make it safe. The bits cut off were given to Glasgow Womens Library and they are making it into things to sell to raise funds. Isnt that lovely Another special tree was one I saw at a holiday place we rented at Achnacloich, near Oban.The gardens there have this amazing redwood that looks like a gigantic hand.The reason it looks like a hand was that when it was planted a rabbit kept nibbling the bud in the middle. Every time this rabbit nibbled it, another shoot would come out the side. It was one of the first redwoods to be grown in Scotland.We were staying there with loads of kids and it was the best climbing tree in the world ndash they would get lost in it.You would be sitting outside having a cup of tea in the morning and suddenly hear a wee voice from up in the tree asking: \"Whats your favourite flavour of crisps \"Carole Baxter, Beechgrove Garden presenterI LOVE rowan trees. All the species are beautul. There is such a range of colourful berries and they are a hardy plant. In my garden in Aberdeenshire I have eight ieties including cashmiriana, Joseph Rock and the native rowan.I have enjoyed the rowan for its berries as long as I can remember, certainly from a young age. It is a value-for-money plant: you have the blossom and fruits, lovely foliage and great autumn colour.People perhaps arent aware of the range of species and named ieties. You dont need to have the one that has the orange-red berries you can get white, yellow and pink berries.There are some small ones as well, such as Sorbus reducta which is ideal for a rock garden. We have that one at Beechgrove as well as vilmorinii, which has pink berries with almost blueish foliage. Those were my plant choices.What is interesting is that birds tend to home in on the red and orange berries to start off with so,you have cashmiriana with its white berries, it tends to hold the berries a bit longer.This year has been particularly good for the fruits because we had a cold spring and it gradually got warmer, so we didnt have the frost and the blossoms werent damaged, which was then followed by a nice hot summer.It is nothing to do with the fact we are going to have a hard winter as people often say ndash thats an old wives tale ndash it is the fact that we have had a good season.Episodes of Beechgrove Garden are available on BBC iPlayer until November Gordon Buchanan, wildle filmmakerSCOTS pine has been my favourite tree from a young age. I grew up on Mull and I have always loved woodland. I spent a lot of time as a kid walking through the woods.One walk we did took us a mile or so out of Tobermory. When you are eight or nine, even just going a couple of miles out of town feels like you are exploring the other side of the planet.It was while out walking that I first saw a Scots pine. It was one of those classic old \"granny\" pines with so much character, the limbs were all twisted ndash there was one that came out at a right angle and shot skywards.This Scots pine stood among mixed birch and there was no other tree around it that looked the same. It seemed so exotic and out of place. Your eye was drawn to it.As I got older and spent time in the Cairngorms and Abernethy Forest, I learned that much of Scotland was covered in forests filled with these trees. I thought it was the most magical habitat.The tree then became a symbol for all the wildle that you find living in those forests. I have spent time filming capercaillie as well as red deer, red squirrels and pine martens among the trees.Weirdly, now I have travelled further than just a couple of miles out of town, whenever I see Scots pine, they dont look exotic to me. I have recently been working in Russia where there is mixed birch woodland and what I call \"Caledonian Forest\" ndash this reminder of home.My love of Scots pine is undiminished but they have gone from being a symbol of the exotic to something very familiar.A couple of years ago I was working in a mountainous region of Turkey and you could almost have been in the Cairngorms. It was very similar. I felt at home.Animal Families and Me with Gordon Buchanan is at Kirkintilloch Town Hall on November , Brunton Theatre in Musselburgh on November  and Rothes Halls in Glenrothes on November Kirsty Wark, broadcasterA TREE is a marker, something you look out for at a particular time of year. My Japanese maple in the garden, for example, you just know when the leaves are going to turn, be vivid and then flutter to the ground.The yellow-berried rowan is one of my favourite trees. I love lime trees because I think they are so vivid in the landscape.Trees represent a constancy. Planting trees is entirely altruistic because, unless they are fast-growing, you are never in your letime going to get the real benefit of them. I love the fact that parks were laid out by the Victorians ndash and even much earlier with Lancelot \"Capability\" Brown.After my father died, we planted a rowan where he loved to fish most, which was Kendoon Loch in Galloway. That was in . It is beside the water and Im not sure it is the most fertile place for it, but it is hanging on in there. I went to see it last week.In Celtic mythology the rowan symbolises courage and protection. That is why you will often see old houses with rowans planted in the front garden by the gate. We planted a red rowan for Dad, but I really like a yellow rowan too.I used to know the names of all the trees because I was in the Brownies. I dont know them all now. I love walking in the forest up to Glenashdale Falls and Whiting Bay on Arran, those specic spaces where you are surrounded by flora and fauna.Sir John Lister-Kaye, author and naturalistTHERE is an ash tree that is one of the biggest trees in the garden here at House of Aigas near Beauly and almost certainly the oldest ndash it is possibly  years old. It is right beside the house.Ashwas a very valuable timber throughout the th and th centuries. It was used for all sorts of things ndash implement handles, cart frames, furniture.It is a very good, close-grained hardwood. Very few ash trees ever survived more than  or  years, perhaps  years, because they were too valuable. Highlanders were not well off and it was a good way of making money.There are very few old ash trees in the Highlands. This one has survived simply because it is so close to an th-century house and I think the owners must have said many times: \"Dont fell that tree, we like it\". And so it survived.What is wonderful about it is that it has survived for so long and that means it has seen so much. For instance, it will have seen Bonnie Prince Charlie come through raising the clans which, of course, culminated in the Battle of Culloden.It saw the folk mourning after the loss of Culloden and it saw Cholmondeleys regiment come and camp here and then burn the tacksmans house down right beside it. The tree must have been scorched by that fire. The Frasers who were living here at the time were all murdered in May .It has witnessed some real horrors. Later, it will have witnessed the Highland Clearances, people pulling out and leaving for the New World. It will have witnessed the Victorians arriving with their grand ideas and turning the place into a sporting estate.This \"loftier ash\", as I call it ndash because that is what Fraxinus excelsior means ndash has seen a lot of history and for that reason alone it is a very valuable tree. In my book Song of the Rolling Earth: A Highland Odyssey, I dedicated a whole chapter to it.Let me read you a bit from it: \"The ash tree has witnessed it all. I stand at its foot. Great roots have corrugated the ground around it with broad woody thongs undulating outwards in a circular plate of tangle and deep grip, roots that trail far across the lawns in every direction.\"It is solid, purposeful, locked in. Its trunk writhes with power. It is all heart. My fullest reach, both arms stretched, extends to less than a third of its circumference an inconsequential hug leaving me in awe of its rigid grandeur.\"Its bark is deeply grooved with long vertical ripples of hardness like a throng of ribbed buttresses all heading upward, shoring up its might, shedding veils of green dust at my touch.\"The bark fissures draw in treecreepers: those tiny mouse-like birds that dash upwards in little jerky pulses, defying gravity. Then, giving in to the earths pull, they flick down again, back to start, like a game of snakes and ladders never won.\"I am enthralled by this tree, rapt. Every time I stand here, I shrink it grows. I age it shrugs off such foibles and just goes on expanding into a thousand shaded alleys. What is  minutes or a week when you are  years old \"Song of the Rolling Earth: A Highland Odyssey by Sir John Lister-Kaye is published by Abacus, priced pound.. Visit aigasPaul Murton, Grand Tours of Scotland presenterA TREE that I have always admired is a rowan that grows from a huge boulder. It is one that everyone will have seen as they are driving north up the A to Fort William.Just as you get to Rannoch Moor and are climbing up above Loch Tulla, there on the left-hand side of the road is a massive boulder left over from the Ice Age.There is a crack in it where, for many years, this amazing little rowan tree has been growing.It has been blasted by the elements and cant be getting many nutrients from the rock, so I dont know how it survives.There is something quite symbolic about it. I have filmed it several times for programmes over the years. It also appears in one of my favourite books, Mountaineering in Scotland by WH Murray.In fact, the first time I saw this rowan tree was in WH Murrays book when I was  or .I hitchhiked from Dunoon to Glencoe to go climbing and I remember seeing it in the flesh and thinking: \"Oh, thats the one in the book\".That was exciting because I felt I was on the trail of real mountaineers. Any mountaineer who had been up to Glencoe going back decades will have seen that wee tree.How did it end up there  Perhaps a crow or a raven carried a berry, dropped it and it then got stuck in a crack where there was enough nutrients for roots to grow. It must be at least  years old.Im a bit of a secret tree hugger. I planted a lot of trees at my mothers place in Argyll years ago and it is nice to admire how much they have grown. There are a couple of chestnut trees, beech trees and Scots pine.Episodes of Grand Tours of Scotlands Lochs are available on BBC iPlayer until November . The series will be repeated on BBC in Greg McHugh, actorI GREW up in Morningside in Edinburgh and at the bottom of the garden were steps down to a wood. There was a mud road with a wall and trees behind it. I loved spending time there.All the kids in my street would go down and play. It was an incredible place. I know people think of Morningside as being posh, but this wasnt a kept space. It was completely wild and overgrown. My mum would always shout as I went out the door: \"Dont go near the giant hogweed!\"It was this little hidden spot in the city. When I was in third year at school, I did a history project on it and learned that this was the old \"poorhouse\" road that had grown over.To think of the families that would have walked up and down there, the trees have been witness to all of that.We would gather conkers, climb and make rope swings among the trees and put old doors down over the stream. On fireworks night there would be a big bonfire and all the families in the street went along.One of my brothers mates stood on a wasps nest and was incredibly badly stung. Afterwards it gave spending time among the trees a new element of risk. The thing that sticks in my mind is that, while during the day it was our playground, we would never dare go down there at night.The inaugural Scottish Tree Festival organised by Discover Scottish Gardens features more than  tree-themed events and runs until December .

I was a cook for some timersquo.\"TB or not TBMOVING on from the war, a reader who served in Aden was on the troopship taking him there when they were given a lecture on keeping healthy, in which they were warned that half the local women had VD and the other half had TB. \"So we looked for women with a cough,\" he told us.Vote for itMANY Scots also served in Afghanistan in recent times, and a ing soldier told us his platoon was going out on patrol when one of the grumbling troops jokingly told the officer: \"We took a vote and wed rather go to the canteen.\" \"Ill explain,\" their officer replied. \"Were here to defend democracy, not practise it.Wheely goodANOTHER soldier who served in Afghanistan told us one of his mates got such a slagging for putting up a picture of his much-loved Peugeot hatchback with alloy wheels while all the rest of the squad sported pictures of their girlfriends.The car chap eventually snapped back: Laughyou want ndash at least my car will still be there when I get back.\"As he comes from Milton, that was a pretty big boast,\" says our contact.Baby talkA MUM whose soldier husband served in Afghanistan told us her five-year-old daughter askedit was not about time she had a baby brother. Mum told her it was a nice idea, but perhaps they should talk about it with dad when he came home from his tour of duty.\"Why dont we just surprise him \" asked the little one.Doggone itA SOLDIER back from Afghanistan was proud of the fact that he had earned his corporal stripes and suggested that the picture of him as a private patting the now-deceased family dog on top of his parents television should be updated.His confidence was shattered somewhat when his mum replied: \"Well, you see, son, we really keep the picture there as a memento of Buster.DisarmingOUR request for National Service stories reminded an Edinburgh reader of reporting to RAF Bridgnorth in Shropshire for his basic training. \"I still remember square bashing,\" he told us, \"and the drill corporal shouting thatyou made an error, he would pull off your arm and beat you to death with the soggy end.\"Bit of a charlieFINALLY, entertainer Andy Cameron swore to us that a slightly deaf private doing his National Service was on guard duty one night and shouted out: \"Who goes there \" Continued Andy: \"On hearing the reply, Army Chaplain approaching he fired his rle.

Now we are contaminating the memory of those who performed the greatest act of love by turning that which symbolises it into something shrill and shallow.Once, the poppy was something to be worn quietly and discreetly or to be placed gently and without fanfare at a graveside or a war memorial. Now it has become something to be wielded and brandished to be proclaimed and announced while self-appointed tribunes scan the masses looking for signs of sullenness and dissent: these being punishable by a visit to the scaffold of the st century: a snatched iPhone picture and exposure on social media.In st century Britain the poppy has too often become a clashing symbol of ision signying your allegianceto something much shallower than the mere desire to liberate others.To wear it is to be accused in the eyes of some of endorsing wars fought for darker purposes and not to wear it is deemed to be treacherous and disrespectful and of giving succour to Britainrsquos enemies, both real and imagined. It is lamentable when we ought only to be lamenting the sacrices of those who fell for something few of them understood.Remembrance Sunday has now expanded to become a season which starts around September and lasts until the first week of Advent. No-one dare risk appearing on television during this period without sporting a poppy lest they bring down the ire of the patriotic militias who swing into action at this time. In Scotland every senior football team must have the poppy stitched into the fabric of their jerseys and a minutersquos silence must be observed at every ground. Reporters and newspapers driven by agendas other than commemorating the sacrices at the Somme or Passchendaele take gleeful delight in hounding the dissidents.Until relatively recently, you bowed your head and uttered a silent prayer or paused to observe a two-minute silence at your place of workNovember  fell on a weekday. On the nearest Sunday you watched the Queen place a wreath at the cenotaph or perhaps gathered at your local war memorial to remember the members of your own family who had fallen. Now it has become distorted and twisted into a festival. With each passing year the poppies get bigger and the displays become more inordinately bizarre. This little flower with nothing to declare but its God-given colour finds itself pressed into service in huge and preening mosaics and installations which mock the idea of modest self-sacrice it once represented.The unconscionable decision to include illegal wars in this commemoration has made it dficult for some to wear the poppy. The refusal to acknowledge this has become a dismal characteristic of Remembrance. It is a betrayal of all that the poppy is supposed to represent. It has also become a recruitment tool for the British armed forces, accompanied by bizarre displays of military hardware and fed by the BBC which spends fortunes sending their reporters to the killing fields to give us whispered despatches without any ounce of context.Rarely is there any attempt to expose the futility of the First World War and the way that Europersquos royal families aided by the aristocrats and industrialists for whom war is always a Klondyke conspired to make it happen. In other places the poppy and Remembrance Sunday has been hijacked by darker forces which seek to manipulate the emotion of it all into proof of loyalty to Britain. This will be ramped up steadily to fuel a hostile environment in the dangerous post-Brexit years.Yet, there are more benign and understandable reasons to explain this countryrsquos recent national obsession with making a grim pantomime of the poppy. The left would do well to think about these and reflect upon them. In a time of approaching chaos and during this period when old certainties and traditional ideas of church, community and family are crumbling itrsquos natural to look for something that represents stability and permanence and to embrace it.I once wondered at how our emotional attachment to the events of the two world wars seemed to increase rather than diminish with the passing of the years. Yet itrsquos not really surprising. The values of self-sacrice, courage and unquestioning loyalty are no longer rewarded in st century Britain. Instead they are mocked. The legacy of Margaret Thatcher which is proclaimed by the principal architects of Brexit is a rebuke to self-sacrice and loyalty. In their place have come self-enrichment at the expense of all  financial self-gratication and betrayal of your country by depriving the exchequer of taxes. In all of this the poppy increasingly becomes a reminder of humanity at its very best. And perhaps as the signs of humanity at its worst gather it is natural to cling to the poppy more tightly even at the risk of making of it a graven image and a  idol.Irsquoll wear a poppy this weekend and Irsquoll recall once more the words of a good German soldier, Erich Maria Remarque from his novel, All Quiet on the Western Front. ldquoBut now, for the first time, I see you are a man like me. I thought of your hand-grenades, of your bayonet, of your rle now I see your we and your face and our fellowship. Forgive me, comrade. We always see it too late. Why do they never tell us that you are poor devils like us, that your mothers are just as anxious as ours, and that we have the same fear of death, and the same dying and the same agony ndash forgive me, comrade how could you be my enemy "},{"url":null,"title":"tom-gordon-tough-choices-loom-over-public-services","story":"Others are irreconcilable from the start. Before she headed for the British Irish Council on the Isle of Man yesterday, Nicola Sturgeon put Brexit firmly in this last category. Theresa May, she said, was heading for disaster by promising too many things to too many factions, and they could never all work out.Mrs May is not the only one prone to excess promise-making, of course. A report from Fraser of Allander Institute this week highlighted the many promises made by Ms Sturgeon, and her growing dficulty in keeping them.Its jump-out statistic was on health. Day-to-day resource spending on the NHS was % of the Scottish budget at the start of devolution years ago. By the end of this parliament it will be almost %.This partly reflects necessity ndash there is rising demand from a growing population, particularly the elderly population, but also ambitious political commitments to protect health from austerity, plus a boost from the recent UK budget.The Fraser of Allander report coincided with a related one from Holyroodrsquos finance committee. MSPs said there was a ldquodemographic risk to the budget. Namely, lots of old folk, not enough taxpayers.This is a familiar theme in Scottish politics. There have been warnings about a lsquodemographic timebombrsquo for years. But the Holyrood report said the fuse had now been lit.From  onwards, Scotlandrsquos working age population, the  to  year-olds whose income taxes account for around a third of the budget, will start to fall. Meanwhile, Scotlandrsquos elderly population will accelerate from , faster than in the rest of the UK. The number of over-s will double by .It therefore makes sense that the health budget is expanding. But healthrsquos insatiable consumption of public funds has consequences.Itrsquos not fair to characterise it as a zero-sum fight with other services over cash. Spending on employment, education, skills, and alleviating poverty can lead to long-term improvements in health and so diminish demand. Itrsquos complicated.But the focus on health since  has undeniably been accompanied by a % real terms fall in the second largest slice of public spending, local government. Education is down %, environmental services %, roads and transport %, culture and libraries %, and planning and development a mind-boggling %.Nor is health the only protected service. Besides promising to increase resource spending on the NHS by poundbn to pound.bn by , the Scottish Government has also pledged to maintain the police budget, put an extra pound.bn into doubling nursery care, put hundreds of millions more into closing the attainment gap in schools, and have more generous devolved benefits. And while it has been quick to trumpet the promises, it has been near silent about the challenges other services are facing.When ministers published their five-year Fiscal Outlook earlier this year, it implied spending on non-priority areas would fall by % in just three years. The UK Budget, with poundm of extra funding under the Barnett formula, has reduced that to %, but it shows the brutal squeeze that ministers, sotto voce, were ready to countenance.The Fraser of Allander says it canrsquot go on. It recommends ldquoradical change, a phrase guaranteed to strike fear into the heart of even the most outwardly radical politician.One idea, aof tuition fees, is a radioactive non-starter. But others are more practical. Like giving councils the power to set their own taxes. Not just a tourist tax, but a tax on employer car parking spaces, which has raised revenue and cut congestion in Nottingham.The thinktank also floats a tax on vacant land and an overhaul of council tax, which is increasingly detached from house prices. There hasnrsquot been a revaluation since it was introduced  years ago.What about a national social care fund to help our ageing population  The Welsh Government recently published a report on the idea. Iniduals would pay between % and % extra income tax according to age and means as an insurance against social care in old age.Costs would be spread fairly across the generations, and the benefits would be linked to peoplersquos contributions, so last-minute retirees from outside the country couldnrsquot piggyback on it.ldquoThe fact that Wales is having such a discussion, but Scotland is not, suggests that we need to up our game in Scotland with regard to the level and quality of the debate, the Fraser of Allander says pointedly.The current break between elections at Holyrood was supposed to be the time when MSPs were going to take on these big issues.Brexit has understandably got in the way, sucking the oxygen and adrenaline from the body politic.But even Brexit cannot go on forever. The debate over how to pay for public services ndash what to tax and what to cut ndash is inescapable.As Ms Sturgeon also told the Prime Minister yesterday: ldquoIt is time to be straight with people."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/9012574.jpg?type=article-full","title":"armistice-100-in-their-own-words-letters-from-the-front-line","story":"And while the historic picture of the war is one of unremitting bleakness and destruction, two servicemen ndash one an officer, one a private ndash who wrote to The Herald in  shared another side of the war.Writing anonymously, both talked about learning to live under constant shelling and machine gun fire until it became routine, and the bonds they formed with their squadmates - and even the enemy.The front was a blasted wasteland:The conflict that would never end for so many survivorsThe officer wrote: ldquoHere, amid rain and mud, with over two feet of water to wade through in places in the trenches, with trench walls and parapets falling down with the rain, everyone is happy and cheerful and anxiously assist every one and share with the others in a way that makes one feel that Brotherhood here is reality.

Well, my comrade, here I am sitting in my ldquodug out after after our evening meal, and before I lie downI just want to have a few quiet minutesrsquo chat with you. I canrsquot quite make up my mind at times whether this really is War or only a gigantic circus. Tonight, of course, is the great night for fireworks at home, and out heremdashno doubt that they might show that they really did remember the th of Novembermdashthe brigade on our left arranged to send up dozens of red rockets at . p.m., to be followed by rapid rle and machine-gun firemdash in the hopes of catching the Germans lining their parapets. Well, at . I went out into the most perfect starry night I have seen since Loos, I stood looking up at the Plough and Pole Star when the rockets began. They really were very pretty, but were answered by dozens flares and star shells from the Germans that showed up the country all around. Then the rles and machine guns cracked out for a few minutes. Thousands of rounds were loosed off and probably no one was hurt. It is perfectly marvellous how much lead and old iron can fly about and how little damage it does.I have been in these trenches since Tuesday and daily we must have had thousands of rounds of rle and machine-gain fire and from a dozen twenty shells mdash high explosive and shrapnel - sent over us and amongst us and not a single one of mv men has been hit and no harm has been done. It is rather wonderful, but makes one think about the appalling waste there is in war. What an amount of money is spent on all that ammunition! How little harmmdashcomparativelymdashit does! If all this money could have been spent on social work, what Heaven we might have had earth today! And yet mdashI wonder.One learns much here with these death-dealing missiles around that I fancy we could never learn at home. Somehow I feel it is all for good. We are getting lessons and experiences brought to us out here that a letime social work couldnrsquot teach to home. Loos has made men the more or less happy-go-lucky lads I brought out here. It has taught them what Brotherhood is. It has brought it to the surface and cemented it as nothing  could. And le altogether has new, fuller meaning to us. We have been through the crucible, have looked Death m the face and have learned that you can do that without any fear but the most wonderful calm and peace. The experience was awful yet subline.While shells were dropping amongst us and around us we were conscious of the most wonderful uplting, and ldquoPeace, perfect Peace, were the words that seemed to breathe through me with the most wonderfully calming effect. And here, amid rain and mud, with over two feet of water to wade through in places in the trenches, with trench walls and parapets falling down with the rain, everyone is happy and cheerful and anxious assist ever other one and share with the others in a way that makes one feel that Brotherhood here is reality. There is no lack of discipline, but very strong bonds of real affection amongst us. Oh, it has been grand experiencemdashrain, mud, wet, and everything. I wouldnt have missed it all for anything. And yet I long to home. I long for the war to endmdashto be finished with it all. And inside myself I feel it will end when the lessons it is meant teach are learnt, are brought right home to the world largemdashand not till then, All things work together for good. Yes this ghastly war, too. It has taught us many lessons: through and through the loss of loved ones it will teach millions of others. This, I am sure of, that war on this scale can never tried again. You could no more get these menmdashregulars or volunteersmdashto enlist for another war like this than fly in the air, although they would notmdashin spite of thatmdashthink of giving up now till this war is through. To us it seems impossible that such another war could be it is too ghastly to think of.National Service  Yes all should serve the nation all should, serve the yet wider Brotherhood of humanity. But Conscription  Never. I was opposed to conscription before. In am ten times more opposed to it now. If these men had not come into this willingly they wouldnt have learned the lessons they have. But heres the Post Corporal come for mv letters, so I must stop.All good be with you. May you be richly blessed my friend, in your splendid work.Privatersquos LetterDear sir, as a reader, not to say admirer, of your paper The Herald, I think it is my duty to inform you of an incident which I was a party to and which occurred in the trenches in Flanders. In a few words, the Germans and us have shaken hands it is no lie and not in the least exaggerated. I will try and explain how all came about. Thu enemyand us are only fteen yards apart in this particular point. We have been conversing with each other for a few days now, but on the morning of November  we were a little more brave, showing our headswe then showed more of our bodies until they and us were completely visible. They invited us over and we invited them, and after a bit of arguing from each side advanced they shook hands, and immediately a German officer rushed forward and the hand of the British Tommy that had stepped forward bravely. They cheered and we did likewise, and, Mr. Editor, believe me, I never felt so delighted in my existence.They gave us cigarettes but refused ours, as they said they had plenty of tabac and cigarettes, and I might mention they looked cleaner and better cleaner and better clad than us. A few remarks passed by them are as follows: ldquoWe no shoot, you no shoot ldquoWar no good ldquoBombs no good. After about an hour of this their officer asked us to go in some of our chaps didnrsquot seem to like the idea, so he ordered one of his men to fire a shot, but of course well over our heads. I expect the reason he had to do this was some Von Gabberstown would be visiting and then no doubt it would be serious for himthe big unrsquos heard about this. Now what will the English Press critics think when they know that these men are the very people who were anxious to cut us upndash the Baians  Itrsquos a clear smack in the mouth for those who are trying to turn the English race against the whole German race, and it proves that the German soldier is only as bad as he is made by his oppressors. It shows that your paper is the only paper worth reading, the only paper of principle, and the only thing that preaches the proper thing ndash Right before might.I must now close, so wishing you, your staff and paper every success. I have pleasure in beinga supporter of your ideals.Driving the Germans Back, A bitter Struggle: A Mossend Manrsquos Experience.Dr. Barron, House, is in receipt of the following from S. S. James Mlsquollwraith, , C Coy., Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, British Expeditionary Force:mdashJust a few lines to let you lot know that I am still pushing along as usual. I hope you are well. I expect you are kept pretty busy and will not have much more time than ourselves at present. The other night we had a pretty lively time here. I never witnessed anything like it since the war started: It was a pure picture. The heavens were illuminated for miles along the whole battle-front. I tell you for truth that a worm could not have escaped instant death. However, we are beginning to enjoy it, with the sound of the guns never out of our ears.When we are having our little bit of meat we have to stand outside in the open, becauseyou go into a house you get twice tile quantity you should have in your mess tin it is filled with dirt or dust. The people here go about their work the same as in peace time. They are ploughing the land for their crops as usual, while the shells are screaming over their heads like seagulls. They are, like us, are getting used to it.There is not much improvement as far as I can see but for the last eight or ten days there have been some bitter engagements fought with the same results to the Germans. Our men are far the better class in a hand-to-hand struggle, and there is nothing earth to stand against our rle fire. It is, like our bayonet work, most deadly. It is horrible after a bayonet charge. I would as soon shoot for a year as use the baronet for an hour. It must, be done and the Germans must get it. We canrsquot, nor will not, show any sympathy to a German, matter what rank holds. We are fed up them. Germans Left out of .Thrilling Narrative from the Front. We are in receipt the following from Private John Mclnrue, nd Sherwood Foresters:mdashlt gives me great pleasure to write you this, and I trust it gives you the same to read it. As I- have started to communicate with many of my old friends through your paper I hope they are all enjoying the very best health as this leaves me in the pink. The weather is on its best behaviour, and I can tell you it is a treat out here at present. When have a holiday out of the trenches and have walk about this-mdashwhich was once a beautulmdashtown, it is most refreshing.To describe the town would be nearly impossible. Just imagineyou started on walk from the North British Station, Bellshill, to Holy town, and you met nothing but soldiers, and every house had its windows smashed, every second or third house had large holes in the walls made by the ldquocoalboxes, in the middle of the street engineers filling up the holes in the roadway, the churches and schools and all prominent buildings completely lowered to the ground, and week in, week out, you are in the midst of cannons roaring from morn till night. It makes our blood boil sometimes when we think of the ruin caused the Germans. It is not the towns alone that catch all this no all the villages, and even he farmhouses, get the German ldquocoalbox, but the time is not far distant when we will bring them to their senses.I think one of the finest sights I ever saw in my le was on the th of this month, about - p.m., but, before letting you know about it, I must tell you that both our and the German artillery fire very little during the night because the flare of the gun, which could be seen for miles, would give their positions away. On this occasion, we were busy numbering our sentries off for the night, when, all of a sudden, about two hundred cannons started from over the lines and our guns started in answer. Thu night was pitch dark, and  to  miles off the enemy thought they had discovered some weak spot our chain trenches, so their Infantry made a charge.Up went the searchlights, star shells, and rockets, and the shells exploding in the air. It was a sight. We would have enjoyed it better had we known that there would be no casualty list, but there was nevertheless, was a sight I will never forget. I was saying, their Infantry made a charge but they didnrsquot get through.  got theof our comradesrsquo trenches, and only  survived so they paid dearly for the mistake they made in thinking there was any weak links in our chain. But, mind you, the Germans are no weaklings they are just a little obstinate, and think that all things earth should belong to them, but they can get no further. In the place where, our regiment is, I could stake my le that the whole German Army could not get through in daylight, and, mind you, we are only  yards from their trenches. But supposing there was no opposition to them, it would take them about three hours to cover the distance.I cannot mention the name the town we are in, but it is, or was, a very large city, just about as large as Glasgow. I donrsquot want to take up too much of your valuable time at present, I intend on sending you another note shortly.

President Maithripala Sirisena announced the dissolution of Parliament effective from midnight on Friday.It said the names of candidates will be called before November  and the new Parliament is to convene on January .Sri Lanka has been in a crisis since October , when Mr Sirisena fired his prime minister, Ranil Wickremesinghe, and replaced him with former strongman Mahinda Rajapaksa.Both say they command a majority in Parliament and had been expected to face the -member house on Wednesday after it was suspended for about  days.Foreign Minister Sarath Amunugama told reporters that the reason for the president to dissolve Parliament was the need to go to the people to find a resolution to the crisis.ldquoOn the th there was to be a lot of commotion and unparliamentary activities sponsored by the speaker, Mr Amunugama said.ldquoThe speaker was not planning to act according to the constitution and standing orders of Parliament.Mr Sirisenarsquos supporters had been irked by Speaker Karu Jayasuriyarsquos announcement that he was going to call for a vote for either party to prove their support.ldquoThe dissolution clearly indicates that Mr Sirisena has grossly misjudged and miscalculated the support that he might or could secure to demonstrate support in the Parliament, said Bharath Gopalaswamy, director at US-based analyst group Atlantic Councilrsquos South Asia Centre.ldquoAt the end of the day, he is a victim of his own homegrown crisis.Mr Wickremesinghe has insisted his firing is unconstitutional. He has refused to vacate his official residence and demanded that Parliament be summoned immediately to prove he had support among its members.Tensions had been building between Mr Sirisena and Mr Wickremesinghe for some time, as the president did not approve of economic reforms introduced by the prime minister.Mr Sirisena has also accused Mr Wickremesinghe and another Cabinet member of plotting to assassinate him, a charge Mr Wickremesinghe repeatedly denied.Mr Sirisena was critical of investigations into military personnel accused of human rights violations during Sri Lankarsquos

lost a re-election bid in  amid accusations of nepotism, corruption and wartime atrocities.Mr Wickremesinghersquos camp is likely to contest Mr Sirisenarsquos move because of constitutional provisions stating a Parliament cannot be dissolved until four-and-a-half years after its election.The current Parliament was elected in August ."},{"url":null,"title":"armistice 100 centenary celebrations at

Jim therefore tried to find historical accuracy as far as possible by researching contemporary documents and manuscripts that held vital evidence.\"There are certain liberties you can take, like for example the drumming used by the armies preparing for battle and that is often for dramatic effect.\"The film is billed as a \"true David versus Goliath story\" of how the great th-century \"outlaw king\" Robert the Bruce used cunning and bravery to defeat the larger and better-equipped occupying English army.At the films debut during the Toronto Film Festival last year there were a few raised eyebrows when American actor Chris Pine, who plays Bruce, appeared full-frontal naked in one scene.Directed by Oscar-nominated film-maker David Mackenzie the epic was shot in ious Scottish locations throughout  and Jim spent six months working on the diegetic soundtrack.Jim said: \"I had a meeting with David Mackenzie just a few weeks before the shoot and none of this particular aspect was planned.

We all love it.\"Gill Arrowsmith and Shirley Sinclair both thought the painting was \"fantastic\" while Annemarie Simpson thought that a similar venture in Wick would help tackle the \"towns eyesore\" buildings.While on that subject, one dissenting voice condemned the piece and said there was a \"masterpiece eyesore now in Wilson Street thanks to Caithness Horizons\".Beauty is, of course, in the eye of the beholder.The mural depicts a portrait of Thursos renowned botanist and geologist Robert Dick surrounded by a kaleidoscopic representation of the CHMAG facade and the scientists specimen collection.The bold use of line and colour based on modern urban graffiti cannot fail to be noticed just like the mural on nearby Tollemache House but is sited in a much less conspicuous space ndash the gallerys car park.CHMAGs curator Merran Gunn, who was instrumental in commissioning Delaye to create the work, said the artist had also spray painted a wall within the building as part of a show running called Graffito.His earlier piece has an explosive anime style figure punching out of the wall toward the viewer.\"Marcs work is bold and vibrant, electric colours jostle for dominance, and the new outside mural is no exception with tangerine skies set behind the historic Thurso of Robert Dick,\" said Gunn.Thursos illustrious scientist had his herbarium collection feature in an earlier work by the artist Joanne Carr which in turn is featured within Delayes mural ndash a clear case of one artist paying homage to another.\"Graffiti and street art is more relevant than ever whether it be in the art world ndash with the recent record sale of Banksys girl with a balloon ndash or here in the Highlands where graffiti has made its way onto the syllabus at Farr High School through art teacher Tracy Wilkinson,\" she said.After garnering great positive feedback from the current show Merran decided to \"have a moment of spontaneity\" and raised funds through a crowdfunding website and the Dounreay Communities Fund to commission Marc Delaye to breath some le into a fairly drab corner of the town.Tracy Dodson, commercial manager of CHMAG, said that the gallery was \"breaking boundaries\" with Graffito.\"It questions what actually constitutes art and what gets shown in a gallery. Graffito is an exhibition that celebrates artwork that is available to everyone.\"Traditionally graffiti has been seen as anti-social, fringe or even as criminal vandalism, but with an emphasis on social inclusion, we are celebrating street, pop, comic and zine work as mainstream art for hanging in our gallery.\"Tracy unabashedly declares that Graffito is \"aimed at young people and the young at heart, as a way of inviting new and future audiences to a museum and gallery experience\".\"This is a multicoloured on-the-wall exhibition devoted to all manner of graphic mark-making and breaking the boundaries of what art is all about,\" she said. \"We have also hosted street painting and comic workshops, guided gallery tours, and collaborating with our local schools and council.\"Marc Delaye is an established community projects artist with Freshpaint.org which is based on the Black Isle.\"Murals are as alive now as ever before and an excellent way to introduce art to internal and external spaces, giving iniduals and communities something that they can be proud of and enjoy each and every day,\" said Marc.The murals can be privately commissioned and can be an \"ideal means of advertising products, services, messages and campaigns\".Other exhibitors at Graffito include Andy Strachan, of Comic Creations Studios Dundee, David Robertson of Fred Egg Comics and Zu Dominak, all of whom work at the University of Dundee within the Masters degrees in Comics and Graphic Novels ndash the only course of its kind in the UK.Other exhibitors include Victor Nobis and his series Fallen Giants ndash a fantasy dream space where cities like Edinburgh rise and twist through the torso of neon lit giant figures.Graffito finishes on Saturday with a day of childrens workshops, guided tours and a colouring competition.Saturday  Nov  : PM"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"November ,  at : pmOrkney FC and Alness United shared four goals this afternoon in a - draw.

It’s such an iconic building in the heart of Kirkwall and we wanted to do justice to it # so we have done a lot of work to take into account the uneven surfaces and to choose a colour palette that would really work with the beautul red stone.The Great War: An Orkney Memorial Experience will run for the final time between pm and pm on Remembrance Day,  November.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Will the Chief Secretary work with the Secretary of State for Business to develop that proposal and work with the Business Department and the developers to see the fruition of what could be a very important part of the Government’s industrial strategy.”Responding to Mr Carmichael, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, the Rt. Hon. Liz Truss MP, said: “As part of the spending review we will be looking at the most efficient way we can achieve our carbon targets, and I am working closely with the Department of Business Energy and Industrial Strategy to do.”Commenting after the exchange, Mr Carmichael added: “The Minister’s response will do little to assure the industry that they are a priority for the Government. There was nothing in the Budget for this industry, and the Government have been working closely across departments for some time now. It is disappointing that little progress appears to be being made.“Wave and tidal power generation and new and innovative forms of producing green energy. The ambition of the industry however has not been matched by the policy framework, which continues to prevent this sector from reaching the point where it becomes commercially viable.“Renewable energy generation, particularly wave and tidal stream power are areas at which the Northern Isles is at the very forefront, and the creation of these Innovative Power Purchase Agreements would make great strides towards helping these innovative industries continue to flourish. The Minister should stop dragging her feet and start delivering for the industry.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

They also campaign to improve their lives and remember the fallen.Mark Bibbey, chief executive of Poppyscotland said: “Members of the Armed Forces are often based far away from home so an initiative like this which offers a signicant discount on travel must be applauded. This will also make Loganair’s extensive network more accessible to those who have served, and to Forces families too.It underlines Loganair’s commitment to supporting the Armed Forces community and is just the latest way in which they have demonstrated this. We thank them for their continue support.”To find out more about the Armed Forces Fare visit www.defencediscountservicecopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

If we continue to turn a blind eye to the risk of developing type  diabetes as a result, we can only expect to see the number of undiagnosed cases escalate.‘Diabetic retinopathy is one of the leading causes of blindness among people of working age in the UK so it’s hugely important that diabetes is detected early and monitored correctly to avoid furthering the risks.‘At Specsavers, we offer digital retinal photography. This takes a detailed picture of the back of your eye and the microcirculation of blood – helping to highlight indicators of diabetes that need addressing.Eye screening is also a key part of your diabetes care and people with diabetes should have routine screenings done every one to two years by an optometrist. Contact your local GP or local diabetic screening service for more information.Sophie Castell, Director of Relationships at RNIB, says: ‘Sadly, all too often, people with diabetes can lose their sight due to complications. Yet with early detection and treatment, sight loss due to diabetic retinopathy can be prevented. Regular eye tests are important for everyone, but especially for people living with diabetes who should also ensure they attend appointments for specialist diabetic eye screening. It’s a few minutes that could save your sight.’ https:www.diabetes.org.uk resources-s - diabetes_in_the_uk_.pdf https:www.diabetes.org.uk about_us news over--of-people-unaware-diabetes-can-lead-to-blindness- State of the Nation’s Eye Health, Specsavers  RNIB  https:www.rnib.org.uk knowledge-and-research-hub-research-reports prevention-sight-loss stateofthenation http:www.rnib.org.uk sites default files RNIB_evidence_based_review_of_working_age_people.pdf vw, px\"  copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

We should have something similar around the Firth. You see people driving past Kirkmichael slowing down to take a look because it looks interesting. People are drawn in and genuinely interested by what they see.\"Irsquom not really all that comfortable with heritage being competitive but this does mean the community, which has been supporting this for close on  years, can be recognised.

We have a whole plan of engagement throughout the year that will do that, starting later this week.\"And at the same time to listen to the public and to hear the views of what the council is doing really well, what everyone believes the council could be doing better in terms of delivering services and the important part of that is that we go across the Highlands to hear those views.\"The first thing is about listening to people, the second most important thing is about going back and saying to people lsquoyou said and we willrsquo or lsquowe are not able to becausersquo.\"The councilis due tostart a \"public budget engagement process\" tomorrow, designed to help the local authority make decisions to balance its books.\"It is really important that we listen throughout the month of November,\" Mrs Manson said. \"Then we will go back and give feedback on what the suggestions are.\"Mrs Manson was upbeat about the local authorityrsquos financial woes that have seen it stumble from one unpopular cutback to another over several months amid a flurry of resignation threats from within the administration.\"I am quite positive about our budget situation here in the Highlands ndash I think we are in a fair place,\" she said. \"There are places where we will be able to make efficiencies and our officer team and our members are working on that all the time, day-in, day-out behind the scenes.\"However, Mrs Manson did accept that \"there are some challenging areas in there, such as what our priorities for resource and for spend are, and I think it is very important to take a transparent approach so that when we do take decisions in February [when the council budget is decided] we can actually evidence it comes after listening to people.\"One of the answers to those challenges, according to the chief executive, is to rely on the \"many talented staff who believe in the values of public service and that we are here to make a dference\" and to capitalise on an upsurge in community involvement.\"I genuinely believe that many, many people that I have been speaking to over the last few months in dferent parts of the Highlands have really good ideas,\" she said. \"They see where the council can become more efficient.\"But equally so, I think that people can be more understanding of the challenges that we face.\"The local authority has made pound. million of savings since  and raised council tax by three per cent in each of the last two years.Budget leader Alister Mackinnon said: \"We have to do more with less money and our costs are rising for things like fuel, pay and cost of living.\"We are working with services to produce comprehensive information on our current spending profiles, to identy where there are opportunities for efficiencies and any commercial opportunities.

In a bright apricot top and carefully made up, she’s surrounded by our favourite foodies as she presents another serving of The Great British Bake Off: An Extra Slice, the spin off from the ratings busting TV show. She couldn’t be more rehabilitated from the days of her vilication as the man-hating, acerbic lesbian stand-up she never actually was, to the favourite aunty now welcomed into the nation’s sitting rooms to serve up their feelgood comfort food TV. “I think I’m seen as a bit more fluffy now,” says the -year-old in her pleasantly dry laconic drawl. “A lot of the press thought when I got married, ‘oh she can’t be a man hating lesbian after all’”, she says, sounding asshe’s scuffing the toes of her Docs on the ground as she drags herself all the way to double home economics. As for the sartorial makeover, Brand is happy to ditch her matching black T-shirt and leggings for pastels on TV because “they make me. No, they don’t, but my thing is to fight bigger battles. I wouldn’t select colour for myself butsomeone  does, I’ll wear it. And they do your make-up too,” she says, sounding pleased, as she loves a bit of lippy, and an aubergine tint in her hair. Because despite the rebranding, Brand has retained her ability to subvert expectations, as well as her feminist or left-wing principles, along with her talent for devastating one-liners. She’s been making us laugh for  years, since Channel ’s late night comedy show Saturday Live in the late s, after she’d already made her name as the heckle-proof deadpan ‘Sea Monster’ on London’s comedy circuit. Her own shows Jo Brand’s Big Splash and Jo Brand Through The Cakehole followed and she became a regular list on Have I Got News For You, QI, Would I Lie To You and Countdown. Moving into writing, she penned and starred in NHS comedy Getting On, for which she won a Bafta to add to her four British Comedy Awards and most recently, social services satire Damned. Her several books include an autobiography and novels, one of which she adapted into this year’s film The More You Ignore Me, starring Sheridan Smith. And there’s her latest book, the amusingly useful le guide, Born Lippy: How to Do Female. All of which amounts to the sort of career that leads to you being called ‘national treasure’, so how does she feel about that  “It’s not my favourite thing because it limits your behaviour. I don’t hate it, it’s quite funny, but I would reserve judgement because I don’t want to behave like a national treasure for the rest of my le. I might want to do things that don’t fit into that category…”Such as… back in the Extra Slice studio it’s dessert week and Jo is revisiting the contestant’s chocolate spheres. The trick is to pour hot chocolate sauce over and watch it melt daintily, but an impatient Brand speeds things along with a tenderising mallet, inadvertently also smashing the white china plate underneath. “Sorry,” she says, unconvincingly, as the guests and studio audience cheer her on. This national treasure still has an irreverent bite.Brand loves presenting Bake Off: An Extra Slice despite admitting thatwe shouted ‘Show Us Your Bakes!’ at her, she’d come up with... “not much – a very plain sponge or a rhubarb crumble. The problem I have is making it look nice and Bake Off is as much about art as baking.” Did she take the hosting gig for the comic potential of soggy bottoms, cracks and buns then “To be honest, I did it because they asked me, and I love its happy audience, funny  and – unintentionally terrying sometimes – audience baking. And I liked the format. It’s a bit like Have I Got News For You, presenting, with a  of funny people and an audience.“I’m doing another HIGNFY soon, hosting this time, and it’s like promotion, being a grown up,” she says.The  show allowed Brand to demonstrate her more reasonable than raging approach to feminism when she calmly reprimanded a dismissive Ian Hislop and the all-male  for downplaying sexual harassment in the House of Commons, by saying, “For women,you’re constantly being harassed, that builds up and wears you down.”“I really like Ian a lot and have known him for years and I was really surprised, but I felt I had to say something. Because it’s a creeping thing, a collective set of experiences that wear you down. It’s not a one off touching your bum, or ‘you look gorgeous’, it builds up.” As the mother of teenage daughters, Maisie and Eliza, Brand is used to being uncool, but for once they were impressed. “They loved it because I was trending on Twitter for three months. And I’m pleased it got the attention it did. My instinct was to speak quietly because it’s such a cliché about feminists, that they’re just a load of shouty women with no sense of humour.” At which point it seems apposite to insert one of the jokes from Born Lippy: How many Feminists Does it Take to Change a Lightbulb Do it yourself, you lazy bastard.Things have changed for women in comedy too, for the better according to Brand as attitudes have moved on. “For a long time male comedy was described as being lots of dferent styles – Eddie Izzard did surreal, others did puns – and women were just ‘women doing comedy’, but these days women are allowed to have all kinds of dferent personalities and styles.” Away from the telly, Brand is back on stage and heading for Edinburgh, with Birmingham Repertory Theatre’s Nativity! The Musical. Thanks to Maisie and Eliza, she has been to her share of nativity plays and is a big fan of the Nativity! films. “What you do is totally focus on what your child is playing, eventhey’re a rock or sheep, and for my money, the more mistakes the better.“I’m playing a newspaper critic who starts off cynical and is swept away with the show because the kids are so great.” Being self-deprecating, Brand is downplaying her own starring role in a school nativity, when she played not ‘Bethlehem’, as she’s claimed, but Mary. “Well, I remember virtually nothing about it, apart from wearing a white head thing and a blue dress. It was the s and traditional – no space ships – they didn’t give Mary an awful lot to say. Mary doesn’t say a word in the Bible, it’s all Joseph. And she was very pregnant, wasn’t she, so she’d probably just have said ‘My God I’m tired.’”Born in South London in July  to an engineer and social worker, with an older and younger brother, Josephine Grace Brand grew up in Kent then moved schools at , hated it and started to skive, smoke and drink. In Born Lippy she doesn’t hold back describing her headstrong teen years with stories of the time her dad punched her heroin addict boyfriend, or when he threw all her clothes on a bonfire after he and her mother caught underage Brand coming out of Emmanuelle, stoned, accompanying seven men, the incident that prompted her leaving the family home. Moving in with her posh heroin addict boyfriend, she went on the pill and put on four stone, becoming the spiky haired, thick-skinned ‘Sea Monster’, an alternative comedian who faced down the hecklers with her deadpan drawl. Ask Brandshe regrets leaving home as a teenager, she demurs.“No… I would say I probably did the right thing actually because I don’t think things would have been any better at home and to some extent, my leaving added to the weight that made my father get some help. I needed to get out just because we were in one of those awful relationships where you can’t work it out and be calm.” While honing her comedy she trained as a psychiatric nurse and worked at an emergency department where knives, guns and abuse were a reality and made the clubs look tame. “When you’re a stand-up comedian and people are off their heads, you get a lot of abuse. But the manic phase of bipolar disorder is way more eloquent than the average drunk bellowing ‘f*** off you fat cow’”. Brand’s ten years working as a psychiatric nurse provided her with background for her sitcoms satirising le at the sharp end of the caring professions and she acknowledges that her father’s struggle with depression may have influenced her original choice of career.Set in a geriatric ward the BBC Four series Getting On, which she co-wrote and co-starred in three series of, was directed by Peter Capaldi and did for the NHS what The Thick Of It did for politics, as well as winning her a Bafta in  for Best TV Comedy Performance. Meanwhile Damned, the second series of which screened this year on Channel  is set in a social services office, and stars Brand, and her friends Alan Davies and co-writer Morwenna Banks.“They say write about what you know then you don’t have to spend a lot of time researching to make it relevant. That’s why I haven’t done any dramas about scaffolding. I stick to stuff I do know about, mental health, nursing, social work, and not many people are doing stuff about that. I have experienced a lot of le. My favourite comedy is the kind where you see that, where people have had proper jobs before they came into it. It adds something.” Mental illnessis also dealt with in The More You Ignore Me, a novel she turned into a film, set in s rural England. Starring Sheridan Smith as Gina, a schizophrenic mum who is hospitalised after becoming obsessed with a local weatherman, it also features Mark Addy, Sheila Hancock, Ricky Tomlinson and Brand herself.“The central thing is how unglamorous it is to be ill like that, and its impact on the family. In the s it was something that was kept private, shameful. My dad suffered depression from his teenage years and didn’t seek help until his mid-fties. It’s unrecognisable now in comparison, and the power of the person seeking help has risen exponentially. “A few of my friends who are psychiatric nurses saw it and they’re hard-bitten cynical people, so to make them cry and laugh too, I was satisfied. I couldn’t believe I had the power to move people with something I’d written.” Her latest book Born Lippy: How to Do Female is moving too, as well as funny, and most of all useful. A collection of all the things Brand wishes she’d known, things she’s learnt, and things she hopes for the future, among the chapters are, How to Manage a Bully, Your Family And How To Survive It, Having Fun, Not Having Fun, How Not to Fall in Love, Feminism, a Rebranding and Staying Sane.There’s also handy practical advice for you to try. Can’t get on with your toxic family  Lower your expectations. People making you unhappy  Ultimately, you can walk away. Nervous at parties  Try some ice-breakers: “What’s the most violent incident you’ve ever witnessed ” Or “What’s the worst lie you’ve ever told ” Find yourself confronted with a flasher  Shout “That looks like a penis only smaller,” and for women faced with that old favourite: “You obviously hate men,” try “No I don’t, it’s just you”, while “You need a good shag”, can be dispensed with “I’ll look where then.”Hitchhiking alone at night, falling in love with a heroin addict or smashing up an abusive driver’s windscreen when you have PMT  Read Brand’s own experience and it might put you off. Although she’s conflicted about that last one. “I’m not advocating violence,” she says, “butyou do suffer from PMT be aware you might go there one day. I used to control it  per cent of the time, and when I didn’t, I tried to appreciate it. And it was always towards things, never people, and that’s not quite so bad.“The book is all stuff that was familiar to me, that happened to me or was interesting to me. Hence the lack of a chapter on motor mechanics. I wrote it for my daughters in a way.“If you’re a comedian rule number one is ‘be funny’. There are serious bits but a lot of it is tongue in cheek. I don’t like to give advice and I think the best way is to tell people stories about what went wrong for you and say,you can avoid doing that you’ll be better off.” Brand is keen to write more novels – “so I don’t have to get dressed” – but hasn’t lost her love of stand-up. The problem is being away too much from the South London home she shares with husband of  years, Bernie Bourke, a psychiatric nurse, her daughters and cats Louis and Dotty. Script-writing and TV work suit her at the moment, but she’s never been one for five or ten year plans. “As things come up I think do I want to do it or not ” she says.And she decided she did want to do the Edinburgh and London legs of the Nativity! The Musical tour as she “likes Scotland”. Speaking of which, Brand was one of the  celebrities who signed an open letter in theto the people of Scotland urging them to stay in the UK in . Does she still think that, in the light of the Brexit vote “Well, I think so, just because I like Scotland,” she says. “But to be honest, I don’t blame you for wanting to leave because I wouldI was in Scotland. You have policies that are good on health, such as free care for the elderly, and it’s more caring. “As for Brexit, I would support another referendum because I think we are much better suited being in Europe than on our own, but it looks asaround half of the people are delighted by Brexit, and that’s quite a dficult thing to live with. “A bit of me thinks ‘you’ve made your bed, see what happens when you haven’t got enough people for the health service, doctors, teachers…’ Let’s see what happens. I think we are in the last chance saloon andwe do leave, I’m not sure how it’s going to be,” she says, sounding resigned. Butanyone should be tempted to say to her, “Cheer up love, it may never happen!” I refer you to one of her handy general purpose put-downs, “Keep talking and it will.”@JanetChristieJo Brand will appear in Nativity!

Indeed, it has long been a risk for kilt wearers that they can be subject to unsolicited peeking, questioning about what is worn underneath – or even groping.Yet, while campaigners have long fought, quite rightly, for “up-skirting” to be banned, it has somehow been perfectly acceptable – nay welcome, even – for a woman to feel free to do whatever she likes when a man is wearing a kilt.Earlier this week, I reported on a stooshie over an advert produced by clothing retailer Mango. In it, the model, Jeanne Dumas, apparently a Parisian ‘it girl’, embarks on a visit to Scotland wearing the brand’s garments. As well as a lot of scampering around in the Scottish countryside with a dog, she graces the streets of Edinburgh with her presence, only pausing on her whirlwind fashionista tour to peek cheekily up the kilt of a Scotsman, who happens to be standing handily on the street.Broadcast on social media, the ad sparked outrage among people who complained that this action was “not appropriate”.“Mango,” said one, “are you really condoning lting up stranger’s skirts ! It’s not acceptable, whether it’s a lady’s skirt or a guy’s kilt.”Another argued that it was akin to sexual harrassment. “So odd that in a world where we campaign against ‘upskirting’ andconsider having their skirt lted to be sexual harassment, that a woman looking up a man’s kilt is shown as playful and jokey,” she said.: English upskirting ban ‘will also apply to kilts’As I watched the ad, I realised I recognised the chap who was the victim of this violation. It was none other than legendary Edinburgh kiltmaker Howie Nicholsby, who has worn a kilt every day for the past  years.I tried to contact Howie, who I assumed would laugh off the incident with a tongue-in-cheek comment – after all, he had not looked too traumatised on the video and had presumably given his consent to appear in the ad – but when I finally managed to have a chat with him after he ed from holiday, I found that he did, indeed, feel quite strongly about the practice.In fact, it turned out, he had allowed Ms Dumas to lt his kilt, but under some duress. He told me that he had actually tried to explain to the film crew that he didn’t feel comfortable with her peeking under his kilt, but that the language barrier, combined with a lack of cultural understanding, meant he found it dficult to get across. And after a long day’s filming, Howie was too exhausted to argue.“It was a pleasure to work with the Mango film crew, but they were foreign and they just didn’t get what I was saying about this,” he explains. “I tried to tell them that I wasn’t comfortable with it, that it was the equivalent of up-skirting, but they didn’t understand. It had been a long day and in the end, I just went with it. With hindsight, perhaps I shouldn’t have.”Howie estimates he has experienced at least one incident a year over the past two decades of what I am going to refer to as “up-kilting” with which he has not been happy. “There have been a lot of experiences, often late night in a bar, some in Scotland and some where,” he says. “There have been drunk -year-old women who probably should have known better and on occasion, even some men.”: Leader comment: Scotland’s upskirting law is not fit for purposeOne particularly unpleasant incident occurred in Newcastle, where a group of four women pinned him against the wall in a bar while he was on a stag night as their friend forced her hand up his kilt.“I usually wear underpants, but on that occasion it was a stag do, so I was commando,” he remembers. “I’d used an old rugby trick of putting a fair bit of Vaseline down there to avoid chafing and when the woman grabbed me, she looked at me asI was the one who was disgusting beacuse she’d got a handful of Vaseline. It was asI’d assaulted her, when it was the other way around. I was standing there, thinking ‘Jesus Christ, how is this OK ’”Up-skirting was made a specic offence in Scotland in , which refers to operating equipment, such as a camera, under people’s clothing. A separate up-skirting bill is currently being passed south of the Border, which will, it has been claimed, specically protect kilt-wearers, as well as women in skirts.While groping of any kind is obviously unacceptable and could be classed as an offence under sexual assult laws, socially, a woman sticking her hand up a man’s kilt is often seen as a bit of a laugh. Unlike women in the same situation, men are expected to almost enjoy the experience, which Howie says is most definitely not the case.“Of course, some guys are quite happy when it’s an attractive woman, but it has to be seen as under the same laws which protect women,” says Howie. “It has to be regarded in the same way as up-skirting.”And he’s right. We can’t argue that men shouldn’t look up a woman’s skirt – which obviously they shouldn’t – while watching a major brand do exactly the same in reverse.

Ms Sturgeon has said the SNP will support a referendum on the terms of the Brexit deal. This week Mr Gibson rebelled against the SNP whip by failing to support a Holyrood vote for a second Brexit referendum. The vast majority of SNP MSPs joined the Lib Dems and Greens to support an amendment calling for the People’s Vote.Speaking to the independence-supporting National newspaper, Mr Gibson said he favoured a second Scottish independence referendum because Brexit had brought a “material change in circumstances”. When it came to Brexit, however, he said nothing had changed “materially”.“I also believe that having a second vote on the Brexit package sets a precedent. One I would not want to see imposed post indyref.”Mr Neil did not vote in the Holyrood Brexit debate on Wednesday, but he told the National the SNP was “bounced” into supporting the policy after Ms Sturgeon annnounced SNP MPs would back a second Brexit referendum on a TV interview.Mr Neil said: “What I am first and foremost is a Nationalist. I want independence for Scotland so I judge everything on the basis on whether advances or not the case for Scottish independence and based on that criteria I think it is a huge mistake to support the idea of a confirmatory referendum, which will be used against us by our opponents.”©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4827488.1541860087!/image/image.jpg","title":"artist s altered edinburgh street signs went unnoticed for 18 months","story":"A street artist who altered almost  road signs in Edinburgh city centre has revealed that his whimsical alterations had gone unnoticed for  months.Frenchman Clet Abraham, , confirmed he was the artist behind the altered signs, featuring images including sumo wrestlers, wine glasses and a doughnut, pictured right.The fine art graduate said he thought people had not noticed his work because there were too many signs in the city.He said he hoped they remained in the streets as they were “for everyone”.Speaking from his home in Italy, Mr Abraham said it normally took between three to four months for people to notice his art work on road signs in other cities across the world. He said: “I was in Edinburgh in March , so it was very slow for there to be a voice about my work, I find it very funny. “I think there are too many street signs in Edinburgh and so people don’t like street signs and therefore they don’t bother looking at them. It’s very crazy and bureaucratic to have that many signs.“I never cover more than about  per cent of the sign as I don’t want to disturb the meaning, which is very important to me.“My work is about prohibition and therefore to cover the sign too much would mean it had lost its meaning.“I’m against authority without discussion. While I’m not against signs they are a symbol of authority as they give an order.”Mr Abraham said he had also left his stamp on ten signs in Glasgow, and had picked Scotland because he had a cultural affinity with the country and its green landscape, and he singled out Edinburgh due to its “beautul” architecture.The artist takes between two days and two years to come up with each design before hand-drawing it and then putting it onto a computer to make a sticker.He has changed signs all over the world – and been arrested in Japan. He was caught by the police several times but has usually been allowed to carry on once he has explained to the police that he is not a vandal.He said: “I take care to do it at night and it doesn’t take long as I’ve already made the stickers but yes I have been caught in Italy, London and Japan.

It is part of the Year of Young People activities.The youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.Year of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to  years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, #What do you enjoy about Shetland #, #What makes you proud of Shetland #, #What is Shetland famous for #.# Send any ideas, before Friday th July , to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.The SIC#s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.#This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People .”Are they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be doneI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish##.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc###and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of le or some other pointless title.Over the years art has very much lowered its standards signicantly to make and justy it becoming more commercially viable####.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called # limited edition rubbish #.I would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at###atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.No doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and le experience###..despite the fact everybody  looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.Love the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us.

I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds.

To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted.

So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 25 ","story":"Those responsible finally saw sense this week, reversing the ridiculous decision to play both Scottish League Cup semi-finals at Hampden Park on the same day.Celtic, one of the four sides involved, had indicated that a draw should be made to determine which game was moved to Murrayfieldthe original plans were scrapped.But the holders’ game against Hearts will now take place in Edinburgh at .pm on Sunday th October. The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"whalsays new research arrives in lerwick for first time ","story":"The Research leaves Symbister with bunting flying as she heads for Lerwick on Saturday.

He had represented Cunningsburgh, Ness United and ious Shetland select sides, once making a trip to Faroe with a county squad.Alastair was probably a wing-half in his early days, but after the change from -- to modern formations he usually formed part of the central defence.He played alongside the late Ian Manson for Ness, while for Cunningsburgh his long-term partner was Douglas Halcrow. They were part of a team which enjoyed many successes in Southern League football, and also which won the Parish Cup in  and .Cunningsburgh had a number of outstanding players in that era, not least twins Billy and Malcolm Adamson and the late George Adamson, but Alastair was definitely one of the most consistent.Very similar to his -year career at The Shetland Times, he was as dedicated as it was possible to be, someone you could always count on whatever the issue.As former goalkeeper Peter Farmer said after the funeral last Friday, “I played behind Alistair for  years and he was so reliable, the way he read the game.”Football runs in the family. His younger brother Gordon also played for Cunningsburgh and Ness while another brother Jim represented Shetland in  and . Nephews Raymond and James Aitken and Tony and James Johnston did likewise, with the latter becoming the county’s equal most-capped player.When the Times started a works league team in the s Alistair was persuaded to come out of retirement and take part in the very first match, a friendly against Bressay. That was where his we hailed from and I recall him saying that “I better no score a goal or Margaret will nivver spaek ta me again”.He also came with the works team on a trip to Orkney. He was a bit unsure about that and actually got injured in one of the matches, but as far as I recall he had as good a time as anybody where the after-match entertainment was concerned.Alastair and Margaret had three daughters, Wendy and twins Susan and Alison. They were all musically gted while Susan and Alison excelled at hockey.One of his grand-daughters, Sophie Moar, is a top athlete. At the island games in Jersey three years ago she won a bronze medal in the long jump and was a member of the gold medal-winning # metres relay squad. Alastair and Margaret were there to see it and I would imagine that was one of his proudest ever moments. After his retiral in  our paths crossed a few times but unfortunately not all that often. He was always friendly and good company.The last time I saw Alastair was earlier this year when I visited him and Margaret at Bremmer in Cunningsburgh. It was a very dficult experience as by then the dementia had taken its toll, and he was a shadow of the vibrant figure he had been. He still knew me though, which made it worthwhile.Alistair was a tremendous guy. I know Margaret, their daughters and grandchildren, and the other family will miss him greatly, and I would like to give my condolence to them all.: : : : : : : :News came this week that Crystal Palace footballer James McArthur had retired from Scotland duty as he believed it was the only way he could “continue to play at the top level”.There was a time when representing your country was considered the “top level” but sadly that is not a view shared by an increasing number of people in the game.McArthur, who won the last of his  caps a year ago, says he has found it increasingly dficult to manage a number of physical issues. He is only .The Crystal Palace midfielder will continue to turn out for his club in what could be -odd games a season. However, he has deemed the half a dozen or so he could be required for his international side to be just too much.McArthur follows in the wake of a number of Scottish players who have taken this decision, the highest profile being Celtic captain Scott Brown. Others, such as Alan Hutton, are still performing regularly for their clubs.There were also the recent instances where both Leigh Grfiths, Robert Snodgrass and Kieran Tierney asked to be released from the international squad because of perceived “fatigue”.No doubt McArthur, like the others mentioned, has his reasons for arriving at this decision. But I cannot help thinking that players from a dferent era would never have done so.Some, notably Denis Law and current Scottish boss Alex McLeish, have said they have never retired from their country. They would still be availablerequired. Attitudes have definitely changed, and not for the better.: : : : : : : :The Australian Cricketers’ Associationthis week called for the bans to be lted on the three players who were involved in ball-tampering in South Africa earlier this year.The association has laid part of the blame for the incident at the door of Cricket Australia, who it has labelled “arrogant and controlling”.Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft were all “contrite men who have suffered enough”, a review carried out by the ACA stated.Smith, who was captain at the time, and vice-captain Warner are seven months into their one-year bans, while Bancroft, who carried out the cheating, will be eligible tonext month.While the three may have endured both a degree of humiliation – Smith’s tearful confession was felt by some to be meaningful – and financial penalties, lting the ban now would send all the wrong signals.Cheating in sport, however apologetic the protagonists may appear in the aftermath, is an anathema which needs punishing.

A lot of visitor experiences are going to be marred.\"Adam Gough, CairnGorm Mountain representative, who had told of the need for the slopes aimed at beginners and intermediates, was clearly stunned by the rejection.Asked immediately after the decisionan appeal was likely, he said that a statement would be issued later.CNPA head planner Gavin Miles had stressed from the outset the application had to be determined on planning issues ndash landscaping impacts in particular ndash and not on its commercial merits, which had generated much argument.He said the business case was a matter for Natural Retreats.Mr Miles told the committee the articial slope would not extend the ski area in any signicant way but the footprint of obvious development would increase.He commented: \"Initially the team were very concerned about the landscaping but as more information was given to us by the applicants it was considered that in the long term planting would mitigate against that. There would be an impact in the short term of the dry ski slope.\"Whether it will ever be an attraction in its own right and generate signicant income, who knows, but that is not a consideration of the planning process.\"In effect it is a ersication of business in this area and therefore acceptable andit was to strengthen the stability of CairnGorm Mountain then thats a good thing.\"He said there were some hefty planning conditions attached to control the development.CairnGorm Mountains representative said some  per cent of total visits to the resort were in just three winter months of the year.Mr Gough had told the committee Natural Retreats had explored several options in depth to remove the reliance on winter income including mountain biking and zip-wiring but this plan was the most viable at this time.He said it was imperative the attraction can provide year-round employment in order to retain its best staff. This site was the most sheltered for the ski slope and close to other facilities without impacting on other slopes, he said. It could also be used for tubing and other activities.Mr Gough acknowledged the clamour for better ski uplt at CairnGorm which has been overtaken as Scotlands most popular ski resort.He said: \"We would like nothing more than to be able to upgrade ski infrastructure to improve the snowsports experience for everyone but this has to be a long term process built on solid commercial foundations.\"He said the slope could be in operation for  per cent of the year outwith winter and ice would not be a problem as it was easy practice to break it up.ABA secretary Alan Brattey said history showed articial slopes at Scottish resorts including the Lecht, Glenshee and Glencoe had not worked.He also said a bright green Snowflex slope would stand out like a sore thumb and no consideration had been given by the operator to an alternative by market leader, Neveplast, which could be camouflaged.He said that of just over  votes on Facebook on the application,  per cent were against it.Tessa Jones, of the Badenoch and Strathspey Conservation Group, asked the committee: \"What are you going to say to the world about this peatland destruction \"Committee member Dave Fallows moved the application be refused and he was seconded by Carolyn Caddick.He said he appreciated the efforts to mitigate against the ski slope but said: \"It cant possibly soften in the long term the impact that this makes on the area.\"Mrs Caddick said: \"We are going to see it for miles and miles around.\"Peter Argyle had moved in favour of the application saying he had faith in the planning officers conditions but was not supported.Mr Brattey said after the vote: \"This was very much the right decision and wed like to congratulate the planning committee for deciding to reject this planning application against the advice of their planning officials.\"We very much hope that common sense will now prevail and that the plans for the Ptarmigan Building will be dropped.\"We are left to wonder just exactly why HIE allowed their tenant to take such a madcap plan all the way to the CNPAs planning committee who were very decisive in their rejection of it.\"He said HIE should ert the pound million to new uplt. \"The hill business requires to be funicular proofed as soon as possible,\" said Mr Brattey.Saturday  Nov  : PM"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118063.jpg","title":"Green light for Dalwhinnie quarry work","story":"Gavin MusgroveA quarry operator has said that measures are in place to allay concerns that their excavation plans could lead to a surge in speeding lorries in a Badenoch village.Leithshas been given the green light by the Cairngorms National Park Authorityrsquos planning committee to recommence operations at the site at Carn Dhomhnuill Bhain on the doorstep of Dalwhinnie.The company has said that it is not contingent on winning a contract to supply aggregate to the dualling of the A but that the produce will be used for housebuilding and other local construction projects.The firm was granted temporary permission for  yearsatthe CNPArsquoslatest planning committee meeting at Boat of Garten Community Hall.Production will be stepped up dramatically at the quarry around one mile north of Dalwhinnie by the A.It was previously in operation up to .But now Leiths has permission to extend the site from two to  hectares.

Importantly that means that visitors will be travelling through the Sleat peninsula, where communities have worked long and hard to build up a viable industry.“In the midst of the important debates about ferries and not least the importance of the MV Coruisk to the Armadale-Mallaig crossing, it’s important to celebrate the huge contribution that RET has made to the island economies.”If CalMac#s league tables of ferry route usage tell us anything, it is that moving the MV #Coruisk# from its purpose-built harbours on the busiest crossing in the north-west remains inexplicable.If the two tables of passengers and coaches highlight anything , it is that CalMac badly needs its two new ferries from the Clyde to be delivered according to their revised schedule and not experience a third delay.It is a mild surprise, as Kate Forbes MSP says, to discover that more people sail between Mallaig and Armadale in Skye than between Stornoway and Ullapool and that more coaches cross the Sound of Sleat than make any other journey on CalMac#s itinerary.It is good news not only for Sleat but for the whole of the island. It is good news which is tempered by the fact that this busy, bustling route is now served only by whatever ships CalMac can spare, when the tide permits them, while its purpose-built vessel, the MV #Coruisk#, which can dock at Armadale in all tidal conditions, is ploughing between Mull and Oban  nautical miles away.If CalMac had the ships, Mallaig Armadale would be dependable and therefore even busier, Mull would have a vessel of its own and almost everybody would be happy.CalMac do not have the ships in large part because two new deep-sea vessels which were commissioned in  from Ferguson Marine Engineering at Port Glasgow show no sign of turning up for duty.One of them is due to operate on CalMac#s busiest passenger route between Ardrossan and Arran. The other is to work between Uig, Tarbert and Lochmaddy, which last year carried almost , people.The delivery date for those two ships has been put back twice. On each occasion, the £ million contract to Ferguson Marine — which is the property of one of the Scottish Government#s friends, advisors and allies, the billionaire tax exile Jim McColl — was topped up by a multi-million-pound handout from the public purse.If all was on schedule at least one of those ships would now be in service, and CalMac would have substantially more leeway in manoeuvring its fleet from one part of the west coast to another. They might even be able to keep the #Coruisk# on the Sound of Sleat.They are very far from on schedule. The new Ardrossan Arran ferry is now supposed to be delivered next summer, and the new Uig Tarbert Lochmaddy ship in spring .Will they be delivered  Or will we experience a third delay, which would certainly plunge CalMac into even greater chaos as its ageing fleet breaks down or requires routine maintenance somewhere in the Baltic Those are important questions. As we reported last week, the chief executive of Outer Hebrides Tourism, Rob MacKinnon, has criticised the Scottish Government for a lack of any #tangible action# to address the islands# ferry problems.The Scottish transport ministry, said Mr MacKinnon, must #pursue all feasible options to increase ferry capacity in both the long and the short term for the benefit of both visitors and islanders#.As we report this week, Labour#s Western Isles# candidate Alison MacCorquodale has added her voice to the many demanding to know the precise terms of the private finance initiative deal which has bound the Scottish Government into using just one ferry for all passengers and freight between Ullapool and Stornoway, with unacceptable consequences.Ullapool Stornoway may not yet carry as many tourists as Mallaig Armadale. But it is the definition of a leline service, with , passengers last year, many of whom found themselves unable to squeeze onto an overbooked #Loch Seaforth#.We should be told how and why one of our biggest and most important ferries came to be owned by Lloyds Bank.We should be toldJim McColl is going to deliver two badly-needed ships at the third time of asking.It is not enough to say, as does transport minister Michael Matheson, that building CalMac#s ferries is #providing vital support to our shipbuilding industry#The way things are going, building and rebuilding CalMac#s ferries will keep Scottish shipbuilding alive well into the next decade. Their higher purpose, and Mr Matheson#s job is to provide vital support to the Hebridean ferry service. That support is urgently required."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/2018-mod-gold-medals-e1539885405814.jpg","title":"thursday at the mod skye and lochalsh gold medal","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThere was a Skye and Lochalsh double in the premier singing competition at this year’s National Mòd in Dunoon.In Wednesday night’s final Ceitidh Campbell from Kyle of Lochalsh won the women’s Gold Medal, while the men’s medal went to Ruairidh Cormack from Portree.Both singers are following in family footsteps in landing the prestigious honour, which is presented by Mòd organisers An Comunn Gàidhealach.Ceitidh’s mother, Barbara Smith, won the Gold Medal when the Mòd was held in Skye in .

November, in which Councillor Ian Cockburn put forward a motion whereby the local authority would determinefunds were available for design work to begin on replacement options to the bypass. This motion was agreed. earlier this week, the chair of the EDI committee, Councillor Allan Henderson said that the council was putting pressure on the Scottish Government to have the route classed as a trunk road. However, during Thursday’s meeting Councillor Cockburn was quick to dismiss the likelihood of this happening: “Who in their right mind would take  miles of the worst road in the Highlands” He said. “After six and a half years we still only have two options… and the delays and the consequences for the wider community have been absolutely shocking.”The SNP member for Wester Ross, Strathpeffer and Lochalsh also went on to question the tendering process behind the work at the bypass, saying: “Was it necessary to shut the road during the day  I believe there was a tender on the table that would have allowed the road to open during the day.”He went on to argue that the council needed to release money straight away to enable design work on the replacement options for the current bypass to begin, adding that it was a matter of urgency due to the risks identied in the  annual sloping report which detailed four very high-risk rock slopes at the Stromeferry bypass.In response to Councillor Cockburn, the council’s head of infrastructure Colin Howell said that the council did receive an alternative tender from a contractor who said they could carry out the required works at night, however, Mr Howell said the cost was signicant and due to concerns about these plans it was decided it would be wise for some of the work to be undertaken during the day.Mr Howell said that while there were ongoing issues with rockfalls and managing slopes, he believed that the council had done a good job. He went on to add that the council were prioritising the high-risk slopes and currently working on the cost and details in relation to stabilising those areas which would be delivered at the next EDI committee meeting. He added that there were “three optimum solutions” in respect to replacement options and said that the committee had “decided to leave those three on the table# and seek dialogue with Scottish Government for funding. He said: “The administration is looking for feedback, we are working on slopes with high risks and will come back to the next EDI with the costing.”Councillor Derek MacLeod described the current situation as “one episode in a long, long history of problems with the route#, and in contrast to his fellow ward member, Councillor Cockburn, he argued that the route should be “trunked between Auchtertyre and Garve” as he believed it to be strategic in linking the ferry points of Uig and UllapoolCouncil Leader Margaret Davidson told the committee that she would be meeting with the Transport Secretary Michael Matheson and would report back “what options have been put on the table.” Councillor Davidson said that the council were “acutely aware of what’s needed” and were working towards a long-term sustainable option for Stromeferry. She also thanked the public for their cooperation during the works and the council staff for their efforts."},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27481  ","story":"• Mícheál Mac Donncha and Robert Ballagh Mícheál Mac Donnchaby Robert Ballagh published by Head of Zeus. back in the late s. For anartist of his stature this was courageous, dependent as he was, tosome extent, on commissions from people who, to say the least, wouldnot be subscribers to our paper. But this was an artist who went hisown way in art and who acted as a citizen with a conscience in anIreland where State-imposed censorship distorted not only politicaldebate but also national self-image. For Robert Ballaghcreative work and active citizenship have gone hand in hand all hisle. This is depicted in his double self-portrait ‘Upstairs No.’,one of the many illustrations of his work in this superbly writtenand beautully presented book. It is not a standard autobiographywith chapters set out in chronological order beginning with genealogyand ending with this week’s news. As you would expect from Ballagh,he takes a dferent approach, starting towards the later years andcircling through his days in no particular order before coming backto the present. More than that, he weaves narrative, anecdote andreflection together seamlessly and conversationally showing a skillwith words akin to his skill with brushes. He has a story to tell ofa very ied le, from his unusual family background to his time asa showband guitar player, through his unorthodox beginning as apainter and his development as an artist and an activist. Withfrankness and clarity he tells us how he learned and matured as anartist and his brief commentaries on many of his works areilluminating both of how they were made and the concepts behind them.It makes the reader want to look again and more intensely at thepictures. The Prologue isessentially a dedication to Robert’s late we Betty, his lelonginspiration, mentor and most important critic. The first chaptertells the harrowing story of how Betty, in her serious illness, wasdisgracefully let down by a healthcare system which basically allowedher to die through neglect, as was admitted in legal proceedings. Butthis does not cast a shadow over the book, as her positive presenceis felt throughout, and is celebrated by the author. These days I rarely getthat urge immediately to re-read a book when I reach the end, but Idid with this one. Thankfully the chapters are so well defined thatthey can be read as stand-alone essays or stories. Take just twoexamples: ‘Who Fears to Speak ofEaster Week’ recounts the tremendous people’s commemoration ofthe  Centenary in which Robert played a central part, aculmination of his activism which has included campaigning againstapartheid, for the Birmingham Six, for artists’ rights, with theIrish National Congress opening border roads, in solidarity withPalestine and as an enthusiastic participant in Féile an Pobail inWest Belfast from its commencement.‘Dining at McDonald’s’is a brilliant critique of the dominant and stultying modernistideology and practise in art and an appeal for an opening up. Ballaghattacks “the notion that the artists’ choice imbues a givenobject with special properties which are tantamount to a metaphysicaltransformation of the object that it ceases to be a pedestrianartefactand becomes,by virtue of the artist’s choice, art”. This ideology leads tothe absurdity of much of the ‘installation’ stuff in galleriesthat baffles all but elitist insiders and, as Ballagh recounts, theclaim by loyalist killer Michael Stone that his attack on Stormontwas a piece of performance art. He argues that the bureaucracies mustset aside this ideology and make galleries more open and democratic .For these views and forhis artistic method and, among some I suspect, for his politics,Ballagh has been frowned upon by certain elites. One prominent figurein the Irish art world said of him with dripping condescension thathe is “not a real artist, he is a mere illustrator”. Typically,Ballagh responded with humour and defiance in a self-portrait wearinga t-shirt saying ‘Fuck the Begrudgers’. I cannot recommend thisbook highly enough. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27482  ","story":"Pearse Doherty: The Interview  Ruairí Doyle“Society is organised in the wrong way - we should not have a housing crisis - what is happening with our children in emergency accommodation is immoral. It is a scandal that we will look back at in twenty years with shame.” - Pearse Doherty TDSinn Féin TD and Finance spokesperson Pearse Doherty has spoken of his origins, his le and how they influence and inform both his political ideology in an extended online interview. He also outlined his vison for a New Ireland that provides achance for people to live, to work and to raise their families without thechronic levels of deprivation and inequality facing so many today. Speaking ahead of Sinn Féin’s Alternative Budget launch nextweek Deputy Doherty laid out his party’s vision “for a new economy for a NewIreland”.The Donegal TD was born in Glasgow and lived with hisparents and five siblings in a one-bedroom flat in Ibrox before the familyed home to Gweedore in Donegal in the ’s. This informed his belief that no matter when someone leftIreland, evenit were  or  years ago, they still have a great sense ofbelonging, of that tangible bond with home “that’s home - you know - Níl aontinteán mar do thinteán féin - that’s their home”, commented Teachta Doherty.Pearse, who has been a TD since , talked about his drivehome when the Dáil wraps up at the week’s end, crossing the border twice on hisway up the winding road to Donegal to his we and four boys. He also gave aninsight into the dficulty of the balance between work and home le, and theunique challenges of being a public representative. The Gaoth Dobhair resident added that it is not solely challengesthat come with being a Teachta Dala. He said: “It is what shapes you and your values. It’s yourexperience - it’s your past experience - it’s your family experience and it’swhat shapes you in Irish society, the people that are around you. The peoplewho influence you and that help shape you and that’s the values that I bring tomy job today as Finance spokesperson for the lead opposition party. It’s thevalues I will bring to the job as Minister for Finance,I am in thatposition.”Sinn Féin regularly faces accusations of employing “fairy-taleeconomics” or “economic illiteracy”.Pearse dismisses these comments as cheap throw-away remarks,designed to stunt political debate. This is a debate that Pearse opines that the establishmentparties do not want because “any fair minded person would see clearly thatthere is a need to build houses, to bring our children out of emergencyaccommodation instead of cutting taxes for the wealthiest in society.”He continued: “Where despite the fact that the three main banks aremaking €. billion in profits every year, they don’t pay any Corporation Taxand some of them won’t pay for the next twenty years.  That’s the debate they don’t want to have.”As Pearse puts it, the Budget is not just about numbers -it’s about our values and ensuring we create a new economy with strong publicservices and shared prosperity where no one is left behind and no child goeswithout.Deputy Doherty said: “Society is organised in the wrong way. We shouldnot have a housing crisis. What is happening with our children in emergencyaccommodation is immoral and it is a scandal that we will look back at intwenty years with shame.  “What is happening in our hospitals is outrageous, in a country thathas the wealth that it does.  “It is just not shared properly and it is not allocated properly andthat isn’t the fault of citizens. That is fault of politicians that decided onBudget day that the resources created by the Irish people are going to beallocated in this way.”Touching on the spectre of Brexit, as a TD for a borderconstituency, Pearse argues that the North of Ireland remaining in the EU andgiven a Special Designated status is the only way to protect people on bothsides, particularly Donegal which is isolated from the rest of the  Counties.Pearse also remarks that “the debate about Irish Unity needs to go toanother level”. He continued: “We are moving, in my view, to a position where we willhave a border poll. Where a majority of people will vote for Irish unity.  “And that will come about because of demographic changes. It will comeabout because Sinn Féin is agitating for it, and other people are recognisingthat it is in their interests that we have an end to the Irish border.”Sinn Féin is not interested in maintaining the status quoand not content to merely “tinker along the edges - where you might get anincrease in public services, an extra few gardaí, an extra few public sectorworkers, a little tax cut here” Pearse Doherty said. This Budget, and every Sinn Féin Budget, would be about our vision fora new Ireland and that vision of an equal and fair society. We would also focuson the political choices that have always been available to create that society one is prepared to make them. Teachta Doherty states in the conclusion of his interview: “Our job isto provide opportunities so that people can live and work at home. We need togive people the opportunity to raise their families at home, so that they canget through le and reach their opportunities and reach their potential athomethat’s what they wish.” test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27483  ","story":" Mary Lou McDonaldPresident of Sinn FéinWe are facing into a politically challenging time. However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.- Mary Lou McDonaldDUP Leader Arlene Foster has called for fundamental changeto the Good Friday Agreement to facilitate Brexit. In other words an agreement endorsed by the majority of people north and south must make way for Brexit, a proposition rejected by a majority in the north. The latest position of the DUP leader lays bare the root of thecrisis in the north. Remember, the DUP opposed the Good Friday Agreement, campaigned for a No vote in that historic referendum and they continue to oppose the Agreement. An Agreement that has underpinned peace for over two decades.They oppose the all Ireland nature of the Agreement, they oppose the rights and safeguards of the agreement and they oppose power-sharing.   to be in them.” The institutions in the north could no-longer bear the weight of this contradiction and collapsed. This was brought to ahead by the continual refusal to implement agreements, opposition to marriage equality, rights to an inquest, an Irish language Act and the financial scandal that is the RHI Cash for Ash scheme.Add to the mix a British Government that has no understanding of Ireland, our economy or our agreements. The Tories are at war with themselves over Brexit and seem intent to bring their own country down with them. This same Tory Government entered into a toxic deal with the DUP to stay in power. That is why there are no institutions in the north, and why the DUP leadership walked away from the deal they had made with Sinn Féin in February this year to get the Assembly up and running.These latest comments by Arlene Foster are a desperate throw of the dice by an increasingly marginalised Unionist leadership. The deal with the Tories will end. Its only legacy will be Brexit. Meanwhile Ireland north and south is changing and a New Ireland is emerging. The joyous revolution of Marriage Equality and Repeal of the Eighth has resonated with a new generation in the north. The largest political demonstration in Belfast is Pride. A magnicent event that celebrates the ersity of identities that make up our communities.Similarly there is a growing demand for access to abortion services. As a placard proudly announced in Dublin Castle when the Repeal result came through, “The North is Next”.Brexit has also unied those who voted to remain within the EU. Brexit will be a disaster for the economy in the north, particularly for agriculture. A community that values prosperity and access to the EU is looking beyond Brexit and Westminster and instead towards Irish Unity. We are facing into a politically challenging time. However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.As for Arlene Foster and the DUP - the game is up. If their leadership want the institutions in the north up and working then they must support real power sharing, respect, equality and the rights of others. When this happens Sinn Féin will be a willing partner. Now is the time for political courage, to look forward in the interests of all communities. Meanwhile the debate on Irish unity and a unity referendum grows. I am confident that we can build a New United Ireland, a home for all that share this island. That is the big challenge for our generation. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27484  ","story":"• RUC unleashed an unprovoked attack on the crowd with batons Mícheál Mac DonnchaCivil Rights campaigners in Derry had been pressing for a march in their city which had long been a byword for unionist sectarianism and discrimination.Using gerrymandered electoral boundaries and a corrupt voting system which allowed wealthier citizens to have multiple votes in local elections, the unionists maintained a majority of members on the council in a city with a nationalist majority.Nationalists lived in very poor housing conditions and were affected disproportionately by the % unemployment rate in the city.Unionists had long regarded the old walled town as a citadel that could never be surrendered and their dominance was symbolised by the walls towering over the crumbling th century terraced streets of the nationalist Bogside. The last time nationalists had attempted to hold a parade inside the walls was on St Patrick’s Day  – when they were batoned by the RUC.Housing was a massive issue in Derry and the Derry Housing Action Committeeprovided the focus for leadership as the Civil Rights campaign took off. The DHAC had organised a James Connolly commemoration in the city in July  which was banned by the unionist government.The Northern Ireland Civil Rights Associationagreed to hold a march in Derry on  October. The loyalist Apprentice Boys organisation immediately announced a counter-demonstration with the purpose of forcing the unionist government’s hand to ban the Civil Rights march. But the regime at Stormont did not require forcing because the Home Affairs Minister was ultra-unionist William Craig, who promptly imposed the ban.NICRA held an emergency meeting with the DHAC. Many on the NICRA Executive and some Derry nationalist figures, including John Hume, wanted to cancel the march, but the majority of Derry activists were determined to defy the ban. They won out and the march was to proceed as planned.It was a relatively small march, beginning on Craigavon Bridge with several hundred people. The objective was the Diamond in the city centre.The march was stopped in Duke Street by the RUC. A meeting was held with speakers including Gerry Fitt, Betty Sinclair, Eddie McAteer, Ivan Cooper, Austin Currie and Eamonn McCann. Three Westminster Labour MPs were also present.After the meeting, the marchers found themselves hemmed in on all sides by the RUC. They could not disperse and after a tense stand-off the RUC, oblivious to the presence of TV cameras and photographers, unleashed an unprovoked attack on the crowd with batons, boots and fists. Water cannons were then used.Bernadette Devlin McAliskey, then a young People’s Democracy activist, recalled:“Quite deliberately, they hosed in the upstairs windows and shopfronts, and they went right across Craigavon Bridge, hosing all the onlookers. The police just went mad.”The RUC attack in Duke Street brought the Civil Rights struggle in Ireland to a world audience for the first time. It was a complete eye-opener to many people in the  Counties and in Britain. But most profound was its effect on young nationalists.Derry man Mickey Devine , the last of the ten Hunger Strikers to die in the H-Blocks of Long Kesh in , recalled:“Like every young person in Derry, my whole way of thinking was tossed upside down by the events of  October . I didn’t even know there was a Civil Rights march I saw it on television.“But that night I was down the town smashing shop windows and stoning the RUC. I developed an intense hatred of the RUC.

They remain psychologically andpolitically locked into a conflict mind-set even twenty years after the GoodFriday Agreement was signed.The role of British State forces and their agents, a refusal toacknowledge and be accountable for their actions, combined with a disregard forsuccessive binding court rulings, has defined the British state’s approach tolegacy matters.That has been reinforced in recent times by a cynical and narrative, including interventions by the British Prime Minister Theresa May,and British Secretary of State in the north, Karen Bradley, to suggest thatonly state forces were being made subject to legacy investigations.These statements are offensive and wrong, and are an egregiousdemonstration of the partisan nature of British policy towards dealing with thepast.They are consistent with the British practice of denying wrongdoing, concealing the truth, and preventing accountability.This poses a major challenge to ensuring that a robust,independent, and impartial facilitation of the legislative process will emergefrom this consultation on addressing the legacy of the past.All sides suffered, and caused suffering to each other during theconflict.There are multiple narratives regarding our tragic past. There isno single narrative despite the attempts of the British state and politicalunionism to assert otherwise.The past cannot be changed, nor can our shared hurt, suffering andpain be undone. While there may never be agreement on the ious contestednarratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.The Stormont House Agreement, , , set out an agreedframework of legacy mechanisms which provided an unprecedented opportunity tocomprehensively deal with the past in all its aspects.Subsequent draft legislation reneged on the British government’sobligations under the SHA by introducing a national security veto, which hadthe effect of blocking a way forward on the issue of legacy.Full implementation of the SHA on a human rights compliant basispresents the best opportunity to deal with the legacy of our past and guaranteea framework which is victim centred.Facilitation of any future legislative process will require thatthe British government must ensure all victims are treated with equality,respect and dignity that the legislation reflects the policy intent of theAgreement and, that the legacy architecture is fully independent, human rightscompliant, and properly resourced and funded.The following key principles should be central to the operation offuture legacy legislation and mechanisms.-          Allprocesses should be victim centred-          Allprocesses must secure the co-operation of all relevant parties to ensuresuccess-          Allprocesses should be based upon equality, respect, and dignity-          Allprocesses must be free from political interference and be absolutelyindependent-         Acknowledgement should be central to the operation of the legacy framework-          The aim ofthat framework should be to enable reconciliation and healing within widersocietyIf there is to be a collective and comprehensive engagement withthe past in a human rights compliant manner, there can be no hierarchy ofvictimhood or humanity.There must be no change to the definition of a victim.High-quality services should be provided to all victims at thepoint of need.This should extend to the immediate provision of a pension for allseriously and psychologically injured during the conflict.The British Government should also immediately release therequired funding to resource the Lord Chief Justice’s inquest plan, as aseparate distinct process from any new legacy mechanisms.The Office of the Police Ombudsman should be adequately andimmediately resourced.Any attempt by the British state to introduce a statute oflimitations to protect its forces and agents would be a violation of the SHA and must be opposed.Full participation and unfettered disclosure by British stateforces and its agents with the legacy mechanisms will be essential to achievefull public confidence in their ability to deliver on behalf of all society.Periodic reviews should be carried out to inform the extent offunding requirements and necessary timeframe, for all legacy mechanisms.Legacy processes should not be limited or impeded by closedmaterial proceedings. In addition, for future legacy mechanisms toasintended, it is essential families are given full access to legal aid.The legacy legislation which ultimately emerges from theconsultation must comply with the policy intent of the SHA by:-          Promotingreconciliation-          Upholdingthe rule of law-         Acknowledging and addressing the suffering of all victims and survivors-         Facilitating the pursuit of justice and information recovery-          Beinghuman rights compliant-          Beingbalanced, proportionate, transparent, accountable, fair, and equalThe full implementation of that Agreement representsthe best potential and opportunity to address the legacy of our politicalconflict and the suffering experienced by everyone during the conflict inIreland, Britain and beyond. So, it is now time to finally deal with the past.  It is time tobuild for the future. It is time to lay the foundations for reconciliation andhealing, and to open up a new phase of the peace process. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27486  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National Chairperson“The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office”Ive been wondering lately whether anyone in Democratic Unionist Partyleadership circles actually try to reflect upon what republicans, nationalists, and other progressive minded citizens think about the current political situation.Do they even care what others think The evidence suggests not.Several days ago the DUP leader pronounced that her party could and would change the Good Friday Agreementat a whim. There was no hint of irony in her claim – the DUP has spent the last  years opposing the GFA, ever since it was signed.In another extraordinary, but not untypical, outburst she declared her blood red line position on Brexit and, that in the same week as the consultation on dealing with the past was concluding!Of course the DUP leader, and other key figures have form in making offensive and provocative political interventions.Her dehumanising description of republicans as \"crocodiles\" in  comes to mind.Notably, she previously called republican and nationalist Ministers in a ing Executive ‘rogues and renegades.Only the DUP knows whether this leader is naturally predisposed to being rhetorically gaffe prone, or is being deliberately offensive.Perhaps some figures in the DUP do think about wider opinion: the DUP is not a monolith after all.But, those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power sharing.  They oppose equality and rights, and reject reconciliation.Instead they have chosen to join forces with the extremists in the British Tory party to help steer the Brexit train wreck.The DUP leadership is living in a delusional bubble.Meanwhile, the party brand has become indistinguishable from the financial scandals of recent years such as Red Sky, NAMA, Brexit dark money, and financial relationships with Sri Lanka.The ongoing RHI inquiry exposé of how the DUP behaved in government makes a complete mockery of its purported adherence to good governance’.The party MPs have become power drunk through their pact with the Tories, and a serious misconception that they are king makers in Westminster.  Edward Carsons cautionary words have clearly been forgotten or disregarded.  He warnedWhat a fool I was.  I was only a puppet, and so was Ulster… in the political game that was to get the Conservative party into power.’ The DUP has a tactical approach towards everything including maintaining the status quo on its own terms, slowing down and frustrating progressive societal change, and maintaining sectarian dominance within the unionist constituency.The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office.  Its inability and refusal to embrace dference or celebrate ersity is reflected in an institutionalised bigotry against, and intolerance towards the Irish national identity and cultural traditions, and LGBT rights.The partys contempt and sharp practice in government has destroyed wider public confidence in the political institutions, and led to the decisive tipping point of RHI and withdrawal of the Líofa grant scheme in the winter of .As a result of its ingrained arrogance and lack of political humility the DUP leadership is constantly in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarianism, homophobia, and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists, and many others, including sections of civic unionism, do not believe the DUP is serious about restoring genuine power sharing. These citizens want the institutions to be restored, but not at the risk of allowing the DUP to continue practicing discrimination, disrespect, intimidation, bigotry, and sharp practice. They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power on that basis.  And, neither will Sinn Féin.The DUPs behaviour, and the onslaught of Brexit have together brought back graphically into focus the denial of rights which resulted in the Civil Rights Movement fty years ago.A generational realignment has occurred within northern nationalism.Acht Gaeilge, marriage equality, womens reproductive health rights, legacy justice rights, and the demand for a Bill of Rights are the modern day acid test equivalents of one person, one vote.  The current crisis in the north of Ireland is the visceral culmination of  years of DUP push back against the GFA.Intoxicated with its imaginary power at Westminster, the DUP leadership has finally over played its hand. The political institutions could have been re-established by the th February last, but the DUP leaders walked out of negotiations.Instead of selling the deal which they negotiated in February with Sinn Féin, the DUP leader, deputy leader, party chief executive, and its senior talks team bottled out.Since then the party has been convulsed with the resultant internal fall out.  There has been no meaningful contact with Sinn Féin, and absolutely no willingness demonstrated to resume negotiations.Any advocacy of blood red lines is a total anathema to democracy.The wider nationalist constituency is fed up to the back teeth with the subversion of the political process by the DUP, the British Tory government and others in political unionism.It is more impatient than ever for equality, rights and parity of esteem.  The history of  is being replayed. Thousands marching from Duke Street in Derry city on Saturday th October to mark the iconic civil rights march  years before is the latest example of that.  An exciting momentum for change is taking place across Ireland, north and south.  Old orthodoxies are being eclipsed by discussions about new, modern, all-Ireland constitutional and political arrangements. The permanent unionist electoral majority is gone and demographic changes are irreversible.All of this puts the onus back upon both governments to act decisively to address the denial of rights.The Irish government needs to take the lead because for now the DUP has this British government over a barrel.  But thats a short-term situation.  A British general election in the immediate to mid term cannot be ruled out.A new political discourse has begun about the future. All sections of society need to be involved in this and the unionist is critical in all of this.Brexit, the GFA, citizens rights, and an Irish unity referendum are central to that. Progressives should explore common ground and alliances for change.Republicans and unionists need to start to face the same way.  We have to begin looking at each other through eyes of the future.The benchmarks of a rights-based society guaranteeing civil and religious liberties and equality for all, are set.  These are not negotiable.So, whoever is actually in charge of the DUP for the time being has a lot of serious thinking to do...Who now leads the DUP  Do they have the authority to negotiate and stick to an agreement Are they committed to a shared future with republicans, nationalists, and others in the north Unless, and until the DUP can clearly answer these questions for the rest of society, it will remain exactly where it is now – out of power, and facing the inevitable fate about which Carson warned: getting dumped by the British Tories.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27487  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaThe Liberal Party was in government in Britain and had introduced the Home Rule Bill with the support of the Irish nationalist MPs in Westminster. They had abolished the veto of the House of Lords and Home Rule was due to be implemented in . The Tories seized on the issue of Home Rule as the most effective weapon to bring down the Liberals. Leading members of the British landed aristocracy, capitalists and senior military figures jumped on the bandwagon and backed up Unionist leader Edward Carson with threats of civil warHome Rule was brought in.Amidst the political frenzy there were very few Protestants in Ulster who were prepared to oppose Carsonism. But there were some and among them was the Reverend J.B. Armour of Ballymoney, County Antrim. A minister of the Presbyterian Church, Armour stood out from most of his co-religionists in advocating self-government for Ireland. In , he opposed a resolution at the Presbyterian General Assembly condemning Gladstone’s second Home Rule Bill. He was also a strong critic of landlordism.In , he again opposed a resolution against Home Rule at the Presbyterian General Assembly.Calling for freedom of conscience for Protestants to support or oppose Home Rule, Armour slammed the intolerance of Carsonism when he told the assembly:“If you deny the right of private judgment and of free speech, how much do you have of Protestantism worth keeping  Nothing at all.”Armour organised a public meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney to support Home Rule and oppose Carsonism. Banners in the hall proclaimed “No provisional or provincial government for us” and “Ulster for Ireland and Ireland for us”.The resolution stated that the meeting of Protestants of Ballymoney and the protests in The Route“against the claim of Sir Edward Carson and the self-constituted Provisional Government of Ulster to represent the Protestant community of north-east Ulster” and “disputes the narrow claim that dferences of creed necessarily separate Irishmen and women into hostile camps”. Among the speakers at the Ballymoney meeting were JB Armour himself, historian Alice Stopford Green, Jack White, son of a British Army general and later a leading figure in the Irish Citizen Army, and Roger Casement, who was executed in . This was Casement’s first appearance on a political . With his Antrim family background, Casement regarded the occasion as hugely signicant and in his speech he denounced any notion of partitioning Ireland. The meeting was a once-off and failed to turn the tide of Carsonism but it did show that a signicant minority of Protestants in the North-East were still prepared to stand up for Irish unity and self-government. The meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney in support of Irish self-government was held on  October ,  years ago this week. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27490  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonThe labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.- Declan KearneyLast weekend the Irish Congress of Trades Unionsand Irish Labour History Society organised a conference to commemorate William Walker in Belfast.Walker was an anti-Home Rule unionist who was a leader in the Belfast Independent Labour Partyin the early twentieth century.When James Connolly, Irelands most signicant historical, socialist republican leader called on the ILPs membership to support socialist unity in Ireland, his appeal provoked a rebuke from Walker.This led to a robust debate between both figures in the pages of Forward between May and July .Their debate came to be known as the Connolly Walker controversy and later became an historical reference point for the anti-imperialist struggle in Ireland.I participated in a  alongside veteran trade unionist Joe Bowers, Ulster Unionist councillor Chris Mc Gimpsey, and ICTU Assistant General Secretary, Owen Reidy, to discuss the post Walker years and the current situation in the north.Not surprisingly we delivered four very dferent perspectives on Walker and his legacy as well as, Brexit the north strategy and politics on the Left and, future prospects.A very challenging but fraternal debate ensued between the lists and the audience.I opened my comments by saying that any consideration today of William Walker’s legacy needs to be within the historic and contemporary reality that the advancement of socialist and Labour politics has been held back due to the effects of British colonial policy in Ireland.He was a product of his native Belfast and directly influenced by the communal environment within which he grew up.He was a protestant in a largely protestant workforce. Sectarianism in the late s and early s stalked Belfast.While Walker was severely limited in his political analysis he was committed to improving the conditions of his fellow workers.He is an integral part of Belfast’s industrial history and his contribution to the city’s labour heritage deserves recognition.British policy in Ireland and its consequences for Irish society has ided Irish workers along communal lines. It has paralysed the labour movement from effectively challenging partition and championing the strategic aim of Irish unity.Partition is the central fault line at the heart of Irish society and politics.Sectarianism remains a visceral blight in this state.Following partition, it was used by the ruling unionist elite to cement the foundation of the state and prevent unity among citizens on issues of common concern.The fact is Labour was indeed told to wait as the resurgent struggle for national independence grew in momentum just over  years ago.The counter revolution which took place post partition represented a strategic setback for labour and working-class interests in the new free state.It eclipsed the seminal influence which socialist republicanism had on the  Proclamation and the Democratic Programme of the First Dáil.The rights of workers became subservient to the conservative elites, north and south.However, sections of the labour movement were compliant with British policy in Ireland and the imposition of partition.That was personied in the political thinking of Walker and others pre partition.This tendency opposed Connollys core position that \"the two currents of revolutionary thought in Ireland, the socialist and the national, were not antagonistic but complementary\".Walkers debate with Connolly reflected a key contradiction inherent in the Irish labour movement and its relationship with the Irish national liberation struggle, and anti-imperialism generally.That contradiction has existed ever since.Walkers brand of ‘Municipal Socialism’ was in reality a euphemism for self-imposed strategic and political limitations which went on to define the Trade Union movement in the north.As a result, the Irish labour movement, particularly in the north has failed to challenge partition and modern British political policy towards Ireland.Partition has been an abject failure. It was never designed to make the northern state a political or economic success.From the beginning this state has carried within it the conditions of inherent instability.It was built upon institutionalised and structural sectarianism which ensured that a substantial minority was destined never to be treated as equals.The Civil Rights Movement fty years ago exposed the inability of the unionist state to treat the minority as equals.That belligerent opposition from powerful sections within political unionism against reform of the northern state persists today in the form of political unionism, and specically DUP hostility towards implementation of the Good Friday Agreementsince .Refusal by the DUP to embrace a rights-based society and equality, culminated in the collapse of the GFA political institutions in January , and our associated political crisis which has continued since then. Those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power-sharing.The party brand is now indistinguishable from financial scandal and sharp practice in government.As a party, the DUP is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic reforms, social modernity, and standards in public office.Its project is negative and tactical, and entirely focused upon slowing down and blocking progressive change, while maintaining a sectarian hegemony within the unionist constituency.The DUP is in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarian, homophobic and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists and many others, including sections of civic unionism, have concluded that the DUP has had its chance and cannot now be trusted in government.They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power at the risk of allowing it to continue practicing discrimination, intimidation, bigotry, or sharp practice.The enduring political crisis is accentuated by systemic structural weaknesses in the regional economy.The required investment in local public services and protection of workers’ rights are confronted with a combination of Tory austerity and Brexit.Pressures on public services are intensying.The regional block grant, or public expenditure settlement, has been reduced by .%.Real term cuts to public funding are now factored into future budget profiles alongside ·         Actual net cuts in take home pay for public and private sector workers·         Welfare cuts and the universal social charge·         Higher inflation and living costs, adults in working families live in relative povertyAverage wages in the north remain lower than ten years ago.Precarious working conditions, zero hours’ contracts, and the scam of bogus self-employment used by some employers are in common practice.Workers’ rights and protections are being systematically reversed.The onset of Brexit will be a catastrophe for the regional and island economiesIt will deepen an existing race to the bottom by further undermining the potential for economic growth, and new investment.The Brexit agenda, twinned with Tory austerity threaten jobs across all economic sectors, workers’ terms and conditions, and, any potential for sustainable public services in the north.The dawning political and economic reality is that Brexit has changed everything.It has exposed the negative role that partition continues to play in Irish affairs, and the fundamentally anti-democratic nature of the union with Britain.  The British state has been pushed into an unprecedented, existential political crisis.Brexit is a train wreck being jointly steered by the DUP and extremists in the British Tory party.But it also has become a defining moment for these islands.A new generation is questioning partition.There has been a seismic sht in the ambitions and expectations of citizens in the north.A new political discourse has begun about the future of Ireland north and south, and our relationships with Britain and EuropeThe debate on Irish unity and the timing of a unity referendum have moved centre stage.The time has come for a fundamental paradigm sht in British government policy towards Ireland.The Irish government needs to begin preparing constitutional, political and economic transition towards Irish Unity.It should facilitate an open, inclusive national conversation involving all citizens, political parties, social partners, and civic society.That is a dialogue about our collective future on this island which addresses all the concerns, accommodations and compromises relevant to negotiating a new, all Ireland, constitutional, pluralist democracy.Today this new focus upon Irish unity provides Irish trade unionists and workers with an opportunity to influence the debate about future constitutional and political change.Previous moments of political change have required that labour should wait.The emerging challenge for the Irish labour movement north and south is to engage with this emerging discussion.To paraphrase Connolly in his opening contributions to the Connolly Walker debate\"Constitutional change then is almost a certainty of the future.”The labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.I said to the Belfast conference this reality will require Irish trade unionists to take strategic positions on supporting an Irish unity referendum and then to campaign positively for constitutional change.On Monday of this week I reiterated that opinion when I met Patricia King, General Secretary of ICTU in Dublin.Of course, this will be a challenging discussion for the Irish labour movement, as comrades noted both during and after the plenary discussion. But it should not be feared or avoided.Today in modern Ireland there is a battle for hearts and minds about how society is organisedThe status quo has failed us all.Connolly’s vision of a united Ireland which serves the interests of the many instead of the few will not be wished into existence.Labour should not wait again.The Irish labour movement needs to assert itself on the Irish unity debate by introducing a progressive labour agenda to the unfolding discourse on future constitutional and political change.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27491  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaThe writer, newspaper editor and Irish republican Seumas O’Kelly was a native of Loughrea, County Galway. Author of short stories, plays, poems and a novel, The Weaver’s Grave which was his masterpiece, O’Kelly’s le was cut short because of his commitment to Irish freedom. The O’Kelly family of Loughrea were flour millers and merchants and Seumas received a good education. He was a fellow student of James Joyce in University College Dublin. There is a remarkable photograph of the BA degree class of  including Joyce, O’Kelly and George Clancy. Like O’Kelly, George Clancy, a close friend of Joyce, was to die a tragic death. He was Sinn Féin Mayor of Limerick when on  March  he was murdered in his home by the Black and Tans, on the same night as former Mayor Michael O’Callaghan. Seumas O’Kelly was a committed republican from an early age. He is recorded as one of those to the fore in the centenary commemorations of the  Rising in . He was writing for Arthur Grfith’s Irish Republican Brotherhood-funded newspaper The United Irishman from  and for its successor Sinn Féin from . While a full list of attendees is not available it is probable that he was at the founding meeting of Sinn Féin in November . In  O’Kelly was appointed editor of the Leinster Leader in Naas, County Kildare. He founded a branch of Conradh na Gaeilge in the town and was active in Sinn Féin locally. He welcomed republicans to his home during the annual Wolfe Tone commemorations in nearby Bodenstown. O’Kelly’s first book of stories was published in  and his first play was produced the following year. Several of his plays were produced at the Abbey Theatre. Constantly busy with literary and journalistic work, O’Kelly was subject to poor health. He joined Óglaigh na hÉireann when they were founded in  but was unable to play an active military role. His brother was a Volunteer and was jailed in England after the  Rising. The paper Nationality, edited by Grfith, was established in  and O’Kelly was one of its writers. It was the main organ of Sinn Féin during the  and  by-elections. In May  Grfith was arrested and jailed in England and O’Kelly took over as editor of Nationality. Following the  November  Armistice which ended the First World War, British soldiers and loyalists ran riot through the streets of Dublin, attacking suspected Sinn Féin supporters. On the night of  November a crowd of drunken soldiers invaded the Sinn Féin Ard Oig at  Harcourt Street . Seumas O’Kelly was at his desk in the Nationality office and tried to defend himself with his walking stick. The office was wrecked and O’Kelly collapsed. He was brought to Jervis Street Hospital where he died of a brain haemorrhage. Seumas O’Kelly was honoured with a republican funeral to Glasnevin Cemetery, attended by huge crowds. He died on  November ,  years ago this week.  test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27492  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaAt the start of the th century women began to campaign actively against the denial of their right to vote. In  the Women’s Social and Political Union was founded in England and the militant feminists commenced the battle for the vote. In Ireland there had been groups working for women’s suffrage but the campaign really began here on the instigation of Hanna Sheehy Skeffington and Margaret Cousins. Margaret Cousins came from a unionist family in Dublin but she later wrote: “I belonged in my heart from the beginning to the fighters for freedom.” Her husband James Cousins also rejected the unionism of his background and became involved in the Gaelic revival. Margaret came into contact with the women’s movement in England in . On herto Ireland she co-operated with a remarkable young woman who was to make her mark on Irish history. Hanna Sheehy was the daughter of a Fenian, David Sheehy, who took part in the  Rising and was elected as a Parnellite MP in . Hanna was an exceptional student and excelled academically despite the restrictions on women’s access to education she achieved a first class honours MA in . She became a teacher and married Francis Skeffington. In line with their shared feminist principles they adopted each other’s surnames. Francis resigned his post as registrar of University College because the authorities refused to register women on the same basis as men. In  Hanna and Margaret founded the Irish Women’s Franchise League , with the active support of both Francis Sheehy Skeffington and James Cousins. From the beginning they stressed that the IWFL would address the specic needs of Irish women in “a subject country seeking freedom from England” and would “work on independent Irish lines”. Margaret Cousins described the IWFL’s position: “Its policy was to educate by all forms of propaganda the men, women and children of Ireland to understand and support the members of the League in their demand for votes for women, and to obtain pledges from every Irish Member of Parliament to vote for Women’s Suffrage Bills introduced in the British Houses of Parliament, and to include Women’s Suffrage in any Irish Home Rule Bill.” The IWFL campaigned throughout the country and made an impact beyond their numbers of about  activists. Not all militant women agreed with the IWFL’s tactics the republican group Inghinidhe na hÉireann refused to join in lobbying the British parliament, preferring to “organise a women’s movement on Sinn Féin lines, or on lines even broader still”. Despite this dference, republican women such as Constance Markievicz played an active role in the IWFL’s work and Hanna Sheehy Skeffington herself was strongly republican. Markievicz urged young Irishwomen to prepare to fight: “Arm yourselves with weapons to fight your nation’s cause. Arm your souls with noble and free ideas. Arm your minds with the histories and memories of your country and her martyrs, her language, and a knowledge of her arts and industries. Andin your day the call should come for your body to arm, do not shirk from that either.” Markievicz said Irishwomen were “doubly enslaved with a double battle to fight”. Following the  general election the Irish Party at Westminster was in a position to press the Liberal government to publish a Home Rule Bill. But Redmond and his party still refused to support women’s right to vote. The IWFL became more militant and Hanna and Francis founded the Irish Citizen newspaper to further the cause of women’s rights as well as Irish independence, social justice and pacism. When British politicians visited Ireland they were challenged by the IWFL. Margaret ‘Meg’ Connery confronted British Tory leader Andrew Bonar Law and Unionist leader Edward Carson when they came to Dublin. In Belfast Hanna Sheehy Skeffington challenged Winston Churchill. Margaret Cousins joined protests in England in  and was jailed for a month. In June  eight women from the IWFL smashed windows in Dublin Castle and other prominent buildings. Hanna was arrested at the Castle and she and the seven others were imprisoned in Mountjoy. The following month British Prime Minister Asquith visited Dublin and there were more protests. Three English feminists had followed Asquith to Ireland and they were also jailed for their protests. After a hunger strike in Mountjoy by the English suffragists and the IWFL women, all were released except two of the Englishwomen who were subjected to forced feeding. Many meetings of the IWFL were physically attacked at this time by Redmondites who saw the campaign for women’s suffrage as a threat to their political dominance and their relationship with the British Liberal government. In contrast, republicans such as Pádraig Mac Piarais and Thomas MacDonagh were supporters of the IWFL. The IWFL also won the support of prominent trade unionists James Larkin and James Connolly. They were closely allied with the Irish Women Workers Union in Liberty Hall and in  Hanna Sheehy Skeffington was jailed after a confrontation with the Dublin politan Police during the Great Lockout. She was released after a six-day hunger strike. That year also saw the death in England of feminist Emily Davison who ran on to the course at the Epsom Derby and was trampled by a race horse. Hanna Sheehy Skeffington was jailed again in  for campaigning against recruitment to the British Army. Her influence and that of the IWFL was seen in the Proclamation of the Irish Republic of  which enshrined women’s right to vote. Her friend James Connolly told her: “You will be glad to know that in the Proclamation of the Irish Republic we are including equal citizenship for women.” Hanna replied that she knew who was responsible, meaning Connolly himself. “We were practically unanimous, Only one questioned it,” replied Connolly. Francis Sheehy Skeffington was murdered in Portobello Barracks by a British Army officer during the Easter Rising. Hanna embarked on a tour of the United States to expose the truth about the murder and other British atrocities. She continued to play a leading role in the struggle for Irish freedom, as did many of the pioneering feminists of the IWFL. In  the IWFL saw its central aim achieved when women voted for the first time in the general election which resulted in a massive Sinn Féin victory, although women under  were still excluded.

They must not be allowed to destroy the democratic option for making change in the north. - Declan Kearney MLAThe publication of an open letter to An Taoiseach, LeoVaradkar from over one thousand signatories in the Irish News is a powerfulintervention supporting the rights of Irish citizens in the north of Ireland. December that Irish citizens in the north “would never again be left behind by anIrish government”.These Irish citizens have explicitly urged Leo Varadkar toadhere to his expressed commitment from last year, “and to redouble yourefforts, and the efforts of your government to ensure that our rights areprotected”.Their intervention comes at a time of deepening politicalcrisis, and increased uncertainty and instability caused by the continueddenial of citizens’ rights, and the fast approaching Brexit catastrophe.This initiative indicates the frustration and anger amongrepublicans and nationalists and other progressive minded people about thedenial of rights here, and which are taken for granted where throughoutthese islands.It is outrageous that the northern state remains a rightsback water where language, marriage equality, womens reproductive health andlegacy justice rights, as well as a Bill of Rights are blocked.Northern nationalists are absolutely incensed with thecontinued denial of democracy and democratic rights.They are not prepared to put up with their Irish identitybeing treated with disrespect and contempt.Some of the signatories who have backed this highlysignicant intervention were active supporters of, and participants in theoriginal Civil Rights Movement  years ago.But many more are the children and grandchildren of those whocampaigned and marched in support of modest civil rights reforms and who werebeaten and shot off the streets and roads in the north because the unioniststate refused to deliver equality and rights.These citizens reflect the ersity, depth, confidence andstrength of those who identy as Irish citizens in the north.They represent tens of thousands of others in the north, andfrom right across Ireland, who have invested in the promise and ambition of theIrish Peace Process and Good Friday Agreement . They are articulatingthe voice of a progressive silent majority.However, they also persony a fundamental realignment withinnationalist and progressive opinion, including some sections of civic unionism.A new dangerous tipping point has been created in thepolitical process due to the destructive bigotry of the DUP the combinedefforts of both the DUP and British Government to systematically undermine theGFA, and to impose Brexit and, as a result of their toxic pact.The GFA guaranteed the delivery of equality, rights, parityof esteem and mutual respect.The DUP and others in political unionism have consistentlyopposed it from .Twenty years after the signing of the GFA it has still to befully implemented despite its status as an internationally binding agreement whichhas been laid with the United Nations.As a consequence, both the British and Irish Governments haveobligations as co-guarantors to ensure its implementation.However, the British Tory government turned its back on theGFA since it took power in .Now the DUP, British government and the most extreme elementsin political unionism are engaged in a full frontal assault against theAgreement. Brexit is the antithesis of the GFA.Its imposition will deepen the rights deficit in the northand will further destabilise the political process.That reality goes to the very heart of the existing politicalcrisis in the North, and which blocks the political institutions from beingre-established.A wreckers’ agenda is being driven by the DUP and Torygovernment. They must not be allowed to destroy the democratic option formaking change in the north.It is these circumstances which bring sharply into focus theIrish governments responsibilities.Those who courageously signed this letter to the Irish government are saying the negative position of the DUP and British governmentmust not be tolerated.These are citizens who want the political institutionsre-established but only on the basis of democracy and equality.They are assertive in their resolve to see a rights basedsociety created, which guarantees rights, respect, and parity of esteem, in ashared, inclusive future.But they are not prepared to be treated as second-classcitizens in this part of Ireland.Those days are over.It is time for the Irish Government to indeed redouble itsefforts to step up to the mark by absolutely opposing the imposition ofBrexit, and guaranteeing equality and rights for all citizens in the north.An Taoiseach and the Irish Government needs to reflect verycarefully about the signicance and timing of this intervention, respondpositively and act decisively, in cooperation with the politicalrepresentatives of Irish citizens, and others in the north, to ensure thattheir democratic rights are delivered upon.test"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.ballymenatimes.com/webimage/1.8695614.1541521803!/image/image.jpg","title":"irish language group funding snub claim rejected by dup","story":"A DUP councillor has rejected claims that unionists #snubbed# a request to fund an Irish language event.Irish language group Conradh na Gaeilge submitted a request to Mid and East Antrim Council to fund an event as part of Seachtain na Gaeilge , which takes place each March.Sinn Fein councillor Patrice Hardy claimed unionist councillors had “refused to even countenance” the request, adding: “Seachtain na Gaeilge is a hugely positive, global event which this council should be supporting rather than snubbing. “The Irish language community aren’t seeking special treatment, they are only seeking equality.”Last year, Ms Hardy accused the council of being “anti-Irish to the core”, after a move to have the local authority participate in Irish Language Week was rejected following a vote by members. In a statement yesterday, she added: “Despite all the controversy over the previous refusal to fund Seachtain na Gaeilge or even to engage with the Irish language community to discuss this, it appears that some members of the council have learned nothing.”But DUP Councillor Gregg McKeen said Conradh na Gaelige had been treated “the same as any other group” who had made a funding request, by pointing them towards the council’s grants programme.He told the News Letter: “They will be assessed under the same criteria as everyone . It is not that they are being refused funding, but they need to go through the same process as everyone .

Boyle, Chief Executive of Ballymena Business Centre. The project is part funded by Invest Northern Ireland and the European Regional Development Fund under the Investment for Growth  Jobs Northern IrelandProgramme.I used to be a childminder and had two young children and didnrsquot think it was possible for me to get into the beauty business - but then I went back to college and studied beauty at the Roberta Mechan College, she said.I have a real interest in health and well-being and wanted to offer these services to others. I opened in April this year and I currently offer specialist skincare, nails, massage and waxing.Helen turned her dream into a reality after taking part in the Go For It Programme which is delivered free of charge by a team of experienced business mentors through Northern Irelandrsquos wide network of enterprise agencies.It provides expert advice and help with developing a robust business plan to help turn ideas into a commercial enterprise.Commenting on the success of the programme, Helen said: Often it is hard to know where to start that was my experience before starting the Go For It Programme. The support and guidance offered through it helped me fine tune my business idea from concept to working reality.They helped me with practical things in the early stages like setting out a business plan and doing a detailed analysis. It was great for helping me to budget and forward plan.ldquoI would urge anyone who has ever had the idea of starting up their own business, or evenyou have just started operating your own business to apply for a place on the Go For It Programme. The skills and knowledge imparted is beyond the realms of what you could achieve on your own.Melanie Christie Boyle, Chief Executive of Ballymena Business Centre, on behalf of Mid and East Antrim and Borough Council, added: ldquoHelen joined the Go For It Programme driven by a desire to launch her very own beauty business, driven by a passion to help women improve their skin and help them feel good about themselves.Helen undertook an intensive beauty course under tutelage of an industry expert with a clear vision and motivation to open her own salon as soon as she completed her examinations.We worked with Helen to develop a business plan, focusing on key areas such as defining her service provision, marketing and financial forecasting, as well as helping her secure commercial premises at Ballee and Harryville Community Enterprise Centre.It is great to see how Helen has progressed her business in such as short space of time, building a loyal customer base and a excellent reputation for her quality customer service and using only the very best range of products.If you have a business idea yoursquod like to develop oryou are thinking about starting a business call    or visit: visit www.goforitni.

The grieving Newry woman had planned to travel to England to live with the GAA player, where he was due to begin a teaching course.But tragedy struck when Karl was travelling home from GAA training on the section of carriageway between Banbridge and Dromore.\"We were together for three-and-a-half years and had planned to move over to London,\" Ciara told the Belfast .She said Karl usually didnt want to \"jinx\" himself by getting too excited about their plans.\"But even he was believing in himself and believing that it was what he deserved. He deserved his chance to be a PE teacher,\" she added.The latest victims on the road were an -year-old man and his -year-old stepdaughter last month.Six months on from the tragedy, Ciara said lack of meaningful communication between the Department for Infrastructure and Karls family prompted the petition.More than , people have signed it within the space of a few days. A Facebook page: A: How Many Must Die  has also been created.Ciara added: \"If the road was in the best possible shape it could be, we dont think accidents would happen as much as they do.\"Gap junctions have been a major cause of concern on the A.

We, therefore, appreciate your stated determination that the border will not become an impediment to the movement of people, goods and services. The border has signicance for the agri-food sector and animal health..push\"Its critical to our economy that our businesses, both indigenous and FDI companies, retain their competitiveness and do not incur additional costs. We, therefore, need to retain as far as possible the ease with which we currently trade with EU member states and, importantly, retain access to labour - unskilled as well as skilled.\"This not only applies to the private sector, but also to the public sector, who are heavily dependent on EU and other migrant labour. Energy is another key priority... nothing in the negotiation process should undermine this vital aspect of our economy. Our agri-food sector - and hence our wider economy - is uniquely vulnerable to the loss of EU funding and potential tarf and non-tarf barriers to trade.\"The above comments are not from the keyboard of some cappuccino-supping liberal, or lettuce-munching Leftie. No, they are excerpts written from the desk of none other than the former First Minister, DUP leader Arlene Foster, on behalf of the Executive Office and co-signed by the late Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness on August , .The letter is not only addressed to the Prime Minister, but to others, including the-then leading Brexit-supporting ministers Boris Johnson, David Davis, Andrea Leadsom and Liam Fox.Words, as we know, matter and those that leap from that letter are those which emphasise the Brexit impact on Northern Ireland: unique dficulties impediment signicance priority. It also identies the need for access to labour, free movement of people, goods and services, retention of the ease of access as we currently have when trading with the EU member states, the importance of our particular energy needs and the impact on our agri-food sector.The DUP has never resiled from the contents of that letter. How could it, as it is made up of its wish-list while in office Prime Minister Theresa May knows full-well the contents of the letter. The special case being made for Northern Ireland was not crafted by some wily, unseen bureaucrat in Whitehall - it was concocted at the heart of the DUP-dominated Executive.Northern Irelands special status has even been at the heart of the DUP Tory confidence and supply agreement - how  could you make a case for a £bn bonanza when the place is already subvented by the UK taxpayer to the tune of £bn per annum.The DUP, like unionists of previous generations, is likely to over-play its hand. Those, like Carson and Craig, who thought Ireland wouldnt be partitioned, were wrong those like Chichester-Clark and Harry West, who thought Stormont wouldnt be prorogued, were wrong those like Paisley and Molyneaux, who thought they would face down Thatcher over the Anglo-Irish Agreement, were wrong those that resisted the Good Friday Agreement ended up travelling the world selling it as a template for peace-building.The Prime Minister is in an invidious position. She is faced with unsavoury treachery from within the Tory party and by political blackmail from the DUP.To her credit, she has done nothing, or said anything, so far which impacts on the integrity of the constitutional position of Northern Ireland within the UK.The DUP knows this. It is the type of agitator that starts a fire and then rushes to the scene to put it out.The threat to pull the plug on Mrs May would be a kamikaze act of monumental proportions. A Tory leadership race would take months and the party would pull itself apart. A general election would follow - a general election that the DUP can ill-afford.Anger over Brexit, the outcome of the RHI Inquiry and possibly an inquiry into the Social Investment Fund would give an impetus for the Northern Ireland electorate to choose any candidate but the DUP. Meanwhile, Sinn Fein can sit back and benefit from the ensuing chaos.If the Prime Minister can frame a Brexit deal within the context of that joint letter of August , there will be relief all around from Brussels to Belfast and from Merrion Street to Downing Street.Tom Kelly is a political commentator"},{"url":null,"title":"arlene foster pms brexit plan could see northern ireland separate from uk over next decade","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHomes  InteriorsSeptember CarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It is intended to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland and the EUs Chief Brexit Negotiator Michel Barnier and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar have insisted it must be part of any UK withdrawal agreement.Prime Minister Theresa May has countered the plan by suggesting that the entire UK could remain inside the customs union for a time limited period.However the EU have said that that any backstop could not be time limited, and must remain in place until Brexit issues regarding the future relationship between the UK and the EU are fully resolved.A backstop to the backstop would involve only Northern Ireland remaining tied to the EU in the event that a trade agreement could not be reached within the time limited period.The DUP claim the plan would effectively separate Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK and create a border in the Irish Sea.DUP leader Arlene Foster says no unionist would be able to support British Prime Minister Theresa Mays Brexit plan | Read more: https:t.co VTkYxMKNFW pic DxwUhqueW— RTÉ NewsNovember , Mrs Foster said that the DUP would not be able to support the Prime Ministers plan in Parliament.Mrs May currently relies on the support of ten DUP MPs to get key legislation, including Brexit, through Parliament as part of their confidence and supply agreement.DUP leader Foster suggested that her partys position had support from senior Conservative Party figures saying that Mrs May had \"a job of work to do to get this through cabinet\".Mrs Foster said the plans would cause a \"democratic deficit\" giving the EU power over Northern Ireland, without Northern Ireland having a say and could lead to Northern Ireland \"erging away\" from the UK over the next decade.She told RTE that her party only had \"one red line\" and that they were determined to protect the union.The DUP leader suggested thatMrs May wanted to pursue the current proposals she could so without the support of the DUPs ten MPs."},{"url":null,"title":"arlene foster the intent is to handcuff the uk to the eu with the eu holding the key","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHomes  InteriorsSeptember CarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The desire to produce the right deal can be superseded by the perceived need to produce a deal.This is why all negotiations need measures to prevent this, a check mechanism and preferably multiple ones.With the current UK-EU negotiations, there are two identiable check mechanisms or lines of defence to concluding an unwise agreement - Cabinet and Parliament.Last week, I wrote to the Prime Minister outlining broad concerns about the direction of travel.This could be discerned from shts in public comments, private engagements and what was being briefed in London, Dublin and Brussels. I wrote in the hope of reassurance and with the desire that an acceptable deal for us all was within grasp. Instead, I received confirmation that we were right to be concerned.If what is outlined in the reply is the type of deal the Prime Minister intends to conclude, then the DUP could not support a deal which annexes Northern Ireland from the rest of the United Kingdom.Indeed, many others in Westminster and throughout the United Kingdom, true to their commitments to respect the referendum, the national interest and to the Union, have contacted me to voice their concern.Equally we cannot be assured that this current proposal will be the final deal. The European Union price for agreement appears to rise daily whether it be our fishing industry or an ever growing list of level playing field commitments.Last December when this backstop appeared we were deeply concerned. This is why we sought and got the paragraph  assurance of a democratic protection against a sea border.In March, the EU made clear its intention to ignore paragraph  and rewrite paragraph . We took no solace from our predictions being correct but we did take solace that it was universally rejected.Neither the passage of time nor the application of pressure has made it any more acceptable now.The new idea of a UK customs arrangement does not appear to be a genuinely UK-wide offer but a GB offer and an NI offer badged as one - Northern Ireland in THE EU customs territory and GB in A customs union.The real intent is not to solve any land border issues in Ireland but to handcuff the UK to the EU, with the EU holding the keys. The United Kingdom would be trapped.The focus on customs arrangements should never blind anyone to a sea border of regulations.We certainly did not forget it and why we raised it repeatedly and consistently.It was something the Prime Minister ruled out after Salzburg: \"…no new regulatory barriers should be created between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK unless the Northern Ireland Executive and Assembly agree.\"The limited and low level checks that exist at the moment in Belfast and Larne do not compare to what wo uld be the future arrangement.Key industries in Northern Ireland would be subject to rules and standards with no democratic input to them. Rules would be made in Brussels rather than Stormont or Westminster.The regulatory sea border with some caveats in the Prime Ministers letter is still a sea border.This is not haggling about checks but preventing Northern Ireland from being left in the EU with the Northern Ireland Assembly reduced to vassal status or the devolution settlement torn up.Our most important trade flows are to be hampered and regulated by the EU. Despite all of this a Northern Ireland specic backstop still remains.The Scottish Conservative MP Ross Thomson has rightly warned: \"…Northern Ireland would erge unconsciously from the United Kingdom against the expressed will of its people - it would also feed Scottish nationalist demands that a similar ergent arrangement be made for Scotland.\"The DUP does not stand alone against this proposal. We appreciate the support from MPs across the United Kingdom.We are ready to stand with those in Cabinet and in Parliament to work for a better deal. One which works for the whole United Kingdom. We want the referendum result to be respected and the entire United Kingdom to leave together with a sensible deal.Arlene Foster is leader of the DUP"},{"url":null,"title":"flight out of belfast nosedived 500ft due to","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHomes  InteriorsSeptember CarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

In doing so, we join with people across these islands and across the continent of Europe, and worldwide. An event of impossible human destruction is now commemorated collectively in a powerful symbol of our shared commitment to peace.On this island, it has not always been so. As Irish Parliamentary Party MP Stephen Gwynn said: \"When the time came to rejoice over the wars ending, was there anything more tragic than the position of men who had gone out by the thousands to confront the greatest military power ever known in history, who had fought the war, and won the war, and now looked at each other with doubtful eyes \"That doubtfulness foreshadowed later times when there was too much forgetfulness, neglect or ambivalence in too many quarters about the place of those men and women in the history of this island.However, in the last decades I believe we have seen this transformed. Approaching the centenaries of the last several years, it was by no means clear that we would navigate them in a way that paid proper respect to the part they had in shaping the history, traditions, identities and lived experience of all the people of this island. It was by no means inevitable that we would mark these moments in a way that brought us closer together and gave us a better understanding of one another.Now we can look back and remember together the quiet dignity and shared purpose that characterised the high ceremonies of state of the last number of years. We remember President McAleese and Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth side by side and bowing their heads in respect in both the Garden of Remembrance and in Islandbridge. We remember President Michael D Higgins laying a wreath at the tomb of the unknown soldier in Westminster Abbey during his State visit. We remember the Taoiseach and Prince William together honouring the memories of the th Ulster and th Irish Division under the round tower of the Island of Ireland Peace Park in Messines,  decades after those men fought shoulder to shoulder.Those moments, and the many others like them, were powerful. They opened up new spaces for everyone and inspired us to move into them. Where forgetfulness had built up, they reminded us. Where there was a sense that there was some unseen line that we perhaps should not cross, they swept it away. They left us closer together than we had been.However, they did not do so in isolation and in fact they did not lead the way. They built on the imaginative and patient work of a generation of people - professional and amateur historians, community leaders, church leaders, journalists, campaigners, and others from all parts of this island - who had refused to accept the articial parcelling out of a shared history to dferent groups and traditions, but wanted us to remember the lives and loss of the sons of Ulster, Leinster, Connacht and Munster all. They built on the work of all those who were not only open to new ideas and stories, new partners and audiences, but sought them out.I have been glad and proud that the Reconciliation Fund in my own department has been able in a small way to support dozens of projects in that spirit in Northern Ireland and where.As always, such transformation and such achievements must be built onthey are to be preserved at all. For the island of Ireland, the decade of centenaries of events that shaped our modern history continues. We will again have to rise to the challenge of remembering those events in our shared history in a way that is authentic and honest and rigorous and respectful of others. We have to do it in a way that enhances our understanding of our history, and our understanding of each other.We have to do all this while finding our way through the political challenges of the moment. I am confident we will. What we have done together in the last few years has shown that we can.In the Summer of , Tom Kettle wrote to his family promising, \" I live I mean to spend the rest of my le working for perpetual peace\". Eleven days later he was cut down while leading his men of the th Royal Dublin Fusiliers in what was described as a \"tempest of fire\" in Ginchy in France.We owe it to him and all the youth of his generation to take up that promise.Simon Coveney TD, Tanaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade"},{"url":null,"title":"200 acre site outskirts derry identified preferred location new

Those responsible have branded by the local politician as ldquogrossly irresponsible.Cllr Curran described those who engage in such behaviour as ldquoselfless, reminding them that they are guilty of an environmental crime by dumping their waste in unauthorised areas.There are a number of illegal dumping hot spots across the district with the Downpatrick councillor suggesting the mentality of those responsible is particularly dficult to fathom.ldquoI cannot understand why people do not make use of household waste centres in Downpatrick, Castlewellan and Ballynahinch, declared Cllr Curran.ldquoThe mentality of those who dump waste along rural roads is beyond me. What puzzles me most is that people who engage in this activity end up paying for its removal through their rates bills. They are literally costing themselves money, but that does not appear to register with them.Cllr Curran said there was no excuse for illegal dumping as there were so many ways for people to dispose of their waste legally and safely.ldquoFly tipping and illegal dumping results in a blot on the landscape and is an image no one wants to see. I firmly believe that those responsible for despicable behaviour should feel the full force of the law, otherwise this activity will continue, he warned.ldquoIllegal waste can range from bin bags dumped at the side of the road to old household furniture, rubble or old trees. For a modest fee, bulk waste can be collected outside peoplersquos homes.ldquoFor the le of me I do not understand why people are prepared to load up their vehicles and drive to secluded, rural areas to get rid of household waste. Why not just drive to one of the three household centres in our district Cllr Curran said local council officials were placing increasing emphasis on promoting the district as a major tourist destination and the last thing they wanted to see was roads littered with waste.He added: ldquoThe message must go out that illegal dumping is unacceptable and that the countryside and indeed town centres must be respected, not used as open air dumps by people who should know better.ldquoWe are fortunate to live in a stunningly beautul area which should not be blighted by the reprehensible actions of a mindless few. Our rural areas in particular must be respected, not used as open air dumping grounds..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballycran have it all to do in final  ","story":"BALLYCRANrsquoS hurlers are hoping that history repeats itself at the Athletic Grounds in Armagh on Sunday when they take on Cushendall in the Ulster Club Hurling Championship final.Itrsquos  years since the McKenna Park side last lted the Four Seasons Cup. That was in Cushendall are the aristocrats of the competition and while Ballycran have lost all three final appearances since their historic win in , the Ruairi Ogs have been crowned undisputed Ulster champions on no less than five occasions.Ballycran booked their place in this yearrsquos showdown after a sizzling display of open hurling, blasted holders and hot favourites Slaughtneil out of the competition.Gary Savagersquos boys were rated as   outsiders against the defending champions, but they left Slaughtneil in tatters with an impressive display.Savage was part of the team that lted the trophy in  and in addition to now managing the side, his two sons, Liam and Phelim, help control matters on the field of play.Both boys are certainly chips off the old block and Phelim, despite still being a minor player this season, is showing his true pedigree by dominating games from the centre half back berth and midfield.He is surrounded by a host of top class hurlers with Michael Hughes Stephen Keith, Scott and Brett Nicholson, Conor Woods, James Coyle and Colm McManus to feed off.Ballycran lost both their Antrim League games against Cushendall by signicant margins, but championship finals are a dferent animal and Gary Savage will have his side in a voracious frame of mind for Sunday. Cushendall are expected to lt the Ulster crown for a record-breaking th time. They have an abundance of experienced players in Carl Carson, Sean Delargy, Neil McManus, Eoghan Campbell, Ryan McCambridge, Donal Naughton and Paddy McGill, but they know they are in for one heck of a scrap on Sunday.If Ballycran can come up with a plan for depriving Carson, McManus, Campbell, Naughton and McGill of the sliothar, then they are in with a shout, but that is easier said than done, given the experience in the Cushendall set-up.One thing that is certain is that Ballycran will give it their all, but some times that is just not enough.Meanwhile, Burrenrsquos bid to recapture their glory days in Ulster is over for another year following their - to - defeat to Scotstown in their provincial SFC quarter-final in Newry on Sunday.Burren trailed - to - at the break, but a stirring second half display saw them give the Monaghan kingpins a run for their money. However, it was Scotstown who had a sting in their tail and they held on for victory.It was a similar story for Bredagh in their Ulster Club IFC quarter-final in Cootehill on Saturday where they were beaten - to - by Cavan champions Mullahoran. Jody Gormleyrsquos charges were desperately unlucky not to progress and were pipped at the post by a goal in the last minute of added time.Elsewhere, Downpatrick beat An Riocht - to - in the ACFL Division  relegation play-off at St Patrickrsquos Park, Newcastle.The Hoops just about held on in dficult playing conditions as An Riocht refused to go go down without a fight.St Johnrsquos got the better of Ballymartin in their ACFL Division  relegation play-off and their - to - win was just reward for a determined display.The only negative thing for St Johnrsquos was the news that manager Benny Corrigan stood down after the game..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch bypass scheme edges closer  ","story":"THE planned Ballynahinch bypass scheme is moving into the contract stage, Sinn Feacuteinrsquos Cathy Mason has confirmed.The partyrsquos Slieve Croob spokesperson has received confirmation from the Department for Infrastructure that work has commenced on drawing up contract documentation for the scheme.She said: ldquoFollowing the decision by the then Infrastructure Minister Chris Hazzard to commence work on the Ballynahinch bypass in December , officials from DfI have been working diligently through the ious legal stages to ensure the long awaited bypass scheme can commence as soon as possible.ldquoA programme of geotechnical investigation works on lands along theof the scheme was completed in  with advanced archeological investigation works completed earlier this year.Ms Mason added: ldquoThis has allowed the Department to now move ahead with preparation of the contract documentation in readiness of funding becoming available to construct the scheme..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Charles sends his gratitude and appreciation for the generosity  ","story":"A RECENT fundraising event in aid of Zambian businessman Charles Mwanda has raised pound,.The St Patrick Centre in Downpatrick was the venue in September for a night of musical entertainment organised by Sr Mary Delargy, a missionary sister from the town who has helped dozens of African children out of poverty and into professions over recent years.When Sr Mary worked in Zambia, Charles was her administrative assistant and she says the fundraising concert was not about giving him a hand out, but a hand up to continue with his business and employ a number of local people.The key reason for the September fundraiser was to generate enough money to allow Charles to purchase a generator so he could power his car wash business.Sr Mary worked in Zambia and during this period Charles was her assistant, helping her with the young people she was working with aged between  and .She had helped Charles get his business going through donations but there was a problemwith the power supply which is intermittent. To help keep the business going, he required a generator which is now in place.Sr Mary explained that due to regular power outages, electricity is only available from pm to am, therefore no business can operate during daylight hours.She said the recent concert at the St Patrick Centre raised pound, with an additional pound raised via subsequent donations.ldquoThe generator has been bought and installed and is making real dference to the business, a delighted Sr Mary confirmed this week.ldquoCharles sends his gratitude and appreciation for the generosity of people he will never meet. He now employs five young men and sustains his own family with the proceeds of the business.Sr Mary has thanked everyone who made the recent concert such a success, in particular, the Director and staff at the St Patrickrsquos Centre and the talented Stephen Smyth and his band who provided the the entertainment.Thanks were also extended to Frenchrsquos for providing the delicious supper, Downe Travel, Connollyrsquos and the Knights of St Columbanus for sponsorship.St Mary added: ldquoThank you to all those who attended the .

There was a lot at stake to see who would win the battle of the coaches.

Projected as three-screens, the film was cleverly edited to juxtapose the ying yellow line constructions, from the scouts lining up their yellow kayaks to the farmers forming their line of yellow bales.With the use of dramatic aerial shots, the formation of the yellow lines could be seen clearly as they cut through the landscape, representing both the Border and itrsquos people. The film received great response from the audience participants as they witnessed the powerful result of their involvement.With lsquoAcross and In-Between,rsquo Suzanne Lacy highlights the wit and cleverness of Border le in the face of political pressures, focusing on the power of play in creatively responding to complex issues.Suzanne commented: ldquoOur project draws those who live along the often-invisible boundaries between countries into a conversationmdashmetaphoric and literal ndash on personal and symbolic meanings of this border and by extension all such borders drawn by political forces.ldquoThe artwork explores inverse paradigms: visible and invisible, official and unofficial, rural and urban, the real border and imagined ones.

If they succeed, this would automatically mean more barriers to trade with the EU, including across the Irish border, she stated.Dr Hayward agreed that the Mrs Fosterrsquos argument against any sort of backstop was ldquoperfectly reasonable as it is not ldquothe intended destination. But she still argues that it is of ldquocritical importance.. It is the issue over which the whole Withdrawal Agreement could collapse, leaving all of us in the mire of a lsquoNo Dealrsquo outcome.ldquoIt is therefore very important that all judgements of the backstop are based on a clear and accurate understanding of what it actually means, unclouded by hyperbole.And it is in relation to the backstop where Dr Hayward, who is a Fellow in the Senator George J. Mitchell Institute for Global Peace, Security and Justice, took most issue with Mrs Foster analysis:ldquoFoster claims that Northern Irelandrsquos access to the UK single market would be restricted. In actual fact this is entirely in the hands of the British government ndash it is a domestic issue unrelated to UK-EU negotiations, the Queens Reader asserted, before adding:ldquoSecondly, Foster says that lsquoEU access, comes with the requirement for Northern Ireland to fully adopt and implement EU regulations with no changesrsquo. But it is not necessary to have full regulatory alignment with the EU in order to have tarf free access to its market. That would be like saying wed have to have all our laws imposed by Beijingwe are to get tarf-free access to China.Dr Hayward does however admit that major ergence would require an operational backstop:ldquoThat said,the UK erges widely from the lsquocommon rulebookrsquo of the EUrsquos single market, it would not be possible for goods produced in Northern Ireland to have free movement around the single market as is currently the case. It would be in just such an instance that the backstop could come into play. This would not mean that all EU laws would apply in Northern Ireland but rather that goods produced here could be considered to be of EU standardcertain procedures are followed.In her opinion piece last week Mrs Foster stated that:ldquoFree Trade Agreements donrsquot just cover regulation but tarfs too. This would require not just being in the single market but in the customs union. In other words, a total sea Border descending between Northern Ireland and its largest market, Great Britain.Dr Hayward does not agree however and says ldquothere is absolutely no prospect of a total sea border under any scenario.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

DUP Leader Arlene Foster has reiterated her party’s stance that they will not back a deal which results in a trading border down the Irish Sea, which would mean Northern Ireland being more closely aligned in terms of rules and regulations with the Republic of Ireland the EU than the rest of the UK. Speaking ahead of Monday’s meeting, Michelle O’Neill said: “This is the latest in a series of engagements and initiatives which the parties have taken together to demonstrate that the DUP and British government do not represent the cross-community majority of people in the North who voted against Brexit. This will be followed by a meeting with An Taoiseach Leo Varadkar on Wednesday.“The Brexit negotiations are now in a crucial phase and this is another crucial show of unity when we will once again be asserting our common position that the ‘backstop’ as already agreed must be maintained.“The backstop is the absolute bottom line for Sinn Féin, SDLP, Alliance and Green Party as we enter the endgame of the Brexit negotiation process on Britain’s Withdrawal Agreement with the EU.”The DUP leader meanwhile over recent days said “no unionist” could back Theresa May’s apparent advocacy of a withdrawal treaty that includes a Northern Ireland specic backstop measure to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland.

Located on Pearse Street right beside Trinity College in the heart of Dublin city, it made the perfect location to for the tour, with quirky and fascinating décor and superbly stylish and comfy rooms to retreat to after a day’s exploration.After unpacking, we progressed to the veranda, mixing with guests from all over the island. The atmosphere was relaxed and friendly and boded well for dinner in the Courtyard Restaurant, which included ham hock, blackberry sorbet, and a iety of cheeses and enjoyable wines.Of particular note was the delicious freshly baked bread, the creme brulee and the sirloin and the craic was good with a friendly and cosmopolitan mix of guests.After a very comfortable night, the breakfast was also top class, albeit, for once you are recommended not to try everything as one is typically tempted to, leaving room for the gourmet tour ahead.With the advent of cheap air travel in the s, however, came easy access to the cuisine of France and Italy and a real revolution began the strengths of top quality Irish ingredients then began to be married to the Latin flair and creativity,Our guide for the day was likeable foodie historian and former chef Chris Binchy. Starting in the heart of Trinity University campus, he gave a fascinating talk on the evolution of Irish cuisine. Our parents and their parents, he noted, would have enjoyed a pretty nutriotious but plain diet which ied little from week to week. Originally dominated by dairy produce, as Irish society was organised around cattle, the arrival of the French Normans in the th century brought a dferent type of agriculture and cultivation of crops.Dairy products, oats, fruit and root vegetables, cabbage, bacon, eggs and chicken were later added to with scones, tarts and pastries.With the advent of cheap air travel in the s, however, came easy access to the cuisine of France and Italy and a real revolution began the strengths of top quality Irish ingredients then began to be married to the Latin flair and creativity, giving what is today the st century foodie haunts across the city. Consequently, our first stop was a dedicated cheese shop, Sheridans, where we were entertained and informed by a true French man, who took care to extol the virtues of a wide range of new Irish cheeses made in the French style, all of which were passed around with crackers to sample.Next up was Powerscourt Shopping Centre, what was traditionally a wide open quadrangle in the centre of classic four storey Georgian buildings, but has been transformed into a charming indoor shopping complex, the central feature of which is the glass roof.A centre of all things ‘design’, we were treated to scones and cream from the Pepper Pot, which has a pedigree in custom baked breads and bagels, with a cult following among locals. They serve six dferent breads, all baked daily, which form the centre of all their dishes. Who knew Irish cream is dferent to English cream - clotted and not whipped with no sugar it is delicious enough without anything added, we were informed.

Specialising in natural cheeses, which were delicious, we also sampled a range of delicate parma-style hams, some of which were produced at Ballycastle and have a revered following in Dublin on account of the quality produce. For a change of pace we then popped into a traditional Victorian pub, the Swann, however this was a pub with a dference. It is ‘the’ rugby pub of Dublin, traditionally favoured by touring players the night before games - in the amateur era at least. It was run by legendary Ireland and Lions prop, Sean Lynch. Now run by his son Ronan, Sean still pulls the odd pint behind the bar and the rugby memorabilia on the walls is worth studying.This was followed by a trip to George’s street arcade, filled with ‘boho’ stalls and second hand bookshops, where we stopped at Lolly and Cooks for ‘Savage Rolls’ in Dublin the word ‘savage’ means ‘great’ and boy did these sausage rolls deserve the label. As big as your fist, they were as delicious as the meat loaf my mother used to make. Our last stop was the Temple Bar food market, which is even a hidden gem even to many Dubliners. As you enter, you may hear passionate yells from the acting school a few floors up, while a kaleidoscope of smells invade your senses.First up we tried the fresh oysters and the Temple Oyster Bar - surprisingly delicious. After that we moved onto the Market Kitchen, a food stall with a dference their menu on any morning depends on what all the speciality stalls around them are selling that day. We had sourdough with tahini and pumpkin puree, kale and chilli - out of this world! An interesting and worthwhile tour for visiting friends or family, stag and hen weekends or business trips. * Including overnight accommodation with breakfast and a Fab Food Trail, prices start from £ per room based on two people sharing.

Knowing this, John gave up his teaching course and took a full time job at the boatyardhellipand the rest is history.Mr Freemantle moved from Penarth and started his own boat building workshop in South Clive Street in  with British Road Services ndash now National Freight Consortium.In , the business was expanded and relocated to a greenfield site within Cardf Marina, which is now the exact location of Bayscape.The boat yard at the time stored around - boats. Long before the Cardf Bay Barrage was built, the water was tidal and boats moored in the middle of the river.As there was no road to the marina, Mr Freemantlebuilt a track to enable him to get to and from the boat yard. In  he put pontoons for the boats and laid the first cement for the slipway which was all created by Mr Freemantles own hands.In  the Freemantlesset their sights on retiring and sold the boat yard - which had grown to storing more than  boats - to a family friend of their business partner who used to visit the boat yard as a child. And so Bayscape began.One day the couple were walking along the waterrsquos edge and looked across to see the unique development taking shape in the exact spot of Mr Freemantles beloved boat yard, where  years previously they brought in the original electrics, telephone line and water. The couple decided to move back to where they had spent many happy years.Mrs Freemantlesaid: ldquoWe love living here, it feels really safe and therersquos a great sense of community. I look forward to coming home.To find out more about Bayscape, visit www.bayscape , call    or email info@bayscape. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here.

It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community.

Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day. Their yard or garden will also need to be securely fenced so that the puppy remains safely within its confines.Guide Dogs supplies basic equipment, covers all veterinary and feeding expenses, and provides a network of support and advice.To find out more about becoming a puppy raiser for Guide Dogs, ring Steve Kersley on   and leave a message, or email Steve.Kersley@guidedogs.org.uk article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

When I woke up whenever and potted and mooched and just saw what the day would bring.Like most people, the demands of work, family, friends, errands and the general stuff of le, mean that at any given moment we can be doing one thing, planning something  and thinking about many more.I get in to grasshopper phases where it feels like there is so much on my lsquoto dorsquo list that I flit and fly between myriad things and sometimes few of them get completed how Irsquod like or indeed completed at all and for those that that do get sorted and sewn up with aplomb, there is no time to take any satisfaction or pride because it is time to crack on with the next thing folks.I read a while ago about a concept that affects your brain around scarcity.The idea that when we feel that something is scarce, be that time, money or something  that we feel is in short supply, it can make us act with less focus and rationality thanwe had an abundance of such.So, in my case, when I feel time is pressured, I am more likely to try to do more with the result that I feel I have less time and my scarcity suffering brain is more likely to forget, to misplace to mess up.And so, knowing this, I am going to set aside the lsquoto dosrsquo and the lsquoshouldsrsquo and curl up on the settee with my utterly wonderful friend and eat and chill and know that with every mouthful of delicious cake, I am doing myself some good. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The project is part funded by Invest Northern Ireland and the European Regional Development Fund under the Investment for Growth  Jobs Northern IrelandProgramme.I used to be a childminder and had two young children and didnrsquot think it was possible for me to get into the beauty business - but then I went back to college and studied beauty at the Roberta Mechan College, she said.I have a real interest in health and well-being and wanted to offer these services to others. I opened in April this year and I currently offer specialist skincare, nails, massage and waxing.Helen turned her dream into a reality after taking part in the Go For It Programme which is delivered free of charge by a team of experienced business mentors through Northern Irelandrsquos wide network of enterprise agencies.It provides expert advice and help with developing a robust business plan to help turn ideas into a commercial enterprise.Commenting on the success of the programme, Helen said: Often it is hard to know where to start that was my experience before starting the Go For It Programme. The support and guidance offered through it helped me fine tune my business idea from concept to working reality.They helped me with practical things in the early stages like setting out a business plan and doing a detailed analysis. It was great for helping me to budget and forward plan.ldquoI would urge anyone who has ever had the idea of starting up their own business, or evenyou have just started operating your own business to apply for a place on the Go For It Programme. The skills and knowledge imparted is beyond the realms of what you could achieve on your own.Melanie Christie Boyle, Chief Executive of Ballymena Business Centre, on behalf of Mid and East Antrim and Borough Council, added: ldquoHelen joined the Go For It Programme driven by a desire to launch her very own beauty business, driven by a passion to help women improve their skin and help them feel good about themselves.Helen undertook an intensive beauty course under tutelage of an industry expert with a clear vision and motivation to open her own salon as soon as she completed her examinations.We worked with Helen to develop a business plan, focusing on key areas such as defining her service provision, marketing and financial forecasting, as well as helping her secure commercial premises at Ballee and Harryville Community Enterprise Centre.It is great to see how Helen has progressed her business in such as short space of time, building a loyal customer base and a excellent reputation for her quality customer service and using only the very best range of products.If you have a business idea yoursquod like to develop oryou are thinking about starting a business call    or visit: visit www.goforitni. try catch     .               ..

Many staff doing the same jobs are on dferent pay scales and people are confused about who to contact about issues.“I along with Cllr Margaret Tinsley have raised this issue since the council began and to date we still do not have a final council structure.“I understand that every other council in Northern Ireland has long since completed this task and we are still dithering. “Indeed, some councils are reviewing their original structure and doing this for the second time and we haven’t even got it done once.“I again raised these issues at every committee and at full council in May June. It has gotten to the stage that our party is very concerned that the lack of structure is having a detrimental impact on the council’s ability to provide a quality service for our rate payers. “By not having this task completed council’s ability to be proactive and respond \u2028to local needs is being hampered.“The responsibility for the implementation of these structures lies with the most senior officials within the Council and it is about time it was sorted once and for all.“I am calling on the Council to implement a realistic time line for completion of this task to move immediately to ensure every possible effort is made to give our employees and rate payers assurances that this is being taken seriously.“We must ensure our employees know they are valued and appreciated and that any inequalities are immediately corrected.Morale must be boosted and creating the new structure will go some way to helping with that.”A Council spokesperson said: “The Council is going through a period of unprecedented change, the biggest change in Local Government in  years.Raw sewage bubbles up into City Park Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"“With three large Councils coming together as one - making the second largest Council in NI - we are working through a number of complex HRissues so that our staff are treated fairly and equitably and structures are fit for purpose, providing the services local people need - whilst providing the best value for ratepayers. “We continue to work in partnership with our Trade Unions and staff to implement a structure that will support our community into the future.

It current plays host to tenants including Nationside, Barclays, Davy and Hays Recruitment.There is also a suggestion that a further , sq ft could be added over the building’s seven storeys, subject to planning permission.Some of the other business tenants include a small Kaffe O coffee kiosk, and Space NK.Gavin Clarke, director of investment at Osborne King, said while a few UK-based investment funds have looked at the building, it could go to someone closer to home.“It’s a landmark building – it’s the first time it’s been on the market in  years.“I thinkcould be local. We have had a few UK-based funds look at it to date.

A national debate which “we have been swept up in”, he says.While he says there remain serious issues which leave his business, and the rest of Northern Ireland, in the dark, far from seeing the port’s proximity with the border – in fact much of the mass of water is in the Republic – as a negative, Brian believes it could positively position it following Brexit.“We are unique as we are both a UK and European port, which is a fantastic opportunity with Brexit coming up.“We are talking to the City Deal people, the UK and Irish governments along with Donegal.“I think we, along with others, particularly, have an opportunity… there are dficulties we could face, especially with a no deal. We are pleased we can articulate our concerns and still hopefully have practical solutions.“Even in a ‘no deal’ scenario, where we are located, there will need to be good relations. Around %commute from Donegal. They will still need to do that.“In a paradox, it does bring some benefits. We have benefits with this Atlantic gateway – it is under-used, and can be utilised in a way to straddle the border. We are speaking about how we can join the dots.”Brian says the port has been working with Donegal County Council, over plans for its new cruise ship terminal at Greencastle. “We have the ability to import materials into the Irish side in the case of a hard Brexit. It wouldn’t take a huge amount of investment to make that happen.“There’s another dimensioninfrastructure capacity. We have a lot of things in place which is strong.“We have deep water available, and have access to probably the biggest land bank in the British Isles.“Project Kelvin  – the high-speed trans-Atlantic fibre-optic cable connection – runs right past our offices. We have over MW of power right beside us. In terms of the building blocks for basic industrial development, they are all in place.“In effect, a ‘no deal’ hard Brexit would be the ultimate impact… it means additional bureaucracy, would cost our port customers time and money, and might make them look at alternative ports to bring material in.“We are not insulated form the operational side of things. Materials coming in from the rest of the world. What could be an extreme in this, ultimately, it might mean, bringing in two million tonnes a year, % from Europe – that % could be subject to tarfs, or a lot of bureaucracy.”Laying it all out, the key concern ishuge bulk cargo – such as grain or animal feed – has to be ‘unitised’ into separate lorry loads, which require single certication each time.“It could create a fairly substantial bureaucracy around the logistics. That’s the very worst situation.”But business is good. Brian says the port employs  staff directly, but around , indirectly.“The numbers we put out in turnover are really strong, but they are modest in a sense that they don’t reflect the impact of what we do,” he says.“Percentage-wise, it’s mostly about the job creation that comes into the regional economy. “We have reinvested £m in the last few years, have a £m asset base and handle about £.bn in commodities a year.”In the other corner, Brian’s closely involved in Derry’s bid for a City Deal, similar to that submitted by six councils, including Belfast, last month.“We are working really closely with the infrastructure around the City Deal. There are two strands – there is the innovation, which is being led by Ulster University, and there is the infrastructure, which we will be playing a fairly central role in.”So, back to Brexit. What will Brian and his team be doing on the morning of March   “As much as you can do, we will continue as normal,” he said.“We have a number of preparedness scenarios. We are as prepared as I think we can be.“We could be prepared, but log jamsare beyond our control. “I don’t hear anyone talking up, or looking for a no deal outcome. I think Northern Ireland businesses have articulated itvery well, and we are punching above our weight.”The biggest issue is whereby a customer could look to moving where, thus moving trade away from the north west, Brian says.Looking back almost two and half years ago, and examining the current landscape today – whereby the UK is set to leave both the customs union and single market – Brian says: “I would have stayed in the customs union and single market. Our strategy has been to defend and grow – why would anyone want to turn away from the biggest customer base “I am not critical of people who wanted to leave the EU – but the way it has been done has not exactly been helpful. “What we see, in my own personal interpretation, when we talk to politicians, particularly from the UK, that the decision to leave the EU was made onof immigration.“That is what took us on the path. There’s then the second thought of the Irish question. If you can solve the issue for Derry, you can solve it for Dover. I don’t think that was considered when the case for leaving on immigration.“We have been swept up in an alternative, national debate – not something relevant for us.”And what’s next for the port  Brian says it’s been through three successful strategies, so far, in terms of expanding the growth.“It’s about leveraging in the coreand selling out the additional capacity to other capacities.“For example, in our marine, we invested in vessels – dredgers. When not used for our work, we go around the UK and Ireland, and offering expertise to other ports.“The key things we are doing is the strategic aims, to defend and grow – maintaining our core business, with core customers, and then looking to developing the industrial land bank and tourist product.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Danske-cover.jpg","title":"danske bank leading the tech and digital charge","story":"Posted on Monday November  by Ulster Business Danske Bank has taken another leap forward in its support for nurturing and helping to get businesses off the ground. Ulster Business chats to Danske Bank’s Vicky Davies and Richard Caldwell about the bank’s new Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub and ‘Making more possible’ for Northern Ireland businesses When you are already leading the technology and digital race in Northern Ireland banking, where do you go from there  For Danske Bank, its sights were set on something hugely ambitious, and something philanthropic which it believes can help cultivate, boost and grow the next generation of technology and fintech business start-ups in Northern Ireland. Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub, run in partnership with Catalyst Inc, is a stunning, modern incubator and hub which will see dozens of entrepreneurs and start-up businesses shape and craft their ideas in the heart of Danske Bank’s own Belfast city centre headquarters. The partnership with Catalyst Inc makes a lot of sense, as it already plays host to dozens of knowledge-based businesses across  acres in the Titanic Quarter, and the Innovation Centre in Londonderry. Vicky Davies is managing director of strategy and corporate development at Danske Bank. “We have a clear ambition to be the best bank in Northern Ireland, and we plan to do that by making more possible for our customers, employees, stakeholders and society”, she says. It’s that message, ‘Making more possible’, that adorns the wall of one of the main meeting rooms in the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub. “Banking is changing so fast. It’s relentless in terms of new entrants, innovation and the level of new fintech money coming into the industry.” “We know we need to change at pace, or face being left behind.” “We needed a partner in this venture, and we were looking for someone with reach and expertise,” she said. Following an initial meeting last year with senior management at Catalyst Inc, Vicky says there was an immediate mutual connection, and they went from there. “They have the expertise in running a space like this, and we have access to banking and business expertise – with both of us having great experience in helping businesses to grow. So, every dimension we looked at – it was a really good fit.” The hub is an impressive space, awash with splashes of colour, connectivity, co-working spaces and meeting rooms – including a nod to Princess Leia with an image on a wall – and it is able to play host to around - entrepreneurs and business start-up professionals, with top end cable and fibre internet connections. It’s further evidence of Danske Bank ensuring it’s well ahead of the pack and out in front. It’s about bringing a business from an embryonic start-up, to a thriving company, helping lead the way in its sector. But for Danske, this isn’t all about the bottom line. It’s about creating a thriving hub for the future stars of Northern Ireland’s burgeoning tech sector. And it’s a two-way street – with the bank aiming to learn as much from the start-up businesses nestled in the top-end spacious ground-floor hub, as the other way around. So, what does this mean for Danske Bank in terms of business banking and as an institution further bolstering its credentials in the digital space. Richard Caldwell is managing director of personal banking and small business. “We want to be part of the local fintech journey. We want to help influence and develop ideas,” he says. “There are more than , businesses in Northern Ireland, and we want to continue to support start-ups in general – by putting expertise and support into this partnership, we will help this particular set of small businesses to grow in what is a burgeoning sector.” “Ultimately, real success for us would be seeing products brought to market, and helping businesses grow from an embryonic idea, through to start-up, growth and expansion. With the business maybe ending up as one of our loyal corporate customers in the future.” Richard says research showed that many of Danske Bank’s existing bigger business customers wanted the bank to provide “something more tangible” for start-ups, to grow companies for the future. Although tenants in the new fintech space don’t necessarily have to bank with Danske, the Bank does offer banking support, including everything from a current account, to receiving assistance from a growth adviser to support them with their banking needs. gt “This is a major investment for us,” Richard says. “This is one of the most expensive ground-floor retail premises in Belfast, and we have devoted it to this hub. This is front and centre in the heart of Belfast.” The location of the new hub couldn’t be better – with the new Glider bus linking the hub to Catalyst Inc headquarters in Titanic Quarter. And, as modern tech businesses evolve and reach out to new markets and time zones across the globe, there is also  hour access to the Fintech Hub. The hub has a team of four, two from Danske Bank and two newly recruited by Catalyst Inc. Together Danske Bank and Catalyst Inc have also launched a new online  to help the wider growing number of start-up businesses across Northern Ireland to connect with investors, peers and potential new recruits across Europe - thehub.io helps connect start-ups to relevant resources, such as talent, networks, financing, tools and advice from experts which will help them overcome some of the challenges of scaling up. It is clear that strategically this is a big push by both organisations to play a key supporting role through the provision of both physical and online resources. Digitalisation Richard is keen to point out support for the hubs is just part of a bank-wide digital transformation agenda at Danske. “For example, we want to change the nature of traditional relationship management at the Bank. In addition to managing traditional banking needs as we have always done so well, we are now moving into the added value space. As well as the human touch, customers increasingly want top notch digital solutions to make their lives easier, to give them ease of access and quicker credit decisions.” The digitally-savvy way of thinking is giving Danske Bank competitive advantage, and that is from an already well-established position in the market. Last year they appointed a chief digital officer, who is a member of the Bank’s executive committee. “Our people are still our best asset and will remain so,” Richard said. “We have great people. And customers still highly value that human touch and expert advice. But what the journey looks like for transactions, well we have digital solutions for everything. For your payments, wages, drawing direct debits or paying suppliers. “Right now we are piloting and rolling out digital credit decisions for business customers. This is transforming the credit journey for both our customers and our business relationship managers. For example, one customer recently applied for an overdraft through the digital credit solution and got approval and the funds in their account in  minutes.” Danske Bank was the first of the local Northern Ireland banks to bring in app banking, and solutions such as Samsung Pay, Fitbit Pay and Garmin Pay. And this new Fintech Hub is very much another stride forward. The bank is also leading the pack when it comes to customer satisfaction, right across businesses of all shapes and sizes. “For some time now we have been the market leader in business banking. Research continues to show that our customer satisfaction scores are first for large business, and first for small business,” Richard said. Both Vicky and Richard are keen to see what they predict will be short and long-term benefits from the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub. There’s an organic osmosis, allowing ideas to flow freely between the Danske Bank people visiting from upstairs and those entrepreneurs which it hosts on the ground floor. “The entrepreneurs in the hub bring a fresh mindset, one we can learn from as we continue our own digital journey throughout the bank,” Vicky says. Richard added: “The fintech sector is seen in many quarters as a challenger to traditional banks, but we are embracing it and feel we can grow with it, to the benefit of our customers.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Riccc.jpg","title":"ni house prices outpace uk market","story":"Posted on Wednesday November  by John Mulgrew RICS residential property spokesman, Samuel Dickey Northern Ireland homes have avoided a UK-wide dip in prices, according to a new survey. The latest RICS and Ulster Bank Residential Market Survey shows a larger proportion of surveyors pointing to a rise in the average cost of a home. That was a higher level than anywhere  in the UK, during October. It says that “Northern Ireland surveyors are also the most optimistic, looking forward. A net balance of % expects prices to rise in the three months ahead, while a net balance of % expects the number of sales to increase in the same timeframe. Most other regions expect prices and sales activity to fall or be broadly flat in the final quarter”. In terms of supply, the survey pointed to a slight rise in properties coming onto the market in Northern Ireland for the first time in five months. RICS residential property spokesman, Samuel Dickey said: “Interest from first time buyers and a strong rental have been two of the factors driving the Northern Ireland housing market, with first time buyers and investors both very active this year. “Surveyors remain confident about the market, despite political and economic uncertainty, and  is shaping up to have been a more positive picture for the housing market than perhaps was initially anticipated.” Terry Robb, head of personal banking at Ulster Bank, said: “As the survey indicates, demand remains relatively strong and we continue to see a good-pipeline of mortgage applications. “Our new paperless mortgage process has generated interest but more fundamentally, interest in the market remains firm from a broad range of mortgage purchasers including first time buyers, home movers and those remortgaging.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
