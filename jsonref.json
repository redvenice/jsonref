While dating her victim she carried out Google searches for \u0027how to get a rich man to give you money\u0027, \u0027does cash show up on airport scanners\u0027 and \u0027how to get rid of your fingerprints\u0027\u0027The victim went alone to pay his debt, but when he arrived to do so and opened the envelope he discovered that it contained no money, but rather ripped up pages of what appeared to be a women\u0027s magazine.\u0027Their return from the trip to Ireland marked the end of the relationship. The victim was surprised to find Ripley had changed the seating arrangements on the flight so they did not sit together.\u0027On arriving back at his home, she put her case in her car and drove off.\u0027The hearing was also shown her internet searches, which also included one for Omega Constellation watches and how much money could be carried from Ireland to the UK.However, the tribunal was told that despite carrying out an investigation, Sussex Police had decided there was \u0027insufficient evidence\u0027 to charge Ripley and therefore they would not be pushing forward with a criminal case against her.The disciplinary panel said that although the misconduct was not related to her work, they felt they must ban her from continuing to be a registered social worker.The report added: \u0027There has been no acceptance of wrongdoing on the part of Ripley. She has shown no remorse or insight into her behaviour.\u0027Her actions were not victimless and took an emotional toll upon him. The panel believes there is a real risk of repetition. For these reasons, the panel is satisfied that making a striking off order is a proportionate response."},{"url":null,"title":"Namibias isolated Himba tribe use bright clay create incredible hairstyles make up","story":"Share this article          The men are often away from home for extended periods of time, with the Himba being a patriarchal and polygamous tribe.

But it is not relevant that the people that assisted Donachie in creating it were all women with young children. “They are artists” she emphasises, “it is coincidental”. And, even though the three participants in Donachie Rhodes Ryan at the Freelands Foundation appear because they received funding from the Freelands award as mid-career female practitioners, their gender is not relevant. They are artists artists without the “female” prefix. There is no millennial pink here or a gly sign, nor is there heavy-handed curatorial themes of “the body”, “domesticity” or “feminism”.In a bid to rectify the historical pattern of forgetting and undervaluing female artists, the foundation shines the spotlight on its winning artists once more to mark the publication of their most recent report into gender (Representation of Female Artists in Britain During 2018). Ryan, who won the award in 2018 and will exhibit at Spike Island in 2020, presents Salvage, a reassessment of her early work that literally disappeared when it was lost in the Momart fire in 2004. On simple industrial storage shelves, Ryan arranges yams and sweet potatoes, plaster casts of fruit and vegetable trays, plush cushions, a coil of teabags and layers of fabric part way through the tie-dying process. It is a cabinet of curiosities, encapsulating Ryan’s current explorations into materiality and her long-term interest in categorisation.A fascination with materiality also appears in Donachie’s An Era of Small Pleasures with a 16-metre chain made of leather. Fluttering, pastel-coloured, lightness is replaced with a heavy structure that rises up from a pile of loops on the floor and cuts across the gallery as a “no entrance” barrier, forcing visitors to walk in a certain direction. In the centre of Donachie and Ryan’s work, we see Rhodes’ film Notes from Light Music – or rather, we hear it, because we see what we hear. The montage of black and white lines, flickering shadows and oscillating squeals is a recording of a larger piece, Light Music, where Rhodes filmed a series of drawings and then printed them onto the optical soundtrack of the film.The exhibition may be small, but the conversations are endless. In freeing these mature artists from focusing on their gender, there is space for the disruption of materials, the reinterpretation of Hepworth and Brâncuși and the interrogation of inequality. Rhodes might have created Light Music as a response to the lack of female composers in Europe, but she has also referred to the illusion of the dancing forms as a metaphor for an economy that appears to be fluid but is actually held by the corporate elite.Donachie Rhodes Ryan is a celebration of how dynamic and erse the art scene could be, were we not to “disappear” a large proportion of female artists."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/658e01c662c9d7a4ad736ca671e6b18ca95b169f/0_114_594_356/master/594.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=26413aa7ad11fbcc528c240efea77b6c","title":"tips links and suggestions what are you reading this week","story":"Your space to discuss the books you are reading and what you think of them Welcome to this week’s blogpost. Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week.Thomas Wolfe told us that you can never go home again. But you can do some re-reading, as Diane Cano explains:Re-reading in my ninth decade a book I first read as an adolescent: Look Homeward, Angel, by Thomas Wolfe. Even as an adolescent I thought of it as a novel especially suited for young teenagers, full of enthusiasm and new pain. It is still racist and misogynist and full of (glorious) lists, but I am no longer the indignant girl I was. Now I just relax into the tolerance of knowing, with Auden, that Time “worships language and forgives everyone by whom it lives”. Oh, how Wolfe throws those words up, around, over and through - everything.“I am not sure why,” says gavernism, “but I am re reading The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde by Stevenson”:Perhaps because I feel that social media today plays the role that chemicals play in that novel: it opens up a dark side of us that can roam around in the dark, anonymously, doing as it pleases. The issue now, as with the novel, is that hidden never really stays hidden, does it?The Silk Roads: A New History of the World by Peter Frankopan is “outstanding” according to darrylxxx:So many interesting stories, connections, insights and so easy to relate to where we are now as a global population. Shows how things ebb and flow over time – our current “reality” isn’t fixed in stone.“I do love Home Front diaries,” says NicolaVintageReads, who has been reading May Smith’s wartime diary These Wonderful Rumours:Ration books, Time and Tide magazine, sitting in a cold cellar waiting for the all-clear siren, tennis parties, wartime wedding cakes with cardboard imitation icing, seeing the newly released Disney films Dumbo and Pinocchio at the cinema, billeting evacuees, fear or Goering’s plans but spirit of the Blitz.WebberExpat is also “loving” Lucia Berlin’s A Manual For Cleaning Women:A bitterly hilarious, brutally truthful, elegantly incisive collection. Wonderful, just a brilliant, up-front, trusthworthy voice. One which does not overstay its welcome, nor get too repetitive meandering between stories.The sense of growing unease is palpable. I like the way Roth explores events – mainly a growing wave of anti-semitism in an isolationist America in WW2 governed by a right wing president – through the experience of a really well-defined young Jewish boy and his family.Becoming by Michelle Obama has impressed nicegirl2:I’m not really one for reading non-fiction but this is brilliant – so well written, smart, funny and humble (so far).Visions of Gerard by Jack Kerouac haunts dylan37:A childhood in the 1920s, a saintly hero brother who disappears too soon, Catholic dreams in a Massachusetts winter, survivor guilt and a family struggling with mourning.There’s a different kind of Kerouac energy here introspective, spiritual, angelic and natural. The ghosts of the great wanderers float through these words – William Blake and Walt Whitman, with the touch and feel of sad autumn leaves. There’s that strange melancholy of a dying season, disappearing like smoke from a slow burn bonfire. A haunting and beautiful small book, about the biggest of subjects.Red Bones by Ann Cleeves has intrigued jimitron5000:There is a certain slow burning intrigue about this book. The location adds an immense amount to the story and covers for the times when not much happens. It develops nicely into a really enjoyable novel. I have read the first two and will endeavour to read the rest of the series. Funnily enough I have never managed to sit through a whole episode of the TV show.Finally, a fascinating literary nugget from Zdzisław Najder’s, Joseph Conrad: A Life, courtesy of interwar:Pursuing Joseph Conrad’s beginnings as a writer, I came across this:In March 1893 the Torrens, “one of the most famous sailing ships of its day”, set sail from Adelaide, Australia on its return voyage to London. On board was a wealthy young English barrister who had been travelling round the Pacific. From shipboard he wrote to his mother about meeting a remarkable man, the ship’s Polish mate:“A capital chap, though queer to look at he is a man of travel and experience in many parts of the world, and has a fund of yarns .... He has been right up the Congo and all around Malacca and Borneo and other out of the way parts…”John Galsworthy had not yet turned to writing and his new friend, Konrad Korzeniowski, though secretly working on a novel, had not yet become Joseph Conrad. Both would remain friends, however, as they gained fame for their fiction.If you’re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag #Books, and we’ll include a selection in this blog.

RealReal raised $300m (£235m) from investors by selling new shares in a flotation that initially valued the firm at $1.6bn.Wainwright is best known as the former boss of Pets, one of the biggest flops of the early 2000s internet bubble. Its initial public offering in 2000 raised $82.5m but it went bust eight months later, with its short shelf life a harbinger of the end of the dotcom boom.The entrepreneur launched RealReal in 2011 with an initial investment of $100,000.Wainwright said last year she had set out to found an e-commerce business that “Amazon couldn’t replicate”.The idea came to her after she saw one of her wealthy friends buy consignment stock – secondhand items sold on behalf of the original owner – hidden away at the back of a designer boutique.“That’s when the lightbulb went off,” she said. “I went home and looked at my closet, and I had 60 designer pieces that I had never worn or had stopped wearing. I thought, ‘How big is this market? Can eBay do this?’ The truth is, if you’re selling luxury goods, you need trust, and eBay’s not set up for that trust.”RealReal connects buyers hunting for cut-price Chanel and Rolex watches with sellers who want to clear out their bulging wardrobes.The marketplace enables buyers to avoid fakes as it employs more than 100 product authenticators, including handbag pricing experts, gemologists and horologists, to vet products. The site uses an algorithm, which takes into account the designer, item type, age and its condition, to set prices, and takes a cut from the sale.Despite its lofty valuation RealReal has never made a profit: last year it made a $76m loss on a turnover of $207m. Before seeking a listing on the Nasdaq stock market in New York the company had already raised nearly $300m in private capital.Wainwright bills RealReal, which has a partnership with the fashion designer Stella McCartney, as a force for good: “You’re keeping things out of landfills and preventing items being melted down and energy applied. When you buy things of value, they have an afterlife, and they should recirculate in the economy. You’re helping the planet as you do that.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ac1b7853d0da70a5dfee10363a0a3158b882e207/0_0_1880_1128/master/1880.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5631b784b1a7aef8d2867196a147986a","title":"putin liberal values eu blame rightwing demagogues","story":"Vladimir Putin is right. When he celebrates the existential crisis of what he terms “liberalism”, his grounds for triumphalism are substantial. “The liberal idea has become obsolete,” he crows: he cheers on the anti-migrant backlash sweeping the western world, the onslaught against multiculturalism, and even endorses the ever-escalating campaign against trans people. If you were Putin, would you not be celebrating? His brand of authoritarianism is in the ascendancy: a rightwing populism based around a venerated strongman leader, where the trappings of democracy are kept for show, but where, in practice, the substance of democracy is hollowed out. Putinism could indeed be humanity’s future.Donald Tusk, the European council president, has shot back, voicing his staunch opposition to the “main argument that liberalism is obsolete”, claiming instead that: “For us in Europe, these are and will remain essential and vibrant values. What I find really obsolete are: authoritarianism, personality cults, the rule of oligarchs.”Hungary – an EU state – is already de facto a Putinist nation: its authoritarian far-right leader Viktor Orbán, surrounded by similar oligarchs, flaunts what he calls an “illiberal democracy” that has shut down dissenting newspapers, persecuted NGOs, closed down an entire university, throttled the independence of the judiciary, whipped up hatred against migrants. Its rampant corruption has led to Hungary being widely labelled a kleptocracy, and it has indulged in wanton antisemitism.Or consider Tusk’s own home nation, Poland, whose authoritarian rightwing government has also seized the judiciary, attacked media freedom, attempted to undermine the right to protest and indulged in rampant migrant-bashing. The EU has let them get away with it: as Michael Ignatieff, the rector of the Central European University – driven from Hungary by Orbán – puts it, the Hungarian nightmare enjoyed the “collusion and compliance” of the EU.Consider Turkey, once described as an emerging democracy, but whose de facto dictator Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, who rules through a never-ending state of emergency, has locked up and persecuted journalists and opponents, and concentrated power in his hands. While a defeat for his chosen mayoral candidate in Istanbul is cause for celebration, the west has continued to arm and support Erdoğan as he throttles democracy and civil rights.We can see, too, a wider trajectory. Italy’s far-right deputy prime minister Matteo Salvini – whose Northern League has soared in polls – has every chance of becoming the country’s leader in the near future. Brazil’s authoritarian far-right leader, Jair Bolsonaro, was the beneficiary of a successful conspiracy to prevent Lula da Silva – the nation’s progressive former president – from standing in elections he had every chance of winning. And look at the United States, whose demagogic leader locks children up in what the congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has called “concentration camps”, attempts to institute a Muslim ban, posts videos suggesting he could be US president for all eternity, and exudes a rampantly authoritarian attitude.And what about Britain? British exceptionalism – always drenched in chauvinism and myth – painted our nation as immune to authoritarian populist impulses. The aftermath of the Brexit referendum kills this lie: this is a country where newspapers denounce judges as “enemies of the people” and opponents as “saboteurs and traitors” where our leaders denounce “citizens of nowhere” where threats to prorogue parliament – a de facto coup d’état – become mainstream and where rightwing populism continues its ascent.When Putin ridicules the “claim now that children can play five or six gender roles”, he joins a deafening chorus of bigotry: from Trump banning trans soldiers to the escalating anti-LGBTQ backlash in Brazil. No wonder he is so cocky.That isn’t to say that we existed in some fabled golden age before now. But there is no question that a great reverse is taking place: a lethal combination of a backlash against hard-won rights for women and minorities, and worsening economic and social insecurities being exploited by rightwing demagogues. The lights are going out – and if an alternative politics of hope fails, then darkness will consume us all."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b31c869259940032011d4674f7dcd11019410ae1/275_143_1436_861/master/1436.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2bc5af9826de43d7cc88a96fa024d06e","title":"women on the verge of a cricket shakedown","story":"Being a cricketer and a woman is no easy path. Tasneem-Summer Khan meets a coach, an umpire, and a player inspiring girls and the game to come togetherYou won’t often hear cricket described as trailblazing it’s more commonly thought of as reactionary. However, spurred on by a summer of World Cup and Ashes cricket, women and girls all over Britain are making their mark on the sport.Asma Ajaz-Ali, a third-generation British Pakistani who grew up in inner-city Birmingham, experienced a variety of socioeconomic and cultural barriers to playing the game. Despite this lack of access to the formal game, she taught her brothers to play on an informal basis, then began running sessions for women and girls who had never before held a bat, supported by Warwickshire CC.“People think cricket is all upper middle-class men,” says Ajaz-Ali, who joined the ECB’s ambitious South Asian Action Plan, supported by NatWest, that aims to transform community engagement by recruiting 2,000 female mentors. “I go to mosques, temples, community centres, and get children and women from everywhere involved. Children see their mothers coaching and feel pride. It tells them they can do that too. These initiatives change opportunities and cultural attitudes for generations.”Ajaz-Ali prefers to focus on the future than lamenting her own lack of opportunity growing up. “I can’t bring back that time for me, but I can offer something to these girls,” she says. She sees change happening in the sport and aspires to generate more: “I have women playing in shalwar kameez, I coach asylum seekers. The point is to break down barriers and build inclusivity. Cricket is such a cool sport. It’s vibrant, it’s dynamic, and we have to try harder to make more people, particularly girls of all backgrounds, understand that.”Much like Ajaz-Ali, Laura Caughey found it hard to get a game of cricket. Growing up in Northern Ireland, she attempted to join a team as a child, only to be told she could practise with the boys but, lacking female peers, could not play in matches. “That stuck with me through adulthood and it’s not something I want more girls to experience.”Caughey decided to focus on a different aspect of the sport – umpiring. “I’d watch Simon Taufel and study what he did … he was my cricket idol growing up.” She became Ireland’s second female umpire this year when she was appointed to the representative panel of match officials.Through umpiring, Caughey has met like-minded people and helped to shape the conversation through administrative panels, eventually helping to set up and develop a women’s side at her local Carrickfergus CC. Reflecting on the enduring dismissive attitudes towards women in the sport, she says: “I just want to enjoy my season and let my on-field speak for me.”Ellie Threlkeld has been playing cricket for 10 years. She credits her experiences in mixed-gender cricket for developing skills which saw her move from the age-group county setup to playing for Lancashire Thunder in the semi-professional Kia Super League.Recognising the limited prospects for women cricketers, she opted to study psychology at Loughborough. The university’s enviable facilities and MCCU membership enable her to simultaneously develop her game and prepare for another option if cricket doesn’t work out.Threlkeld – who has ambitions to replace her England wicketkeeping heroes Sarah Taylor and Amy Jones one day – volunteers, coaches, and does ambassador work to grow interest and participation. “Assemblies get a great turnout, and girls can see how good it is to be a cricketer, but kids don’t just need role models – they need more thrown into the game so it’s an actual career.“A lot of women don’t have the option to train full-time – they need to work to earn a living. If there was money involved in the game, everything would improve faster.”With women all over the country dedicating their time and energy to the sport, barriers are shifting – new generations of girls are becoming women under the tutelage of these inspirational characters, and it’s hard to imagine anything but a positive future for British women’s cricket.For almost four decades, NatWest has supported cricket, with a mission to make the game easier for everyone to play and enjoy. A proud partner of the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) and the charity Chance to Shine, NatWest champions cricket at all levels - from grassroots support for local clubs and getting more people involved in the game to supporting current and future England stars and helping fans cheer on their teams, however and wherever they choose.With NatWest, cricket is a game that has #NoBoundaries.

You realize there were 10 people on stage shouting, and the moderators, and he outshouts them all!”When the subject of race came up, Kamala Harris set herself a part as the only black person on the stage or as Noah put it, “Kamala Harris was like, ‘The rest of you need to sit your asses down.’” She interrupted an answer from Williamson to gain control of the floor. “So now that Kamala had the floor, she was going to wipe it with Biden.” During this exchange, she targeted Joe Biden for his record of working with segregationists and for not supporting bussing, an initiative that was personal to her, as she was bussed herself as a schoolgirl. “Yo, at this point, Kamala was bussing Biden right out of the debate.” In the same exchange, Biden cut himself off when giving an answer, saying he had run out of time. Noah agreed: “After Kamala did what she did to you tonight, Joe Biden, your time might be up.”On The Late Show, Stephen Colbert said that before the debate, Biden supporters handed out ice cream cones they dubbed Joe Cones. “A Joe Cone is also what Biden wears to make sure he respects personal space these days,” Colbert joked. But the friendly feeling Biden headed into the debate with was soon dashed, noted Colbert. “Tonight, that Joe Cone was met with the Kamala Harris flamethrower.”Sanders called Trump a liar, a racist and a phony and said the American people needed to understand this in order to defeat him. Colbert was doubtful: “Oh, they understand it, sir. That’s the reason why some of them voted for him.” In the same moment, Sanders asked that Trump be exposed. “Not sure if we need to do that, Senator. Trump already has a long history of exposing himself.”When Harris asked to comment on race as the only black person on stage, Rachel Maddow told the candidate she would be allotted 30 seconds for her response. Colbert mimicked the moderator’s suggestion: “OK so for 30 seconds, just sum up institutionalized racism that’s been plaguing our country since our very foundation and go!” She then talked about being bussed to school. “I believe Harris on bussing because she clearly just took Biden to school.” Harris later took aim at Trump, saying he embraces science fiction over science fact. The host quipped, “Well, of course Trump embraces science fiction. I’m pretty sure his hair was shaved off of a Wookiee’s ass.”Also live after the debate, Seth Meyers began with a comment from Trump who said all of the candidates would do poorly. “You think they’re going to do poorly? Be careful for what you wish for, dude,” said Myers over an image of Trump stalking Hillary Clinton in a 2016 debate, “because judging by recent history, doing poorly at debates is a pretty good indicator of future success.”But unlike Trump’s assertion, the debates went quite smoothly. In fact, Daniel Dale, who catalogues Trump’s lies, was scheduled to go on CNN to factcheck the debates. He later said he would not appear after the first Democratic debate as it was so truthful. “That’s wild. Factchecking is the only where Donald Trump can say he created more jobs,” said Meyers.But apparently, Biden knew a target would be on his back last night and prepared for the debate by studying his own record. Meyers called this action suspicious. “That’s like when someone ghosts you on Tinder and you have to go back and read your conversation to see where you blew it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3a356cf5a1646fadd667cba7c11dcd8aaa967d34/0_0_3000_2000/master/3000.jpg?width=1010\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=b17d67e0664b44628477bb084cc434b4 2020w","title":"how to wear one colour head to toe","story":"Monotoning is the new colour blocking – try pairing items from your own wardrobe in a fresh wayI can be honest with you now. I wasn’t at all sure that it would work when I remixed my column into a more sustainable format last year. But I was sure that fashion was about more than just accumulating loads of unnecessary stuff, and I knew lots of you felt the same way.I was also conscious of a gap between the way I really get dressed – a blouse I’ve just bought, but worn with last summer’s sandals and jeans I’ve had for a decade, say – and being photographed in outfits with price tags attached to every piece. I was anxious that my trusty old favourites would look shabby up against shiny new stuff under studio lights. And I fretted that the scent-trail of excitement, the thrill of the fashionably new, would go cold if I stepped off the new-clothes merry-go-round.I have been beyond thrilled with the reaction. I love that so many women want to tell me, on the street or on social media, or by postcard, about the leopard print midi skirt they have had in their wardrobes for two decades that is a dead ringer for this season’s must-have. I love writing about how we all really wear clothes.Nigel Slater wrote a recipe, recently, for strawberry, ricotta and pistachio choux puffs. (Bear with me – this is more relevant than it sounds.) I can’t bake to save my life, but I had most of a tub of ricotta left in the fridge and in June I can’t walk past a punnet of strawberries for sale, so I whipped the ricotta with blitzed pistachio crumbs and dolloped it on to strawberries. OK, it wasn’t Nigel-worthy but it was pretty good because the flavours worked brilliantly. Like a recipe, I hope this column can work as an inspiration rather than a prescription. A jumping-off point to shop your wardrobe, rather than the actual shops.Today’s fashion recipe is simple. Monotoning – wearing one colour from head to toe – is the new colour blocking. This is a really simple way of elevating an easy-to-wear outfit into something with a bit of drama or attitude. If you have a pair of bright shoes you like, start there, then pull out everything in your wardrobe that is the same colour. If there’s a shirt and skirt that you had never thought of wearing together, try it. Finding new pairings that work among the clothes you already have is as satisfying as winning at Snap..

There were borek pastries, sweet, olive oil-kissed tomatoey green beans, and courgette and cauliflower fritters all served close enough to the Greek basil growing in the garden that you could reach out from your seat and tear it right over the food.Sevgi, the cook, and her tiny band of women made bread and yoghurt every day, and nothing – not a scrap – was wasted. Only a week eating their food was not enough, and I’ll be trying to recreate their cooking for years to come. These böreks come close, and they come with my version of Sevgi’s molasses tahini, which was, without question, the discovery of my trip.The bitter greens are a riff on two meals we enjoyed – some homegrown kale we ate at dinner, and the fresh greens piled on to plates at the breakfast table.In Turkey, there is an array of bitter greens and herbs, and for me the wilder and more flavourful they are, the better. I like to leave the stalks on too. If Turkish bread is hard to come by where you are, sourdough or pitta would work here, too.4 slices Turkish breadExtra-virgin olive oil1 garlic clove, peeled and finely sliced4 large handfuls bitter leaves (I use a mixture of sorrel, dandelion, wild rocket and watercress), washed and stalks left on1 small bunch dill or fennel tops1 pinch Turkish chilli flakesCrumbled feta, to serve (optional)SaltToast the bread, then drizzle with olive oil.Heat a glug more of the oil in a wide frying pan and gently fry the garlic. Add the leaves and dill or fennel tops to the pan and, using tongs, move them around to coat and wilt in the oil.Top the toast with the greens, then sprinkle over the chilli flakes, feta (if using) and a little salt.These keep well for a few days in the fridge. To reheat, warm them in a frying pan with a little olive oil: that way, they get nice and crisp again. Vegans can use vegan cheese in place of the feta, or some well-seasoned, crumbled firm tofu.500g spinach, chard, spring greens, cavolo nero or kale150g feta (or manouri), crumbled3 tbsp toasted sesame seeds, plus extra for sprinkling2 sprigs thyme, leaves picked1 large handful Greek (or regular) basil50ml olive oil (or melted butter), plus an extra drizzle of oil for the greensSalt and pepper250g pack filo pastry (about 8 sheets, 30cm x 40cm)4 tbsp dark tahini1 tbsp honey1 tsp pomegranate molasses (optional)Put the greens in a colander, and pour just-boiled water over them, so that they wilt a little. (For hardier greens, remove the stems, wash, put them in a lidded pan on a high heat and steam, covered, for two minutes, then drain.) Once cool, squeeze out as much liquid as possible, then roughly chop. Transfer to a large bowl. Add the cheese, sesame seeds, thyme, basil and a drizzle of oil, and mix. Season well and set aside.Heat a baking sheet in the oven set to 200C (180C fan)gas 6. Lay out a sheet of filo on a work surface, keeping the remaining sheets covered with a damp tea towel. Brush all over with olive oil (or melted butter) and fold in half lengthways to create a long strip of pastry about 15cm x 40cm. Spoon about 75g of the greens mix into the bottom left-hand corner of the strip, leaving a border. Take the right-hand corner and fold it up over the filling to seal it into a triangle shape. Continue folding the pastry over the filling until you reach the top of the pastry strip. Seal the edges and lightly brush with more oil or butter. Put on a tray to chill while you make the rest.Transfer the parcels to the hot baking sheet, sprinkle with sesame seeds and bake for 20 minutes, until golden.Meanwhile, mix the tahini, honey and molasses (if using), then whisk with 40ml water to loosen.Let the böreks cool slightly, then drizzle with the tahini and sprinkle with more sesame seeds. Serve warm or at room temperature."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cac1c1a3bfcf919e557d1866c176d85507b365ba/62_354_3040_1824/master/3040.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b9cbd68131f79d349773d97e23276aad","title":"usa france womens world cup quarter final live score","story":"33 min: The corner kick gets to Henry, but the header goes well over. France are at least putting a few things together. Still no shots on target.32 min: Still not sure what happened with Morgan. Replay showed she might have landed badly after going up for a header, but she walks off with little trouble and immediately asks to come back in. We resume, and Diani takes the ball from Dunn and goes forward. Mewis blocks the cross for a corner.29 min: A corner kick for France, which might be their best chance to get something going thanks to the height of Wendie Renard. The ball floats past her head, and as France try to cycle it back in, they’re offside. Again. That’s at least four.Alex Morgan is down, which gives us an unofficial hydration break. Not sure what’s up, but the trainers are out.28 min: Things have quieted down a bit. The USA are clearly content to press in spurts and wait for France to hand over the ball.25 min: Not saying the USA have parked the bus, but while France play the ball around midfield, we can clearly see a line of five keeping France at bay.And it pays off with an offside call. So if you wanted Ertz to play center back today, congratulations. Now she is.Two from Mary Waltz in the inbox: “Spain shut down Morgan with constant tough,not dirty, play well before the box area. With the early yellow will France be able to duplicate those tactic. French goalie just assumed a tip in on that goal.”Also: “Dunn still looks shaky. If France focuses on her this match is far from over.” But they won’t. It’s over.Note to emailers -- I am not going to mention the person whose name rhymes with “rump” and is a part-time resident of Washington, DC. Sorry.21 min: Do you know me? This is Tobin Heath. She plays right forward for the USA. She barely saw the ball against Spain but was very effective when she did. She’s one of the most skilled players in US women’s history.Rose Lavelle just tried to play the ball to her, but the pass was about 10 yards (9 meters) off target.18 min: A sweet cutback from Diani to beat Dunn, and that sets up a series of near-chances. Still nothing to trouble Naeher. France’s defenders play the ball around, hoping they’ve weathered the storm while only conceding one goal. And Rapinoe is down in pain again. Amandine Henry, who has played in the USA, chats with the ref. The Seattle-Portland rivalry is everywhere.16 min: I can’t possibly keep up with the US attack today. Neither can Bouhaddi, who has to race out of her box to play the ball away from Rapinoe (who was offside, the replay shows, but VAR is far behind). Then Mewis falls in the box with no contact, and Aly Wagner thinks it should be a card. Every sports journalist who watched women’s soccer religiously -- every four years -- would be aghast. They think US women don’t e. Nice one here ...Our Caitlin Murray, for one, does not think this is over. Hey, maybe Jill Ellis will bring in Carli Lloyd for Abby Dahlkemper just to make it interesting.14 min: Torrent whacks Rapinoe’s ankle from behind as is lucky not to see yellow. (As you may recall from the last MBM, I am not a US homer. This has just been dreadful from France so far.)13 min: Finally some attacking possession for France, and actually, it’s a half-decent chance in the end as Le Sommer gets her head on the second cross attempt. Naeher snares it, but replay showed it was going ...Pardon me -- Morgan shoots at the other end. Can we possibly try Spain’s defense with France’s offense? Would they have a chance?Look, so many French players play for Lyon, who win every game by a score of 308-0. You think they know how to play from behind? But follow along with us anyway8 min: France finally attack on Dunn’s flank. They’re offside. Well, maybe. Looked OK on the replay. OK, no deflection, and the three-time global goalkeeper of the year just lost the ball in traffic. It’s over. Calling it now. Bring on USA-England.Rapinoe’s free kick goes into traffic and emerges on the other side. Surely it was deflected?5 min: We spend a rather long time setting this up for some reason .. and ... 4 min: YELLOW CARD to Mbock! The USA take a quick throw-in, and Mbock grabs Alex Morgan as she races down the left flank near the box. Free kick now that Rapinoe will take. She has been erratic with these.2 min: Speaking of left backs who attack, Amel Majri (wearing No. 10) tries to work her way past O’Hara into the US box. She falls. There was no contact. Not a good idea. Refs from Ukraine don’t fall for that. 1 min: Instead of going straight at the left-back who isn’t a left-back, Crystal Dunn, France try to walk a tightrope down their left. The USA go the other direction, Rapinoe finds space to play to Ertz, and the USA already have as many shots on goal from the run of play as they did against Spain.Kickoff: The countdown is English. The kickoff is French. The ball is out of play.OK, all silliness aside -- this is one of those matchups you dream of seeing in sports. It’s a privilege to be here to talk about it.Here we go ... Speaking of penalty controversies, today’s officials are ... The first was rather obvious, wasn’t it? Anyway, tonight’s people in green are ... A few more of your pregame thoughts before I go into full-bore game mode. I mean full-blown. Hopefully not full bore.alincoln on Twitter, presumably referring to Horan’s omission from the starting XI: “Remember when Greg Ryan started Scurry over Solo against Brazil in 2007 WC?This is Ellis’ Greg Ryan moment and will also be her last game as HC of the USWNT.” Was there an off-field issue with Horan? Joe Pearson has already has wine. I’m on my third soda, which I never do. I don’t think caffeine affects me, though -- hey, should I rewire the entertainment center while I watch? I think I’ll also juggle. Je parle francais un peu, mais ma vocabulaire est tres mal. I’m the product of US schools. You’re all lucky I can speak English. Peter Oh: “I like the sound of “the Statue of Liberty derby”. Hopefully this match will be remembered only for the actions of the ladies on the pitch, and I’m not talking about the referees. No VARc de Triomphe, please!” Actually, I heard they checked the video again, and they’ve taken back the penalty awarded on the Lavelle we-won’t-say-e incident against Spain. We’ll have to play the rest of that game again. Anthems are underway, and France has the USA beaten there. As ever, I’m astounded at the disposable income Americans can conjure for things like this. I can’t even afford to see my alma mater play basketball, but I made poor career choices. “Poor” as in financial. This is clearly its own reward. Speaking of the red, white and blue, we have this from the mailbag from Jamison MacLachlan ...“The one HUGE Achilles Heel the US has is that they seem to have an inability to either recognize they need to make adjustments in game or they refuse to. ... If the US plays the way they did against Spain....lacking awareness and creativity in adjusting on both sides of the ball....it could be a long night for my red white and blue.” Which red, white and blue, though? Speaking of the seven European teams in the last eight, Shane Hart asks a question of all England fans: Who do you want to win? Red, white and blue! I lost the tweet that referred to this game as the Statue of Liberty matchup. At least we’re remembering that wonderful celebration of democratic ideals and not selling “freedom fries” any more. From our correspondent on the scene ... Brandon Dwonch, in the inbox: “I have not looked towards to a game this much since the Champions League Final.” But he says it’ll be goalless, and France will win 4-3 in PKs. (Or, as we pedants call it, kicks from the mark.)Worth noting -- the USA didn’t have a lot of shots on goal in the game against Spain. To be precise, three, including the two penalties.Also on the interwebs ... I picked the USA to win it all before we started, and I’m sticking with it. I also picked Australia to reach the final, so I may not be good at this.Today, I’m thinking if the US women score the first goal, it’s all but over. The French have a word for how that will feel -- Déjà vu.The host country has had a good team throughout the 2010s, but medals have been elusive. In 2011, two late goals by Abby Wambach and Alex Morgan pushed the US to a 3-1 win in the semifinals. They’ve never been closer to the top three than that.Tom Lutz informs me that, contrary to what I said previously, our sun cannot go supernova. That will be of little comfort in France, which just saw a record temperature of 45.9C. That’s nearly 115 degrees in US temperatures. Or, as we sometimes call it, Death Valley hot.But at Parc des Princes, it’s merely 30 degrees. That’s 86 in the USA, the land of stubborn measurements. And we’re told it’s not the same humidity as those of us who dwell on the US East Coast swim in every day. Unchanged from the last game. And it’s pretty much as projected from our team guide. Wendie Renard has made the odd uncharacteristic mistake here, but she and Griedge Mbock are a generally sound defensive partnership. And like the US women, they have more attackers than they can possibly start, with Delphine Cascarino being the in-vogue supersub. Lindsey Horan is a tremendous two-way midfielder. She has experience playing with an against the French players. She sat out the round of 16 game against Spain until the very end, perhaps because she was carrying a yellow card, and a second would put her out of action for the game against France.As it turns out, that didn’t matter. Out of the four main US midfielders -- Horan, defensive destroyer  attacker Julie Ertz, two-way player Samantha Mewis, and playmaker Rose Lavelle -- Horan is the one that sits. Another option Jill Ellis would have had -- sit Becky Sauerbrunn, one of the finest defenders in women’s soccer’s relatively brief history but coming off some minor injury concerns and a major mistake against Spain, to move Ertz to center back. Didn’t do that. It’s the familiar lineup at the back: Alyssa Naeher in goal, Sauerbrunn and Abby Dahlkemper at center back, attack-minded Crystal Dunn at left back, attack-minded Kelley O’Hara at right back, Ertz behind Mewis and Lavelle in the middle, Megan Rapinoe trying to do better on the left flank than she did against Spain, Tobin Heath trying to see more of the ball on the right than she did against Spain, and Alex Morgan trying to be fouled out of the play a lot less than she did against Spain. Personally, I’d put Dunn at forward in place of Rapinoe, and I’d go back in time to include Casey Short on the roster so she could play left back. Please check out the work Caitlin Murray and Sam Morris did with respect to the comparative World Cup bonuses that the US women might achieve in the next 10 days and the US men might achieve before the sun goes supernova. This is, of course, part of a couple of larger questions, and not just the glass ceiling in American workplaces. The tough part is that FIFA’s bonuses are pretty far from equal. In 2018, France got $38 million. This year, the winner will get $4 million.So your options are these ... It’s Brazil-Germany in the men’s World Cup. It’s Ronda Rousey vs. Cris Cyborg, had Rousey stuck with MMA and gone back up to her old weight class. It’s Kelly Clarkson vs. Susan Boyle in an all-star battle of reality-contest singers. Super Bowls are hyped for two weeks. This game has been hyped since the World Cup draw was made in December, assuming the USA and France would win their groups and their eighth-final games. (As it turns out, each team made hard work of it.)So this could be a contest of titanic proportions. Or it could be Mike Tyson knocking out Michael Spinks in 91 seconds. But let’s hope not. The winner faces England, which will be the next epic match.Beau will be here shortly. In the meantime, here’s Caitlin Murray on how today’s game may be settled:“We take set pieces very seriously,” Megan Rapinoe said in France before the USA’s first game of the tournament. “Those are moments you can practice, you can set things up, you can potentially catch the other team off guard, go quickly or if you’e got tricky plays. We have a lot of specialists in all the different areas of set plays.”Although the Americans are traditionally been strong on set pieces, such scenarios haven’t been the deciding factor for the Americans yet. France, meanwhile, have scored five of their goals in this tournament from set plays.Samantha Mewis, standing at almost 6ft tall, is the tallest outfield player the US have ever had. Wendie Renard, the French center back, has at least two inches on her and is the tallest player in this World Cup. If there’s a play the US will have to watch on corner kicks, it is surely Renard.“She’s great in the air and a really well-rounded player,” Mewis said Wednesday. “We all have so much respect for her and I think our setup on set pieces will remain the same – we just have to make sure were doing our jobs and executing because she’s definitely dangerous.”You can read the full article below:"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/94db4220ab43513b167afd449f9abb828b3ff973/0_960_4800_2880/master/4800.jpg?width=220\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e2248646fd29de6690548ade80d28132 220w","title":"a simple guide to finding the right travel insurance for you","story":"Travel insurance is hardly the most exciting holiday purchase, but it’s one of the most important. So, before you head off to warmer climes, check out this simple guide to holiday insurance to make sure you’re fully covered …Travel is said to broaden the mind, but for peace of mind it makes sense to secure the right travel insurance before you head off.According to Compare the Market, almost one in four people fail to take out travel insurance, leaving themselves at risk of returning home with a hefty bill should the worst happen – according to the Association of British Insurers, the average cancellation claim is £816, while the average medical claim is £1,300. Ouch!That’s not to say that the world of holiday insurance is easy breezy. With so many different policies on the market, narrowing down the right one for you can feel like an overwhelming chore.But fear not, travel fans – we’ve simplified the world of travel insurance to help you secure the right policy for your trip in a jiffy …Is travel insurance really necessary?Look, no one’s going to stop you from travelling without insurance, but it really wouldn’t be advised. We all head off in the hope that our trip will be all sunshine and poolside margaritas (well, some of us do!), but sadly not every trip is quite so blissful.Medical claims are one of the highest costs facing insurance companies. The NHS might treat us for free, but medical care in other parts of the world can come with a sizeable price tag, and some hospitals overseas may not even treat you unless they know you can pay for the care.So whether you fall ill, have a valuable item stolen or have to cut short or extend your trip due to an emergency, forking out for travel insurance could save you big bucks in the long-term.One size does not fit allTravel insurance is like a good suit – it’s got to be tailor-made. There are almost endless variables to consider from whether you want single trip or annual cover, to the number of people you want to include on the policy, and the activities and eventualities you want to insure against.Yes, finding the right travel insurance can be a tricky business. If you’re not sure where to start, Compare the Market is a good port of call. Not only can it provide you with an impartial and independent comparison of policies from a range of UK providers – based on your specific needs – in just a few clicks, but the travel insurance section of its website also has FAQs and helpful pointers (including sections specifically dedicated to different types of trip, such as golf holidays, backpacking and family trips) to help you narrow down your options.Read the small printAs with all insurance policies, when purchasing travel insurance, it’s really important that you READ THE SMALL PRINT! Check you’re happy with the excess (ie the amount you’ll have to pay towards any claim you make), ensure you’re definitely covered for all the activities you’re planning on doing, and double check you’re satisfied with the circumstances under which you’ll be able to make a claim.There is one more vital detail to check with travel insurance – how the country you’re visiting is classified geographically. Yes, you might think a country’s location is set in stone, but that’s not quite the case when it comes to travel insurance. Insurance providers group some countries differently for instance, while some classify Egypt and Turkey as Europe, others class them as “worldwide” destinations.Don’t leave your travel insurance to the last minuteIf you’re one of those people who gets their travel money at the airport, this point is probably for you! Smart shoppers bag their travel insurance as soon as they’ve booked their trip. Why? Because if your holiday is cancelled or delayed you should, depending on the terms of your precise policy, be able to claim for it – which ought to take some of the sting out of the situation.Head over to comparethemarket and get a travel insurance quote for your next trip.

When I go back home I have started to have issues with my family, especially my mother. Looking back, my childhood was quite dysfunctional: I was the product of a drunken one-night stand, yet my parents stayed together for quite a while. Because of this, my mum had an affair with a work colleague and thanks to all the tension in the house, both my parents became severely depressed and argumentative.The man she was seeing moved in, but he was controlling and creepy. My mum later told me that he is on the sex offenders register. He eventually moved out and my mum had to find a smaller house.She has become very tearful with me lately because she thinks I am cold towards her. I worry about her becoming depressed again (she’s been to her GP to ask to be put back on antidepressants), but I feel so hurt that my instinct is to stay away. I feel like a terrible human being, but I’m sick of being her emotional crutch.I’m contemplating staying at my university town for as long as possible to have some time away from her, but she said that when I left home she felt lonely and isolated. It feels selfish, but I’d much rather focus on my degree than have to check on her. I hate how much repressed anger I feel. I’ve turned into such a judgmental, aloof person, I doubt many people at college like me. I wish I could put everything behind me, but I can’t.It is not uncommon for people to leave home for the first time and look back and think, “What the hell was that all about?” Some of the actions of the adults around you wereare indefensible and irresponsible, and your anger is justified and valid.What I see is someone who (in your original letter) blames herself for a lot of things: for your parents staying together for your mum’s affair for her sex-offender partner leaving for her moving to a smaller house for her being depressed. Stop. None of this is your fault, or your responsibility.But I want you to think about the things you have done: you’ve got into a good university you are doing a course that is challenging you you are questioning things. You are not selfish.I talked to Avi Shmueli, a psychoanalyst (bpc.org.uk), who thought you were “insightful and determined to have a better existence”. He thought your belief that your parents had stayed together because of you gave you a feeling of huge power (although probably unconsciously). It took me a while to understand this comment but then it clicked: if you think your existence has caused something as colossal as two people to stay together, you then feel responsibility for it and everything that follows.And, Shmueli continued, “because you feel responsible for your mum’s unhappiness but can’t make her happy, you are hugely angry, but don’t know what to do with that anger, other than blocking it”. The problem is that you can’t choose to suppress only the anger: block one emotion, and you block everything. This is why you probably feel “aloof”. It’s a protection mechanism.Shmueli wondered what you thought would happen if you told your mother how you felt? He said that you probably feared destroying your relationship, but that, actually, part of you already feels as if you have done that. You haven’t, of course, but you’ve internalised that guilt. “You also seem to feel that having any sort of life takes it away from your mother.” It doesn’t.Your instinct to be by yourself is not selfish but self-preserving. Listen to it. Your mother has made her choices. You aren’t as powerful as you think: this sounds like an insult, but it’s an attempt to help you look at things in proportion. What you can do now is accept responsibility for your life. Study, make the best of what you have and leave your mother to her life. It won’t be easy and won’t happen overnight. I would also urge you to talk to someone in more depth – maybe a counsellor attached to your university or GP’s surgery.I find it helpful to visualise responsibility as bags of shopping. If you go through life carrying everyone else’s bags, eventually you become so weighed down you can’t move. You then have a choice: either collapse under the weight or stop, ide the bags and give them back to their owners. This isn’t unkind, it’s the start for a potentially equal, healthy relationship.• Send your problem to annalisa.barbieri@mac.

Almost half of those who chose not to switch said the process was too time-consuming, while a slightly lower number were put off by having to contact multiple providers.Under the new “text-to-switch” process, consumers text PAC to a number, after which the code is sent back. The code is valid for 30 days. The response from the provider will also need to include details of early termination charges or pay-as-you-go credit balances. The consumer can them pass the number on to their new provider.

Musically, it’s often stunning. However, Sellars’ treatment, though striking, may not be to everyone’s taste.The action is largely confined to a platform in front of the orchestra, though Haraschta the poacher (Hanno Müller-Brachmann) prowls around in the stalls, his rifle slung across his shoulders. Cast and chorus are uniformly dressed in black, and there is no visible differentiation between animals and humans. However, video projections above the orchestra provide images of teeming nature and the drab world of mankind. Quivering tadpoles become frogs during the introduction, and insects copulate during the love scene between Lucy Crowe’s Vixen and Sophia Burgos’s Fox. Gerald Finley’s Forester seemingly lives not in a lodge but in an urban apartment block, while folk dancers prance about at Haraschta’s wedding. The end result, though admirably free from cuteness or sentimentality, can on occasion be charmless, and short on the playfulness that offsets the beauty and sadness of the score.Finley, in a deeply moving performance, is in many ways the protagonist here, a melancholy, alienated figure who eventually finds contentment in acceptance of the eternal renewal of nature. Crowe, in superb voice, makes a wonderful Vixen, mischievous, charismatic, naive yet tender in her duet with Burgos. In a consistently good cast, Peter Hoare’s sad Schoolmaster, Jan Martiník’s dour Parson and Müller-Brachmann, gritty sounding and fierce, stand out.The choral contributions – from the London Symphony Chorus and the children of the LSO Discovery Voices – are extremely fine. The work itself, meanwhile, has long been among Rattle’s personal favourites. “It’s the piece that made me want to become an opera conductor,” he writes in the programme, and he conducts it with great affection, keenly alert both to its drama and the astonishing beauty of its evocation of the natural world. The playing is outstanding.• Repeated at the Barbican, London, on 29 June."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1e3d71a2d4b195f6dcdcecb677a005d6b32a6dba/0_307_3101_1860/master/3101.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cf923cbf1676d62acb3985cd73eb8c71","title":"meet rosalia madonna and almodovars favourite flamenco star","story":"Her take on the Gypsy art form has powered the Catalan maverick’s rise, and as for cries of cultural appropriation: ‘Music is beyond races,’ she saysRosalía always knew she would be famous. “I’m a spiritual person so I had a vision of this moment in my life,” she says the day before her cover of Spanish Vogue drops, and a week on from being namechecked by Madonna in an interview (more on that later). In the space of just two years she has evolved from singing flamenco standards on her death-obsessed debut album Los Ángeles, to controversially modernising that genre’s folkloric traditions via the high-gloss sheen of R\u0026ampB on her breakthrough collection El Mal Querer, swiftly becoming pop’s most exciting new superstar in the process. Last year, in a New York Times profile, the 25-year-old was hailed as “the Rihanna of flamenco”.Along the way, she has picked up fans ranging from James Blake to Alicia Keys (to whom she’s been giving Spanish lessons) and director Pedro Almodóvar, who cast her in his latest film Pain and Glory. That’s thanks in part to the album’s crossover hit Malamente, full of complex handclap rhythms and sleek electronic pulses, which landed her five Latin Grammy nominations and a performance at the MTV Europe music awards. Its head-spinning, Hype-Williams-does-Top-Gear video, featuring Rosalía executing flawless choreography in the back of a lorry, and later being lifted skywards on the prongs of a forklift, currently stands at 85m YouTube views. Its mix of industrial, modern and traditional (matadors lure motorbikes rather than bulls cape-wearing penitents glide around on skateboards) is a perfect encapsulation of Rosalía’s merging of Spain’s past and present. It’s been a busy 12 months, capped this weekend with a performance at Glastonbury that will see her reach a whole new audience, a la Christine and the Queens in 2016, and tighten her grip as global pop’s latest innovator.If this newfound fame has unsettled her, she is not showing it. “I feel like I’ve been preparing all my life for this moment,” she says on the phone from a Barcelona studio. Her grasp of English is much better than she gives herself credit for – “Oh my God, my English is the worst!” she screams in frustration at one point – considering all her songs are performed in Spanish. “I’m working harder now than at any other point in my life because I have a fear of losing what I have,” she adds. “Before, I had nothing I didn’t have any contacts in the industry, nobody around me was a musician, so it was really hard. But I also had nothing to lose so I’ve always been fearless.”That determination has been put to the test recently with accusations from certain sections of the Spanish media that Rosalía’s use of flamenco iconography – traditions fostered by the art form’s historical ties to Spain’s marginalised Gypsy (or Gitanos) community in Andalusia – amounts to cultural appropriation. Rosalía was born in the more affluent region of Catalonia and critics have cited her use of Gitano vocabulary and phrasing as problematic. “Flamenco is suffering a kind of institutional racism that whitewashes the art form and markets it like a piece of meat wrapped up in plastic,” Gitana activist Noelia Cortés told Public Radio International in 2018. While Rosalía’s initial position was defensive, citing in interviews the fact that she studied flamenco from a young age as proof of her passion (she has a bachelor’s degree in flamenco vocal performance), she offers a slightly more balanced take today.“It is very important that people understand how important flamenco is to the Gypsy community,” she says, choosing her words carefully. “There have been some amazing Gypsy artists. It’s important that we give visibility to that, but at the same time people have to be fair and recognise that Paco de Lucía was the biggest guitar player in this style of music in the world and he wasn’t Gypsy. Lola Flores was the biggest Spanish female flamenco icon and she wasn’t Gypsy. Music is beyond races, beyond territories.”She says she is aware, too, of her privileged position and keen to create a platform “that’s helpful for all the people who don’t have the opportunities”. She grows angry, however, when reflecting on the implication that she is nothing more than a capitalist construct and that flamenco is merely an adornment to a campaign with a huge marketing budget the Association of Feminist Gitanas for Diversity (AFGD) last year dismissed her as a “poseur”.Rosalía relaxes when explaining why she was drawn to flamenco in the first place. At the age of 13, she and sister Pili (now her stylist) would hang out near parks with older friends who’d blare its tales of emotional blood-letting from their car stereos. She was captivated instantly. When I ask why, she hesitates, adding a “this is my personal opinion” caveat, so as not to ruffle any feathers. “I would say, for me, flamenco is so pure, so raw,” she says. “I love pop culture but sometimes I miss the root, the rawness. With flamenco, I felt like I always needed it, I just didn’t know it. It’s purer than anything else for me. If you don’t put the truth into it, it won’t work. I don’t know what it will be but it won’t be flamenco.” If flamenco is the music of passion, of experience, of a life well lived, where does the wise-beyond-her-years sadness that permeates her songs emanate from? The answer, it turns out, is Carl Jung. “He talks about a collective unconsciousness, and I love this concept. I’m a spiritual person, and I really think that we don’t just die.”For now, there are more pressing matters at hand. Earlier I had asked what her friends would say about her. “They’d say I’m a perfectionist, that I’m a workaholic and that they don’t see me as much as they’d like to,” she said. And they’re right. She currently has collaborations with the likes of Pharrell, Arca, Oneohtrix Point Never, Billie Eilish and Dua Lipa to get finished and the recording studio is calling. “We’re hopefully going to finish all these songs soon and I can’t wait to share them,” she says, near breathless. “I’m excited.” We all should be."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a0c3b2b517e31be4675517ba1c13f790ec1a9f0e/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=788b7b3d50d45dad1c75331a18eeccae","title":"welcome to glastonbury 2019 in pictures","story":"Wednesday saw the early arrivals, a dazzling fireworks display – and the first night of after-dark debauchery "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ccf37c54c4b869eb50e444b421d1f1d42762cf1/0_0_4654_2793/master/4654.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=44720604a5256c2c7c4d2c7014691fa9","title":"friday at glastonbury follow all the action live","story":"Earlier today saw Sheryl Crow, Bastille, and Lewis Capaldi take to the stage – continue following our coverage in the buildup to Stormzy’s headline slotOK, have switched over to George Ezra, an artist whose fake-bluesman shtick I found incomprehensible for a long time until my nephews played him repeatedly during a recent visit to their house. The earworm must have wriggled inside because I found myself sneakily playing Paradise and Shotgun in the car on the way home. Ezra is not going to challenge your preconceptions of what math-rock can achieve, but on a sunny festival stage he’s basically the dream booking. Here are some superfans who’d been queuing at the Pyramid all day for a top spot ... Idles are now covering a medley of Sheryl Crow’s All I Wanna Do and Adele’s Someone Like You. Possibly they’re doing both songs at the same time, such a racket it is. Now they’ve moved on to Nothing Compares 2 U and a Harry Styles number. This is quite ... weird.Not sure anyone will top this Glastonbury coverage ... can anyone get Tim a job at the Beeb? Idles not only playing an incendiary set but also seem to have stellar advice for other bands on the bill struggling with this heatwave – simply play in your pants! Every time Lauryn Hill is booked to play a gig, one eternal question arises: will she show? And if she does, how late will she be? So many have Ms Hill’s missed appearances been that to her fans, just the virtue of her turning up seems enough to justify the ticket price.So, at 6.10pm on the Pyramid Stage, 10 minutes after the scheduled start, there was a palpable nervous energy that rippled through the gigantic crowd. Hill’s tour DJ valiantly spun the classic pre-gig fillers: Drop It Like It’s Hot, et al. but the audience was beginning to reckon with another disappointment. Gladly, though, five minutes later and Hill appeared resplendent and imperiously hatted in black, backed by three singers and a five–piece band.Currently winding up a 20th anniversary tour in celebration of her debut album, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill, Hill’s band were a well-oiled machine, responding with all the speed and efficiency of fearful children to their leader’s sharp hand signals and reprimands at the end of each song.Opening with the anthemic Lost Ones, Hill’s vocals were breathless and somewhat patchy, leaving the bulk of the singing to her harmonising backing trio. It was only on the Fugees’ classic, Killing Me Softly With His Song, which opened with a solo vocal, that a glimpse of Hill’s true talent shone through. Notwithstanding the no-show controversies, her battles with the IRS and even recent allegations of plagiarism, here her voice dug deep within to provide gossamer-light runs over the embellished chords. Finally, the audience were right there with her and Hill ended on that most coveted of phenomena: the Glastonbury singalong to the final chorus.BBC Two’s coverage has stopped so I’ve jumped over to iPlayer to watch the incomparable Idles … Joe Talbot has just delivered an impassioned tribute to his wife, Elizabeth, who has “sacrificed all this bullshit” to raise their child. He asks the crowd to cheer on the mums out there before launching into Mother (some especially good rolling of the “R”s going on here).The thing I like most about this Charlatans performance (other than the dungarees) is how youthful Tim Burgess looks ... and how bad the rest of the band do. A real Dorian Gray thing going on.Flipping flags. In the way if you are there. In the way on iPlayer. The only flag I truly appreciated was the ‘Fist Me J*sus’ of about 10 years ago - pure genius!Won’t anybody think of Rob S? He can’t see a thing for your stupid flags.Rosalía does not need a wind machine to make clear that she is cooler than literally everybody else at Glastonbury: that much is evident within seconds of her hyper-stylish performance on the John Peel stage. Surrounded by female dancers in matching long, dark ponytails, she flashes between tenderness and a mode best described as “come and ’ave a go” as she flexes through her kinetic flamenco-rooted pop. When she sings one song totally a cappella, her voice flutters and billows like one of the flags steaming over the Pyramid stage, and the sight of a man in the front row singing – and truly feeling – every word makes her lip tremble, her effort to suppress tears palpable. But suddenly, she shifts to a tone of admonishment, summoning a palpable wrath and vengeance that transcends the language barrier (although there are an impressive number of people singing along).Her set – at first bafflingly under-attended, but soon rammed – is a masterclass in how to pull off heightened craft without quashing the emotion, in contrasts of light and dark. The traditional palmas – handclaps – girding her songs are hardened to uncompromisingly tough beats one song orbits around the strum of a Spanish guitar, processed and repeated into a subaqueous, menacing pattern. Meanwhile, Barefoot in the Park, her duet with James Blake (not here today) is as light as peachy cirrus. It’s phenomenal, whether she’s performing alone or with her girl gang, and the unrelenting spells of between song applause come as no surprise. Comparisons to Beyoncé are audible in the post-show chatter. It’s the rare occasion that they don’t feel like hyperbole.I’ve barely had time to compute Tim Burgess’s blonde mop and dungarees combo and now BBC2’s coverage has started with the promise of music from Jorja Smith and others. First up, though, is … er, Bastille and Lewis Capaldi (the problem with liveblogging is you can’t leg it to the healing tents during moments like these).There’s a bit of a buzz about Rosalía’s Glastonbury set (“If you’re not at Rosalía you’re missing out” – Laura Snapes, 2019). You can find out more about Madonna’s favourite flamenco star by reading tomorrow’s  Guide cover feature here.Norman, Norman ... if there’s one thing you should have learned about Glastonbury by now it’s that: 1) Nobody wants to be reminded about the toilets.2) And nobody wants to be reminded just how much cleaner the backstage ones are.So while our writers head off to indulge themselves in the joys of a sunny Glastonbury, you lot now have the joy of following along live with me, Tim Jonze, from the ’s rather less sunny office. I forgot my cider, sadly, but I do have a steaming hot cup of FOMO beside me right now.Still, we’ve got the television – and each other – so we’re surely in for a fun-packed Friday night. I’ve just tuned into Lauryn Hill singing the beautiful To Zion, which seems a fairly good place to start as we build up to Stormzy’s historic set.Great lineup tonight up at the Crow’s Nest – essentially a grab bag of the best in new indie.

He said that the “the real world” would take over from the rash promises the pair had made to party members.Clarke, 78, who has represented the Nottinghamshire borough of Rushcliffe since 1970, now appears to be calling time on his long career. He has held the chancellor, home secretary and education secretary posts among other ministerial roles.“You’ve got to hold yourself out for doing five more years and do the job properly,” he said. “I’m currently minded to step down. I’ve told my people in Nottingham that I’m not standing again. I just think in every walk of life, particularly politics, you got to decide to pack it up before people start dropping hints telling you to pack it up because you can’t do it any more.”Clarke had suggested 2015 would be his last election, but changed his mind and stood again in 2017.Regarding the promises made by Johnson and Hunt in the Conservative leadership election, Clarke said both Labour and the Tories had been pushed towards more fringe views than those of their MPs after altered rules involving party members electing leaders.He said: “Both parties were doomed, in hindsight, when they followed the 1990s fashion of making our parties democratic. They’re not ready for it.“Now we have the membership, which in both parties’ cases is totally unrepresentative of the vote for the respective parties, which now chooses the party leader.“That’s why it looks like we’re winding up with Jeremy Corbyn and Boris Johnson, who are two of the people most unrepresentative of public opinion at large that you could possibly imagine.”Johnson has promised to deliver Brexit by 31 October “do or die”, while Hunt has pledged to push for a no-deal departure if needed. Those outcomes were very unlikely to happen whoever won, Clarke said.He added: “They are pitching themselves at the electorate they are doomed to have to appeal to. I don’t think either candidate believes leaving with no deal makes the slightest sense at all.“Jeremy hedges it, Boris does his usual thing of changing the way he expresses it day by day. He’ll make his mind up what he’ll actually do, regardless of what he actually said, if he actually finds himself prime minister, and I’m sure Jeremy will start getting back to common sense if he finds himself prime minister.“Neither of them thinks we’re going to leave with no deal on 31 October. It is, in all practical terms, impossible.”Clarke was dismissive about the leadership campaign as a whole. “When the Conservative party can’t think of anything sensible to do in a crisis it always has a leadership election. And I’ve taken part in several of them.”He said that in the end “sanity and the real world” would deliver a moderate Conservative government.“We might return to normality. But it’ll be a different normality. It’ll take a generation to cure the isions that this issue has caused. It has broken the political system. We will have multi-party parliaments. I think if we had an election, god knows how many parties would be in and what the respective balance would be.”Clarke reiterated his threat to potentially back a motion of no-confidence against a new Tory government if it pushed for no deal over leaving the EU, saying he faced a dilemma.“As I don’t think that the declared policy position of either candidate is remotely credible, nor do I think it is what either of them think it is what they’re going to pursue, I shall wait to see what the prime minister says he and the government he forms actually intends to do,” he said.This, Clarke added, was a luxury he could indulge in as a veteran not seeking to stand again. “I don’t want the new leader to make me parliamentary under-secretary for nuts and bolts.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/83302542c82f91f289480e2a0ac7ade89372b74f/0_23_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=326a21d0ecab2982320df6e6cf6f90c5","title":"boris is a performer tory members prepare for hustings in exeter","story":"Underdog appears to have impressed but Boris Johnson loyalists remain confidentRichard Norman had got up early to make sure of his car parking spot and was first in the queue for the Exeter Conservative leadership hustings, the latest round in the battle between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt for the hearts, minds and votes of the party faithful.Resplendent in a Royal British Legion jacket, Norman, 75, took his place at the Sandy Park conference centre neutral but thinking Johnson was probably his man. He left feeling differently.“I’m going to support Jeremy Hunt,” said Norman, who is from east Devon. “He’s a much more thoughtful guy and I believe that will be better for the country. I’m glad I came.”At the other end of the age scale, Hunt also managed to woo 17-year-old students Alex Hall and Alecia Mason, from Torbay. “I was leaning towards Boris at the start,” said Hall. “But I was taking notes and found myself writing less when it was Jeremy Hunt’s turn because I was fixated on what he was saying. Boris has the personality but Hunt seems more about getting on with the job.”Mason agreed. “I don’t think Johnson is willing to change,” she said. “It’s clear Jeremy will sculpt his views and compromise.”It was striking how many people entering the conference centre next to Exeter Chiefs’ rugby pitch on Friday were wearing badges supporting both candidates.Jo McCready, a 48-year-old IT worker from Bristol, was also undecided on the way in. As she left she said: “I think I’m leaning towards Jeremy. He seems more grounded he does have a Brexit plan – bringing factions of the Conservatives together and the DUP. You don’t hear that from Boris, I don’t know what Boris’s plan is. Jeremy has fact and detail.”The men did not go head-to-head but addressed the room and took questions separately. Johnson went first and reminded people that he had been raised on a Devon farm. Revelations were few and when asked to tell the audience something they didn’t know about him, Johnson said he weighed 15 and a half stone. Questioned over what failings he had learned from when a minister, he said he had been mistaken to think he could forge better relations with Russia.One member asked if he was too “frit” to take on Hunt in more television debates. He said two was “more than enough”. He would not commit to including Hunt in a future cabinet if he won.Hunt, when his turn came, told the audience he had lived in Devon for two years when his naval officer father was posted there but accepted he was a “grockle” - local slang for holidaymakers and other incomers.Asked whether character mattered – an invitation to criticise Johnson’s – he replied: “Of course character matters,” but he said private life should not be part of that.Hunt said there should be further head-to-head debates before Tory party members receive their ballot papers this time next week. Hunt said many would vote by return – that was what Tories did – before the next TV head-to-head. On which failing he had learned from, he cited the junior doctors’ strike when he was health secretary. Unlike Johnson, Hunt said he would love to have his opponent in his cabinet, and he gave a strong hint that if he lost he would be keen to remain foreign secretary.The standing ovation at the end of Hunt’s half of the hustings was slightly larger than Johnson’s – though that might have been because he went second and people were anxious to stretch their legs.Hunt clearly made new friends in Exeter, and in Bournemouth the night before, but the Johnson loyalists were still confident.Gavin Donovan, who lives in a village just outside Exeter and works in property, said his mind had not been changed. “I thought Boris was particularly great – energetic and fired up and ready to take on the mantle. There are no reservations about his character for me. I love his positivity.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/38812fd71524401c604c77592a9a1be9dde8cd0b/431_557_3386_2033/master/3386.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e13bf2a7741c116af6a93ebe8b3c7e7b","title":"theresa may exchanges cool handshake with vladimir putin","story":"PM addresses Russian leader at G20 over ‘wider pattern of unacceptable behaviour’Theresa May has upbraided Vladimir Putin for the Salisbury poisoning, calling it a “truly despicable act”, during a frosty one-to-one meeting at the G20 summit in Osaka that is likely to be their last encounter.After exchanging a handshake, during which May appeared stern, the pair held the first half of their 80-minute meeting alone, with only translators in the room.A senior government official confirmed that before the meeting, the prime minister had read a defiant interview with the Russian president in the Financial Times, in which he declared liberalism to be “obsolete”.According to a Downing Street spokesperson, she told Putin: “The use of a deadly nerve agent on the streets of Salisbury formed part of a wider pattern of unacceptable behaviour and was a truly despicable act that led to the death of a British citizen, Dawn Sturgess.”And she confronted Putin with the fact that the UK had gathered “irrefutable evidence that Russia was behind the attack – based on painstaking investigations and cooperation with our allies”.“She said that this behaviour could never be repeated and that the UK wants to see the two iniduals responsible brought to justice,” the spokesperson added.“The prime minister underlined that we remain open to a different relationship, but for that to happen the Russian government must choose a different path. The prime minister said the UK would continue to unequivocally defend liberal democracy and protect the human rights and equality of all groups, including LGBT people.”The prime minister had insisted before the pair met that Britain’s relationship with Russia could not return to “business as usual” while the suspects from the Salisbury poisoning remained at large and Moscow continued to carry out disinformation and cyber-attacks.“It’s not business as usual and it can’t be business as usual with Russia until they stop the sort of acts we have seen them doing around the world,” she told ITV. “We in the UK have seen the use of a nerve agent, a chemical weapon, on the streets of Salisbury.“But we see other Russian activity around the world – we see the use of disinformation, cyber-attacks – and we need to see Russia desisting from that activity.”The two leaders met after Putin’s FT interview in which he attacked liberalism and made light of the poisoning of the Russian former spy Sergei Skripal in Salisbury last year.Elsewhere in the interview, Putin said “the so-called liberal idea” had “outlived its purpose”, and criticised open borders and multiculturalism.He said Russia was taking action against unfettered migration, “whereas the liberal idea presupposes that nothing needs to be done. The migrants can kill, plunder and rape with impunity because their rights as migrants must be protected. What rights are these? Every crime must have its punishment.”May also told Putin the UK would “continue to unequivocally defend liberal democracy and protect the human rights and equality of all groups, including LGBT people”, in what appeared to be a response to Putin’s uncompromising remarks in the FT interview.Reporters were admitted to the early moments of the meeting between the pair, before leaving the room to allow them to speak “leader to leader”, as the prime minister called it. She looked serious throughout.The widow of Alexander Litvinenko, who was poisoned in London in 2006 with a radioactive cup of tea, said she was disappointed May had agreed to meet Putin.Marina Litvinenko said the prime minster had failed to mention Andrei Lugovoi and Dmitry Kovtun – the two Russian assassins who had poisoned her husband. Putin has refused to extradite the pair. A UK public inquiry in 2016 found them responsible for Litvinenko’s murder. It said Russia’s president had “probably” approved the assassination.“Mrs May has said nothing about what happened to my husband. He was a British citizen when he died. The two suspects for his murder should be brought to justice.” Earlier, Putin appeared at a press briefing alongside Donald Trump. When asked by a reporter whether he would challenge Putin over interfering in elections, the US president turned to his counterpart, wagged his finger and said: “Don’t meddle in the election, president.” The pair laughed.May is also meeting the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, and the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, at the two-day summit in Japan.It is one of May’s final outings on the world stage, before she hands over the keys to 10 Downing Street to either Boris Johnson or Jeremy Hunt next month."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/098accb9cdf3317b99c50fcde77630cb0a14c1c5/0_41_2409_1445/master/2409.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=645099f130aba515f35395cb1c9080c9","title":"uk must decide next step on brexit france europe minister","story":"Amélie de Montchalin says EU 27 countries are not putting pressure on Britain over BrexitFrance’s minister for European affairs, Amélie de Montchalin, has said it is up to the UK to decide the next step on Brexit and no single European Union country was pressuring London, least of all France.Asked to respond to a report that Boris Johnson, the Conservative leadership favourite, had called the French “turds” over Brexit, De Montchalin declined to comment, saying she was unfamiliar with the word.The minister said Brexit was “a British issue for the British to decide”.She told the Anglo-American Press Association in Paris: “If the UK wants to leave the EU, and in an orderly way, the withdrawal agreement is the deal on the table, which has been negotiated for over two years. We’ve also said that the political declaration on the future relationship is open to discussion if the prime minister had a majority.”De Montchalin said the key question was to move on as quickly as possible to think about the future relationship. “What is important is how we work together on the future on issues that are economic, academic, cultural, social, defence and security – what we’ll do together, and we’ll do a lot together, that’s certain.”She said the EU 27 countries were united on Brexit.Asked if France would back giving another extension to Britain’s leaving date beyond 31 October, De Montchalin said there would have to be a political element “which showed that, if more time is given, something will be happening”. She said for the last extension, which was given in the spring, this was after cross-party talks between Conservatives and Labour. For any future request, there would have to be a process in place. “If it’s just the question ‘we’d like more time’, the EU council is very clear on that: there’s no reason for it without a new political scheme being put forward.”She said the advantage of the withdrawal agreement was that it included a transition period “which allows us to discuss the future in a stabilised situation. If there was not an exit agreement, we’d be discussing the future in a situation that wasn’t stabilised.”She said many EU countries had made contingency preparations for a no-deal exit “not because they want that” but because there might be a possibility it could happen by accident.“The cost of uncertainty is high – in the economy in general, in industry, in the financial sector, among fishermen on both sides of channel who don’t know what’s happening tomorrow,” she said. “I think there are a certain number of governments, who see the cost of that.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0bc59a011949da45b3805b2aee398c5e6bec63b5/0_107_2480_1488/master/2480.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=765cd0b4bbe23d727ffd55c1e27060cd","title":"apollo 11 tapes moon landing sale value nearly lost","story":"Tapes identified in 2008 as the only surviving original recording of the first moon landing in 1969 are to go up for auction in JulyWhen Gary George bought a truckload of videotapes for $218 from a US government surplus auction more than 40 years ago, he planned to sell them to television stations – to record over.Fortunately, he decided to hold on to the three tapes labelled “Apollo 11 EVA”, which have since been identified as the only surviving original recording of the first moon landing, in 1969.Now the tapes – which include Neil Armstrong’s famous words “That’s one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind” – are to go on sale in July at Sotheby’s in New York, where they are expected to fetch as much as $2m.The collection also includes footage of Buzz Aldrin walking in minimal lunar gravity, planting the US flag on the moon, collecting samples. It also shows the crew’s call with Richard Nixon.George, now 65, was astonished. “I had no idea there was anything of value on them,” the retired mechanical engineer from Las Vegas told Reuters. “I was selling them to TV stations just to record over.”George thinks he sold eight reels to television stations for $50 each. It was his father who spotted the three Nasa labelled reels.“He was really into the space program and he said, ‘I think I’d hang on to those. They might be valuable someday. So, for that very reason, I pulled them out and hauled them around the country for the next 43 years. That’s how come they survived.”In 2006, Nasa admitted that they could not find the original video recordings of the landing. It was not until two years later, when George was on holiday with a friend who worked at Nasa, that he found out they were looking for them.“Quite frankly, I was sitting at the table drinking a beer and I said, ‘Well, damn, I have those,’” said George.He did not have the equipment to watch the tapes, but after he started speaking to Nasa about handing them over he was able to see the footage for the first time in a special studio in California."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ab309586e55bd02f5ee85455752643cf5918b5e/0_2614_3370_2021/master/3370.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=28f1928947d8c7bea65c453b3c93bace","title":"share your experiences of sure start childrens centres","story":"Whether you helped set up the programme in your area or your family used a centre near you, we would like to hear your storiesThe flagship Sure Start programme has saved the NHS millions of pounds through the benefits it has brought to children including some of the most deprived areas and reducing the number of those taken to hospital, according to a study.Research by the Institute for Fiscal Studies “found that where Sure Start offered high levels of service in poor neighbourhoods in England, visits to hospital to treat injuries fell among all children of primary school age, and by a third of all 11-year-olds”.Tracy Brabin, the shadow early years minister, said: “This research shows the critical role Sure Start plays in children’s health, as well as their development.

In front of an anticipated crowd of 120,000 over the two days, with the majority of tickets having been sold in the UK, the sport is determined to make up for lost time in promoting the USA’s ‘national pastime’ to new audiences.Baseball is making its bow in London 12 years after the first competitive NFL fixture was played in the city but Boone’s counterpart at the Red Sox, Alex Cora, shrugged off any concerns that the sport might be late in trying to broaden its international appeal.On Friday afternoon the London Stadium had already reached a pitch of excitement. Both teams performed open training sessions with as many as 2,000 fans – including Spike Lee and Raheem Sterling – watching on, as well as a massive US media contingent.The stadium’s usual tenants, West Ham United, have handed over the running of the venue to the MLB for the duration and new, intensified security is just one of the noticeable differences. Dressing rooms were deemed insufficiently accommodating for American athletes and have been done up, while bevvies of east London volunteers have been given laminated copies of the lyrics to Take Me Out to the Ball Game, which they will be expected to sing should the moment require it.The Red Sox are in third place in the American League East, nine games behind the leaders, the Yankees. Only the isional winner is guaranteed a place in the play-offs but, with the 162-game regular season at only its mid-point, the pressure to win is not overwhelming for the current champions. This could be fortunate given the unusual nature of the baseball field they will be playing on.The demands of converting a football stadium (itself a description that has come under question by some West Ham fans) to a baseball field has required a number of changes. Firstly the diamond is perpendicular to the layout of the oval-shaped stadium, leaving a centre field position (straight in front of the hitter) which is much shorter than usual. Grass has been replaced with AstroTurf, imported from France, while the dust around the diamond has been imported too, from Slippery Rock, Pennsylvania. There is also an unusually large foul area to the sides of the diamond and the possibility of foul balls smashing back off the lighting system that hangs off the stadium’s roof.Not that any idiosyncrasies were putting anyone off. The Yankees’ right-fielder Aaron Judge, one of the sport’s biggest new stars, smiled when he was asked about the curtailed centre field. “We’ve got two potent offenses and, with the dimensions of this park, we’re going to have a bit of fun with it,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2939adaf0dba8fb517b69cd246316633e72b81ed/0_341_4086_2452/master/4086.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=87f8789badf49d3a6f0c96d0f54fb22c","title":"sri lanka south africa cricket world cup match report","story":"Anyone arriving at Chester-le-Street just after two o’clock would have been bewildered to find two umpires, 11 men in green and two batsmen flat on the ground, faces nose deep in the grass as a swarm of bees buzzed across the square. But there was no sting in the tale for Eoin Morgan, as Sri Lanka fluffed the understudy lines suddenly thrust at them and declined the offer to draw level on points with England – without completely removing the possibility of qualifying for the semi-finals as the complicated last-gasp dance continues.The nine-wicket victory with more than 12 overs remaining was only South Africa’s second win in what has been a personal dog’s dinner of a tournament. Their solitary victory before this was a slow crawl against Afghanistan. Yet there were signs of life in this autumnal triumph – a disciplined bowling display, sucking the Sri Lankans into self-destruct mode, and some incidental high-class fripperies with the bat from Hashim Amla and Faf du Plessis.Amla clonked two balls of the first over of South Africa’s reply to the boundary, leaning gloriously into a stroke on the off side before flicking the next ball through midwicket as Lasith Malinga drifted on to his pads. But in Malinga’s next over he repeatedly rooted his feet to the ground while awkwardly jousting outside off stump. A little later he pulled out a lofted shot that crawled to a standstill short of the boundary. Then a poky nudge, followed by the purest of cover drives.And so it went on, sumptuousness followed by inelegance, on a slow pitch that proved tricky for any strokeplay other than the most gung-ho.The only wicket to fall in the innings was that of Quinton de Kock, who after three fours was mesmerised by one of Malinga’s low-armed slingers, a dipping speedy yorker that crept between bat and pad to crash into the stumps. Du Plessis, the tall-standing foil to Amla’s shuffling master, finished 96 not out, clocking up his third fifty of the World Cup. He also hit the shot of the day – a dancing, towering six which was the 265th of the tournament – 88 metres straight over the Lumley End off Suranga Lakmal. His next ball was pulled masterfully through midwicket for four. Amla finished unbeaten on 80, his biggest scare coming when he gave himself out after seeing a reviewed lbw on the big screen, only to be called back when it was revealed the ball pitched outside leg stump.Their unbroken stand of 175 was South Africa’s highest of the tournament and gave some easy afternoon pleasure to a full ground enjoying the first of its three World Cup fixtures, a gentle breeze cooling the ground in anticipation of the heatwave on its slow march north.Du Plessis won the early-morning toss and had a bowl, looking for some seam movement on a good pitch. What was he after? “A win,” came the rather desperate answer. South Africa had won 16 of their last 18 ODIs against Sri Lanka but World Cup campaigns can run sides low.Sri Lanka had been given permission by the ICC to pull on their lucky yellow change jerseys that they had worn when they beat England but luck turned out to be in short supply.Dimuth Karunaratne was out to the very first ball of the morning, caught off guard by some bounce from Kagiso Rabada, his horizontal bat limp as the ball billowed to Du Plessis at second slip. From there Kusal Perera and Avishka Fernando decided to live by the sword, slotting four fours each as their left-hand right-hand combination threw the bowlers off their line. But both fell for 30, snared by the excellent man of the match, Dwaine Pretorius, playing his first World Cup game. Theirs were to be the highest scores in a total of 203 as Sri Lanka’s middle order chose to live by the sofa, stodging along, settling in, slow between the wickets, happy to block out balls – there were 187 dots in the innings – until suddenly throwing the popcorn in the air in big-hitting panic and getting out.Malinga, still a crowd favourite after all these years and who, incidentally, can still touch his toes at the start of his spells, had time to swat a burly boundary before being last man out, with three balls of the innings to spare.Things are likely to be rather more tense when England play here on Wednesday in what could be a sudden-death game against New Zealand. After the game Pretorius said: “The guys are stoked, we showed what we are capable of, I’m just sad that it’s too late.” England live in terror that the opposite could be true for them – they have already shown us what they can do, only to fall at the last."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/490ee99ca5aeab86db3bb6cac31c6eebbec5ceb6/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7ed709d772162d73c4c5236a42e710bf","title":"england win world cup cricket deserve barney ronay","story":"The 50-over game, and the game in general, is fast disappearing in England which would make finally becoming world champions in the format a little peculiar‘Deserve’s got nothing to do with it.’Jonny Bairstow knows what the problem is. Two days after the invertebrate batting collapse against Australia, six days after the invertebrate batting collapse against Sri Lanka, Bairstow spoke out this week. Some English people – journalists presumably self-motivating strawmen definitely – don’t want England to win the ICC World Cup. This apparently is the problem.It is a misguided suggestion on the most basic level. For the last four years this England team has been a source of pure visceral pleasure. Even the most jaded of observers wants to watch Jos Buttler somersaulting his way to 77 off 33 balls, as opposed to Jos Buttler on a green pitch batting with all the assurance of a three-legged dog trying to cross a busy dual carriageway.More to the point, this is to misunderstand the business. There is a huge slice of media self-interest in England winning the World Cup. Out there beyond the bubble they’re not exactly gasping for England-lose-again-at-obscure-summer-sport stories. Cricket is increasingly pushed to the margins, a vanishing square of green. Defeat is frankly no good to anyone.Plus, of course, England are still well-placed to do the opposite. They can win four games from here. The dry weather will help. Other teams also have flaws. Never mind the angst, or those weird press conferences where Eoin Morgan pronounces his words with clipped and regal disdain, looking like the president of the space federation taken hostage and forced at gunpoint to sit in front of a board covered with adverts and talk about field settings and bowling changes in the powerplay.And yet this isn’t quite the whole story, is it? Because Jonny is also right. There is something else here, another question, something rather glossed and unexamined on the way here. England can still win the World Cup. People want them to win the World Cup. But do England actually deserve to win the World Cup? And what would it mean if they did?This is clearly not a point about the team itself. Win matches, lose matches – it’s always deserved. The rest is just noise. And the players themselves are popular, even rather cherished in the case of Jonny B: so spiky, so relentlessly affronted, standing there with his bat raised like a scimitar and hitting the ball with such purity of purpose.This is instead a matter of trajectory. Does English cricket deserve to win the World Cup? It is a question that goes to the heart of what the whole spectacle is actually for. In its pure form international sport is not about salesmanship or revenue streams. It is instead a test of systems and the wider culture.Success is a reward for good choices and care taken across every level. International sport tells us about the physical health of a nation, just as the best teams tend to speak to some wider sense of collectivism and shared resources well used.We remember that gold-standard Spanish football generation the gushing tide of brilliant Australian cricketers in the 1990s the schools and clubs that fed the Caribbean islands. All of these reflected mass participation, not to mention a pitch of obsession, happiness, love – all of this expressed in the details of elite level success.Meanwhile, here come England. Enter the blue Lycra machine, the scowling men in shades, emissaries of a sport that happens behind the high Palladian walls or on the edge of town where the green spaces appear.What system is being exemplified here? What message would it send out if England were to become world champions? Neglect the grassroots. Retreat from state schools and inner cities. Give up on the poor. Hurl the carved wooden chairs into the fire, gurgle down the last of the claret from the cellar. Enrich yourself, while making the one thing you have to give invisible. And yes, you still get to win the World Cup.That resource-heavy team at the top is in its own way a kind of con job, there to blind us with its stand-alone brilliance. In reality it reflects little of the wider national life, or of 50-over cricket (which has been all-but abandoned now) as some kind of happily embraced obsession.Instead we have dramatically falling participation, a minority sport headed the way not just of golf, but of polo. We have an England team built on sloganeering and marketing phrases. We have a set-up that talks about playing “a brand of cricket” as though brands are actually real things or even good things.In the last few weeks this brittleness has revealed itself. The stitches have shown a little in the light, the feeling emerged of something slightly ersatz. It’s there in the prim, pointless moralising over Alex Hales, who deserved a ban but should be in the squad now.It comes in the weirdly inflexible way England have assumed a style that suits everywhere except their regular home conditions. It comes in the way nobody knows who the next best 50-over batsmen are because we don’t actually play this format very much. It’s there in the spectacle of a laissez faire coach whose effects could be replicated more cheaply by propping a slightly gloomy looking turnip on a raised balcony seat, covering it with a floppy hat and sunglasses, writing the words “that’s the way they play” on its forehead and paying it a quarter of a million pounds a year.And still “deserve” really has got nothing to do with it. This is sport, where victory montages are compiled by the winners, and where the whole narrative can turn on a few details of skill and luck. England are good enough to win this from here. But from a certain angle they do look a curious bunch of pretenders."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a8ed333b5889713e38830a966d084c5f4b77af23/0_3381_5504_3302/master/5504.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=10f59f175736c7c464128448103f3f27","title":"jessica fostekey funniest things","story":"The actor, writer and standup on the things that make her laugh the mostI went to see Daniel Kitson in Edinburgh and that left me feeling like I’d had a spiritual experience.

He plans to launch a new creative company called LoveFrom – and said Apple will be his first client.“While I will not be an employee, I will still be very involved – I hope for many, many years to come,” Ive told the FT. “This just seems like a natural and gentle time to make this change.”“Jony is a singular figure in the design world and his role in Apple’s revival cannot be overstated,” chief executive Tim Cook said in a statement. “Apple will continue to benefit from Jony’s talents by working directly with him on exclusive projects, and through the ongoing work of the brilliant and passionate design team he has built.”Cook further paid tribute to Ive in an interview with the FT, highlighting his role in rescuing the company from its early-90s doldrums: “The work on the original iMac was sort of the point at which people began to pay attention to Apple again on something other than how badly economically the company was doing.“We get to continue with the same team that we’ve had for a long time and have the pleasure of continuing to work with Jony,” he added. “I can’t imagine a better result.”Ive’s departure comes at a tricky moment for Apple, which became the world’s first trillion-dollar company in August 2018, but has faltered amid increased competition, slowing demand for smartphones, and the escalating trade war between the US and China. The company shocked investors in January when it was forced to downgrade sales forecasts , the first such warning the company had issued since 2002.In recent months, Apple has moved to ersify its revenues away from hardware sales and toward subscription services, including a bid to take on Netflix with original entertainment content.Ive’s influence at Apple pre-dates his employment there. He worked on the company’s original Apple PowerBook 140, released in 1991, while still employed by the British design firm Tangerine.His first truly iconic hit after joining Apple was the 1998 iMac with its translucent “Bondi blue” casing. Next came the iPod, the iPhone and the Apple Watch.But Ive’s influence extended beyond hardware design. Starting in 2012, he took over design of Apple’s software, which resulted in a total overhaul of the iPhone’s operating system, iOS. Ive jettisoned the cutesy faux leather and paper icons and pseudo-3D textures, opting for flat and abstract iconography.He was also involved in designing Apple’s new headquarters, Apple Park, the $5bn futuristic “spaceship” that opened in 2017.The designer also had his share of misses – and critics. As stunning as Apple Park’s four-story glass walls may be, the minimalist design failed to include the usual markings that can prevent birds – and humans – from walking into them, resulting in multiple 911-call-inducing accidents. In March, Apple debuted a beautifully absurd “laser-etched” titanium credit card that drew instant ridicule.No immediate successor has been named to fill Ive’s role as chief design officer. The heads of the company’s user interface team and industrial design teams, Alan Dye and Evans Hankey, will both report to the chief operating officer, Jeff Williams, Apple said.“I certainly have an ambition and feel almost a moral obligation to be useful,” Ive told the paper. “I feel I’ve been fortunate enough to work with remarkable people over the last 30-plus years and have worked on some very interesting projects and solved some very difficult problems. I feel keenly aware of a responsibility to do something significant with that learning.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cca2aaefeaa32e528c3af25796d8d44fed1af64d/1741_1104_5480_3289/master/5480.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=63508fbf87c4f8b900c8257dc923fbed","title":"me and my dad inspiration indifference and pride","story":"Absurdist, dogged, overtly Scottish ... our fathers come in many flavours.

Over a glass, or two, of Tobermory 12 Year Old whisky, a writer, photographer and magazine journalist, give a frank glimpse into their relationships with the men who raised themWhen I first told my dad about the subject of this piece, how his creativity has inspired my writing, he responded with the traditional Druker facial expression (somewhere between a sneer and a shrug).“Pheh,” he said. “It doesn’t even inspire me.”It’s taken us a long while to get to this point, sat across a table from each other, talking like a pair of adults. Mostly over coffee. Occasionally something stronger.My dad has a huge personality, but he’s not a big drinker. Two wine gums and a glass of water and he’s pissed, he says. I used to drink a bit too much. Now we meet somewhere in the middle. We used to be too different, too much the same to do this. We had rows, we didn’t get on. But times change. Times change people. And now we have moments.My dad retired around the time I was stumbling into adulthood. After a life of work and activism, he took up creative pursuits, playing in bands and DJing world music, funk and jump blues, expanding on his lifelong passion for music. As funny as he is, he takes it all very seriously.I notice the ways I’m like him, now. And the ways I want to be like him. He’s probably the funniest person I know. Cutting, absurdist and lightning quick. He’s got a sharp reply before you’ve finished talking. And when chatter falls to quiet, he’ll point strangers out, invent stories about them, tell me who they’ve just had a row with.He’s also a walking encyclopedia for film, music and literature. Pick out an old soul single and he’ll tell you who played bass on the B-side.His morality is like a lodestone to me. My understanding of the world was forged by anti-apartheid fundraisers, picket lines and marches before I could walk, and it’s informed by him to this day.It’s only now, as I pick it all apart, I realise how much of him is in everything I write. Sometimes behind the words on the page or the mouths of characters. Sometimes just kibitzing in my ear, telling me to lighten up and try putting a joke in for once.So now we have fleeting moments of connection I treasure. Something he never got to do with his dad. Something that will always be with me.He can also be a bit of a putz, to be fair.My dad and I haven’t always gotten on, with my stubborn teenage behaviour and his old-fashioned views. But as my mum doesn’t really drink, my dad had someone to share a tipple with when I started drinking. Even now when I go home he jokingly asks when I’m moving back to be his drinking buddy. We found out about one another’s likes, pet peeves and favourite drinks (mine: tequila, his: whisky). I got to know about his fascinating life and him as a person, rather than just my dad. You think you would know these things about your parent, but over a drink, this authority figure fades and a friend emerges.Being someone who studied fashion and has always been obsessed with clothes, we often find ourselves chatting about the topic. You’d never know to look at him in his home-knitted vests, but my 76-year-old dad was quite the fashionista back in the day! He showed me his old Dior suits, bought with his first paychecks, and that ignited my interest in vintage fashion – which was a step outside of all my high-fashion magazines. I make my own clothes as much as possible, and when video-calling my seamstress of a mum for help, my dad is often in the background ready to pipe in with some advice – a longer hem, more fitted, a different button – and I hate to admit it, but a lot of the time he’s spot on.I know every child says this, but my dad is one of the best cooks on this earth (owning a successful takeaway for 20 years might have something to do with it). But one thing that’s certain to come up when we meet up is talk about food. I’m always bugging him about how he made a dish while I ply him with a drink, hoping for him to spill his secrets. As someone who could only boil pasta when I left home, I now make dishes from around the world. My love for cooking and fascination for flavours is down to him.I’m now an entertainment journalist at a leading women’s magazine. He may not know the people I write about in my job, but he’s always been supportive of me and keen to learn more about the industry I’m in. It wasn’t easy to get into, and I know that my perseverance in my career is the same as my dad’s “never quit” work ethic that got him from Hong Kong to the UK in his 20s, and got him his successful business after many less successful ones. And that’s certainly something to say cheers to.My dad, David, inspired my passion for both photography and Scotland – which I’ve had a lifelong love affair with.He’s Scottish, in fact he’s very Scottish – he’d play the bagpipes at my school and my two brothers and I would often wear kilts – but his work as a doctor meant I was born and raised in the East Midlands, which is billiard table flatness.When we would visit my granny in Forres as a kid my brain would be absolutely fried by the beauty of the place, I just always had an affinity and always felt Scottish – although when I moved there when I was 18 I was constantly and very much reminded that I wasn’t!My parents enrolled me at the Findhorn Foundation in Forres, which is a spiritual community, where I did something called the Youth Programme, which enabled me to develop my photography and led to my career, and had me moving back to Scotland as soon as I could.Dad loves my work and is so proud. He was an amateur photographer and had a dark room at our home, and I used his Rolleiflex as my first camera I’ve been lucky to have a dad who is so supportive.My two brothers are very academic, and obviously my dad is too, being a doctor – plus my grandparents were doctors, so I had a lot of pressure to “do something”. I’m dyslexic, and at school I just wasn’t academic, so photography really opened up so much.The Isle of Mull is both one of my and my dad’s favourite places in Scotland, and I love exploring every nook and cranny with my camera. It’s incredible and erse, a bit like a mini Scotland in one. It’s mountainous and moory and it has breathtaking beaches.It’s wild but it’s got towns like Tobermory where there’s theatre, and there’s a real sense of community about it, yet it still has this complete remoteness, which is what I love most about it.And of course, there’s the distillery in Tobermory. The whisky somehow manages to taste like Mull by encapsulating its myriad qualities. It’s beautiful, peaty and completely an island whisky.To learn more about the art of the Hebridean distillers visit tobermorydistillery"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26622970158ecd033d6cd9ca5a8aaec3805879b5/0_254_4774_2863/master/4774.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c6c1c1cb8a2e1a4075c71b2dbcedb619","title":"new york city pride 2019 marches stonewall 50","story":"Heritage of Pride Parade to march on Sunday as Reclaim Pride Coalition says the event does not represent the ‘spirit of Stonewall’ One will be a parade with glitter, go-go dancers, corporate floats blasting disco music and hundreds of thousands of people, flanked by cops and barricades. The other will be a protest featuring homemade banners, political chanting, an old-fashioned rally in the park, volunteer security guards (and glitter, though less of it).The fact that both Pride marches will be traveling in opposite directions through New York City on Sunday while marking the same occasion – the 50th anniversary of the uprising at the Stonewall Inn in 1969 that sparked the modern gay rights movement – is as much a metaphor for a clash of ideas as it is a logistical fact.This year what will probably be the biggest queer celebration in New York City history will consist of dueling marches – the gigantic, official annual Pride march with all the celebratory floats, fueled by big business sponsors and a breakaway march designed to be a grassroots protest not only for the cause of civil rights but against the over-corporatization of the main parade.The bigger parade, titled Heritage of Pride Parade, will carouse from uptown to downtown Manhattan and combines its celebration with World Pride, the international LGBTQ event hosted by a different country each year. Organizers expect up to 4 million people to descend on the city for this month’s Pride events, culminating this weekend.The rival, bare bones Reclaim Pride event will stomp the route of the original march for queer rights that evolved out of the rebellion against a police raid on the city’s Stonewall Inn in 1969 – and will go from that downtown bar, which still operates and was made a national monument by Barack Obama, uptown to Central Park.“The annual Pride parade has become a bloated, over-policed circuit party, stuffed with 150 corporate floats. This does not represent the ‘spirit of Stonewall’ on this 50th anniversary year,” a statement from the Reclaim Pride Coalition organizers said.The statement added that the event did not address the urgent continuing needs of the queer community “still under daily attack by the Trump administration and in countries around the world”.Organizers have called the alternative event the inaugural Queer Liberation March. It intends to shun policing by the New York City police department and instead provide its own security via volunteer marshals.“It’s a clash of values. What happened at Stonewall in 1969 changed my life and we’re going to take that spirit into this new century. There’ll be no sponsors, no uniformed police, no floats,” said Bill Dobbs, an organizer of the Queer Liberation March.Leaders of Heritage of Pride and the Reclaim Pride Coalition had held talks about changes to the official annual event. But they were unable to agree on a compromise, said Dobbs. The Queer Liberation March plans to hew closer to the model of the annual lesbian march, which traditionally takes place on the last Saturday in June, the day before the official Pride parade.“When I look at the dyke march I see an amazing, radiant swath of women, it’s just fantastic,” said Dobbs.The lesbian, or self-described dyke march, has always been a breakaway, unofficial march that differentiated itself from the Pride parade by being a more political, unsponsored hybrid between celebration and demonstration. In more recent years another march, for greater transgender rights, has also taken place in June.“We fundraise in the community and we’ve been an alternative space for 27 years,” said Alex Tereshonkova, an organizer of the lesbian march, adding: “I just don’t think there’s a place for Heritage of Pride any more.”Undaunted, Heritage of Pride is putting on 25 events, with singer Grace Jones headlining one party and Melissa Etheridge another that she described in a statement as promising “a truly momentous evening of love, pride and community”.The official Pride parade always begins with dozens of leather-clad lesbians of all shapes, colors and ages roaring ahead of the glitzy floats on their motorcycles, in the traditional “dykes on bikes” display. And official Pride parade “grand marshals” are people or organizations known for campaigning for LGBTQ equality, such as Billie Jean King and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU).New York drag queen, performance artist and DJ Lady Bunny said she plans to attend both the official Pride parade and the Reclaim Pride march. She will be on a float at one and speak at the rally at the other. In the mid-80s she started the Wigstock drag queen festival in the city’s Tompkins Square Park as a pointed and “gritty” alternative to what she saw as the already too-conventional annual Pride march in Greenwich Village.“The parade has become more and more corporate as the years have gone on,” she said, noting ironically that “back in the day most companies wanted nothing to do with us”.Meanwhile Open Secrets, part of the Center for Responsive Politics research group, has accused some companies publicly supporting Pride while also donating via political action committees to members of Congress who oppose the Equality Act, legislation that aims to outlaw discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity in employment, housing and other services."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/53451c2642c06f5eb483ce1ce163a6a71e0979c1/0_550_8256_4954/master/8256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=23f978fa4d4fa2f34f35c759b6b79a57","title":"journey of faith the guatemalan pastors helping smuggle people into the us","story":"As trusted iniduals in a Guatemalan culture rooted in religion, pastors and priests play a role in the booming business behind immigration Early in the morning, Antonio knelt before an altar with white candles and a small statue of the Virgin Mary and prayed for a miracle.It was still dark when he piled into a blue van with his six-year-old son, Gaspar, and a group of other farmers and their family members hoping to reach the United States. They set out from their home town in the highlands of Guatemala and rode for hours before pulling down a narrow dirt road which ended in a clearing near the Mexican border.The migrants bowed their head as their guide – an Evangelical pastor – cracked a Bible, and prayed for the group’s safe passage. At the border, he whispered a last “Que Dios te bendiga” (“May God bless you”) to each before passing them to the next handler.Guatemala is one of the biggest sources of migrants to the US, and across the highlands of this poor Central American country, churches and clergymen also play a role in the booming business of people-smuggling.As trusted iniduals in a deeply religious society, pastors and priests can offer comfort and a promise of safety to those undertaking the dangerous trek north. They also take a cut of the profits.Out of 23 towns Simón recently visited in the western highlands, he found cases of pastors and priests helping people to migrate in 14 of them.Some churchmen physically guide clients on the first leg of their journey – as with the pastor who led Antonio to the border – but most simply link up coyotes and potential clients. Evangelical leaders were more frequently involved in migration than Catholic priests, Simón found.As night fell in a small highland town 70 miles from the Mexican border, a few dozen people sang pop-inspired Christian music in a simple, single-room Evangelical church.In an office next door, drinking a Pepsi and catching up on his accounts, was Pedro, who recruits customers for a coyote.“Pastors can act as a bridge between people who want to migrate and people who can take them,” he explained. “They know the community.”At this church, three of the pastor’s brothers are well-known coyotes, according to Pedro and members of the congregation. For each customer he recruits, the pastor makes $250 he earns another $150 for praying with a group before they set out.After the service, Manuel, 19, a member of the congregation, said that the pastor had previously helped his brother travel to the US, where he now works on construction sites in North Carolina. “I know a lot of people who have traveled with this pastor. I would go, but I don’t have any money,” said Manuel. “But pastors typically know how to get you north.”While around half of Guatemala’s population is Catholic, in the last 25 years Pentacostal churches have grown increasingly important, and the country now has proportionately one of the largest Evangelical populations in Latin America.The movement first gained traction after the country’s first Evangelical leader, Efraín Ríos Montt – an army general and part-time lay preacher – seized power in a 1982 coup. The US-backed dictator gave weekly televised sermons – even as the military murdered, raped and disappeared thousands of indigenous Guatemalans in the country’s 36-year civil war.Catholic priests were often targeted in retaliation for their perceived sympathies with leftwing Liberation Theology. Some ordinary Guatemalans turned to Protestant churches in the hope of protection.Even after a peace deal signed in 1996, violence, corruption, racism and poverty have persisted.The Guatemalan state remains absent from many rural areas, and Evangelicalism has mushroomed as Pentecostal churches step in to provide public services, said Kevin Lewis O’Neill, a professor at the University of Toronto who studies Christianity in Guatemala.“Historically, there’s no reason to trust any institutions in Guatemala – other than the church. Evangelical churches in particular have been able to maintain trust by supporting these places with little state presence which live in the shadow of the war,” he explains.Pentecostal churches are omnipresent in the mostly indigenous regions where most of the country’s migrants are from.“Every Evangelical church is a moment of entrepreneurialism. You only need 10 families and you’re breaking even, if you take tithing seriously,” said O’Neill. “It’s a way to create a job out of nothing. It is also why there is so much competition in Guatemala – and why there are so many churches.”On top of tithes, pastors and priests can also make hundreds of dollars for each migrant they recruit, and further bonuses for praying with each group. Successful migrants will sometimes also send small remittances.In return, churchmen can recommend trustworthy coyotes who will safely help migrants through at least the first stage of their long journey north.In a dusty, drought-plagued town in the Huehuetenango department, Victor was recently working on a new second floor at the home of his brother, an evangelical pastor. The freshly-painted house stood out from the neighbouring homes made of wood and corrugated metal, and gave testament to his good fortunes.Coyotes sometimes use Christian messaging in their advertising, said Simón. One card handed out by a smuggler features a quotation from the book of Psalms – “The steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord, and He delighteth in his way” – emblazoned over a picture of a bus. Underneath, a caption reads: “If you need to travel to the United States have “FAITH,” trust in God and in the trip. We take: older people, minors, fathers and mothers with children.”And potential migrants sometimes turn to their pastors for advice when they are seeking a guide north.One recent evening a young woman called Dina, logged onto Facebook and messaged an evangelical pastor she knew. “I want to go to the US,” she wrote.He replied instantly: “I have contacts with some coyotes because when people leave for their trip I go to pray for them. I can recommend you to one and help you with prayer.“Come by on Tuesday to discuss.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/13d6af01c3276c1381812f69deb169c405a5f25a/60_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e9c7f7e118d1a23eb7ac80f9923cba23","title":"charity calls for total ban on tethering birds of prey","story":"Freedom for Animals calls on government to end ‘vastly cruel’ practice by zoosZoos around the country are routinely only allowing birds of prey to fly for a few minutes a day and keeping them in cages smaller than their wings, an investigation has found.A report by the anti-captivity charity Freedom for Animals, seen by the , details wild birds such as owls and falcons being tied to the ground on short leashes for long periods.Government guidance on tethering applies only to owls and vultures.Some of the birds can be seen continually attempting to fly away before being pulled back down by their tether and chewing at their leg straps in footage recorded by animal welfare campaigners at bird of prey zoos.The charity’s campaigns officer, Maddy Taylor, said: “Birds of prey used in falconry and held in zoos are still wild animals. They still have all their natural instincts and needs as those animals in the wild.“This includes being able to perform natural behaviours, arguably the most fundamental to them being flight.“Historically, there has been very little scrutiny of this industry and we feel that with the rising awareness around animal captivity, the time has come for this to be taken seriously.”Freedom for Animals is calling for the government to review the industry and ban the “vastly cruel” practice of tethering for all birds of prey.There are about 95 bird of prey zoos in the UK which house a minimum of 4,252 birds from 170 species. These include owls, falcons, vultures, buzzards and eagles.Though birds were housed in aviaries, in three-quarters of all zoos they were also tethered – often on lawns where the public could view them.Campaigners also witnessed owls being tied down at several zoos – despite government guidelines stating they should never be tethered. They claimed some birds were tied down for most of the day and night.While most zoos offer some form of flying display, during the investigation birds were flown for an average of 11 minutes, meaning some were tied down for most of the day.Emma Milne, a vet and author, said denying birds flight “and the chance to escape stressful situations and the choices that come with that is unacceptable on welfare grounds”.She added: “Simply put, birds do not belong in cages and this practice should be stopped.”Concerns were also raised by campaigners over “manning”, the common training practice of depriving birds of food until they respond to humans.“The practices of tethering and manning are outdated traditions within the bird of prey industry, practices which we believe do not meet modern animal welfare standards,” said Taylor.According to the report, a third of zoos also did not meet size standards for bird cages, with some birds living in such cramped conditions that they could not stretch out their wings.Under government guidance on modern zoo practice, aviary sizes “must reflect the flying capabilities of the species” and birds should “enjoy relative freedom of movement”.Of the zoos that did hold a licence under the Zoo Licensing Act 1981, an analysis of Defra inspection reports by the charity revealed several were overdue inspections.Taylor said the lack of regulation meant birds were left vulnerable. “How then can the law be upheld and more importantly the animals protected? The same species of bird in different establishments are receiving vastly different levels of monitoring of their welfare,” she added.Many aviaries were also found without clean drinking water, breaching animal welfare laws and guidelines. Guidance states that “every effort should be made” by zoos to ensure animals have access to water and are kept in a suitably hygienic environment.An RSPCA spokesperson said: “Birds should have the opportunity to fly when they choose and they should always have access to water and shelter, both from the weather and the public.“Birds of prey should not be handled by the public, a view which is supported by the Hawk Board, and zoo standards clearly state that no bird should be permanently tethered. Many zoos have free-flight aviaries for displaying birds, or are moving towards this method for housing birds of prey.” A Defra spokesperson said: “All captive birds are protected by law. It’s an offence to cause unnecessary suffering to a bird of prey and all zoos must provide a suitable environment for them to live in.“Where there is evidence that a bird of prey is being kept inappropriately in a zoo, it should be reported to the local authority which can investigate and, if necessary, initiate enforcement action.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/afa064c1f256d7d98b1038711fa84ae122ebd710/0_238_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a97d864a2660e3b89edcac1ea7bee3c5","title":"france on red alert as heatwave forecast to reach record 45c","story":"Record for mainland France falls in southern commune of Gallargues-le-Montueux as Europe swelters in heatwaveFrance recorded temperatures nearly two degrees higher than its previous record and firefighters continued to battle historic wildfires in Spain as much of western Europe remained in the grip of an extreme early-summer heatwave on Friday.The French state weather forecaster, Météo-France, said the temperature in Gallargues-le-Montueux in the Gard département hit 45.9C at 4.20pm on Friday.The previous 2003 record of 44.1C was beaten twice before on Friday: first when the southeastern town of Carpentras reached 44.3C, then hours later when Villevieille, in Provence, hit 45.1C.“This is historic,” a Météo-France meteorologist, Etienne Kapikian, said. “It’s the first time a temperature in excess of 45C has ever been recorded in France.”In Germany, the national DWD weather service said overall June temperatures were more than four degrees higher than historic averages for the month and 0.4C higher than the 2003 June average, the warmest since records began in 1881.The World Meteorological Organisation in Geneva said 2019 was now firmly on course to be among the world’s hottest ever years and that 2015-2019 would then become the hottest five-year period on record.While it was too soon to definitely attribute the Europe’s current blistering heatwave, which began on Monday, to climate change, it was “absolutely consistent” with extremes linked to the impact of greenhouse gas emissions, the UN agency said.“Heatwaves will become more intense, they will become more drawn out, they will become more extreme, they will start earlier and they will finish later,” the WMO spokeswoman, Clare Nullis, told journalists.The French president, Emmanuel Macron, said extreme weather would become more frequent as a result of global warming. “We will need to change our set-up, our way of working, build differently,” he said, stressing a necessary “adaptation of society and its habits”.Greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels, forest destruction and other human activities are trapping heat and putting more energy into the climate system.\u0026nbspHotter air means heatwaves are much more likely. For example, scientists now say the unprecedented heat and wildfires across the northern hemisphere in 2018 “could not have occurred without human-induced climate change”. In Australia, the scorching summer of 2016-17 in New South Wales was made at least 50 times more likely by global heating, linking it directly to climate change.Hotter air can also carry more water vapour, meaning more intense rain and more flooding.\u0026nbspAnother important factor in the northern hemisphere is the impact of changes in the Arctic. The polar region is heating more rapidly, reducing the temperature difference with lower latitudes. There is strong evidence that this is weakening the planetary waves (including the jet stream) that normally meander over Europe, Asia and North America.When these waves stall, weather becomes fixed over regions and become extreme. This has been linked to past floods in Pakistan, heatwaves in Russia and drought in California.\u0026nbspMost of the planet’s trapped heat goes into the oceans and rising sea temperatures mean more energy for hurricanes and typhoons. Record breaking cyclones hit Mozambique in March and April. The deluge delivered in the US by Hurricane Harvey in 2017 was made three times more likely by climate change. Rising sea level also means storms cause more coastal damage.Four administrative départements in France – Vaucluse, Gard, Hérault and Bouches-du-Rhône – were placed on red alert, signalling temperatures of “dangerous intensity” that are more typical of Saudi Arabia.About 4,000 schools were closed in France as head teachers warned they could not guarantee safe conditions, local authorities cancelled many end-of-school-year carnivals, and nursing homes equipped the elderly with hydration sensors.“This heat wave is exceptional by its intensity and how early it is,” the prime minister, Edouard Philippe, said, defending authorities’ efforts to avoid a repeat of the notorious 2003 heatwave which caused 15,000 premature deaths.“I want to appeal to the sense of responsibility of citizens - there are avoidable deaths in every heatwave,” Philippe said. “Measures have been taken for the most vulnerable people but given the intensity of the heat wave, it’s the entire population who must be careful today ... both for oneself and for loved ones and neighbours.”The French health minister, Agnès Buzyn, warned people tempted to plunge into cold water to do so only in designated public bathing areas, adding that four people had drowned since the beginning of the week.A six-year-old child was also in life-threatening condition after being hit by water shooting from an illegally opened fire hydrant in the Paris suburb of Saint-Denis, French media reported.French families with elderly relatives who were ill or living alone were advised to call or visit them twice a day and take them to cool places, while the state-run rail operator SNCF offered free cancellations or exchanges on long-distance trips.The greater Paris region, Ile de France, had already banned more than half of cars from its roads in an effort to reduce air pollution and the cities of Lyon, Strasbourg and Marseille have also restricted traffic.With temperatures in parts of Spain expected to hit a new June record of 43C, the Spanish meteorological office issued red alerts in parts of Catalonia, Navarre and the Basque country.Hundreds of firefighters in Catalonia continued to battle to bring a large wildfire under control which has so far burned through 6,500 hectares of land and could consume as many as 20,000ha.A 17-year-old Spanish boy died from heatstroke in the early hours of Friday after having convulsions when he jumped into a swimming pool to cool down, while an 80-year-old man died on Thursday after collapsing from what is thought to have been heatstroke in the city of Valladolid.Italy put 16 cities under alerts for high temperatures, and civil security services distributed water to tourists visiting famed sites around Rome under a scorching sun and in Berlin, a police unit turned water cannon usually used against rioters on city trees to cool them down.As Germans attempted to cool off amid scorching temperatures, at least four people died in bathing accidents in different parts of the country on Wednesday. Parts of Britain were expected to experience high temperatures on Saturday, with a high of 32C forecast for London."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ddd6328fad4344db61952a3263abf3fa43c2f591/12_114_3583_2150/master/3583.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6570be09863d43f5c1bfde1c52fea69e","title":"glasgow students visit un to spread word on uk child poverty report human rights","story":"Ten-year-olds join special rapporteur to present damning report to human rights councilIt was not a typical class outing. Ben, Brooke, Advi and Charlie packed their school ties and made the 1,800-mile round trip from their primary school in Glasgow’s East End to the grand halls of the United Nations human rights council.The 10-year-olds were in Geneva this week to chase up what the grownups were doing to tackle poverty in the UK. They had a date with Philip Alston – the UN special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights who last November visited Avenue End school, which serves one of the poorest parts of Britain, as part of his investigation into the UK.Children there had told him about hunger and the shame of poverty, about not being able to afford trainers, TV or food and about foodbanks. Alston kept them in mind when he drafted his damning report, which he presented on Friday to hundreds of diplomats from around the world. He told them the UK was facing “a national poverty crisis”.But before he spoke the children had questions and ideas.“Why do you have the meetings when kids aren’t here?” asked Brooke, having noticed the hundreds of smartly dressed adults, but no children, milling around.“That’s a good question,” said Alston, momentarily stumped. “We should have more kids coming here to tell us what they are thinking about. A lot of what governments do makes a lot of difference to your lives.”Alston asked them what people could do to help child poverty. “Just give them someone to talk to,” said Ben. “Be friends with them,” added Advi. They had raised one of the aspects of child poverty missed this week in Geneva, but often felt keenly by children: loneliness.“It’s great that you have come,” said Alston. “I really appreciate it.”Alston then took them into one of the grand congress chambers where they posed for a photograph in the seats normally reserved for dignitaries.When Alston delivered his report he told a packed UNHRC his belief that economic and social insecurity in the UK was “rampant” and that austerity had left the UK “a more fractured and less compassionate society”.He said: “The country that had pioneered the modern welfare state after world war two changed course dramatically,. Funding for welfare, for local government services, for children, for education, for youth, for legal aid, for the poor and for policing were slashed.”Alston attacked the chancellor, Philip Hammond, for describing his assessment of UK poverty “nonsense” and cited a senior civil servant at the Department for Work and Pensions who last week told parliament it was accurate.“Fourteen million people living in poverty, more than 1.5 million destitute, record levels of hunger and homelessness, falling life expectancy for some groups, one in three children across the country living in poverty,” Alston said. “The greatest tragedy is the situation could be completely transformed in a short time.”The UK government hit back, albeit in a written statement, attacking “the inflammatory language and overtly political tone of this report”.We “strongly refute the claim that the design and delivery of welfare reforms, including universal credit, are deliberately punitive”, it said. “Tackling poverty will always be a priority for this government.”However, the government did not repeat its previous claim that his report was “barely believable” and “completely inaccurate”.The Avenue End children were already on their way back to Glasgow when the government’s response came. But they were unlikely to have been impressed. Asked about ministers’ previous dismissal of Alston’s report, Ben promised they would “keep pushing”.Brooke said: “They should listen. We will keep on … until they do something about it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1e28d387c5b7321d83dcfac3d4661a309d1a2618/61_0_968_581/master/968.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a04a2f18a2cb0de226c2b2d85e498a81","title":"russia first batch of trapped whales released","story":"Greenpeace criticises long-awaited operation, saying it risked trauma or death for the animalsRussia’s long-awaited operation to release the first batch of whales held in cramped enclosures in the country’s far-east region was dangerously flawed, environmentalists have said.The animals – 11 orcas and 87 beluga whales – have been held in captivity in a bay near the port city of Nakhodka since last year. They were due to be sold to Chinese oceanariums, before images of the animals languishing in the “whale prison” caused an international outcry.Vladimir Putin last week hailed Russia’s moves to return the whales to the wild. However, Greenpeace Russia said the two orcas and six beluga whales were simply dumped into the Sea of Okhotsk on Thursday after being transported 1,100 miles by truck and then boat to their natural habitat. The journey took seven days and the whales were held in small containers the entire time.The decision to free the animals came after a visit to their pens in April by Jean-Michel Cousteau, an oceanographer and son of the late marine expert Jacques Cousteau. Yet despite promises by Russian officials that Cousteau’s team of maritime experts would be involved in their release, no international or independent scientists were invited to take part. Cousteau had recommended that the whales be transported only by sea.Greenpeace said no attempt was made to prepare the whales for their return to the wild, seriously raising the risk of trauma or death for the animals. It also said that the entire operation was carried out in secrecy.Russian officials said the operation had been successful, and that none of the whales suffered during the journey. Nine orcas and 81 beluga whales remain in captivity.

The deal, struck in Vienna after nearly two years of intensive talks, limited the Iranian programme, to reassure the rest of the world that it cannot develop nuclear weapons, in return for sanctions relief.The six major powers involved in the nuclear talks with\u0026nbspIran\u0026nbspwere in a group known as the P5+1: the UN security council’s five permanent members – China, France, Russia, the UK and the US – and Germany. The nuclear deal is also enshrined in a UN security council resolution that incorporated it into international law. The 15 members of the council at the time unanimously endorsed the agreement.On 8 May 2018, US president Donald Trump pulled his country out of the deal. Iran announced its partial withdrawal from the nuclear deal a year later.Such a collapse would probably lead the EU to join the US in imposing sanctions, which might bring a military response by Iran as it tries to find levers to force the west to loosen the vice on its economy.At the talks, the three European powers – France, Germany and the UK – tried to assuage Iranian doubts that Europe was sticking to its side of the 2015 bargain by pressing ahead with the long-planned mechanism to facilitate trade between Iran and Europe without being hit by US sanctions.The lead EU negotiator, Helga Schmid, hailed the discussions as constructive and said the first transactions had been completed through the mechanism, known as Instex.The EU was also due to supply a modest €3m (£2.7m) credit line to kickstart the mechanism as a signal of good intent.However, Araghchi said: “For Instex to be useful for Iran, Europeans need to buy oil or consider credit lines for this mechanism, otherwise Instex is not like they or us expect.”The EU has always said Instex will be confined to easing trade in humanitarian goods, such as food and medicine – a form of trading the White House says is not subject to its sanctions regime. Iran had billed the Vienna meeting as the last chance to salvage the deal.The Chinese envoy, Fu Cong, said Beijing rejected the US policy of unilateral sanctions, suggesting China may be willing to defy the US threat.But the US special representative on Iran, Brian Hook, insisted the US would put sanctions on all Iranian oil exports. “We will sanction any illicit purchases of Iranian crude oil. There are right now no oil waivers in place,” he said.Hook said the US economic grip on Iran was intended to force Tehran to renegotiate the original nuclear deal, turning it into a binding international treaty that also covers wider issues including Iran’s ballistic missile programme, its regional interference and its treatment of dual national prisoners.He also promised the US would go ahead with plans to impose sanctions on Iran’s chief diplomat, Javad Zarif. He said Iran’s goal was to bring the Middle East under the thrall of Tehran’s “Marxist theocratic” ideology.Hook was in London to urge the International Maritime Organization (IMO), a UN body, to back his plan for a UN-endorsed maritime protection force, modelled on an established UN anti-piracy force off the coast of Somalia.He said Iran, by its threats to Gulf shipping, was “courting a financial and environment disaster”, and was breaching all maritime rules by turning off its ship collision avoidance transponders in an attempt to smuggle oil out of Iran and avoid being tracked by the US.“An outlaw regime is violating basic maritime law and now represents a maritime threat across the Gulf,” Hook said after meeting the IMO secretary general, Kitack Lim.Hook went further than before by accusing Iran of planning to gain a stranglehold on all international oil-related shipping by controlling not just the Gulf of Oman, off the Iranian coast, but also the Red Sea shipping lanes through the Bab al-Mandab strait off Yemen that take oil into the Arabian Sea and on to Asia.The strait of Hormuz, which provides passage from the Gulf of Oman to the open sea, is the most important gateway for oil exports in the world. With Iran on its northern shore, and the UAE and Oman on its southern shore, the US Energy Information Administration (EIA) calls it the world’s worst \u0027chokepoint\u0027In 2016, 18.5m barrels of crude oil were transported each day through the strait of Hormuz, compared with 16m through the strait of Malacca, which runs between the Indonesian island of Sumatra, Malaysia and Thailand, connecting the Indian Ocean with the South China Sea. 5m barrels of crude oil are transported annually through the next largest chokepoint, the Suez canal.His claim shows the extent to which the US regards defeat of the Iranian-backed Houthis in Yemen as integral to the wider defeat of Iran. “If we do not prevent Iranians from laying down deep roots in Yemen, they will be in a position to threaten to close the strait of Hormuz and Bab al-Mandab,” Hook said. “They are seeking to do in Yemen what they succeeded to do in Lebanon. They would like to ‘Lebanonise’ Yemen and become a power broker on the Saudi southern border and to be in a position to harass the Emiratis and Saudis, and to be another threat in their threat matrix to freedom of navigation. We are pushing back on Iran’s long game in Yemen.”The sanctions, hailed by Hook as unprecedented, have so far cut Iranian oil exports to 400,000 barrels a day, levels that have put the Iranian government deep into debt.“This is a clerical regime that wants to remake the Middle East in its image – and that would deeply destabilise the Middle East to have regimes following the same Marxist theocratic regime,” Hook said.Describing the state of tension in the region, he said Iran’s goal “is to scare the global oil market to keep the price up and to keep the world on edge”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1f064b3703903574e64549e2ead50d49449d05ea/599_85_3285_1971/master/3285.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=58202e99d290a940270b866dae603458","title":"nigeria cattle raising fulani tribe in pictures","story":"With over 200 million people and an emerging middle class, Nigeria is witnessing a boom in demand for meat.

Photograph: Spyros Spyrouvia ReutersAn ancient wooden ship complete with cargo has been discovered off the eastern coast of Cyprus near the resort town of Protaras. The ship belongs to the period after Rome annexed the island in 58 BC.“This is the first undisturbed Roman shipwreck ever found in Cyprus, the study of which is expected to shed new light on the breadth and scale of seaborne trade between Cyprus the the rest of the Roman provinces of the eastern Mediterranean,” the Cypriot antiquities department said.Amphorae in and around the wreck identify the ship as a merchant vessel that transported cargo between Syria and the southern coast of modern Turkey, known in ancient times as Cicilia. Amphorae are narrow necked pottery jars used by Greeks and Romans for storage and shipment of oil and wine.The Cypriot antiquities department announced the find by two volunteer ers working with the Maritime Archaeological Reserarch Laboratory (MARElab) of the University of Cyprus. A MARELab team accompanied by students and volunteers is at the site to document the ship and protect it from looters while the department prepares to conduct a preliminary investigation.The effort is the first underwater project to be fully financed by the Cyprus government, which praised the role of volunteers in the discovery and protection of the site. Their actions, said the authorities, send “an optimistic message regarding the protection of cultural heritage by Cyprus society”.A mid-4th century Greek ship discovered in 2007 off Cyprus’s southern coast near the town of Mazotos is considered to be one of the region’s best-preserved wrecks. It has yielded information on ship construction and artefacts that provide insights into life during the height of classical Greek civilisation.The 500 wine amphorae from this ship are believed to have come from the Greek island of Chios.Among the other items found were three anchors, olive pits and timbers. Archaeologists reported last year that both Greek and Phoenician navigation methods were employed on the vessel, linking technologies of two maritime eastern Mediterranean people.The first and most famous of Cyprus’s ancient shipwrecks, known as the “Kyrenia ship”, was discovered off the northern coast in 1965 by a Greek Cypriot er. This was an early 3rd century wooden Greek cargo vessel carrying wine amphorae from Rhodes and thousands of almonds transported in jars within the hull.It is believed that ship sailed from the Greek islands of Samos, Kos and Rhodes before sinking in rough seas off the Cypriot port of Kyrenia.The ship was recovered, preserved and exhibited in a museum in Kyrenia castle, where it remains on display in the northern area of Cyprus occupied by Turkey in 1974."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3940642.1561739398!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"german media struggles to cover merkel s mysterious trembling","story":"German Chancellor Angela Merkel was seen shaking as she met president Frank-Walter Steinmeier on Thursday, her second such bout within two weeks. Video: Reuters\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tGerman chancellor Angela Merkel with Chinese president Xi Jinping  and Russian president Vladimir Putin: Bild tabloid has asked “How sick is the chancellor?”   Photograph:  Dominique Jacovides Chancellor Angela Merkel’s second outbreak of shakes in nine days has prompted speculation about an early departure from office after 14 years, and plunged German media outlets into a reporting dilemma.On Thursday morning, Merkel began shaking visibly alongside President Frank Walter Steinmeier during a ceremony in Berlin.Merkel looked to an aide for assistance but refused a glass of water when offered, holding her arms before her with her lips pressed together tightly.She departed on Thursday evening for the G20 summit in Japan as planned and journalists travelling with her said she appeared completely normal on the plane and during her statement on arrival, though she took no questions.In Osaka, Merkel delegation members told travelling press the second shaking spell on Thursday was caused when, for a moment, the chancellor thought of the first shaking episode.Nine days previously, after shaking uncontrollably in 29 degree heat, Merkel attributed her turn to dehydration.On Friday, as after the first incident, a Merkel spokesman said the chancellor was feeling fine.Speculation rifeBut the mysterious explanation for the second shaking spell threw up more questions than answers and has revived rather than dampened speculation. And that has created a dilemma for media outlets in Germany, a country that places a high cultural value on privacy. How to report in a fair way on the health of a politician who, even by German standards, is remarkably private?On Thursday evening and Friday morning, many public radio and television bulletins skirted the issue or mentioned it only in passing. By contrast the Bild tabloid pulled no punches, asking on Friday: “How sick is the chancellor?”. It canvassed doctors for their opinions, many of whom refused to make a long-distance diagnosis. Those who did had theories ranging from a kidney infection to diabetes, multiple sclerosis or medication side-effects. Other outlets suggested, after 14 crisis-filled years in office, it was simply exhaustion.“No doubt this can happen to a woman who has practically no breaks in her calendar,” wrote Berlin’s Tagesspiegel daily. “But it is the second time in eight days and slowly the shaking has the makings of a political issue.”Health problemsSome have recalled what seemed like a throwaway remark at last December’s gathering of her Christian Democratic Union (CDU). She handed over the party leadership but promised to stay on as chancellor until 2021 – so long as her health allowed.Others have recalled the long line of German politicians who have concealed health problems.Helmut Kohl, Merkel’s political mentor, once sat through a party conference wearing a concealed catheter rather than enter hospital for prostate treatment and create an opening for rivals.During a second spell in hospital, for a knee operation, Kohl’s spokesman said he had a cold.West Germany’s first chancellor, Konrad Adenauer, also had regular colds in the 1960s – in fact lung infections. Over in the Social Democrat camp Helmut Schmidt, chancellor for eight years until 1982, had fainting spells while his predecessor Willy Brandt’s depression and days of silence remained a secret until after his resignation in 1974."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3940345.1561748484!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"red alerts issued as france records highest temperatures ever 45 9 degrees","story":"The 2019 Glastonbury music festival is basking in hot sunshine as the main stages opens and organisers encourage revellers to put on sunscreen and drink plenty of water.

Twelve towns in southern France saw new all-time highs on Friday and three experienced temperatures above 45 degrees, it said.Four departements in southern France were placed on emergency red alert on Friday, the first time the measure has covered such a large area. The mercury hit 45.1 degrees Celsius in Villevieille, in the southerly Provence region, and temperatures reached 44.3 degrees in Carpentras, in the southern Vaucluse region. Hundreds of schools have been closed and others have asked parents to keep children at home if possible. Middle-school exams have been postponed until next week. In Spain, a 17-year-old boy died from heatstroke in the early hours of Friday after becoming unwell when working in the countryside in the Cordoba province of Andalucia. He is reported to have gone into convulsions after jumping into a swimming pool to cool down. Doctors were unable to save him and he died in hospital.The second victim was an 80-year-old man who died on Thursday after collapsing from what is thought to have been another case of heatstroke in the city of Valladolid. Two other people are being treated for heatstroke in Spanish hospitals.Red alert in SpainWith temperatures expected to reach up to 42 Celsius on Friday, Spain’s meteorological office has issued a red alert in parts of Catalonia, Navarre and the Basque country. Hundreds of firefighters in Catalonia are battling to bring a huge wildfire under control, which has so far burned through 6,500 hectares of land and could consume as many as 20,000.Larger cities on or near the French coast, such as Marseille, where sea-breezes mean slightly lower temperatures, opened museums for free on Friday for people to seek refuge in air-conditioned spaces. Many municipal swimming pools also opened for free. A record high of electricity consumption for summer was recorded as homes plugged in fans.The health minister, Agnès Buzyn, urged what she called “those in denial of extreme heat” to avoid “risky behaviours”. She urged people not to jog between noon and 2pm and said parents should not under any circumstances leave children in cars.Other French cities have battled to deal with high air pollution levels by limiting car traffic, including Paris, Lyon, Marseille, and Strasbourg in the east.The French president, Emmanuel Macron, warned that the extreme weather is likely to become more frequent as a result of global warming. “We will need to change our set-up, our way of working, build differently,” he said, stressing a necessary “adaption of society and its habits”.This week, an independent report found France was falling behind on tackling the climate emergency and failing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, despite ambitious promises.MilanIn the Italian city of Milan, a 72-year-old homeless man was found dead at the main train station after falling ill due to the heatwave, the local authorities said.As Germans attempted to cool off amid scorching temperatures, at least four people died in bathing accidents in different parts of the country on Wednesday.Parts of Britain are also expected to experience hot temperatures this weekend. A 12-year-old girl drowned in a river as hot weather conditions continue across the UK. Greater Manchester Police said the girl was found by underwater search teams after officers were called to the River Irwell in Bury just before 8pm on Thursday. The UK is set to see the hottest day of the year so far this weekend. Temperature could reach a maximum of 34 Celsius in London and the east of England on Saturday. The hottest conditions recorded in 2019 so far were at Weybourne in Norfolk on June 2nd, where the temperature reached 28.8 Celsius.Scientists have said Europe’s 2019 heatwave, like last year’s, is closely linked to the climate emergency and that such extreme weather events will be many times more likely over the coming decades. - Five-day nationwide forecasts, weather warnings and rainfall maps "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/06/11/TELEMMGLPICT000197062411_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqWZZ9520Qrn8RyVs0byqFfxdYxsWUQUCtgJX18DpO5X4.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"making final call publish mps expenses","story":"Former editor of The Daily , William LewisIts publication led to the biggest parliamentary scandal in a generation, but two national newspapers had already turned the story down.The decision to pay for the full expense claims of every MP in Westminster was laced with risk: the leaked information could have been deemed stolen, or worse - it could have been a hoax.

A report by the London School of Economics (LSE) into children’s attitudes towards the internet found they overwhelmingly wanted a ‘grand erasure’ of their online footprint to stop childhood mistakes affecting their future.The research, which was funded by the Information Commissioner\u0027s Office, also found that children were generally trusting of tech companies in the same way they are of their schools.LSE researchers reviewed more than a decade’s worth of studies into children’s understanding of their online data and also conducted focus groups with more than 160 secondary school-age children.Professor Sonia Livingstone, who led the research, said children were generally “outraged” when they learned how much of their personal information is being hoarded online and wanted “a fresh start” when they turned 18.She said: “They say ‘whatever I do before I am 18 should be wiped off’ as it shouldn’t have any effect on them as an adult. They want a kind of grand erasure because they talk about the importance of making mistakes and just being kids trying things out.”The Government is currently looking at a range of new measures to better protect children online including imposing a legal duty of care on tech giants and introducing an Age Appropriate Design Code, which will mean social media giants will have to assume users are children if they can\u0027t age verify them.Duty of Care white paperMost social media companies have a minimum age of 13, but due to the lack of proper age checks the study found children as young as nine said they had profiles.The study found that children generally took instructions they received online on “face value” and often didn’t understand how tech companies were commercially benefiting from the information they handed over. As a result, they found it “puzzling” that internet companies often asked them to give out details they did not see as relevant to the service.The children interviewed were also shocked to learn that material they thought they had deleted could still exist online and wanted “delete to mean delete” when it came to social media.Other features children wanted from tech companies were a way to see which other companies their details had been shared with and “child-friendly mechanisms” to edit their information.Prof Livingstone said the children were generally mystified as to why tech companies were interested in personal information they saw as quickly going out of date as they grew up.She added: “Creepy is a really common word that they use. It’s creepy and sinister that all that data is being kept.”Duty of Care CampaignRevealed: the billionaire philanthropists rewilding the Scottish HighlandsComment: Too many in the West insist on dancing to Vladimir Putin\u0026#39s tune Jeremy Corbyn appears to cave to pressure as ally suspended as an MP over anti-Semitism allegationsClose family of Khuram Butt insisted they had no idea he was capable of murderThe Archers tackles historic child abuse in latest harrowing storylineComment: The people have lost patience with an immigration system built on liesBoris Johnson: I\u0026#39ve put on weight again on relentless leadership campaignBody found in the search for missing Rosie Johnson \u0026#39I learnt to fly a Spitfire so I can spread its glory across the world\u0026#39Bicycle lovers in the Netherlands to be hit with fine for using mobile phones while cyclingLondon Bridge attack: \u0026#39Extremist\u0026#39 who exchanged 329 texts with ringleader \u0026#39refuses to surrender his phone\u0026#39London Bridge attack: Anjem Choudary \u0026#39incited\u0026#39 ringleader to commit carnage – so why wasn\u0026#39t he arrested, ask familiesTory leadership race: Boris Johnson will overhaul stamp duty as it causes \u0026#39huge problems\u0026#39 in London Sir Alan Duncan calls Boris Johnson a \u0026#39circus act\u0026#39 unfit to govern the countryIran warns violating nuclear deal still on the table but welcomes European payment mechanismLondon Bridge inquest: Coroner says terror attacker\u0026#39s family \u0026#39unconvincing\u0026#39 as he rules victims were unlawfully killedComment: Dominic Grieve\u0026#39s latest plan to block no-deal is so destructive, so irresponsible, that it can only be a bluffSandwich company linked to listeria closes despite being cleared as source of contaminationPrince Harry to attend The Lion King premiere as Disney pledges to support his conservation workUK weather: 12-year-old girl dies whilst playing in river with friends as heatwave sends temperatures soaringWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/technology/2019/04/21/TELEMMGLPICT000032877532_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqwDgGh3pkom49KxtKngnUa36K9dyKixjq8GqZuuMTIBE.jpeg?imwid","title":"need first amendment internet counter troubling censorship social","story":"The repercussions of companies with an effective monopoly on our news using their position to impose ‘values’ should concern us allFor all its focus on ersity, Silicon Valley is about as ideologically erse as a vegan powwow The advent of modern technology has brought us extraordinary freedoms.

lefthorrified byflaws englishgcse marking","story":" The anonymous examiner alleged that “the standardisation scripts are all over the place” for this year’s English language GCSEA GCSE English examiner has warned that marking guidance is so poor that students face being given the wrong grades in the subject.They claimed that fellow examiners for the exam board AQA were left “shocked” and “horrified” by the scripts chosen as guides for marking.In a series of now deleted messages on Twitter, the anonymous examiner alleged that “the standardisation scripts are all over the place” for this year’s English language GCSE.AQA cautioned that these were “personal opinions” adding that they do not “reflect the overall picture”.But the examiner’s claims will add to students’ fears that they will be left disappointed with their results in August.This summer is the second year that students are taking revamped GCSEs in a raft of subjects, and the third year of the new English literature, English language and maths exams.The new courses were part of a package of reforms by Michael Gove, the former education secretary, designed to toughen up syllabuses, make courses more linear, and cut down on the number of students getting A*s.Last month, the head of exams watchdog warned schools to be braced for “more variation than usual” in this year’s GCSE and A-level results, as reforms take their toll. The whistle-blowing examiner said that there was “no debate at pre-standardisation among the senior examiners”.They added: “That means that the meeting where the standard is evaluated and agreed was a farce. We had examiners horrified at the standard.”Problems in the standards were flagged by the number of markers failing to spot elements supposed to ensure consistent standards.In one, the pupil was given 14 out of 40 when the “correct” score should have been 21, and in another a pupil was awarded 26 marks when a more senior examiner deemed the “correct” mark to be 40.They told the Times Education Supplement magazine that some examiners were so unhappy with this year’s standardisation materials they used those for 2018 instead.Claire Thomson, AQA’s director of operations, said: “These personal opinions, which the user has now deleted, don’t reflect the overall picture.“Getting students the results they deserve is our top priority and we have very effective quality assurance measures in place to make sure examiners mark to a high standard.”Ofqual, the exams watchdog, uses a system called “comparable outcomes” to ensure that roughly the same proportion of pupils get similar grades each year, and those who are the first to take the new, reformed courses are not at a disadvantage compared to other cohorts.Revealed: the billionaire philanthropists rewilding the Scottish HighlandsComment: Too many in the West insist on dancing to Vladimir Putin\u0026#39s tune Jeremy Corbyn appears to cave to pressure as ally suspended as an MP over anti-Semitism allegationsClose family of Khuram Butt insisted they had no idea he was capable of murderThe Archers tackles historic child abuse in latest harrowing storylineComment: The people have lost patience with an immigration system built on liesBoris Johnson: I\u0026#39ve put on weight again on relentless leadership campaignBody found in the search for missing Rosie Johnson \u0026#39I learnt to fly a Spitfire so I can spread its glory across the world\u0026#39Bicycle lovers in the Netherlands to be hit with fine for using mobile phones while cyclingLondon Bridge attack: \u0026#39Extremist\u0026#39 who exchanged 329 texts with ringleader \u0026#39refuses to surrender his phone\u0026#39London Bridge attack: Anjem Choudary \u0026#39incited\u0026#39 ringleader to commit carnage – so why wasn\u0026#39t he arrested, ask familiesTory leadership race: Boris Johnson will overhaul stamp duty as it causes \u0026#39huge problems\u0026#39 in London Sir Alan Duncan calls Boris Johnson a \u0026#39circus act\u0026#39 unfit to govern the countryIran warns violating nuclear deal still on the table but welcomes European payment mechanismLondon Bridge inquest: Coroner says terror attacker\u0026#39s family \u0026#39unconvincing\u0026#39 as he rules victims were unlawfully killedComment: Dominic Grieve\u0026#39s latest plan to block no-deal is so destructive, so irresponsible, that it can only be a bluffSandwich company linked to listeria closes despite being cleared as source of contaminationPrince Harry to attend The Lion King premiere as Disney pledges to support his conservation workUK weather: 12-year-old girl dies whilst playing in river with friends as heatwave sends temperatures soaringWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/06/28/TELEMMGLPICT000202036559_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"france shuts 4000 schools expected hottest temperature history","story":"France is due to surpass 45C for the first time in its mainland history on FridayFrance has broken its all-time record temperature amid a punishing heatwave that has spread across Europe killing several people, including a young farm worker in Spain.In the southern town of Villevieille in the Gard département, the mercury reached 45.1 degrees Celsius on Friday, the highest count since detailed records began in 1947.In Carpentras, in the Vaucluse area, the temperature rose to 44.3C.Both tallies beat the previous record for France of 44.1C set in August 2003 in the southern region of Montpellier and Nimes.The average temperature had hit almost 35C on Wednesday, already a record for the month of June.Edouard Philippe, the prime minister, announced that 4,000 schools in France would be closed on Friday due to the extreme heat.   Four départements in southern France - Herault, Gard, Vaucluse and Bouches-du-Rhone - the level of alert has been raised from orange to red, a first since the warning system was introduced in 2004.Two people have died in Spain in heatwave-linked incidents, say local authoritiesOver in Spain, a 17-year old farm worker died after complaining of feeling faint while helping harvest wheat in the southern Andalusia region.He dipped in a swimming pool to cool off but collapsed with convulsions and was rushed to hospital in the town of Cordoba where he later died, according to the regional government.Also in Spain, a 93-year-old man is thought to have died of heatstroke on the street in the northern city of Valladolid, said police.A wildfire in southern Catalonia continued to rage on what the regional government predicted would be a “critical day”, as temperatures exceeded 40C outside coastal areas.More than 350 firefighters, including military personnel, battled the flames, which remained out of control for a third day, having started after a heap of farm manure spontaneously ignited amidst the heat and high winds.Catalan interior minister Miquel Buch called on residents of nearby small towns, located on banks of the Ebro river between Lleida and Tarragona, to take “maximum precaution” against the “extreme risk”.The civil protection authority evacuated 52 people on Thursday, the majority of whom live near Flix, home to a large chemical plant which had been the cause of an earlier environmental disaster when it leaked.It is feared a wildfire in Catalonia could destroy up to 20,000 hectaresAround 30 of the evacuees, including a handful of British and German residents, had to spent the night at a school in the village, according to Spanish media.Initial estimates on Thursday suggested that the wildfire may eventually destroy 20,000 hectares (50,000 acres) of woodland and farmland in Catalonia, which would make it the largest fire to affect the region in over two decades.Elsewhere in Catalonia, an 80-year-old woman of French nationality died on a beach near Barcelona on Friday morning. Witnesses said that the woman was swimming in the water when she collapsed unconscious.Heatwave-linked deaths have also been reported in Italy, France and Germany, mainly among the elderly. Four people have drowned so far in France this week, and in the UK a 12-year-old girl drowned in a river near Manchester.France\u0027s health minister and UK police warned people to swim only in authorised areas.France has also seen a rise in so-called street-pooling, or illegally opening fire hydrants. A six-year-old child is in life-threatening condition after being projected “several metres into the air” from high-pressure water jet from a cracked fire hydrant in the Paris suburb of Saint-Denis, according to French media.Southern France is expected to bear the brunt of the heat on Friday and SaturdayWith temperatures due to continue soaring on Saturday, traffic restrictions have been imposed in several French cities, including Paris, Lyon, Marseille and Strasbourg, with the most-polluting cars banned from the roads.In Villevieille, British tourist Matthew Crawford from Cornwall said the heat was unbearable.We can hardly walk, he told AFP. We don\u0027t know what to do anymore. We can\u0027t stay in the camping car with the engine and air conditioning on all day. He added: We wanted sun and heat but frankly this is unbearable.Emmanuel Macron, the French president, warned that such extreme weather events could become the norm as a result of global warming.   We will need to change our set-up, our way of working, build differently, he said while on a visit to Tokyo.Italy put 16 cities under alerts for high temperatures, and civil security services distributed water to tourists at top landmarks around Rome baking in unseasonable heat.Authorities are offering tourists water at Rome landmarks in the heatwaveIn Berlin, a police unit trained water cannons normally used for rioters onto city trees to cool them down.In France, the heatwave is expected to come to an end on Sunday for most of of the country bar the South East, where it is forecast to last until Wednesday. Revealed: the billionaire philanthropists rewilding the Scottish HighlandsComment: Too many in the West insist on dancing to Vladimir Putin\u0026#39s tune Jeremy Corbyn appears to

compare and we had to be apologetic about the British Empire, for all eternity, even during ITV’s Sunday night pm to pm slot.Latest result of this self-loathing is Beecham House, a lavish and expensive, not to mention dreadful, new ITV drama which is supposedly set in  Delhi but can be far more accurately carbon dated to the early st century period between March , when Poldark took his top off, to .pm on Christmas Day, .That was when the last ever episode of Downton Abbey finished, ITV execs panicked and suddenly thought: “Oh s***. We need another show with a big house and a strong, silent, topless gardener who gallops around searching for love, fulfilment and all that toss.”So we’ve now got this six-part series fronted by Tom Bateman, who actually made a promising start to playing soldier-turned-trader John Beecham.He got shot.I’d have run the closing titles right there and then and promised viewers: “ITV willin about , when it’s got some new ideas.”According to the caption, however, “three years later” John Beecham was back and he’d brought his extended family with him to fill the big house.They include: His dear old racist mum, played by Mrs Patmore off Downton, a motherless baby, wayward brother Daniel, some pot-stirring French git called General Castillion and two underwhelming bits of female love interest, who won’t get any bloke switching over from Love Island in a hurry. Also present is Citizen Khan himself, Adil Ray, who’s moved in next door wearing a glued-on beard that last saw serious action in Carry On Up The Khyber.So I hope no one was expecting a laugh, or a plot. Because Beecham House hasn’t really got one, apart from the baby issue and Beecham’s grovelling desire to be granted a trading licence, which both generate lots of sarky backchat from the locals, but not much .It all stands or falls then, almost entirely, on the leading character.And, oh boy, does this one ever fall.As absolutely everyone’s noticed, for the want of charisma they’ve had to dress the poor bloke up as Indiana Jones, which can’t be a lot of fun in that climate.Even with the overcoat, cowboy hat and women throwing themselves at him, John’s brother still thinks he’s “the dullest man in Delhi”.The thing that really weighs him down, though, is Empire guilt. The righteous berk can hardly look at an Indian without apologising.“Your Imperial Highness, I implore you judge me by my actions not my flag.”“I am not like my countrymen.” “Their hypocrisy sickens me.” “The East India company’s policy of expansion is shameful.” “I love your country and believe India should be ruled by Indians.”  He’s so woke he could be reading last night’s Channel  News.An approach that’s unlikely to win the show many friends, I’d have thought, or stop the more right-on viewers accusing him of having “big white saviour syndrome”.Ultimately, though, I have absolutely no real idea whether John Beecham will strike a chord with the viewers, because, like most shows broadcast in the Sunday night pm to pm slot, I am not part of the target female audience.All I’m meant to do is sit dumbly and join in the apologetic Empire chorus.I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I’m not sorry at all.TIPPING Point, Ben Shephard: “In Only Fools And Horses, who plays the character known as Del Boy ”Ben: “David Frost.”Fteen To One, Sandi Toksvig: “What is the two-word term for a flashing orange globe mounted on a striped pole, used at pedestrian crossings, named after a s minister of transport ”Kresha: “Traffic light.”And Love Island, Molly-Mae: “What is the capital of France ”PSYCHOPATH With Piers Morganrequires expectations to be managed, because it’s barely a minute old when Porky-Talkie reveals: “The prison considers Paris Bennett so dangerous they insist I interview him behind toughened glass.”Andthat’s not health-and-safety gone mad, I dunno what is, frankly.RE: Love Island. If Joe and Lucie were “Jucie” and Jordan and Anna “Jordanna”, did that make Elma and Scottish Anton “Elma Fud” NEVER a good sign when you can tell a show’s going to be a disaster just from the furniture.But that was the case with last Tuesday’s big political bun fight, on BBC, which looked more like a dating show or fire sale at Louis Walsh’s gaff than a debate to decide Our Next Prime Minister.It sounded like it as well, from the way host Emily Maitlis kicked off, barking: “Five men. One job.” A phrase I don’t think I’ve heard any presenter utter since Kerry Katona was fronting ElimiDate, back in .Long before it got to air, Maitlis and the BBC had also clearly decided Boris was the “Islamo- phobic” booby prize, because not one of the researchers saw any warning signs being given off by Abdullah, from Bristol, who’d deactivated his Twitter before appearing on the show. The prize guy, naturally, was meant to be Rory Stewart, who liberal political commentators all think would make a great Conservative Party leader, in the same way they probably think Iggy Pop would make a great lead singer of One Direction.Turned out, though, he’s a fidgeting little oddball who was political toast long before he sighed at Boris: “I’m sure, like me, you’ve been in Enniskillen sitting with sheep farmers.”So, by the end of the night, an attempted BBC stitch-up had accounted for: Rory Stewart, one anti-semite, from Bristol, some other bug-eyed Corbyn cultist demanding an early election and probably Emily Maitlis’ credibility as well.Boris, meanwhile, just ploughed on regardless.Well done, everyone.Celebrity Crystal Maze, Gemma Collins: “Just being honest, it’s an honour for you to have me.”And The Last Leg, Alex Brooker: “The problem with me swimming The Channel is I can’t swim.”Problem how ON Thursday’s Shopping With Keith Lemon, former market trader Rob Beckett claimed: “I used to sell compost and you can’t up-sell a bag of s***, can you ”Yet it never stopped him trying on All Together Now.IT’S nearly six months since that great foghorning orca, Gemma Collins, last made an exhibition of herself on television.So I suppose we were overdue Friday’s appearance on Celebrity Crystal Maze, where she rumbled round the course, like Indiana Jones’ concrete ball, alongside Carol Vorderman, Ellie Taylor, Rick Edwards and her on off boyfriend Arg.And how that pair avoided wedging themselves inside one of the show’s duct shafts will remain for ever one of the Channel  show’s great mysteries.Gemma bellowed over everyone, insulted her co-stars, threw a hissy fit inside one virtual reality game – “Nah, sorry. Stop the game” – and told host Richard Ayoade: “You must be clever ’cos I’ve got the mind of a genius and you’ve made me laugh.” She also attempted to create some sort of mystique around “The GC” tag, claiming it was nothing to do with her initials and inviting alternative suggestions from Carol, who remained diplomatically silent, evenI’d swear you could see in the thought bubble above her head  . . . “Gigantic consonant vowel consonant consonant.”THE Real Chernobyl proving the perfect accompaniment to Sky Atlantic’s show of the year.Susanna Reid’s digestive tract going into deep spasm when Geoffrey Boycott asked her out for lunch, on another unmissable Good Morning Britain.Top Gear’s Chris Harris attempting to drink a glass of water while being electric-shocked by Freddie Flintoff and Paddy McGuinness.And Alien Fun Capsule host Harry Hill responding to Stephanie Beacham name-dropping former Dynasty husband Charlton Heston: “Yeah, Charlton Heston. He was slumming it a bit after Ben Hur, wasn’t he ”ITV has just one brilliant comedy show. Harry Hill’s Alien Fun Capsule, co-written by Paul Hawksbee and Dan Maier.Slightly to my surprise, I’ve learned it also has a Head of Comedy called Saskia Schuster, who’s just told something called the Diverse Festival – and what a laugh riot that sounds – she will no longer commission shows written only by men.In the great sweep of ITV history, the possibility exists, of course, that someone has made a more stupid, pointless, self-defeating, virtue-clogged, brain-fart of a commitment than this one.It’s just that I can’t think of it at the moment.LAURA Bassett: “She had her arms by her side behind her body.”Casey Stoney: “Cameroon have got that no-lose attitude, eventhey lose.”Jordan Nobbs: “If England keep believing, the second half will come.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Resign!” were directed at the homelessness minister Heather Wheeler.In an email written before she took up the role, Wheeler described rough sleepers in her constituency as “the traditional type, old tinkers”.The words were leaked and, lo, the outrage flowed hot and predictable. The Big Issue Foundation’s chief executive raged that such language, “has no place in this day and age” and so Wheeler should stand down.A travellers’ charity called her words “racist”, adding that “Irish traveller children should not have to grow up in a society where government ministers show such contempt for their culture”.Yes, Wheeler’s language was wince-worthy, but the leap to “racism” highlights the way race is used as a shield to protect the lestyles of some gypsy, Roma and traveller people from legitimate criticism.Recognised in the Equality Act of  as ethnic minorities, a force field of cultural sensitivity surrounds them. Any discussion of their culture can be labelled racist.Recent reports have found that travellers have it worse than the rest of us: Higher infant and maternal mortality rates higher prevalence of depression higher rates of chronic illness.They are likely to die more than a decade earlier than non-travellers.The educational outcomes for their children are terrible: The lowest attainment of all ethnic groups throughout their school years.They are far more likely to be excluded, and while  per cent of white British children stay in education past , only  per cent of Irish traveller children do.Officialdom’s response to these findings has been to blame officialdom or racial discrimination.The chairwoman of the Commons Women and Equalities Committee, Maria Miller, thinks travellers have been “comprehensively failed by policymakers and public services for far too long”.Always, the blame is directed at “the system”.Always, there is the retreat into the safe language of “vulnerable” people and “marginalised communities”, because politicians are terried of asking dficult questions about why travellers are over-represented in prison, or why many of their children are failing at school.Such questions would only spark accusations of racism and discrimination.This is not to suggest that gypsies, Roma and travellers live free from prejudice.There is discrimination which is real and cruel: Allegations of holiday camp operators having traveller blacklists pubs refusing to serve traveller families children bullied in school.Yet whose interests do we servewe pretend that all of this is down to straightforward racism The usually sensible Trevor Phillips, former chairman of the Equality and Human Rights Commission, has said that for gypsies and travellers: “Great Britain is still like the Deep South for black people in the Fties.”His analogy fails because it suggests the prejudice suffered is all about ethnic heritage, unconnected to the lestyle pursued by many travellers. This is nonsense.Though politicians will not dare say it, many in this country have negative perceptions of these groups because of their experience of illegal encampments on their local playing field: The littering, disruption and what might politely be termed “antisocial behaviour”.They see a group of people refusing to live by the laws the rest of us abide by: Trespassing on land with the police seemingly powerless to stop them breaking locks with no one prepared to arrest them parking on private property and not being towed away.It’s not racism driving this anti-traveller sentiment.It is fury that one community seems to live apart from the rules that govern the rest of us.The authorities seem pitully weak when it comes to evicting these camps. Councils must assess the welfare needs of those on the site before they can get an eviction order.Public money is sprayed on legal fees before the caravans move to a dferent illegal site, where the whole thing starts again.The authorities’ methods might be motivated by a desire not to “marginalise” travellers further, but it isn’t working.We need an approach which, while reconciling travellers’ desire to live on the move, recognises the desire of the rest of us to see the rules of the land enforced fairly.Part of this approach must be to make the process of evicting illegal camps surer and swter.But it’s no use simply wielding this stick without a carrot.The complementary action must be a building programme to create more authorised traveller pitches.Critically, each could have contact points with the local authority, with education and health systems, to catch these families in the net of public services .With more information on who lives where, the authorities could keep better tabs on who is educating their children, who is paying council tax, and so on.This issue may not make the hustings in the Tory leadership campaign, but it matters to the kind of country we are.Sensitivity to dferent cultures is right, butobjectionable or illegal behaviour cannot be dealt with for fear it will look racist, we are in a very strange place indeed.Giving one group a politically correct free pass denied to others is not fair, it is discrimination.Conservatives always talk about the importance of everyone “playing by the same rules”.Here’s a chance for the next leader to show he means it.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We need a leader who is going to go out there and support our troops.If our leaders are going to send our troops to war, they need to know that their back is covered.Jeremy Hunt will not cover the backs of our soldiers, hes made it clear.

However, despite his previous support for reclassying Undershaw as Grade I, it now appears that Mr Hunt lobbied extensively for the house to remain Grade II once the DFN Trust became involved.   In April , he wrote to his successor as culture secretary, Sajid Javid , saying he had been asked by DFN Charitable Trust...to write to you to object to a proposed upgrade of an existing Listed Building, known as Undershaw, in Hindhead, Surrey.Mr Hunt added that he thought the DFN proposal would see the building restored to its former glory, saying: My concern as indeed highlighted to me by DFN Charitable Trust is that the case for an upgrade has been made as part of a long campaign by objectors to a previous residential scheme on the site, to try and thwart any redevelopment of the site.John Gibson, a key member of the campaign to upgrade Undershawaposs listing, told Surrey Live : It would appear with regard to Jeremy Hunt , to paraphrase George Orwell, all constituents are equal, but some are more equal than others.A spokesman for Jeremy Hunt told the Daily Mirror: All donations are declared in the proper way.  "},{"url":null,"title":"jeremy hunts parents unimaginable grief","story":"NewsJeremy Hunts parents unimaginable grief after baby sister drowned in bath next to himThe Tory leadership hopeful opened up about the tragic accident on ITVs Peston and revealed he was two-and-a-half when his baby sister died in a tragic accidentShareCommentsByAndy RuddMichael Greenwood:,  JUN Updated:,  JUN Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news politics video jeremy-hunt-reveals-baby-sister-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true\"\"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailHe has spoken about meeting those who have lost children in the NHS and Tory Leadership hopeful Jeremy Hunt knows only too well how this can affect parents. His mum, Meriel and late father Admiral Sir Nicholas Hunt had to deal with the tragic death of his little sister, Sarah, when she was just  months old. Hunt, , spoke about the tragic accident when he appeared on ITVaposs Peston last night. He had told ITVaposs political editor Robert Peston he would be happy to talk about the tragedy beforehand. Local newspaper the Kensington Post covered the inquest into Sarahaposs tragic death at Westminster Coroneraposs Court in March . Coroner Gavin Thurston heard how Sarah drowned in the bath as the familyaposs nanny prepared their dinner. Jeremy was in the bath with Sarah when the tragedy happened at the family home in Kensington. The inquest was told how nanny Dianne Brady had left the children in the bath for aposabout five minutesapos. When she ed to the bathroom she found Jeremy, then two-and-a-half, sitting at the end of the bath. Sarah was lying face upwards. Jeremy told Miss Brady: Sarahaposs asleep. Miss Brady tried to revive Sarah but she died on the way to St Charles Hospital in Kensington.  Mr Huntaposs father Commander Hunt praised Miss Brady after the Coroner recorded a verdict of accidental death. He said: We have had Miss Brady with us for about six months and we think sheaposs absolutely marvellous and both children absolutely adored her. Giving evidence at the time a distraught Miss Brady said had put the children in the bath in about five or six inches of water and had then gone to their bedroom to lay out pyjamas. Then she went to the kitchen to get Sarahaposs dinner ready. She explained she had dficulty in finding the babyaposs bottle and she also put the spin drier on. She told the Coroner that the drier was quite noisy and that she thought all this had taken about five minutes.  During his ITV show last night ITVaposs political editor Robert Peston said to Mr Hunt: Rather extraordinary about your childhood, which I was completely unaware of, which is that you had a baby sister who tragically died, could you just tell me a little bit about what that was  Hunt replied: Well, I donapost talk about that normally. And actually I wouldnapost say that this is something that has affected me emotionally because she was just a few months old when she died in a terrible accident and I was too young to ever remember it. He added: I do know it affected my parents, before Peston interrupted him to say: But it must have affected you. It must have affected you though, donapost you think  This is the sort of tragedy that has a profound affect on families. Mr Hunt, who has a younger brother Charlie, said: Well I was only two-years-old so itaposs not something I have any memories of. But as I say, I do know it affected my parents. Maybe when I met parents who had lost children in the NHS... maybe that triggered something in me. I donapost know but I wouldnapost claim this is something that had a big emotional effect on me personally.  Addressing the backlash Peston tweeted: I have upset many of you by asking about this. But it was not a aposgotchaapos as you seem to think. I told Jeremy-Hunt well in advance I had heard of this terrible family event in his le and askedhe would be happy to talk about it. He said yes. My view was that it would aid understanding of himhe talked about it. Maybe I was wrong. Maybe I asked the questions clumsily. But I would never have entered such dficult private space without the permission of the interviewee. Sorry though to have upset so many of you.

Considering her successor has not indicated there will be enough drinking water, whether it will be delivered by tap or army, orthere is a missing comma which means November st is more of a worry, you might expect Theresa May to display the same uncontrolled tremors as Angela Merkel. But youaposd be wrong. This is a woman who has seen the light at the end of the tunnel and no longer gives much of a toss whether it is a truck or a train, just so long as itaposs not another meaningless vote that will entail having to deal with those parts of her party that other humans cannot reach.And so she stepped off the plane in Tokyo for her final G summit with the same devil-may-care attitude to international diplomacy that we more often associate with those who call the French turds and then get the BBC to delete it.This is a woman who  years ago displayed indecent haste to clutch the hand of a man who combines stupidity with fascism. She entrusted the fate of Brexit to a man who failed as a weekend warrior. And she smiled broadly on the steps of Downing Street with a Saudi princeling who has used British jets and British bombs to pound Yemen and leave m of that countryaposs citizens reliant on food aid.The front row of the G family photo is a Usual Suspects-style mugshot of some of the worldaposs best-known despots. She managed to raise a smile for that. But asked to pose for a photo with Vladimir Putin, Mrs May adopted the same facial expression as someone asked to pick up cat poo.   All the more remarkable, considering how chuffed she managed to look when she met him in .Now, Putin has not been markedly more awful in the past  years. Back then, he was killing opponents, finagling democratic votes, oppressing minorities and was considered to have ordered the murders of  journalists whose words were a danger to his grip on power.By that point he had also imported radioactive polonium- into the UK, had it administered to the defector Alexander Litvinenko, protected the two men who carried out the killing, and promoted one of them to the Duma.His agents had been suspected of involvement in Parliamentary honeytraps and the body-in-a-bag murder of GCHQ boffin Gareth Williams. He had annexed the Crimea, doped his way to  Olympic medals , and had his military shoot down  holidaymakers as their jet flew over Ukraine where his soldiers were occupying a country that had voted to be more European. We may wrinkle our noses with distaste at all that, but diplomacy requires a smile. And weHADimposed sanctions on the little bugger. So whataposs changed since this happiest of snaps, aside from his tie Thereaposs been even more sanctions. Four more journalists have been killed, apparently on Putinaposs orders. And heaposs followed up his WMD proleration by using a chemical weapon in Salisbury, where the cathedral spire is really great but the perfume bottles are deadly.He tried to kill Sergei Skripal, a British intelligence asset. This may be something many nations - and defectors - accept as a risk in the great game, but he did it in a way that was breathtakingly careless. Not only was nerve agent smeared on a door handle which could have been touched by almost anyone, it was discarded in a park where it was picked up by Dawn Sturgess. Thinking it was perfume, she sprayed it on herself. Litvinenko died slowly, and was conscious for most of the  weeks in which his body broke down. Dawn died after  days in a coma. Both were buried in specially-sealed coffins, in case the poisons that killed them leaked.  Yesterday Putin said it was a fuss about spies and traitors must be punished.Dawn was not a spy. She was not a traitor. She was a mother, a daughter, and a partner.   Other things have happened, too. Russia is now all but broke, after a recession and economic stagnation brought about by sanctions. The country is now considered by experts to no longer be a democracy, and it is believed that Putin is the worldaposs richest man, outstripping even the combined wealth of Bill Gates AND Jeff Bezos. The aircraft carrier he threateningly steamed through the English Channel was so old and decrepit it could be defeated by a Nerf gun. His Red Square military parades show off prototypes of tanks and missiles he cannot afford to build, and his vast armed forces mostly consist of conscripts who have no idea what theyaposre doing. He spends what little money he has on gold toilets. And now Putin and May both know sheaposs off, and heaposs not. His term ends in , and her timeaposs up in less than a month. She can demand action, and the surrender of murder suspects, all she likes. He probably sat there and picked his nose and wondered which female on his payroll would be most likely to get Novichok on Borisapos knob.The only weapons Putin has left are poisonous thoughts, and computer keyboards. And May has seen the evidence that he used them to manipulate the Brexit vote. May is not a woman to exhibit much in the way of principle or decency. She can see  dead bodies pulled out of a burned tower block and NOT order every other tower block to be made safe. She can draw red lines that later turn out to be imaginary, send Go Home vans around erse cities, and create an environment so hostile that British citizens are deported on her watch. She sees no need to apologise for any of it. She is not making her distaste clear because she knows she is shaking the hand of an indiscriminate, power-crazed killer who would still be cackling even as James Bond wound his entrails out of him with a stick. She is not grimacing because she has to be nice to a tyrant, or because his proxies manipulated the British democratic process in the hope,not the act, of arranging an outcome that would damage and destabilise every Western democracy he loathes. She doesnapost give a toss about fake news, troll factories, the US election, Hillary Clintonaposs leaked emails, treating Julian Assange as a useful idiot, or those British citizens suspected to be the victims or patsies of Putin, his cronies or his desperate need to launder his billions in foreign states before he is kicked out of his own. She is upset for one of two reasons. Either he is single-handedly responsible for the nightmare of Brexit which overshadowed her short, painful and utterly fruitless premiership, or he knows who leaked that Windrush report."},{"url":null,"title":"bridesmaids prettylittlething suit made look","story":"NewsBridesmaids PrettyLittleThing suit made her look like Harry Potter sorting hatKirsty Jennings purchased the knitted lounge set for £, and planned on wearing it while travelling to a friends wedding in Cyprus this September - before being horried at what arrivedShareCommentsByHelen Le Caplain:,  JUN Updated:,  JUN NewsKirsty shared a hilarious picture of her outfit online \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA bridesmaid claims a lounge suit she ordered from online retailer PrettyLittleThing left her looking like the Harry Potter sorting hat. Kirsty Jennings purchased the knitted lounge set for £, and planned on wearing it while travelling to a friendaposs wedding in Cyprus this September. But when the suit arrived, the -year-old nurse was horried by her order - which turned out to be a baggy two-piece in a murky colour brown. A hilarious picture shows the suit top matching the iconic Harry Potter hataposs murky brown colour, while its baggy fit created the shape of the characteraposs eyes and mouth on poor Kirstyaposs stomach. The bottom half of the outfit didnapost fare much better as size - Kirsty said the trousers were so baggy ‘you could probably fit another person in them’. On the website PrettyLittleThing boasts that shoppers have the chance to ‘look like the ultimate style icon whilst having the maximum comfort’ in the rust set.    But fashion lover Kirsty said she feels she has been ‘catfished’ by the online retailer and won’t buy anything from them in future. Kirsty, from Birmingham, said: “It looks like I’m wearing the sorting hat - once you see it you can’t unsee it. “I like Harry Potter but I didn’t want to look like one of the extras. “I realised it wasn’t what it looked like on the website as soon as I put it on, the whole thing was horrible. “My mum took one look at me in it and burst out laughing, looking back it’s quite funny but at the time I thought ‘I’ve got to send this back’.” Kirsty had been browsing on her phone earlier this month when she spotted what appeared to be the perfect choice for the five-hour flight and ordered it - a slouchy off-the shoulder top and elasticated trousers. Excited Kirsty had been telling pals at work about her new airport outfit and was looking forward to getting home at pm to try it on. But excitement soon turned to disappointment when Kirsty tried on the top to discover that it wasn’t roomy enough to wear casually slung over one shoulder like the model does on the website.    Kirsty said: “I liked the colour and the fact it looked airy, like you wouldn’t get too hot on the plane with it. “I sent a picture of it to my friend beforehand and she said it was lovely. “I was so excited on the day it was due to arrive. I was talking to one of my colleagues about it saying ‘my lounge suit’s coming’ and showing them the picture. “They thought it would be comfy for the five-hour flight from Birmingham to Cyprus. “The trousers were really baggy - you could probably fit another person in it. “The top was loose but not as loose as it looks like in the picture, there was no chance it could have gone over my shoulder. “The pockets were terrible too, the lining was all crinkled - someone said it looked like I had mincemeat in there. “The whole thing is a massive disappointment and means I’ll have to go and shop somewhere  to find the right one. “I used to shop regularly at Pretty Little Thing but I won’t be any more.” PrettyLittleThing has been approached for comment.

Harry Hankinson, , has clocked up  offences since he fell from a hotel balcony whilst watching Alf Ramseyaposs team on TV during the tournament in Mexico. He claims he banged his head in the tumble which caused a aposaposchange in his personalityaposapos and turned him into a kleptomaniac with an aposaposuncontrollableaposapos urge to steal. Medical tests to determine why he has felt the need to steal everything from designer handbags to packets of meat claim Hankinson has aposaposorganic personality disorderaposapos caused by brain damage. Over the last five decades he has been in and out of jail over shoplting expeditions at stores across the UK. During his criminal career, even Hankinsonaposs own we spoke out to condemn short prison sentences he was receiving. In  she was unwittingly caught up in another thieving expedition when she and her husband went to Ripon, North Yorkshire, for a day out by a coach - to celebrate his release from another prison stretch.    In  he was given an ASBO banning him from every shop in his former home town of Bolton, Greater Manchester. The order also meant he could be asked to leave any shop in Greater Manchester by security staffthey grew suspicious of his behaviour. On Thursday Hankinson who currently lives in a care home in Miles Platting, Manchester, was back in court after he was caught stealing £ worth of food at a Sainsbsurys store in Oldham and £ worth of spirits from a Aldi store in Ashton-under-Lyne. But appearing in the dock on crutches he was conditionally discharged for  months by JP in Tameside after he claimed he usually gave away most of the items he stole. He admitted two charges of theft. His lawyer Peter Butler said in mitigation: You might wonder how somebody has that many convictions - but the back story is it would appear that he fell out of a hotel balcony window in  and suffered a head injury during the World Cup. His family have stated that his behaviour changed from that point forward. Many assessments have been conducted for kleptomania from his GP and a report states he suffers from mixed personality disorder which makes him emotionally unstable and have anti-social traits. The pattern of behaviour indicates organic personality disorder in which victims suffer signicant alteration of their behaviour following brain damage and experiencing lack of control and poor planning in addition to poor impulse control. It is a cognitive deficit due to his head injury. His behaviour over all these years is explained by the head injury that he suffered at that time.aposapos    Mr Butler added: He doesn’t commit crimes for his gain there is no drug habit or lavish le style - he more often than not gives the items away. His family confirmed that they have noticed him come back from the shops with chocolates and he had then given them out to the residents of the care home where he resides. aposaposIt is an offence that is indicative of a serious trauma that has happened in the past. This is somebody with many previous convictions but has stayed out of trouble since . His family have been doing everything they can to assist him - it is something they have to work at day by day. Earlier prosecutor Miss Lucy Garside said the two shoplting incidents occurred on April  and May  this year.    She said: aposaposAt .am he was seen walking around a Sainsbury’s store selecting some items and places them into the trolley whilst he placed other items directly into a blue suitcase. aposaposHe then transferred the items from his trolley in to the suitcase walked past all points of payments making no attempts to pay for any of the items. Outside the doors security ask him to re-enter and account for the items. aposaposOn the second occasion he entered an Aldi store with an unknown female at .am with a large blue suitcase. A he entered the store the security alarm beeped but he said he had a metal pin in his knee. Staff began to monitor him and he was seen to put a number of items in his basket and then moved to a blind spot. After that the items were not in the trolley anymore. He then made his way to the conveyor belt and put some items onto the conveyor, staff asked him about the suitcase and he stated the items inside were from a dferent store. They found four bottles of Aldi alcohol in the suitcase and police were contacted. In the rest of suitcase there were bottles of Martini, Jack Daniels, Champagne – those bottles weren’t actually stolen in Aldi - but the Jack Daniels still had the security tag. aposaposThe defendant didn’t have enough cash on him to pay for items he was found with £ in cash – the amount that was required was up to £.. He has a y list of previous convictions.aposapos Hankinson was also ordered to pay £ in costs. He did not comment after the hearing.

But the girl was crying and the problem was with the mum-of-twoaposs hearing. Childbirth had caused Kate to lose  per cent of her hearing. When her second child, Albert, was born two years later, she lost a further  per cent of her hearing - leaving her  per cent deaf.    After losing her hearing during her first pregnancy, doctors didnapost immediately notice the connection between Kateaposs sudden deafness and her pregnancy. But sheaposs since been diagnosed with otosclerosis - a rare condition that means pregnancy hormones cause the bones in her ear to grow, blocking her hearing. Kate, from London, said: I had no idea I was going deaf, not at all. I was pregnant so lots of changes were going on and I didnapost notice my hearing loss till my husband noticed I wasnapost hearing him as well.    I noticed the initial loss during my first pregnancy when I entered the third trimester, but I didnapost quite make the connection. I was told straight away that it was bone growth - and it would only improve with a risky operation that is likely to leave me completely deaf. But the changes were so little, I didnapost think anything of it but after giving birth to Beatrix, my hearing almost instantly declined. After having a C-section, I began to panic as I couldnapost hear Beatrix crying but she was crying, I was just deaf.  The diagnosis was very hard - I was living on limited and broken sleep, and I was also back part-time working. It was a lot of going to hospital to see the audiologist with a newborn in tow, and I remember being so confused as to why this had happened to me. It was very hard getting answers, and the audiologists said it was so rare. Kate added: I found out that my grandmother had lost all hearing in her left ear, whilst pregnant with my father. Now, I feel like Iaposve turned into my grandma and am now slightly older than my years.  My hearing has continued to decline, and currently Iaposm at  per cent hearing loss. There is an operation available, but it can go wrong, and lead to complete deafness. I was only told last year about the operation and it still wouldnapost help with the sensorineural loss. I could never have imagined how much it would affect me further down the line. Iaposm fortunate that my hearing aids allow me to hear a little, but before they managed to get them to work, I had to rely on lip reading. My children have learnt they need to be more patient as I canapost always hear them, although my hearing aids are fantastic.  I have alarms and monitors in my childrenapos rooms, so even now at the age of three so I can hear them when I am downstairs and they are upstairs. Weaposve had to learn to adapt, and it was a side effect of pregnancy that I definitely wasnapost expecting. Kateaposs hearing has not improved, and she relies on her children Beatrix, six and Albert, five, to be her ears when sheaposs looking after them. Kate said: Since my first pregnancy, and the first decline in my hearing, I was referred straight to Kingston Hospital audiology department. Now, my hearing loss has deteriorated to severe, and it can be an issue at times.Related video: They found it the second time because doctors thought to check it - as it was such a rare thing to happen first thing time around. Iaposve found the hearing loss caused increased anxiety especially as my fear is that I may not hear the children when they need me. I wear a hearing aid and it definitely improves this but itaposs still hard. Every audiologist I have seen exclaims, youaposre so young to have this condition. Itaposs frustrating because every audiologist has tried to recommend an aid which I can hide and disguise, so no-one can see it. It feels so incredibly wrong, as what message is this promoting to young children diagnosed with hearing loss and needing to wear an aid  I could go totally deafI had a third child, but I donapost regret for one moment having children. I definitely wonapost be having a third though.

Three sons from the Mannan family were killed fighting for the extremist group while seven more - including three young children - died in an airstrike. The elderly parents both died of natural causes. When they fled in , it was reported Muhammed Mannan had diabetes and his we Minera Khatun had cancer. The Mannans included the oldest and youngest British people to have defected to ISIS. The  relatives had not been seen in four years after visiting their home country of Bangladesh. It is believed the family stopped in Turkey on their way home before entering the war-torn country. At the time, a statement from relatives back in the UK said they were devastated and the disappearance was out of character.   Speaking to the MailOnline, Mr Mannanaposs son Shalim said: They are all dead. Itaposs over, finished. We had been trying to find out for some time what had happened to them and it was only confirmed to us recently from Syria.Itaposs a tragic end and we have drawn a line under it all and are now trying to get on with our lives.

Joining them were extended family members Mohammed Saleh Hussain, , and his we Roshanara Begum, , along with three children, aged between one and . The family was reported missing to police by two sons, understood to be Mr Mannanaposs from a previous marriage, who live in Luton.    Two months after arriving in Syria, the family released a statement declaring their support for ISIS and their happiness at being in a land that is free from the corruption and oppression of man made law and is governed by the shariah. It added: Yes, all  of us and why should this number be shocking, when there are thousands and thousands of Muslims from all corners of the world that are crossing over land and sea everyday to come to the Islamic State  Donapost be shocked when we say that none of us were forced against our will. In fact it is outrageous to think that an entire family could be kidnapped and made to migrate like this.    Speaking back in , a community leader said he had known the family for  years, with Mr Mannan going to the local mosque a number of times a day. He said no-one knewthey had joined a specic extremist Islamist group but people in his community had told him some women in the family might have been radicalised and taken the rest of the family with them to avoid detection. The Mannanaposs Luton home is currently being rented out and neighbours said that they too had been informed by relatives that the entire family is now dead.

But that could soon change – because pub crawls with a dferent are pulling in punters around the country. We gave our reporters the arduous task of trying out a few... Paul RoutledgeTranspennine Real Ale Trail This is more of a pilgrimage than a pub crawl. I started in a puffer-nutter’s paradise, the Station Buffet Bar, Stalybridge, Greater Manchester, a magnicent Victorian celebration of all things railway. And beer.  Tourists will wow to this bit of olde England, historic train stuff on the walls and white-bearded relics of the steam age knocking it back at am. It’s not cheap but it is theatre. Which cannot be said of the The Railway Inn, Greenfield, just up the valley, which is shut. And the train is cancelled too, so it’s the  bus over Saddleworth Moor to the Riverhead Brewery Tap, Marsden. Altogether more welcoming. We’re now in Yorkshire and the village is the birthplace of Poet Laureate Simon Armitage.He’d compose an ode to my pint of Ossett Blonde.    Ever onwards, ever down the Colne Valley to The Commercial, Slaithwaite , which is quiet but, who cares, with Commerci’ale made round the corner by Empire Brewing at £. a pint.Next up is The King’s Head, in the east wing of Grade- listed Huddersfield station where I often partake with Robert Sutclfe of the town’s Daily Examiner newspaper. In the square outside, statuesque Harold Wilson – a brandy man, for all the talk of beer and sandwiches in No – turns his back on the pub. Canalside in Mirfield, The Navi­gation is a favourite of ale-trailers. They throng through in fancy dress, stag and hen parties. Cheaper than Prague, when you take the air fare into account. Finally made it to The West Riding, on Dewsbury station.   Another Victorian masterpiece with coal firesand a cracking pint of Black Sheep as it should be for £.. First-rate pizza and all-day breakfast for trailers. All these pubs are close to – or on – stations on the Manchester to Leeds line. With such delicious distractions, I’m surprised anybody ever gets to either city. But given the record of Northern Rail and Transpennine Trains, who’s to tell  Amanda Killelea Manchester gin crawl Think of a Manchester and booze and it may conjure up a vision of Mel Sykes leaning out of an ice cream van with a pint of Boddington’s, asking “Do you want a flake in that, love ” But gin is now the drink of choice, with thousands of flavours on offer in dozens of gin bars across the city.  Clever marketing and imaginative ingredients have re-ignited our love affair with the tipple once known as mother’s ruin. Oliver Wrigley’s family have run the Atlas bar in Deansgate for the past eight years. They were the behind the city’s gin revolution, after spotting a gap in the market for artisan products. The bar now stocks over  ieties and is the first stop for afficionados on the city’s burgeoning Gin Journey. Oliver says: “The laws on gin production changed in , opening the market to smaller artisan companies. That’s why there is so much choice.”He pours me his favourite Isle of Harris gin – produced from kelp mixed with a tonic made from quinine grown on the Inca trail in Peru. Weird...but quite wonderful, too. Next stop is Gorilla bar, which has its own dedicated gin parlour tucked away on the first floor where it infuses its own gin with berries, herbs and olives. Bartender Ben Thompson, , says: “We have regulars who have gone back to the traditional way of drinking gin with soda rather than tonic, so they can taste the intense flavour.”Manchester’s regenerated and flourishing Northern Quarter, home to countless independent cafes, bars and restaurants, is on the city’s popular gin crawl. In Cottonopolis drinkers can even give Japanese gins a whirl. But manager Gethin Jones explains that even the fanciest of his cocktails won’t break the bank. I’d better call it a day there, though, otherwise these oh-so-alluring new gins could be this mother’s ruin too. Rachael Bletchly Liquid History Tour, London Iaposm on my third gin and tonic in just over an hour and beginning to feel pleasantly fuzzy. I’ve been enthusing about pork scratchings to a couple from Guatemala, swapping Winston Churchill-isms with a guy from Texas and chatting about a foul-mouthed parrot with Simon and Amanda from Harpenden.  And, although it’s only pm, I’m now trying to persuade a reluctant barman to take me down to the cellar and show me his crown jewels.Or, rather, the vault where the priceless royal gems were stashed during the Blitz to protect them from Nazi bombers. But then Freddie, our cheery guide, tells us to drink up and my  new chums and I pour out of the Old Bank of England Pub on to Fleet Street, heading for another boozer and more fascinating stories. I’ve joined one of the award- winning pub crawls delighting tourists with a quirky mix of history, literature, politics, pop culture, architecture and, of course, alcohol.  They were set up eight years ago by former international tour guide John Warland, . He calls them “love letters to London’s old ale houses and gin palaces”, highlighting their fascinating history while giving hard-pressed landlords a boost – at a time when pubs a week are being forced to close down. And the  to -year-old tourists who pay £ a head for the pleasureclearly think they’re liquid gold. The regular walk takes three to four hours, stopping at half a dozen pubs. But a private group once crammed in  boozers… and then managed to take in a gin distillery. Guide Freddie Heacock, , said: “People rarely come on the tour to get hammered.” The funny, friendly walking encyclopedia of beer and history added: “The foreign visitors find it a great way to see the city, hear some stories and find out about our pub culture and dferent ales. “But we get a lot of locals too.” I urge you take the tour – it really is the best bar none. Hic. Matt Roper Madam Parboiledaposs Nottingham pub tour Sitting in a dark cave with six others, I’m enjoying my third pint as a toothless old “wench” spooks us with stories of a ghostly tormented highwayman and a little street urchin called Rosie. We’re at the Salutation Inn , the third drinking hole on this very dferent kind of pub crawl. Or more precisely, we’re in one of the caves deep beneath it where peasants once lived. And where, according to our cackling guide Madame Parboiled, many a poor soul met an unpleasant end. Four-year-old Rosie was knocked down by a cart and buried in the cave.  “Just there on the spot you’re sitting,” shrieks Madame Parboiled, making a fellow drinker spit out his beer. If you’re looking for a pub crawl which leaves you with more than just a hang-over, this is definitely it. Kath George,  – aka Madame Parboiled – charges £ for the three-hour tour of the city’s oldest pubs. First up is The Bell Innwith a hole still at the entrance, where lepers could buy their beers. Others on the route include the Ned Ludd and The Royal Children, so named because Charles II’s offspring would go there to play with the landlord’s kids. Final destination is the Ye Olde Trip to Jerusalem, claiming to be the oldest pub in England, reputedly dating to . Few, however, know the story of the cursed galleon, an ancient model ship kept locked in an upper room.  Twice in the last  years, cleaners have decided to dust it but both died within days.Today, no one dares go near, including Madame Parboiled, who winds up the tour telling the story from the safety of a room downstairs. Fellow crawler Jacquelyn Clarke, , says: “I’ve found out loads about my city. This is a great way of meeting people, having a laugh and a drink too.” "},{"url":null,"title":"great gran uses 900 love","story":"NewsGreat-gran uses  love letters from late soldier husband to write poetry bookValerie Dewey and then fiance Arnold kept their love alive using letters when they were ided by warShareCommentsByAdam Aspinall:,  JUN NewsValerie Dewey, , is re-reading hundreds of letters written to her by her late husband to inspire a book \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA devoted widow is using a treasure trove of more than  love letters sent by her soldier husband  years ago as inspiration for a poetry book.

Instead, he aposcheekilyapos proposed to his partner Lindsey Norman by pulling down his trousers to reveal the tattoo on his backside during a game of pool just two days before Christmas last year. Lindsey, , told him to come closer so she could get a better look at it - and was shocked when she realised her boyfriend Dustin was asking her to marry him. She broke into tears of joy said yes once the shock wore off and the cat lovers are now busy preparing for their wedding in August next year.    Bohemian bride-to-be Lindsey, from Hertfordshire, is set to tell the coupleaposs unusual story during an appearance on the TLC programme Curvy Brides Boutique. In the episode, which debuts on Friday night, Lindsey tells boutique owners Jo Cooke and Alison Law: Dustin actually got a tattoo on his bum of our cat with ‘Will you marry meow ’ written underneath. She is wearing a dress covered in images of cats.  Jo was amused and a bit shocked, saying: “Having a tattoo on your butt of a cat as a marriage proposal  Whoa, whoa, whoa, I’m too old for all this. Lindsey visited the Essex-based boutique with her best friend and chief bridesmaid Jakki to find her dream dress for her woodland wedding to fiancé Dustin. She says in a trailer for the episode: “I definitely don’t want white. I don’t want to look like a princess with all the layers and the big ballgown.  I like floaty. I’d like to look a bit like a fairy. Jakki adds: “She’s got a vision, she’s got a definite vision and there’s no steering away from it at all. Lindsey was a hit with Jo and Al, who says: “Lindsey, the red hair, this fabulous cat dress, she is oozing personality and style. While trying on dresses, Al points out how confident Lindsey is in herself and with her body, and brings up the subject of body confidence to her.  Lindsey says: “It’s taken a while, a long time actually, for me to feel not really bothered about what people think. Some things still knock you though. Somebody at work just out-and-out asked me what it was like to be in a mixed-weight relationship. Al says: “I can honestly say, in all of my  years, that I have never heard that comment before. Lindsey toldthat Dustin proposed during a game of pool, adding: He orchestrated it so he would get aposseven-balledapos, where the black is sunk when one player still has all seven of their balls on the table.  Our rule is you have to pull your pants downthat happens, so he just pulled down his trousers. I looked over and said aposWhat’s that on your bum apos He walked over to me and I could see that it said aposWill you marry meow apos with a picture of our cat. A friend passed the engagement ring to Dustin, and Lindsey broke into tears of joy. Lindsey said had been dropping hints about getting engaged, and she was shocked when Dustin proposed because she wasnapost expecting it at all or in such a unique way. Until then, he had managed to keep the tattoo a secret, even sleeping in the coupleaposs spare room at night. Curvy Brides Boutique airs at pm on Fridays exclusively on TLC.

Blaine Gibson decided to investigate the Malaysian Airlines plane after becoming perplexed by its disapearance. The retired lawyer started searching beaches and, after trips to countless coastlines between the planeaposs starting point in Kuala Lumpur and its intended destination in Beijing, he struck lucky. On the first day of scouring the shore of Madagascar he found several items and a message. As well as a few backpacks and purses, all empty, Blaine found a baseball cap with a note scrawled inside.    According to the Express , It read: “To whom it may concern. My dear friend, meet me at the guesthouse later.” It is not clear who the message is from or who it was intended for. Despite having found a third of all of the MH debris retrieved since it went missing on March , , the American investigator is not loved in all quarters. According to pilot turned writer William Langewiesche, Blaine started getting death threats when he found his first piece of the aircraft three years ago. Mr Langewiesche wrote on the Atlantic: “One message said that either he would stop looking for debris or he would leave Madagascar in a coffin. Another warned he would die of polonium poisoning. “He has been traumatised.” In a bid to keep a low profile Blaine doesnapost disclose his location or travel plans and regularly changes Sim card. The official attempt to find the missing aeroplane became the most costly in aviation history. An underwater search of a stretch of ocean , miles west of Perth alone cost £. million. After a three-year search across , square kilometresof ocean failed to locate the aircraft, the Joint Agency Coordination Centre heading the operation suspended their activities in January . A second bid to find the plane was launched in January  by private contractor Ocean Infinity but also ended without success after six months.

Roz Dzelzitis has spoken out against the unfair treatment of her daughter while they were enjoying a trip to a play fountain in Silver Spring, Maryland, USA, on June . The youngster - wearing a t-shirt and shorts - was allegedly ejected by a security guard because she wasnapost wearing a girlaposs bathing suit. “She had been in there a little while,” Ms. Dzelzitis said in a Facebook post. “Suddenly the guard came over and motioned to her and said, ‘Out!’”    Roz included a picture of her daughter wearing the same purple t-shirt and shorts that she had on that day. According to Rozaposs account, the security guard pulled out a black binder that contained drawings of swimwear to illustrate that her daughter wasn’t dressed appropriately. The company that runs the fountain, Downtown Silver Springs, requires that children must wear appropriate clothing in order to use the fountain. Roz attempted to explain to the guard that her daughteraposs outfit was swimwear, but to no avail. She added He said, aposbut those are boys,apos and told me aposshe’s a girl.apos When my daughter protested and pointed out the boys, he repeated that aposthose are boysapos and turned to my daughter and said aposyou’re a girl.apos The incident is the second time that the girl was booted from a venue for wearing the the wrong clothes, her mum claims.    She published the post on Facebook in order to challenge the sexist double standards that still exist for girls. “Just the fact that someone specically told her that ‘Yes, that boy can do this but you’re a girl, you can’t,’ ” Dzelzitis said. “It’s unbelievable that would occur in  in Silver Spring, Maryland. Those memories of being told what you can and can’t do because of your gender never leave you.” In a statement to the Washington Post , Downtown Silver Spring Fountain said:  “There was an unfortunate misunderstanding by a security guard at the Downtown Silver Spring fountain who did not initially recognize that the child’s attire was indeed swimwear. Once a supervisor was called and found that the clothing was appropriate swim attire, the supervisor apologized and told the parents the girl was allowed back in the fountain. We’ve taken this opportunity to retrain our Security team. There is no gender specic swim wear requirement.” “The fountain is required to operate under Montgomery County’s rules for swimming pools,” the statement continued. “As such, children and adults must be in swim attire.” Ms. Dzelzitis has refuted these claims. She says her family did not receive an apology and says her daughter was not allowed back into the water that day.

Police were called to the horrying scene after being contacted by a local worker in Polk County last Thursday. By the time officers arrived the gator had already let go but was still nearby, local news station WFLA reported. The Polk County Sherf’s Office told the station the man’s body was found in a canal at around : a.m. Officials from the Florida Fish and Wildle Conservation Commission responded to assist.    The gator was shot and killed by FWC and taken to the Medical Examiner’s Office along with the man’s body, officials said. They will now examine the contents of the alligator’s stomach. “It’s a large alligator. It was  foot,  inches long and it weighed approximately  pounds,” Ashley Tyer, Florida Fish  Wildle Conservation Commission, told the station. A Polk County Sherf’s Office spokesman added that it is possible the man died several days ago. The gator had “disengaged” from the body by the time officials responded, according to the sherf’s office. “The body does look like it had something happen to it related to the alligator,” Carrie Horstman, with PCSO told the channel.    “We’re really not at liberty to say much right now. It is possible that the alligator did something to this person either before or after his death.” Investigators do not have any information on the cause of death at this early stage, a sherf’s office spokesman said. An autopsy will be conducted to determine the cause of death, the man’s identity, and how long he was dead for. A vehicle was towed away from the scene. Law enforcement is working to determine why the man was on the property.

Audra Bear, , used to be vegan and raw vegan until she discovered the apospranicapos lestyle and aposbreatharianismapos eight months ago. She started by practising breath work for  minutes a day and after five days she claims she no longer had a hunger for dense foods. Her first fast lasted  days where she consumed only teas, juices and smoothies. Now, Audra practices breath work anywhere between one and three hours a day. Audra, from Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA, only usually eats solid foods on occasion, usually when she is with her family and friends. She claims she feels relaxed, but a nutritionist has warned this diet can be harmful and means you will be missing out on important nutrients for good health. But nutrition scientist Helena Gibson-Moore warned only consuming one food group in a specic way - such as juicing - is not healthy.    Audra, describing her choices, said: Prana is another word for energy, also known as Qi or Chi. It is a le-giving force that flows in, through and around all things, itaposs in the air we breathe, the sunshine, nature, connections with people and all living things. It is a powerful energy that actually has the ability to fuel and sustain us as humans. Living a pranic lestyle is about shting your focus from nourishing your body with denser sourcesto less denser sources , all the while keeping in mind that food is not bad, you can enjoy foodyou want to.    She said sheaposd heard about this way of living but never thought it would appeal to her until she began breathing exercises. Audra claims she realised she had no appetite for solid or dense foods. It started by practising breath work, she explained. There is something magical about conscious, controlled breathing that brings you with a face to face meeting with yourself, it brings you back to the core of your being. Breath work helps you to realise who you are and what you need or donapost need. I never intended to aposquit foodapos I just started practicing for  minutes a day and after about five days I no longer had a hunger for dense foods.  She continued: Breath work is the base of healing and detoxication for the physical and emotional body,  per cent of toxins in the body are released through respiration. It gently guides your body into para sympathetic nervous system which relieves stress, aids digestion, stops cravings, increases mentally clarity and happiness. Most days I just drink teas, fruit juices, green juices and fresh coconut waters. I do eat occasionally now, but more for celebratory reasons.  Nutrition scientist Helena Gibson-Moore spoke to Lad Bible and warned: A diet that only includes fruit juices and teas is likely to be low in energy so although initial weight loss may occur, in the long term you will be missing out on important nutrients for good health. By only consuming one food group such as fruit and vegetables, in a specic way such as juicing, without balancing it with other food groups, is not healthy and can be harmfulsustained over time. Whilst the evidence for such diets in terms of disease prevention is lacking, there is a wealth of evidence that ied and balanced dietary patterns including fruit and veg, wholegrains, good sources of protein like oily fish, pulses and nuts, some dairy or dairy alternatives, some unsaturated fats and lower intakes of fatty processed meats, refined grain, salt, saturated fat and sugary foods and drinks is associated with better health outcomes.

The arrests came after police in the province of Buenos Aires in eastern Argentina dismantled an alleged gang of kidnappers working in the municipalities of Paso del Rey, Merlo, Isidro Casanova, Longchamps and Villa Albertina.  The two men reportedly said they did not have the amount in local currency but could provide £,, and they were taken to a flat in Puerto Madero to retrieve it, accompanied by the armed men. After the money was handed over, the victims were released but the gang reportedly stole the vehicle, along with £ and mobile phones. The victims reported the incident to the police and an investigation was launched.Prosecutor Leandro Ventricelli ordered the raid of ten houses linked with the gang, arresting six men and the pair of sisters.The suspects have been charged with armed robbery and kidnapping among other unspecied crimes.

The two-year-old girl climbed into the washing machine for fun but became stuck in the drum on June . Her frantic parents tried to pull her out of the machine but were unable to rescue their daughter. They called a washing machine repair man to dismantle the equipment, but the child was unable to be freed. Her parents later called the emergency services in a desperate bid to save their daughter.    A team of seven firefighters soon arrived at the scene in Chengdu, China, and pushed the washing machine on its side to reach for the child. Grabbing her ankles, they successfully managed to lt the crying toddler, who was red-faced and drenched in sweat from the ordeal.    Speaking about the incident, mother said: “She sat in there by herself, but it was too hot and she trapped herself in her rush to climb out. “She pushed and pushed and trapped herself further and further inside. “We even called a washing machine repairman to try and take the appliance apart, but it was unsuccessful.” "},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/06/GJen_The-Caird4-846x564.jpg ","title":"172 at the caird perfect for our kids free relaxing date","story":"We wanted to have a civilised date night to celebrate the news I am expecting another baby.I fancied something nicer than McDonald’s with the kids or a takeaway pizza on the sofa, before our brood grows by one more. at the Caird is a chic, modern venue in a refurbished former jute mansion on Perth Road – the perfect choice for a calm and child-free evening. vw, px\"  I’d been to the Caird for coffees and drinks in its cocktail and wine bar, so I was aware of the tastefully designed interior and stunning views across the Tay, and I was keen to see how its food matched up.The vibe was certainly calm when we entered the reception and were escorted into an almost empty dining room. vw, px\"  It was a glorious evening and the sun was streaming into the room, so we opted for a table by the large window, perfect for people-watching on the main road, next to the glossy black grand piano – classy.My partner ordered a Rekorderlig ciderand even now I can’t hide the disappointment I feel at not being able to order a cocktail. Especially here, where they have an extensive menu dedicated to them categorised by flavour and even offer “cocktail experiences” for those looking to learn from their mixologists. Our waiter recommended a real fruit mocktail with lots of real crushed fruit and berries and juices to provide a thirst quenching mix without the alcohol .We relaxed into the quiet and sipped our drinks in the sun as we pondered over the vast menu options.The venue’s interior is a mix of classic wooden floors with soft leathers and muted tartans in greys and brown, combining traditional charm with modern comfort. vw, px\"  The menus are bound in heavy leather books, and there was plenty of choice.My other half ordered bruschetta to startwhich, of course, we ended up sharing. Well, I am eating for two!Who knew that three simple slices of toasted bread with oils and tomato could be so delicious  Also, both of us were pretty in awe of the little yellow tomatoes – spot the uncultured pair.I toyed with the idea of my usual steak pie-pick and even deliberated a fish dish, but in the end we both went for the same main course of chicken tikka curryand it was presented beautully.The plate held rice and naan with a small dish of mango chutney and a large dish of gorgeously bright-coloured chicken tikka.The chicken was wonderfully soft and the tikka sauce was full of flavour, not too salty with just a bit of zing. vw, px\"  I’m notoriously soft when it comes to anything spicy, but this was just enough for me and I only needed water for my tingly lips towards the end of finishing the plateful.We were both equally surprised at the portion size from the Caird. Although it felt upmarket, there was no scrimping on the food.I chose the brownie for dessert and my partner the sticky toffee pudding . Again, both platefuls looked almost too good to eat.My dark chocolate brownie was topped with drizzled caramel sauce next to a scoop of vanilla ice cream with sprinkles of crushed chocolate and chocolate sauce. Strawberries and homemade fudge was presented to the side in a design with shards of wafer and small dollops of salted caramel and strawberry mousse. It sounds like a lot of flavours and it was, but in a good way.My partner’s slab of sticky toffee pudding was also teamed with a large scoop of ice cream, crushed chocolate, a large wafer and a couple of raspberries, sprinkled with icing sugar.We both finished the lot.The whole evening was lovely and relaxing. We could hear the live musicians in the bar from where we were seating which provided great listening. The staff were also fantastic, extremely helpful, attentive and polite."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/06/2.43361134-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/06/2.43361134-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/06/2.43361134-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/06/2.43361134-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"air traffic controllers reject pay offer from highlands and islands airport","story":"Air traffic controllers have rejected a fresh pay offer from Highlands and Islands Airportsand will resume industrial action today.Staff represented by trade union Prospect commenced working to rule from one minute past midnight today, after turning down a fresh proposal from HIAL based around retention allowances.

But he will be doing his own programme for the next couple of weeks.“Then hopefully we can start to get Niall integrated.“I think Niall will have a chance to be in full training maybe a few days before the second leg.“It would probably be too much to expect Niall for the first leg, but you never know as he is doing well.”Aberdeen will definitely be without midfielder Stephen Gleeson for the games with RoPS as he is ruled out with a knee injury. Gleeson did not travel to Cork due to the injury sustained while carrying out his fitness programme in the close season before reporting back to Pittodrie.The Dons are still sweating over the fitness of Craig Bryson, the summer signing from Derby County, for the first leg with RoPS.Bryson is recovering from an ankle ligament injury.The injury ruled him out of Derby’s run to the Championship play-off final at Wembley, where they lost to Aston Villa in the final.The -year-old has stepped up his recuperation in Cork by beginning training on the grass.McInnes said: “Niall McGinn, Connor McLennan and Craig Bryson are still that bit behind and we are hoping we can get them up to speed and join the squad.“Once we can get those three back on to the pitch and fully training with the rest of us, the squad starts to look a bit stronger and a bit more how we would want it.”Aberdeen have ed to the Fota Island resort in Cork having utilised the facility during pre-season last summer in the build-up to facing Burnley.There is a key dference this summer, however, that is allowing McInnes to get maximum work into his squad – the temperature.The climate this week has been far more conducive to triple training sessions per day.Last year the Dons trained during the hottest summer in Cork for more than two decades.It was so hot an official weather warning was issued by the Met Eireann.Temperatures were in excess of C and Cork airport endured the driest conditions ever recorded.It is much cooler this summer and McInnes is making the most of the conditions.He said: “Last summer was very unusual with the temperatures.“Obviously that was a factor when we were trying to get the work into the players.“The reason we don’t really go to countries with those climates is because we are mindful that players are training twice a day, sometimes three times a day.“We have got to try to make sure the conditions are right for them.“Last season was a bit more dficult to get the work into them.“The weather is a bit more normal this year as it is pleasant.“The facilities in Cork are terric.“We have everything we need and catered for within the working week.“There are also two pitches of a very high standard, which is very important when you are trying to do as much pitch work as possible.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/06/F1-Singapore_18-19_COMP_03.jpg ","title":"f1 2019 review formula one has never looked so good","story":"The latest in official Formula One game is here, so grab your helmets, and jump in.As you#d expect from developers with such pedigree the sport has been treated with all the love, care and attention it deserves.Aside from the expected roster and car updates, F #s visuals have been upgraded massively compared to last year # and that was a beautul game in its own right.The biggest changes are the revamped lighting effects, which are most obvious during the night races in Singapore and Bahrain, and the new new rain effects, making the notoriously tricky conditions all the more pleasing to the eye when you spin off at mph.Jumping into the career mode will see you first racing in Formula , the feeder series were so many of the sport#s big names have cut their teeth.Acting almost like a tutorial these first few races will show you the ropes, introduce you to career rivals in Lukas Weber and Devon Butler, and influence the teams available to you when you do progress into the big leagues.After the season ending race you will be given the chance to pick from available contracts in Formula One # each team with their own season expectations and perks to contend with. vw, px\"  This relationship with your new team is affected by everything you do on the track, as well as your interactions with the press.

A new wave of drivers will also move in to challenge the dominance of the likes of Hamilton and Vettel over the games  seasons.Each of the F cars have their own little quirks, some like the Ferrari#s have pure straight line speed, others, like the Mercedes feel a little more composed in the corners.Moving into the classic cars you can really feel the raw untamed power these vehicles had, they all feel more twitchy, more out of control and really push you to the limits # as they did the drivers at the time.Each car can be tailored as much or as little to your personal style and the inidual track your racing on to maximise your lap time. vw, px\"  That said, hitting holding your nerve through a high speed corner as the force feedback tells really makes you feel how close to the edge you are, does feel fantastic.As you#d expect from Codemasters # F  is a simulation racer. Realism is key. However, tweaking the assists will allow the game to give you a bit of a helping hand with things like gear changes, brakes and traction control, while a D racing line with braking points can be displayed on the track as you get used to the controls.As you gradually turn these off with increasing confidence you#ll really start to get the most of this fantastic game.For those out there that like the challenge of a real person, the multiplayer mode has also had a bit of TLC.Improvements to matchmaking and the penalty system should make sure you get fairer races, against players that won#t shove you off the road and slam into you at corner # unless that#s what you#re after!The league system and weekend championships also bring a competitive edge to proceedings, and for esports fans it#s also easier than ever to follow the digital racing series.F  is pushing the current generation of consoles to their limits and the developers have done an incredible job of improving on last year#s already fantastic offering.With some yearly games there can be temptation to skip a year, butthere#s every going to be a Formula One game you need to pick up # this is the one. vw, px\"  Using the replayto check out your own performance really allows you to take the time to focus on the beautul attention to detail that has gone into recreating the world#s most iconic tracks.Combined with the tweaks to the cars themselves, which make them feel more realistic than ever before, this really is a must-own game for F fans and racing fans in general."},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/06/5d15af676e4f71.47568359.jpg ","title":"aberdeen community groups take part in 24 hour litter pick","story":"Residents young and old turned out to take part in a -hour litter pick across Aberdeen.Groups, schools, and organisations were cleaning up their area as part of the Aberdeen City Council-organised event.It saw  community litter picks over  hours, starting at midnight.It began with the council’s environmental services team near the River Dee, followed by the other groups every hour.During last year’s event,  black bags of rubbish were collected, along with larger items including a car bonnet, a doocot, a satellite dish, vacuum cleaner and four shopping trolleys.Other groups taking part this year included Friends of Walker Dam, the council’s countryside rangers and tree team, Friends of Seaton Park and Brighter Bucksburn.Sheila Gordon, chairwoman of Friends of Seaton Park, said: “It’s about the efforts to keep our city clean.

The UK-wide picture is very dferent, with the construction SME sector overall contracting for the first time in six years.Scotland’s good fortune could be due to fewer EU workers being based north of the border compared with other parts of the country, like in London where one in three construction workers are from the EU.Relying less heavily on migrant workers has meant the Scottish construction industry hasn’t fallen foul of thousands of EU workers ing home during the long march to Brexit due to no longer feeling welcome in the UK or sure of their future here.Scotland’s builders, however, must not be complacent. Looking ahead, the First Minister has indicated thatthe UK does leave the EU later this year, she wants a second independence referendum before the next Scottish Parliament election in . This additional political uncertainty, on top of the continued uncertainty stemming from Brexit, could impact on the construction sector in Scotland.The fear is a looming second referendum could test consumer confidence this year and next. For construction SMEs, this is particularly concerning as their prospects are vulnerable to dips in consumer confidence as so much work comes from the private domestic sector.Gordon Nelson, Director of FMB Scotland.Sir,I was joined by my fellow Conservative councillors in Kilmory recently as we discussed atthe numerous challenges facing Argyll and Bute.Ferry sailings, roads, education and the SNP#s late single farm payments were all mentioned.With the SNP hammering local authority spending and cutting our budgets, challenges in delivering services will become more prevalent.Despite this climate of cuts from the separatists, Conservative councillors are delivering for Argyll. This includes extra funding for the Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund, more funding for infrastructure and an increase in roads winter maintenance resources across Argyll.As ever, my fellow Conservatives and I will continue to fight non stop to make sure our rural constituency is not sidelined by this unceasingly urban and separatism-obsessed over centralising Scottish Government.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and Islands ward.Sir,I photographed this unusual visitor to Kilduskland Road, Ardrishaig, on April .

There will also be opportunities for farming and we must ensure that we make the most of these opportunities to build a forward-looking, progressive and resilient sector that benefits farmers and consumers throughout the UK.We would like to invite all UK MEPs on to farms in their local areas to discuss a range of priority issues and to answer any questions that they might have.

These should ensure everyone receives #joined up# care, that they are asked how they are feeling as part of every diabetes appointment and that a mental health professional with knowledge of diabetes is part of every diabetes care team.To sign our petition, go to diabetes.org.uk missingAngela Mitchell, National Director of Diabetes Scotland.Sir,I#m asking residents in the Highlands and Islands to give their views on Conservative proposals for tackling serious crime.In order to provide Scotland with an alternative to Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP in , we are keen to gain feedback from as many people to our policy proposals to make them as relevant as possible to the needs and aspirations of everyone in Scotland.Too many people in Scotland are affected by the behaviour of serious criminals. This needs to be properly addressed and my colleague Liam Kerr MSP, shadow Justice Secretary, has outlined key policy proposals in a member#s bill in the Scottish Parliament to tackle this scourge.It would give Scottish judges the power to impose whole le sentences to those convicted of the most serious violent and sexual crimes including the murder of a police officer.The courts would still have discretion to impose the appropriate sentence based on all the facts of each case, as they do in England and Wales where such a provision already exists.The proposed Whole Le CustodyBill will not mean the perpetrators of a particular crime will always receive a whole le sentence, but rather that the courts will have the power to impose one where there is sufficient justication.We have started the consultation and experts and members of the public are invited to register their views.Email me at donald.cameron.msp@parliament.scot or write to me at Donald Cameron MSP,  George Street, Oban, PA NT, with your views.MSP Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands.Sir,The SNP has warned Scotland’s NHS is under threat from a Tory-Trump trade deal that could leave the Scottish Government without a veto over a post-Brexit deal that sells Scotland out.This stark warning follows the revelations from Donald Trump that in terms of trade deals, everything, including the NHS, would be on the table.At Prime Ministers Questions, SNP Deputy Westminster Leader Kirsty Blackman MP said Donald Trump and the Tories could not be trusted on the NHS and criticised the UK government for plotting to take powers away from the Scottish Parliament that would allow it to safeguard Scotland’s NHS.The threats to Scotland#s NHS are growing under the prospect of a hard-right Tory-Trump Brexit trade deal. Those threats could undermine the integrity and independence of our Scottish NHS.The UK Tories will block any potential veto by the Scottish Government over such a damaging deal.The SNP government will fight to the end to defend Scotland#s public services from this unprecedented Tory Brexit danger. Our NHS must remain in public hands. It is not, and should never be, up for sale.Scotland has been completely ignored throughout the Brexit process and Tory plans to grab powers from the Scottish Parliament will leave us even more exposed.It is clearer than ever that the only way to properly protect Scotland#s interests, and keep our NHS in public hands, is with the full powers of independence.MP Brendan O#Hara, Argyll and Bute."},{"url":null,"title":"monsters and magic come to lochgilphead booksigning","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead#s Argyll Book Centre is holding a book signing with Lari Don.The Secret of the Kelpie author will be in the indie book shop on Saturday June  to read her new book to eager ears and talk to readers about their favourite folk tales and inventing monsters.After a quick break, Lari willto read excerpts from her spellbinding Spellchasers trilogy to inspire you to imagine magical adventures of your own and tell one of your favourite myths.Born in Chile, Lari Don was brought up in Scotland where she has worked in politics and for the BBC.

regions first Premier Inn.And now that developers have dropped controversial proposals to include a new supermarket, the plans are being given the thumbs up from David Parker.Mr Parker, who represents Leaderdale and Melrose at the local authority, told us: \"I am pleased that Newland Assets have listened carefully to the representations they have received concerning the Borders Gateway proposals.\"A Class  food retail store was very much against local and national planning policy for the site in Tweedbank as it introduced out of town shopping but the developer has listened carefully to ious concerns on this issue and removed it.ldquoThe new proposals have taken on board many observations made so far during the planning process and the revised plans are better in terms of design, road layout and visual impact.\"I am very excited about the economic impact this development could have on the wider Borders economy.ldquoSecuring a Premier Inn for the Scottish Borders will help put our region firmly on the tourism map and the economic impact of Premier Inn and the potential for other investors to follow them, is something which must be grasped.ldquoThe revised Borders Gateway proposals will complement the work taking place to develop the Tweedbank Innovation Park and will sit comfortably alongside the public and private sector projects which are underway at Tweedbank at present.\"The pound million Borders Gateway development also includes a BP filling station, a Costa drive-thru coffee shop, and a MS kiosk.And it is expected that the new outlets will create up to  jobs.Although the wider vision of the development had been welcomed, the supermarket part of the plans had come in for criticism.And Newland Assets revised their plans to omit the supermarket earlier this year.Councillor Parker added: ldquoBorders Gateway has the overwhelming support of the public and many businesses in the area and now that the food retail plans have been dropped there is no reason why these proposals should not be fully endorsed by the planners and backed by Scottish Borders Council.\"The economic advantages of this proposal signicantly outweigh the very small number of policy considerations which are left.ldquoAlthough it was right for the planners to raise concerns about the previous proposal, now that the developer has listened carefully to all the objections and amended the plans accordingly to deal with them, the Borders public simply wonrsquot understand why the council isnrsquot backing this ambitious inward investment opportunity.\"It will help bring new jobs and secure existing jobs and undoubtedly lead to a tourism boost in the Scottish Borders.ldquoI look forward to this development receiving approval and work commencing on

The day after the crash, Superintendent Jim Guy of Strathclyde Police said there had been no evidence from the crew of any problems before the tragedy.He said the evidence available suggested an accident rather than terrorist attack. The scene of the crash was sealed off almost immediately and an air exclusion zone was imposed.Although most of the wreckage was left for accident investigators to examine, it is understood Royal Ulster Constabulary Special Branch officers removed boxes and cases containing secret papers on Friday morning.On Saturday,  personnel from RAF Machrihanish were drafted in to help find and catalogue debris from the crash.FIFTY YEARS AGOKintyre could be surfers# MeccaKintyre could become the major centre in Britain for surfingthe enthusiasm of two young men gets the encouragement it deserves.One of them, George Raynes, of Bishopbriggs in Lanarkshire, is secretary of the Scottish Surf Club, and with his treasurer, James Short of Glasgow, has just completed a preliminary survey of several of the Kintyre beaches with a view to exploiting them for the sport of surfing.George has surfed on beaches all over Britain and also in the Channel Isles and in Europe and he thinks that the beaches at Machrihanish and Southend could become the Mecca for British surfers and the venue for the British Championships.He was particularly impressed with the waves at Machrihanish but thinks Southend has great potential as well.He told the Courier: #The possibilities here are tremendous. These beaches are essentially accessible from the central belt of Scotland, in fact from all over Britain when one considers the air service, and the weather records show that there is plenty of sunshine and the water is warm compared to the waters off the east coast of England, for example.#In fact, I#ve been told that Kintyre topped the sunshine league in Britain last year.#The water is so warm, comparatively speaking, that the sport could become an all-year-round activity in this area. In the winter one would have to wear a wetsuit, of course, but the conditions are ideal and the wave forms have great potential # after all, they are coming straight in from the Atlantic over the north of Ireland.#What I#d like to see is a surf club established in Campbeltown. It could become a great asset from a tourist and amenity point of view.#And any Kintyre people who really took up the sport would have a great advantage over other surfers when it comes to competition because they have the benefit of readily available beaches all year round.#If this club gets going, the chances are that the British surf champions in the years to come will be Kintyre people.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOOrr Ewing CupFootballers were favoured with beautul weather last Saturday and the games played on Kinloch Park in the Orr Ewing Cup competition brought together very large gatherings of spectators.The match in the afternoon was brought to a sudden termination by an unfortunate dispute over the award of a goal. The opposing teams were Kintyre and HMS Thames.Kintyre opened strongly and after  minutes# play had scored twice. The dispute arose over the award of the second goal, which Thames claimed to be offside.The referee, Mr Duncan McCallum, an old Hearts player, was of a dferent opinion, and on his allowing Kintyre the goal, the naval team without more do walked off the field.It is understood that the Thames team intimated to the league at the weekly meeting on Monday night their withdrawal from the competition.The teams were: Kintyre # Jas McKinlay: James Black and Archd Sharp: M Muir, A McCrank and T Cameron: R McGeachy and D Brown: Dan McNaughton: N Scally and J Donaldson.HMS Thames # Meese: Jesseman and Love: McCloud, Hirst and Fernie: Dunnell and Weekes: McGeachy: Slynn and Segrott.Referee # Mr D McCallum.In the evening, the opposing teams were Campbeltown and Kilbrannan. A week previously Kilbrannan had inflicted a - win over a naval team: against Campbeltown on Saturday they found the tables turned on themselves, and with the same score repeated they had to suffer the chagrin of a five-goal margin.It was hard game, but high scoring seldom adds to the vim or interest of any match and so it was here.Campbeltown from the kick-off may be fairly said to have had the measure of their opponents, but while they were the better , on play there was nothing like a - goal margin between the teams.Campbeltown owed their comfortable lead mainly to the masterly play of their centre forward, Archd O#May. This young footballer was home on furlough from the Rhine Army, and his display was undoubtedly the feature of the game. He is a fearless player with a rare turn of speed and a most deadly shot.At least three of six goals came from his foot, and were beautully taken, while he was the means of a fourth which he gave the right wing the honour of finishing.Kilbrannan#s solitary goal was well taken by Brown after a clever break through and an inidual run.Kilbrannan has material for the making of a team that should get much better results than they have so far achieved.The players are keen and inidually have a lot of football in them, but an almost entire absence of method both in attack and defence spoils their chances.The teams were: Campbeltown # A McCallum: G Quigley and Chas McKinven: D Kelly, J McDonald and John Martin: Chas Black and Arch Black: Arch O#May: W McKillop and James Martin.Kilbrannan # John McIntyre: D Bannatyne and Wm Gilchrist: J Short, N McKenzie and James Boyce: D Gilchrist and M Brodie: C Kelly: D Mathieson and J Brown.Referee # Mr W Mustarde."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week june 7 2019","story":"As I retreat into the comfort of a warm house and an even warmer coffee, I wonder what it must have been like for Columba and his fellow monks as they made their way from the shores of Ireland to the wilds of Argyll.The fragile shell of a coracle was not the most effective shelter against the wildness of our coastline.Yet they came.

There are several factors influencing this, but the major factor which has tipped the balance is the extended funding hours and the negative impact this is having both financially on small businesses, like Mary Poppins, and to the quality of early learning and childcare.New Scottish Government policy instructs councils to increase their funded childcare hours from  to , by . This move also includes longer opening hours and a move from term time to year-round opening hours to attempt to make childcare more nationally accessible.Ms Dewar said: ldquoThe money received for funded places does not cover the costs of providing the quality of early learning and childcare which we want and are required to provide, especially with regards to staff costs.ldquoThe timescales and measures that the Scottish Government has put in place to educate a workforce to meet the increased requirements are insufficient, and there is a serious shortfall to meet the requirements of the extended funding.ldquoEast Lothian Council indicated it estimated it would require approximately  staff to facilitate the increase in funded hours in East Lothian. The majority of these posts are early learning and childcare practitioners.ldquoThe local authority advertises early learning practitioner posts at between pound. and pound. per hour. Private nurseries are unable to compete with these rates of pay due to the funding rates we are allocated.A group of parents and staff, including Ms Dewar, are visiting county MSP Iain Gray to discuss the problems, but Ms Dewar added that unless he can ldquowork a miracle and change the policy, then it is unlikely the decision to close the nursery will be reversed.When asked about the nursery, Mr Gray said: ldquoThe loss of any nursery provision is disappointing, particularly with the Governmentrsquos , funded hours policy set to be implemented next year.ldquoIn the case of the Mary Poppins Nursery, the owner has highlighted a number of factors that have contributed to their decision to close.ldquoI have written to East Lothian Council about some of these issues.ldquoHowever, there are also wider issues at play here. The nursery sector has been warning the Scottish Government that private nurseries are struggling in the run-up to the roll-out of its flagship , policy from August .ldquoMinisters must act quickly to address the sectorrsquos concerns and ensure that the capacity exists to deliver the funded hours next year.A Scottish Government spokesperson said: ldquoIt is, of course, concerning to hear of any nursery considering closure, and the obvious effects this might have on staff, parents and children.ldquoEast Lothian Council has provided assurance that they will support families to find alternative early learning and childcare places for children who had been expecting to use the Mary Poppins Nursery from this August.Ms Dewar added: ldquoI am distraught that circumstances have forced me to this decision and that such a wonderful place for children to experience their early years is to close.The decision was met with an outpouring of grief on social media.The nurseryrsquos recent th birthday was marked with a garden party.The nursery was founded by Sue Armstrong, affectionately still called lsquoMiss Suersquo, after she had written to Mary Poppins author P L Travers to askshe could use the name.Miss Sue said: ldquoI received many letters from P L Travers about the nursery.ldquoAt the beginning, she wanted to know what the nursery was going to be like. She had no objection to me using the name, she just wanted to find out more. I ended up meeting her as well.ldquoWe were hoping to get her to come and open the nursery  years ago, but her arthritis was bad. We stayed in touch, however. I would send her letters about how the nursery was getting on along with photos, and she would write back saying how she liked it, and ideas of what to do.ldquoShe said that the children should be encouraged to make up their own stories. lsquoChildren like doing that,rsquo she said.Miss Sue sold the nursery to Ms Dewar in  as she was ldquosick of all the paperwork.She said. ldquoWhen I heard it was to close down, well, itrsquos just all so sad really.

Five minutes in a car can cover a distance which would represent a fairly long walk.Itrsquos kind of a simple principle, I know, but one I sometimes forget, as I did a couple of weekends ago. We set off from an event at Amisfield Walled Garden for a walk. My idea was to walk along the River Tyne to Hailes Castle and thenndash by car a -minute round trip.We had some supplies in the form of fruit in my bag and a little water. It was a sunny and warm day and so we set off on our adventure.We began the walk at the old Abbey Bridge which spans the Tyne close to Amisfield. As you walk under its ancient ribbed arches of this late medieval bridge, you get a real sense of its age and the beauty of its construction.The path beyond follows the river and it is almost impossible now to imagine that a great abbey once stood here, with connections to the infant Mary Queen of Scots. A ruined old mill of later centuries still stands here. I reflected on the stories of this location: a courageous nun who defied a flood in the th century and a gruesome murder in the th century and just visible in the near distance the old graveyard, now ringed with trees and almost unrecognisable as a resting place for the dead.A labourer once thought he saw a ghost at the graveyard, but it proved to be something , and I had a wry smile at that tale of a drunken evening over  years ago. These are all tales I have already told here, but they entered my head as we wandered to the gate that led along the northern bank of the river.Hailes Castle is on the southern bank of the river and I knew that there was a bridge that would takes us over. So we set off to find the bridge.But it took us over four hours.It was a stunning walk, with wild flowers and trees decorating the riverbank almost all the way. A grey heron seemed to follow us perhaps he was warning us that the walk was longer than Irsquod anticipated.It is a walk decorated with history too, of course. A stone in the corner of the field by the first gate caught my eye. Deeply ingrained groove marks on it intrigued me. I was later told that it could be the marks of a plough, as the tips of the plough have scraped over the stone a ploughman unwittingly leaving evidence of his unrecorded toil.Halfway along the walk we arrived at the small hamlet of Sandyrsquos Mill. The cottages and mill itself have been beautully restored. The th-century mill still has its waterwheel, although itrsquos now embedded in silt. The mill ceased working  years ago and was transformed into a residential property, but with much of the old machinery inside still intact. It appears to be a very sympathetic and sensitive restoration.It was beyond Sandyrsquos Mill that the distance began to take its toll. The young kids were tired and desperately looking for the bridge. I spotted Traprain Law some distance away and realised that I had badly misjudged the distance and time it would take with wee ones. We had to sit and have a rest and story, with that grey heron listening, to gather the energy to continue.The kids didnrsquot complain much as we wandered along the still-beautul path, now desperately looking for the bridge. As we had rested wersquod phoned for friends to come and lsquorescuersquo us at Hailes Castle with chocolate and water, and we knew they were there waiting for us.Irsquove never been quite so pleased to see Hailes Castle. It loomed suddenly from across the river. I had never approached it from this direction and it certainly did its best to impress. The bridge was just a wee way further and we finally crossed it with a sense of relief.When we arrived at the castle, the kids devoured the chocolate and water, in a way that reminded me of a scene in the movie Ice Cold in Alex. Thank goodness for good friends.Wersquod made it and what a sense of adventure ndash and an achievement!I sat with the kids and told stories as my we went with the friends to retrieve our car. Hailes Castle drips with history but they wanted tales about giants.The day was a lesson for me: to think more carefully about distance when setting on a walk! I thoroughly recommend the path, especially on a lovely summerrsquos day. But itrsquos going to take half a dayyou have kids. So prepare for that!Unbelievably, the kids later wanted to go to a playpark. ldquoWhere do they get the energy  my we asked.ldquoFrom us! I replied!"},{"url":null,"title":"hopes-of-seeing-railway-station-return-to-haddington","story":"RAGESmet with Peter Brett Associates ndash a leading consultancy of engineers and planners ndash to outline the case for improved transports links to and from East Lothian.One of the more ambitious plans was to see theof a railway station to Haddington.Residents of the town have not been served by a railway station since , with the station closing to freight nearly  years later.However, RAGES feels there could still be a possibility of a station ing to the town ndash though the group acknowledged that work needed to be done.A spokesman for the group said: ldquoRAGES expressed its preference for re-opening of the Haddington branch, ideally to the previous terminus on Station Road.ldquoMinimal compulsory purchase relocation of existing industrial units would be required the biggest physical obstacle would be the reconstruction of the A overbridge which was unwisely built without preserving the railway alignment and loading gauge.ldquoA level crossing would be required at Gateside, failing which an alternative road access could be provided for the new houses on the north side of the line onto the A.There was also a suggestion of creating car parking and even a park and ride facility in the town to serve the new service, which would link the town with Edinburgh.The spokesman added: ldquoAs insufficient parking exists at Station Road , a park and ride station at Oak Tree would be essential, which could also serve the substantial Letham Mains and Gateside developments.ldquoJust east of where the A crosses the railway formation, there is a large rectangular piece of ground, occupied only by scrub, which would be suitable as a car park.ldquoAs only single track would suffice between Longniddry and Haddington, it would be possible to retain a footpath cycleway as the line was originally provided with double track throughout.ldquoAn electric train service from Haddington to Edinburgh would provide the speed and capacity which road transport ndash car or bus ndash cannot match.

It is better than some human beings are treated ndash that is the sad truth.Mr Farnsworth was presenting an annual report on the racecoursersquos performance over the last financial year.The Beast from the East snow storm, an outbreak of equine influenza, and a long spell of dry weather all contributed to what he described as one of the worst years the course had been through in his memory.A number of key fixtures were cancelled and profits fell.In December, four horses died during one day of racing at the course but a subsequent review by the British Horseracing Authority ruled that the course and race organisers were not at fault.Councillor Gordon Mackett asked Mr Farnsworththe racecourse had been affected by animal welfare concerns.The course manager said: ldquoWe did have a horrible day when there were four fatalities however, these were all completely separate incidents.ldquoIn a sport like this you will get injuries and fatalities from time to time. It is horric for the people involved.Mr Farnsworth said that the public were becoming more aware of incidents like these through social media which, he said, ldquofuelled the debate around animal welfare.However, he said there had been no indication that it had had an impact on events at Musselburgh, which saw record crowds at its Easter Day racing this year and another sell-out Ladies Day.His report to the committee revealed that the racecourse had reported a loss over the last financial year after it paid over pound, of legal costs relating to the ongoing process by East Lothian Council to find new third-party operators to run the course.Councillor Kenny McLeod questioned why the costs were being met by the course and not the council itself.However, depute chief executive of the council Alex McCrorie told the councillor that the costs were charged to the racecourse because when the new operator was procured it would be the racecourse that benefitted.He conceded to Mr McLeod that, without the legal costs being taken from the coursersquos funds, it would have been in profit last year.East Lothian Council replaced the previous governance committee which oversaw the running of the course with a new committee last year after relations between members of the old committee badly deteriorated and the British Horseracing Authoritythreatening to suspend its racing licence.The new Musselburgh Racing Associated Committeendash which is made up of four elected councillors and two representatives of the racing industry, currently members of Lothians Racing Syndicate ndash has been overseeing the hunt for a new operator.However, the BHA has only granted temporary licences and extensions under the new committee as it continues to monitor its performance.Mr Farnsworth said that the introduction of the new interim committee had caused some problems too. He told the committee: ldquoIt has been dficult attracting sponsorship and corporate hospitality because of the uncertainty however, this seems to be improving."},{"url":null,"title":"preview-3-harbours-festival","story":"Residents and visitors alike can enjoy art galleries, live music events, family afternoons with pebble decorating and ukulele orchestras, open houses, cooking demonstrations and workshops over the course of the festival, which runs from Saturday to next Sunday .The festival, which was started more than  years ago, is going from strength to strength, expanding and becoming more erse, with something for everyone in its programme.For the live music fans out there, there is a chance to see the Tom Fairnie Band play their famous Americana music supported by Paul Brown, then Andy Brown, Dropkick and Fuzzystar for the Indie lovers, Alex Hodgson and Rhys Heaven for the folk fans, and to get an eclectic mix all in one sitting, there are the Live on the Lawn sessions, an afternoon of music in the majestic Cockenzie House and Gardens .To keep the young ones and old ones entertained all at once, this year will see a Harbour Family Afternoon added to the programme.

Itrsquos a testament to the continued interest in local heritage and tradition that it is as relevant in  as it was two centuries ago.Now in its th year, the annual Haddington Show will open its gates on Saturday to the crowds and showcase the finest producers, breeders and vendors from East Lothian.The show is a signicant event within the area, with traditional displays of animals, produce and crafts but also offering entertainment and attractions that appeal to contemporary audiences.Of course there is always the lsquoBest in Breedrsquo awards, where competition is fierce but friendly between cattle and sheep breeders, and judging is a serious affair.There are about  horse classes, from veteran riders to the horse and rider fancy dress. The number of entrants reflect the unmistakable popularity of equestrian pursuits within East Lothian.And for those who prefer more craft-based endeavours, there are numerous prizes for the craft schedules, including floristry, baking, stick dressing, photography and jam-making.

It is, of course, incumbent on colleges to make sure that they can staff courses properly.Mr Harvie said many of the teachers were on the brink of moving to permanent contracts.Urging Ms Sturgeon to review the use of casual contracts by colleges, he said: ldquoThis is a cynical move by the college management, and it will prevent those lecturers from achieving their two yearsrsquo service and put courses at risk.

Licia graduated with a honours degree in interior design, also winning the IDDA National Interior Design award. This led to her being asked to design a kitchen for the House and Garden Fair in London by the IDDA, the Interior Decorators and Design Association.ldquoThat was the beginning of specialising in kitchens rather than going into a broader commercial interior design practice, says Licia.Her career, initially working with showrooms such as CP Hart has coincided with our interior preferences changing to a more open-plan style of living, so designing kitchens requires an approach that combines practicality with a much higher level of aesthetics.Licia previously worked as Business Development Manager for Poggenpohl, falling in love with the high end brand which led to her selecting Poggenpohl for her own studio.Bauen Design opened in January of this year. ldquoIve always worked in the luxury high-end kitchen market and decided to work exclusively with Poggenpohl because I knew the product so well, says Licia. ldquoAlso, Poggenpohlhadnt been in Glasgow for quite a while. They were delighted to partner with me and then I found this great showroom on Hyndland Road, which is the perfect location.ldquoWe are the only dealer in the UK who exclusively sell Poggenpohl. Most will also have a mid-range German company, or a more traditional offering but I decided the best thing to do was to concentrate exclusively on Poggenpohl.There is no doubt that a Poggenpohl kitchen is a substantial investment, but when a customer interacts with its clever design and sees the quality of the product up close, they understand just how dferent it is to standard kitchen.ldquoIrsquom delighted with the showroom. Itrsquos a great space to show the ranges and a lovely place for clientss to spend time while we explain the whole service we can offer them.Not only can Bauen Design offer the complete interior design service, helping to select flooring, furniture and colours, it can arrange the entire build process.ldquoIn the majority of projects we work on, we take out the existing kitchen, take walls down, prepare walls for the new kitchen, lay flooring.ldquoWe are also careful about the tradesmen we select. We know this kind of project can be stressful for a homeowner so even just to have a tradesman who has a smile on his face can make a massive dference.Licia adds that most clients are happy to shut the door on the kitchen, walk away, leave it in Bauenrsquos capable hands and come back to the completed transformation.ldquoWeve done so much with the showroom and paid so much attention to detail that I think the clients can tell that we work to incredibly high standards, adds Licia.ldquoIts also important to let the client see something thatrsquos as close as possible to the finished room. Hollie, who works with us, puts together amazing photographic-style D renders of how it will look in the clients own property. Were taking that to the next level.With so much experience in dealing with customers making that substantial investment, Licia and the team at Bauen know that personal service is absolutely vital.ldquoClients need to trust us and be comfortable working with us. This should be a process to enjoy rather than be worried about. Itrsquos all down to experience and working with the very best product on the market.

It provides a superb vertical foil to the horizontal expanse of the beautul little town, or Royal Burgh of Inveraray. From the top of the tower, the views can be magnicent, sweeping from the Arrochar Alps, Beinn Ime and the Cobbler above the head of the loch, down to the Firth of Clyde and the western hills of Kintyre. From above, the shape of the geological pressures that created Scotland are laid out impressively. At the foot of the Tower, lies the th century planned Royal Burgh.Climb the Tower , look around, and down. On the way up, visit the bells themselves, fitted like a jig-saw into the space, and see the video display of the bells ringing - an almost frightening sight! On the ground floor is an exhibition of Argyll in the First World War.The Tower has a poignant history. It was conceived and built by the th Duke of Argyll, Duke Niall Diarmid, as a memorial to the dead of the First World War, in particular to the Campbells and the ldquomen of my lands. It was an act of personal piety. Ten bells were commissioned from John Taylor and Company of Loughborough. The ten were cast as a single perfectly matched suite. The Scottish Association of Change-Ringers keeps them perfectly timed, and as the second heaviest set of  bells in the UK, they are known and visited by campanologists from around the world, particularly at the bell-ringing festival . Bells traditionally have names, and these bells are named for the ancient Celtic saints who inhabited the boundaries of the Dukersquos possessions: Moluag, Columba, Mund, Brendan, Maelrubha, Blaan, Murdouch, Brigid, Molaise, and Our LadyStella Maris.The Bells were cast in . First they had to reach Inveraray. The first lorry carrying them broke down in Lancashire. Then the second lorry proved unable to climb the Rest and Be Thankful - like so many other visitors before and after. Two bells and the frame had to be dumped and rescued the next day.Then the Tower had to be built. The Duke taxed all his friends and visitors for money. The facing stone came from the quarry in Furnace during winters, the Duke himself collected rubble in his wheel-barrow for the interior of the fabric. The tower was begun in , and finished  years later in , and the bells hung. The cost was just over pound,, approximately pound million in todayrsquos money. The bells could be heard in St Catherinersquos, across the loch.Before long, the tower was struck by lightning, and with the Second World War, ringing ceased. The Tower became almost ruinous. After the war, Lady Glenkinglas founded the Friends of Inveraray Bell-Tower, and gradually restored the Tower to safety, from where the bells ring proudly today during the summer months for visiting bands.The House of Argyll traditionally belonged to the Presbyterian party, with its strong links to the Hanoverian monarchy. In the s the then Duke married an Anglican Duchess, and built the church of All Saints for the Scottish Episcopal Church. Duke Niall Diarmidrsquos spiritual le was centred here, and the holy stillness of the church reflects that tradition. In his spiritual testament, he asked for prayers each All Soulsrsquo Day for ldquoall who died in the War. A local resident who remembers him avers: lsquoFor Duke Niall, that would have included the Germansrsquo. A poignant place indeed!Visit the websiteto find out more.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The Royal an LochanLocated in Tighnabruaich in Argyll, The Royal an Lochan Hotel boasts stunning views of Kyles of Bute.

Edinburgh was full of colour and noise, and there was a real sense of hope and expectation. Donald Dewar’s speech in the parliament’s first chamber was one of those moments where the hair stood up on the back of your neck. In my view – as someone in a dferent party to Donald, with very dferent views on the ultimate destination for Scotland – that speech was one of the finest speeches in modern Scottish history.How much of a privilege is it to run the country and how dficult is the top job There’s no doubt that being First Minister of Scotland has been the privilege of my le.

And like many people in senior positions, particularly women, I have had moments of self-doubt but I believe it’s important to be open about that and to be a role model to young people. But more than anything, I am grateful to have the opportunity to help make Scotland a better place to live.What is the Parliament’s biggest achievement in the last  years  Twenty years on there are so many achievements that we can be proud of, and that have made Scotland a better place to live, work, study and grow up in. From free personal care to the abolition of tuition fees, the ban on smoking in public places, a minimum pricing for alcohol and the introduction of equal marriage. There’s a long, long list of these inidual policies that wouldn’t have happenedwe hadn’t had a Scottish Parliament.Across the world there are other countries now looking to Scotland to learn from the globally ground-breaking things we’ve done on public health, on tackling climate change, and on the work we’re doing around renewable energy.But above any inidual policy, there is a much more fundamental achievement, and that is that,  years on, the parliament has reinvigorated Scottish democracy and become an accepted, established part of Scottish le. We should all take great pride in that.What has been the most dficult challenge the Parliament has faced and you personally The sad and unexpected death in  of Donald Dewar – the man who had driven through the Scotland Act and then become the first First Minister – was no doubt a moment of great uncertainty for all MSPs in the early days of the Parliament.On a personal level, I’d have to say assuming the office of First Minister was my biggest challenge. Despite having spent  years in frontline politics, and seven as Deputy First Minister, nothing can prepare you for the moment where suddenly you are the last word, where there is no longer anyone above you to seek a second opinion on somethingyou want it – everyone is looking to you.What is your most memorable moment There have been many memorable moments. The passage of the Equal Marriage Act and the Minimum Pricing legislation are two key ones for me. I also think the referendum campaign has to be one of them. It not only saw Parliament at its best – with robust debates and intense scrutiny – but also sparked an enormous outpouring of democratic engagement across the country. Although the result didn’t go the way I wanted, the legacy of a more politically involved country is one we should all cherish.I have a lot of memorable moments. It’s not the famous names or the big events, but the stories I hear from iniduals around the country that inspire me. I’ve spent a lot of time lately listening to the le experiences of Scotland’s care experienced young people. Their stories will stay with me forever and drive me to improve their lives and opportunities.In  years’ time, how do you hope the Parliament will have evolved It should evolve in line with the way people in Scotland want it to. The Parliament was established in large part because of the democratic deficit that opened up during  years of a Tory government which became more and more unpopular in Scotland. Despite devolution, Brexit in particular has demonstrated that Westminster is willing to ignore the views of people in Scotland and disregard votes of the Parliament. I have absolutely no doubt that by  we will have completed the powers of the Parliament and become an independent country. That means we will have established a genuine partnership of equals with the rest of the UK and will have ensured that people in Scotland always get the governments they vote for.Are there any people you would like to thank We should never ever forget those who campaigned for decades to see a Scottish Parliament – many of whom never lived to see it become a reality.Then there are those who have worked tirelessly behind the scenes. We couldn’t do our job without the work of the parliament staff, led by the Parliament’s chief executive, Sir Paul Grice, who recently announced he was moving on to a new job after  years. He might not be well-known by the wider public but, as someone who was there from the very beginning, all MSPs and staff owe him an enormous debt of gratitude.For me personally, I certainly would not be where I am today without the support of my mum and dad and my husband Peter.Everyone is invited to join the partySaturday, June ,  is gearing up to be a great day.From am to noon, the Queen will address Parliament and each of the party leaders will speak in response. The audience will include those young people who were born in  as well as finalists from a competition for student film-makers who produced a short film on the impact the Scottish Parliament has had in their area. There will also be a number of performances celebrating the best of Scotland’s culture and music and the Makar will perform a new piece of work.In the afternoon, the Parliament will open its doors for a day of celebration – a party everyone is invited to join from pm to pm.There will be a chance to sit in the Presiding Officer’s seat and see how it feels to take charge, as well as retro games like giant Jenga, Kerplunk and space hoppers.

First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: “It will be a great day, full of colour and energy. Parliament always does these events well and brings in so many people from across Scotland. “I hope we spend the day not just looking back on what has been achieved, but focused on the work the parliament still has to do.“The public are often sceptical of politicians, but I hope people across the country will reflect on how far we’ve come with the parliament and the dference it has already made to so many people’s lives.”"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"June ,  at : pmA revised pay offer from HIAL to air traffic control officershas been rejected, with industrial action to restart tomorrow, at six airports including Kirkwall Airport.

This year local Scottish Fire and Rescue team will once again have a fire engine at the clinic to help draw attention to the clinic.Councillor Drever added: #The safety checks are carried out by a specially trained Good Egg Safety expert, not police officers # so people should not feel they are at risk of getting into trouble.“Rather it#s an opportunity to get some reassurance that your car seat is compatible with your vehicle, and to get tips and advice on any adjustments that would improve the car seat’s performance. We#d urge anyone who drives children about # whether that#s childminders, grandparents and parents or wider friends – to drop into the clinic. It is five or ten minutes of your time well spent.”The Good Egg Safety Child Seat clinic will be held in the Tesco car park in Kirkwall on Wednesday July , running from am to pm.

This has been under constant review, some might say attack, since .#Commenting after the Coastguard Agency consultation meeting in Edinburgh yesterday, Thursday, on the future of emergency tug provision in the north of Scotland, Mr Carmichael said: “For the third time in nine years the Maritime Coastguard Agency is again consulting on future provision of emergency tugs and for the third time in nine years it looks like a botched job.“The consultants engaged by the MCA have been set tight and arbitrary deadlines. Today’s meeting in Edinburgh seems to be the last chance for input from outside government. I fully support the call made by Councillor Steven Coutts for an extension of the time for responses. As things stand, even that would have a limited benefit. It would probably only extend a flawed exercise.

They want to hear from the owners of all kinds of properties, from urban studio flats to historic country piles. From Shetland to Stranraer and Orkney to Oban, prime properties from all over Scotland will be in the frame.Jo Street, commissioner for BBC Scotland, said: “We’re delighted to announce a second series of Scotland’s Home of the Year. It isn’t just about showing off million-pound properties – it’s about truly celebrating what people have done to turn their house into a home, expressing their iniduality through their design, flair and imagination. We saw some cracking houses over the course of series one and there are far more gems to uncover for series two.”The first series of Scotland’s Home of the Year was broadcast on the new BBC Scotland channel in April and May this year.The series has since seen its audience continue to grow on iPlayer with requests to view so far hitting more than a quarter of a million – ,.The format saw three judges – architect Michael Angus, interior designer Anna Campbell-Jones and lestyle blogger Kate Spiers – travel theand breadth of Scotland to discover architectural gems and unearth some stunning interiors. Both traditional and contemporary properties were put under the microscope and judges considered everything from a one-bedroom apartment to a centuries-old country castle … and everything in between.Each home was scored on ality, distinctiveness and clever design and from seven finalists, one clear winner of series one was chosen – the White House in Kirkcudbright, Dumfries and Galloway, created by proud owner Lesley Smith and her late husband Mike.Series two will have a slightly longer run than series one with nine -minute heats, each featuring three properties from a specic part of the country. The  houses featured will then be whittled down to a final nine which will go under the spotlight in an hour-long final episode.Gerard Costello, executive producer, IWC Media said: “We are thrilled that Scotland’s Home of the Year is ing to the BBC Scotland channel.

The concern is that, although resurfacing and general maintenance continues to be done, this may not fix the issue in the long-term.OIC has now engaged a specialist team to look at the issue, who#ll be deploying state of the art equipment to take radar readings through the causeway down to sea level, providing valuable information on its deep make-up.This data will then be used to come up with options for short and long-term maintenance of the road, with general inspections and periodic minor repairs continuing until the results of the survey are fully considered.Due to the nature of the work, there will unfortunately be road closures and a convoy system in place on the evening of Monday  July. The work has been scheduled for between .pm and .pm to minimise disruption, by ensuring that traffic from the last Pentland Ferries arrival has passed through. Delays of up to  minutes are possible.The work will begin with coring taking place, which sees four small cylindrical sections of the road removed, analysed and then replaced. This allows the contractors to identy the make-up of the top layers of the road and calibrate their equipment accordingly.The second stage of the work sees a specialist vehicle driven at usual traffic speed across the barrier a number of times, taking video and radar footage as it moves.The third and final stage sees a piece of hand-pushed equipment moved across the barrier at walking speed taking Ground Penetrating Radardata of the full depth of the structure as it goes. The GPR system emits short duration pulses of electromagnetic energy. These pulses or scans are transmitted into the road and reflections from material boundaries or embedded featuresare detected by a receiver. Through analysis of the reflected signals a continuous D model of the Barrier can then be provided, determining material thickness and construction changes.  This should therefore determine what,any, underlying defects there are within the matrix of the causeway. The survey allows data to be taken down to depths of five metres.The video survey will provide a high resolution and spatially referenced video to enable the visual condition of the surface to be assessed to sub-metre accuracy. This will be matched with the GPR survey to produce a visual model to pinpoint anomalies in the surfacing.John Wrigley, OIC roads and environmental services manager said: #As a key element of Orkney#s travel network, we keep a keen eye on the state of this road.#Our ongoing monitoring has shown that the surface continues to deteriorate despite previous interventions — which would suggest that resurfacing is not going to fix the problem in the long-term.#We now need to carry out this important piece of work to seethere could be a more deep-rooted reason for the issues — which should lead us to an appropriate and cost-effective solution.##Previous survey work has given us detailed information on the top layers of the road, but this new survey will look deep into the construction for voids or other potential failures.  We apologise for the delays that this survey will cause on the night of  July # but we#re sure that local road users will understand that this is necessary as part of finding a long term solution to improving the structure of the road.  We#d ask that road users take their time in the vicinity on the night and would also take the opportunity to remind people of the mph advisory speed limit that already exists on the first Barrier.#East Mainland, South Ronaldsay and Burray councillor, Andrew Drever added: “I accept the concerns that have been raised over a period of time, particularly by motorcyclists, and I am pleased to see this piece of work getting underway.#Once we have the survey results, we’ll be able to look at options and hopefully find a way forward in a short a timescale as possible.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The  transitional Challenge Fund will help local goose groups develop business models to generate income from the sale of resident greylag goose meat in the long term.SNH has also said that they and local goose management groups are also exploring other options together, such as more flexible licences when necessary, a review of bag limits in some areas, and egg-oiling.The pilot studies cost about £, over five years to March  and an additional £, to March . SNH is now offering a Challenge Fund of £, to support sustainable management, as well as an additional £, for counts and productivity estimates.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

As the population increases, this will become more relevant in terms of the overall pollution created, and no doubt, something will have to be done. Whether sea based farming of certain foods may reduce the pollution, but much of agriculture is still based on land and the production of meat will still create problems related to greenhouse gases in terms of land used for meat production and or crop production as well.

Lavishly staged by a professional creative team, this stirring Grand Opera House Summer Youth Production is the most ambitious to date, bringing together  of Northern Ireland’s creatives. Supported by a -piece orchestra, the impressive score will feature all the big numbers including I Still Believe, The Movie in my Mind and the iconic The American Dream.-year-old Aquinas pupil Lára Mulgrew will perform the role of Ellen in the stage show. No stranger to the Grand Opera House stage, Lára performed aged nine the role of Molly in their production of Annie. Lára described the audition process “as very straight forward” and how it will be “wonderful” to portray the role of Ellen come July.“I hadn’t seen the production before but was able to watch it on Youtube. It’s going to be a total of six performances and it’s a very mature role,” she said. “It’s definitely the most challenging role I’ve ever had to perform and it will be a great challenge to take on her maturity.”Methody College’s Louis Fitzpatrick will take on the role of American GI John Thomas, part of the battalion deployed in Saigon during the Vietnam War.“I heard about the auditions for Miss Saigon through a friend, I went for one audition and did well enough to get a call back. I was really ecstatic to learn I had got the part as I was performing Footloose at the time as part of the Belfast Youth and Drama Society, I joined in April  and the first production I did was Les Misérables.“I hadn’t watched the stage version before but was able to watch it on Amazon Prime.”The -year-old has just completed his A’levels in Moving Image, Politics and Drama and told the South Belfast News how he hopes to go on to study film at the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland in Glasgow.Grand Opera House Chief Executive Ian Wilson added: “This is the ninth year that the Grand Opera House has staged its Summer Youth Production, and Miss Saigon® School Edition will be the biggest so far. It’s very rare for a theatre the size of the Grand Opera House to be granted the rights to the youth version, so it really is a brilliant opportunity to see the best up-and-coming musical theatre stars in one of the most popular musicals of all time.”For ticket information visit: www.goh"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"how divine mercy is local turning lives around","story":"FOUNDED in , the Divine Mercy group continues to go from strength to strength.Four years on, the group attracts weekly attendances of up to  people every Friday afternoon at Sacred Heart church in Glenview Street.The worship group helps those suffering with suicidalthoughts and addictions, using faith as a form of help.Thomas Stewart, who helped set up the group, explained more about the work the group does.“I set up the group with a friend, who  years ago lost his brother who took his own le through suicide,” he said.“It was a total shock to his family and he felt he needed to do something to help others with similar problems.“We started the Divine Mercy group up in  and it was just three of us. It is a time to reflect on le, listen to beautul songs, and a prayer session is also available afterwards for those who wish to get involved in that.“I think with the issues of addictions with drugs and alcohol becoming more of an issue in North Belfast, the Divine Mercy group offers something dferent to anyone who is seeking help.“Whatever is going on in your own le or your family’s le,your son or daughter is suicidal or has addiction problems, I would encourage you to come along to the Divine Mercy group.“There is help available, which is why people come back. It’s an outlet for people also and a comfort zone for them. The Divine Mercy gives these people hope.“There are young lads coming here who are broken in their lives. The reason we can draw them in is because we are all from dferent backgrounds and we are able to reach out to them.”One of the great successes of the Divine Mercy group has been the regular Cursillo residential weekends in Benburb.The Cursillo runs from a Thursday evening to a Sunday afternoon with participants able to meet people and explore their faith further in a serene and spiritual environment.Hugh Byrne, another key figure in the Divine Mercy group, said the Cursillo is a le-changing experience for those involved.“After three days, they are dferent people. It is truly a le-changing experience and I have seen that with people over the years.”Hugh is also responsible for talking to anyone who comes to the Divine Mercy group in order to offer help and advice.“I sit and have a chat with the lads every week,” he added.“If I get them to listen, that is the start. If we help turn one person’s le around, that is better than none.“I ask them how far they are in their addiction whether it would be alcohol or drugs.“Some people have fallen away but there have been a lot of successes. Relationships and marriages have been fixed and people have turned their lives around.“We also have good links with rehabilitation services and other helplines to point people towards further help.”At last Friday’s meeting, the group were joined by some American visitors who ed to Belfast a year on from experiencing the Divine Mercy group for the first time.Thomas says the success of the group has been extremely encouraging and a sign that they are on the right path.“It was great to see the visitors from the USA who were here last year and wanted to come back over again,” continued.“They are going back to spread the word about the work the group does.“The group can only get better. We started with just three people so we have come a long away in quite a short time.“People are coming back so we must be doing something right.“We have the prayers and so on and then we come out and sit and have tea, coffee and biscuits. It is great to see everyone bonding and talking to each other.“People don’t realise how powerful the Divine Mercy is. It doesn’t matter what is going on in your le. Ask for help and reach out to the Divine Mercy.”The Divine Mercy group meets every Friday at pm at Sacred Heart church in Glenview Street and all are welcome to come along."},{"url":null,"title":"belfast mayor finucane to reach out to unionists by laying somme wreath","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

However, the -page mapping exercise gives an insight into the extent we could be impacted.The scope of areas highlighted is broad and includes everything from health, travel, waterways, animal movement and organised crime and drugs to benefit fraud, schooling, library provision and teacher and doctor qualications.For each of the  sectors, the document species the extent to which it is underpinned by the Good Friday Agreement as well as by existing EU legal and policy frameworks.In the case of the North West Cancer Centre, the report points out that the initiative was based on an intergovernmental agreement between Health Ministers from both jurisdictions.It says the centre at Altnagelvin Area Hospital, which opened in November , \"offers radiotherapy services closer to home for many patients from the north west, reducing their travel time signicantly\".Similarly, the All-Island Congenital Heart Disease Network is identied as ensuring that \"vulnerable children\" receive treatment on the island of Ireland.

Other less obvious areas mentioned in the report include the operation of cross-border taxis repatriation of waste and cross-border movement of waste, and even the management of Lough Erne eel stocks.It also species areas such as invasive alien species, chemicals regulation and wildfire initiatives.DUP MEP Diane Dodds said that in the majority of areas ongoing cross-border cooperation would be addressed by retaining the common travel area and pursuing an agreement on free trade and customs. \"In many cases, where frameworks are highly integrated, the circumstances are not unique to our province,\" she said.\"For instance the conditions required to operate both the Enterprise service between Dublin and Belfast and the Channel Tunnel will require a very similar technical agreement with Brussels. Genuine concerns in areas like agri-food and healthcare must be taken seriously.\"Sinn Fein MP Chris Hazzard said an expert  is not needed to show how disastrous a no-deal Brexit will be. He said: \"The British Government has now convened a  of experts to determine the impact of a no-deal Brexit on the North. \"It neednt have bothered as a range of experts have already given dire warnings of the disastrous impact a no-deal Brexit will have on the Norths economy, our rights and the Good Friday Agreement.\" Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington said the documents were part of \"initial scoping work\" by the Government, supported by the Civil Service here, the European Commission and the Republic.Mr Lidington said they were intended to form the basis of discussion and not final products.

No formal or transparent selection process was used in her selection for appointment nor was she given a written contract of employment, statement of main terms and conditions or job description.During , following several years of signicant growth, the firm decided to consider promotions from associate solicitor grade to salaried partner. Mrs Mercer and two other colleagues were promoted to salaried partner later that year.However, the following year, when she applied for promotion to the role of an equity partner, she was told she did not meet the eligibility criteria. Mrs Mercer did not find out about the promotions of her comparators at the time they took effect on June , , because they had not been announced internally. Instead she learned about them around  through what she described as the \"office rumour mill\". When she enquired about applying for promotion to the next stage, she was informed that there would be no more movement in the firm for the foreseeable future.Mrs Mercer flagged ious issues about her pay during  and  and the fact that promotions were taking place without any formal or transparent selection process.In June  she informed one of firms partners that she wanted to be paid the same salary as her male comparators and to have her bonus calculated on the same terms as theirs. Mrs Mercer was later told that the firm had decided to defer the issue of her salary and bonus until the end of the financial year as part of a wider review of business and salaries. Following this she lodged an internal grievance, seeking equal pay with her comparators on the ground that she was performing like work with them. Her grievance was rejected as the firm was of the view that her work as a salaried partner was \"not as demanding as that of a salaried partner benefiting from a profit share arrangement\". The legal practice accepted that Mrs Mercer was receiving less remuneration than her male colleagues but did not accept that she was undertaking like work with them. It contended that, although she and her male counterparts were all qualied solicitors, there were signicant dferences in the work they and Mrs Mercer were undertaking both in respect of legal work and other responsibilities.In addition, the respondent contended that,Mrs Mercer proved that she was undertaking like work with her comparators, there were genuine material factors which were not the dference of sex and which explained and justied any dferences in pay.The tribunal found that Mrs Mercer was employed on like work with all her comparators going back six years to June .The firm was ordered to pay her £, in respect of the dference between her gross annual salary of £, and the modied amount of £, going forward. She will also receive £, arrears of annual salary falling six years before the date of her claim in June  along with interest of £, on arrears."},{"url":null,"title":"nodeal brexit would have severe impact on trade between dublin and holyhead","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

He leaves having talked up falling crime figures and complaints against his force, despite a £m cut in his resources. But in the background are huge concerns about months ahead of more Brexit confusion and border policing headaches, what to do about a soaring holiday pay bill, and questions over Catholic recruitment to the force.But Hamiltons biggest regret as he packs his bags today was always going to be that his legacy would undoubtedly be his failure to address the seemingly insoluble problem of legacy, getting justice and answers for relatives of thousands of people killed during the Troubles.But it is a task that has taxed many more minds than his.When he became Chief Constable in  Hamilton sounded guardedly optimistic about the possibility of progress on the past through the Stormont House Agreement. But after five years he has been powerless to deliver anything meaningful amid the Assembly meltdown, saying time and time again that it is not a policing issue.The Newtownards man, who studied politics and economics at the Open University, joined the RUC in  and was promoted to inspector nine years later.His elevation to Chief Constable was generally welcomed by officers, who were weary of Englishmen in the post. One former colleague said: \"George was a great man to work with and he earned the respect of people like me.\"But the ex-policeman said he was disappointed at Hamiltons initial handling of the job.He added: \"George quickly sounded more like a politician than a policeman. But I know that the Chief Constable has to walk a tightrope. I just thought he could have supported his PSNI officers - and former RUC colleagues - better.\"Hamiltons tenure wasnt without its challenges beyond those normally associated with the office.In  he had to say sorry to his furious officers after posting a late-night tweet that was branded \"offensive\" by the Police Federation. It said Hamilton was out of touch after telling a colleague, who complained on social media of being under pressure, to \"dry your eyes, do the job or move on\".In  he and two senior colleagues were investigated by the Police Ombudsman about concerns over how a probe was conducted by into allegations of fraud and bribery three years earlier. They were all cleared.On the terrorist front, Hamilton has never played down the threat posed by dissident republicans even though he claimed that Westminster politicians werent listening to him.\"George may have had to be a diplomat but he had a habit of shooting from the hip when straight-talking was required,\" said an erstwhile colleague. \"He certainly earned the respect of many officers when he spoke out against the former Ombudsman Baroness OLoan over her criticism of how police handled the Omagh bombing andclaimed it could have been prevented.\"Hamilton also didnt shirk from treading paths that his predecessors would have avoided. He defied dissident street protests to talk on a Feile an Phobail  in west Belfast, and he attended Martin McGuinness funeral in the Bogside, even though he admitted that it was a \"dilemma\" for him.After another funeral, for murdered journalist Lyra McKee at St Annes Cathedral, the Chief Constable denounced her New IRA killers.But what next  When he announced his decision to step down it was said he wanted to spend more time with his family. One associate, however, said that he definitely wouldnt be spending his time in the garden or on the golf course.\"He says he will take a few months to decide where he goes from here. He has said he doesnt want a high-paced executive-stress job. But you can be sure you havent heard the last of George Hamilton,\" he added."},{"url":null,"title":"revealed five schools share the top spot in gcse league table results","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

AUTOCROP h bpanews_ddedc-bd-cf-aa-faef_EmailTaoiseach Leo Varadkar has lamented the “unfortunate” absence of Northern Ireland at the British Irish Council..pushSpeaking on Friday at the th anniversary of the council in Manchester, Mr Varadkar said the entire group present were disappointed that representatives from Northern Ireland could not attend due to the lack of a ing executive in Stormont.Leaders and ministers from the BIC member administrations, including the UK and Irish governments, the Scottish and Welsh governments and representatives from Guernsey, Jersey and the Isle of Man met for a number of meetings and engagements without their Northern Ireland counterparts.No one political party can speak for Northern Ireland.Leo Varadkar“One of the things that we all here found very unfortunate and very sad is that we are marking the th anniversary of the British Irish Councilhere today and it’s an institution that has worked well: Scotland is here, Wales is here, Ireland, the United Kingdom, the Crown dependencies but Northern Ireland is absent,” Mr Varadkar said.“This institution was established as part of the Good Friday Agreement and there’s a sad irony that the only people who are missing are the representatives of Northern Ireland.”Referencing the deadlock between Stormont’s two biggest political parties, the DUP and Sinn Fein, Mr Varadkar called for a compromise for the benefit of the people of Northern Ireland.“No one political party can speak for Northern Ireland,” he said.“Nor does any one political party can say it has the right to speak for Northern Ireland.“Only the Northern Ireland Executive Assembly can do that, that is why we are so committed to seeing those institutions up and running.”New power-sharing talks sparked by the murder of journalist Lyra McKee in April have been ongoing, aided by both the Republic of Ireland and Westminster governments, without any major breakthroughs.Minister for the Cabinet Office David Lidington added that Northern Ireland Secretary of State Karen Bradley had intended to be at the BIC meeting but decided to stay in Northern Ireland as talks continue.“All I can say at the moment is the talks are still ongoing, and the two governments continue to work very closely together,” he said.“I think it’s fair to say there has been some decent working relationships re-established between the leading members of the dferent political parties in NI through this talks process.”It has been more than two years since the collapse of the Stormont executive amid a scandal over a botched renewable heating initiative.Talks to restore the institutions have previously broken down over issues such as the Irish language and marriage equality."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38247159.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/dogs_digital.jpg","title":"watch dogs mad dash for petrol station flowers","story":" Hi degC | Lo

It is for democratic politicians in the democratic world to do so,” he said.The chairman of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee Damian Collins said Sir Nick was wrong to say there was no evidence that Russia used Facebook to interfere in the referendum.“He is technically wrong on that point which he should know,” he told BBC Radio ’s Today programme.“We asked Facebook whether there was any evidence of Russians buying ads during the referendum. There was – which they shared with us – on a very small scale, but nevertheless it was there.”He added: “There has been no proper audit done during the referendum.

We managed to raise £, first year, £, second year and £, this year with our Ramadan charity fasting challenge donation project.”Foyle Foodbank manager James McMenamin thanked the NW Islamic Association for their continued support.“There has been a steady increase in the amount of money they have donated each year. This enables us to buy food that we’re running low on and will also help with teaching courses in debt management.”InclusionEach year in the month of Ramadan the North West Islamic Association invites members of the local community to take part in a fasting challenge where participants fast for a few hours up to full day depending upon their capability and preference.Families, friends and colleagues sponsor the participants by donating money.“At North West Islamic community centre we also run this donation appeal and set up donation box as well. Most of the people from Muslim community who attend for prayer and other events put money in this box to support this campaign as well in addition to show support for the participants,” Mr Bahli said.“The most impressive thing is that kids at the Islamic community centre break their kitty boxes to participate in this campaign.“All the participants are invited to join the Muslim community at the time of breaking the fast in Islamic community centre on the day of the challenge. There are a selection of dishes prepared for this day by the Muslim families from dferent countries“This project strengthens the bonds between communities and helps to know each other and to understand ious cultures and traditions in a multicultural environment. There is great sense of friendship, building bridges and sense of inclusion amongst the communities.”He concluded: “These types of projects are vital in a society to promote combined efforts for a good cause and aims which are beyond race, religion and nationality.“North West Islamic association is grateful to the participants of the challenge this year and also to the people who have donated money for this great cause this year and years before and for support in future. We are hoping to make this project bigger and better in coming years.”googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshPhoto: Mr Bahli and other members of the NW Islamic Association presenting cheque to Foyle Foodbank."},{"url":null,"title":"foyle foodbank record number derry families need emergency food parcels","story":"Record levels of emergency food supplies are being handed out to Derry families this year as welfare reform, zero-our contracts and low-income jobs force people into poverty.Local agencies assist families andthey are deemed to be struggling to put food on the table, they are issued with a foodbank voucher.In the first half of  Foyle Foodbank has received a staggering  vouchers from families comprised of  adults and  children.

Mr Cooper himself believed that the events of that day  years ago irretrievably changed the course of history in Northern Ireland.Another stalwart of the Civil Rights era in Derry, Dermie McClenaghan said: “Ivan was one of the most courageous people I have ever known. In the context of the Civil Rights struggle in the north, to say that he went out on a limb is hardly enough.”A Book of Condolence in honour of Ivan Cooper was also opened at the Guildhall yesterday by Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council Michaela Boyle.Ivan Cooper’s funeral service will take place at St Peter’s Church of Ireland tomorrow at noon and his remains will be interred at Altnagelvin Cemetery afterwards.Mr Cooper is survived by his we Frances, daughters Sinead and Bronagh, son-in-law Conor and grandchildren Cashel and Luca.Ivan Cooper hailed from Kilaloo near to village of Claudy in County Derry just a few miles from the city. Born into a working-class Protestant family in January , Mr Cooper’s family moved to Derry’s Bogside when he was around -years-old.He was briefly a member of the Claudy Young Unionist Association, but in April of  he joined the Northern Ireland Labour Party .His first foray into electoral politics also came in  when he stood as a NILP candidate at the Stormont general election. Although he attracted a good degree of cross community support, he wasn’t elected.Ivan Cooper’s lelong commitment to non-violence as a political methodology made him a natural character to fit within the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association . He quickly became a prominent figure in that movement and its campaign for equality as the s drew towards a close.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshIn , he resigned from the NILP and helped found the Derry Citizen’s Action Committee. One of his first major public pronouncements came in the summer of that year and characterised the fundamental principles of the entire movement.At a protest meeting in the foyer of the Guildhall he said that Protestants and Catholics should stand up for their rights together “as the blacks in America were fighting.”The unication of people away from their religious denominations would remain the dominant feature of Ivan Cooper’s political activism throughout his  years. He was convinced that both communities in Northern Ireland could work together for common goals. However, some within the Protestant and unionist community viewed this stance as nationalist in outlook and tainted him as a traitor.Nevertheless, Ivan Cooper continued his agitation based on the Civil Rights  and after the RUC attack on the October  march in , he ignored a month-long Stormont government ban on parades in Derry.However, following violence after a number of marches in the city, Cooper called for an end to spontaneous demonstrations. As confrontations between demonstrators and the RUC continued to escalate in early  after a People’s Democracy march was attacked at Burntollet, residents of the Bogside cordoned the area off with barricades.Whilst Ivan Cooper managed to persuade locals to dismantle the barriers, the chances of redeeming an already tense political situation had probably already gone. As the sectarianism he had fought so hard to keep at bay crept steadily back into the issues at hand, most Protestant people who had supported NICRA backed away from the movement.At the Northern Ireland general election of , Cooper was elected as an Independent MP for Mid-Derry and in doing so unseated the sitting Nationalist Party representative Paddy Gormley.The Battle of the Bogside began on August ,  after violence erupted following the annual Relief of Derry parade by the Apprentice Boys.As the first of three days of fighting grew increasingly heavy, Cooper attempted to restrain rioters by linking arms with Eddie McAteer and John Hume. As the trio were swept aside by the advancing crowd, Cooper was knocked unconscious by a brick.In August , Ivan Cooper became one of the founding members of the SDLP with John Hume, Paddy Devlin and Gerry Fitt. After Stormont was prorogued in , he was again elected as one of the representatives from Mid Ulster to the Northern Ireland Assembly in . After the power sharing administration tumbled in the face of the Ulster Workers Council Strike in , Cooper was again elected to the Northern Ireland Constitutional Convention in .He was also the SDLP candidate for the constituency at both Westminster elections in . In the first one in February that year, he succeeded in splitting the nationalist vote and as a result caused the defeat of Independent MP Bernadette McAliskey.After boundary changes created the Foyle constituency in , Cooper stood aside to let John Hume have a clear run at claiming the seat. After this point, the overall political situation characterised as it was by ever increasing levels of violence, saw Ivan Cooper gradually withdraw from politics and concentrate more on his accountancy work."},{"url":null,"title":"temperatures sore ensure pets stay cool","story":"With temperatures predicted to go as high as  degrees today, dog owners are being urged to pay extra attention to their pets.The RSPCA says it receives many enquiries and reports about the welfare of animals over the summer months, particularly when its very hot.

OrsquoHare and Diarmuid OrsquoConnor exchanged points before Keegan and Ciaran Treacy finished the job in added time.Mayorsquos five-point winning margin was a bit flattering and the final result would have been so much more dferent had Down taken all their chances.Downrsquos season is now over, but Tally has laid the foundations for better things to come.Saturdayrsquos defeat may well have been the last game in a Down shirt for a few of the sidersquos older players as there is a plethora of young players just waiting to get their chance and Tally seems to be the man to give them that opportunity.Down: R Burns, D OrsquoHagan, B McArdle, G Collins, R McAleenan, K Kernan, D Guinness, J Flynn, C Poland, C Francis, C Mooney , P Laverty, P Havern , D OrsquoHare , C Harrison .

We made three or four goal chances, we scored one and we missed a number of kickable scores and frees, Tally said.ldquoThe players, though, gave all they had and never gave up on it. Ultimately, against a team like Mayo,you are not clinical you will come up that bit short.Over in Fr Lynch Park in Ballyholland, Down camogs won a hard-hitting encounter with a talented Laois side.Down held a - to - interval lead and then withstood a concerted second half fightback from their visitors, but the Ulster champions did enough to get over the line in a robust and competitive clash.Down now entertain Carlow on July  or ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Special event marking 10th anniversary of new Downe  ","story":"THE Downe Hospital is  years old.A special event to mark the occasion takes place at the main foyer at the Struell Road facility this Friday at pm, with the birthday celebration attended by past and present staff.Ahead of the event, South Down MLA Colin McGrath has paid tribute to all the staff who work at the hospital and the excellent service they provide.He also described the hospitalrsquos past decade as a ldquorollercoaster which featured many highs and many lows.ldquoThe one constant has been the high quality of care offered at the Downe from a range of health care practitioners and the all-important support and wrap-round staff, said Mr McGrath.But the Assemblyman said he and many others are keen to see theof the hospitalrsquos -hour AE service and dedicated coronary care unit.He said people also have concerns about the loss of the Downersquos coffee shop, praising the the GP out-of-hours service which he believes is a model which could be successfully replicated in other areas.ldquoThis is an exemplary unit and everyone who uses it is happy, he continued. ldquoAdditional regional clinics, including ophthalmology, are now delivered in Downpatrick which has helped generate increased footfall.

Unfortunately the swing bridge has been out of commission since June .I have met with residents and local Labour councillors, who have been working closely with residents to discuss their concerns and plans to make the bridge once more available to the public.The bridge is owned by the Vale of Glamorgan Council and leased to Penarth Quays MarinaLTD. It was built to ensure that both residents and boat owners had equal access to land and water.I understand that there are no mechanical reasons why the bridge should not be used.The Vale Council and PQM have agreed that safety upgrades need to be carried out for the bridge to reopen. In October  PQM submitted a planning application for modications to the swing bridge. I have been told that PQM were contacted by the Vale council to mody the current application to include lower intensity flashing lights and lsquosilent alarmsrsquo. Unfortunately PQM felt that the changes would not meet the safety standards they felt necessary and choose to withdraw the application. I understand that the Vale Council is currently awaiting the outcome of a noise report which will feature in future discussions between the Vale and PQM over the future of the swing bridge.The swing bridge has been an integral part of marina le for many years and is enjoyed by both residents and the thousands of tourists to the area. Connecting the two sides of the marina the bridge acts as a short cut for residents, particularly useful for those with walking dficulties. Having spoken to local businesses about the potential for the reopening the consensus seems to be generally positive. Reopening of the swing bridge, customers could use the car park on Llwyn Passat and use the bridge to access Portway businesses.I hope that the Vale council and PQM are able to work together to find a solution. I think we can all agree that the way forward is to ensure safe operation of the bridge while minimising disruption to adjacent properties.Before the Easter recess I met with residents to listen to their concerns over plans to remove Victorian lampposts from across Penarth. The cast iron lampposts, which have been an integral part of Penarthrsquos street scene for a century are being replaced by the Vale council with modern LED lighting. I am disappointed that several lampposts along Cwrt-Y-Vil road have been removed without notying residents.Residents have set up a petition, of which over a thousand people so far have signed asking for the old posts to be left in place with new ones installed beside them. This has been carried out in towns and cities across the UK to protect the local heritage.The petition can be found at www.change.org p vale-of-glamorgan-council-save-the-victorian-heritage-of-penarth u .I will continue to work with your local Labour councillors on these issues.

Although a relative newcomer to the site, having previously taught in Newport, it is clear he is immensely proud of the students and staff.ldquoVisitors to the school often comment on the warm, friendly and purposeful environment that exists at Stanwell and, despite its size, they see how the school cares about the inidual child and their progress, he said.ldquoThe schoolrsquos Mission Statement is summarised as lsquoLearning to Excelrsquo and this is the vision for every child, whatever their starting points, interests or talents. The school thrives because we have a fantastic team of teachers, teaching assistants, support staff, parents and governors who help make this vision a reality.ldquoThis is what makes the school so successful because everybody gives so much.Wandering through a theatre the school uses to put on assemblies and biannual productions, Mrs Kynaston pointed out a section of floor that moved away to create an orchestral pit. The production value afforded to every department ndash theatre, maths, sports, English ndash was astounding.ldquoWe try to give our pupils the very best, said Mrs Kynaston. ldquoWe want them to truly reach their potential.

The same story went for maths, with  per cent again hitting their expected target or better, against  per cent of Wales.       ,params: .pushAt A level,  per cent of all grades were A* or A, with  per cent of the year group achieving A* to C overall.A level results put Stanwell students amongst the top performers in Wales, with many iniduals securing exceptional grades.  of themachieved the equivalent of three A grades or better.Three of its pupils went to Oxford University last year, while another earned a place at Cambridge University.Mr Brown said: ldquoWe place a large emphasis on listening to our learners and and our pupils make a dference as leaders in the school, whether itrsquos through well established groups such as our school council, eco-committee or charity committee, or in aspects of teaching and learning where we have subject prefects and learner voice groups.ldquoThey help us evaluate our work as a school and plan for the future.ldquoWhat always comes through is how proud they are of their school.Rightly so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The renaming of our on-air studio to ldquoThe John Wilce Studio was a popular choice to recognise his outstanding dedication.ldquoJune  wouldrsquove been Johnrsquos th birthday, so this we felt really was a fitting tribute and a lovely memorial to all those who knew him, as a constant reminder of his contribution to Radio Glamorgan.Mr Wilce regularly presented on Sunday evenings, often dedicating features to listeners. Without fail he played a Beatles track every time he was on air.When Mr Wilce was off-air, he oversaw and maintained broadcast equipment, actively engaged in fundraising and stood as a trustee, assisting with the day-to-day running of the station.Jamie added: ldquoI speak on behalf of everyone at RG to say it was a privilege to know John, not only as a fellow volunteer but as a friend. He always put everyone  first and his patience was beyond words. His music knowledge was phenomenal and the impact he had on everyone he met, not just at Radio Glamorgan has really come to light since his passing.Michelle Fowler, volunteer services manager at Cardf and Vale University Health Board, said: ldquoItrsquos such a wonderful tribute to rename the studio after John.

He has also cast doubt on the future of the proposed Dinas Powys bypass, and say he believes the Barry Incinerator will be required to draw up an environmental impact assessment ndash which campaigners have been calling for.Cllr Moore and the councilrsquos new deputy leader Lis Burnett gained control of the authority in May.Their priorities include balancing the councilrsquos budget and preserving vital services for the most vulnerable in the face of a need to make pound million of savings over the next two years, as well as regeneration and building more homes, and improving school buildings.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWersquore going to be open and transparent and be prepared to work with people. If there are issues we will try to work through those issues.ldquoSometimes we will have to make decisions that not everyone is going to be happy with.ldquoWe have to be honest with people. We have to say these are the facts and whether we like it or not we will have to do some things dferently or not at all.Cllr Burnett added. ldquoBut we have to be honest about the levels of pressure on local government.ldquoOur priority has to be services to the most vulnerable.The Labour-led coalition includes members of the former Conservative cabinet, which quit the party when former leader John Thomas was deposed as leader of the Vale Tories. The coalition also includes Llantwit First Independents.This is where the new leadership stands on the key issues facing the Vale:Parking chargesCllr Moore said new parking charges proposed by the previous administration, which included town centre car parks, coastal resorts and country parks, will be reviewed.He said new parking charges are likely in the Vale, but they will be ldquorealistic.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWe have to be sensible. Some of the things put forward previously were off the wall, they went too far.ldquoIt will be a full revamp of everything. Whatever we do wersquore not going to fleece the residents of the Vale.ldquoWe may have to make some changes. It does cost money to provide car parking. There are things we will have to start charging for. It will be realistic and fair for everybody.School improvementsThe new cabinet says delivering on major new school buildings is a priority for the new administration.Developments in the pipeline include new builds forPencoedtre and Whitmore High Schools, and expansion and refurbishment of Ysgol Gymraeg Bro MorgannwgAgeing schools in the Vale are set to get a pound. million cash boost for repairs.Llancarfan Primary SchoolLlancarfan Primary School was set to be lsquoclosedrsquoand moved to a new pound million facility in Rhoose.The previous cabinet had approved the plans despite protests from parents and campaigners.Cllr Moore said Llancarfan School move was ldquopremature - but did not commit to scrapping the plan entirely.ldquoIf itrsquos justiable itrsquos justiable, he said. ldquoIf itrsquos not, we will look at alternatives.ldquoItrsquos not an easy decision to take. Itrsquos something we have to take some time about.ldquoWhat Irsquom not going to do is jump or kowtow to people who shout the loudest.Cllr Burnett has previously tweeted the closure of Llancarfan ldquowouldnrsquot be happeningLabour were running the council.New roadsWork continues on outline business cases for two major new roads being proposed ndash the A to M link around Pendoylan and Dinas Powys Bypass between Barry and Cardf ndash but no decision has been made whether either will actually go ahead.The future of both roads rests on whether Welsh Government and the council deem them viable, and whether ministers cough up the cash to fund them.But Cllr Moore said he doesnrsquot think Welsh Government will find the money required for the Dinas Powys Bypass.ldquoItrsquos out of our hands, he said.IncineratorCllr Moore said he believes Welsh Government will order the Barry Biomass incinerator to carry out an environmentalimpact assessment.Cllr Moore, who has previously attacked what he termed ldquoscaremongering and lies around the biomass plant, said he did not want the facility in Barry Docks.He said: ldquoWe opposed it vehemently, both as a council and as a party and personally. It shouldnrsquot be there.ldquoBut now it is there it has to operate within legal parameters.ldquoIf it does, therersquos nothing anyone can do about it.The council refused the original planning permission for the facility, but a planning inspector allowed it in  following an appeal. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We believe it is important that all families feel welcome in the school. Education is a partnership between home and school with a shared responsibility based on trust and mutual understanding and the co-operation and participation of parents with our school in the education of their child is positively encouraged.ldquoA good relationship between school and home builds a childrsquos confidence, aids their learning and helps them to fulfil their potential in all areas.They stressed that the children had an equal say in their education, through the use of techniques like lsquoImmersion Daysrsquo ndash where pupils have a multi-sensory experience of any given topic.These learning opportunities have ied from using LEGO in building new robot designs and solving problems, to visits from STEM experts. businesses and education experts.The pupils develop a basis from these experiences from which to draw questions and interests, while the staff ask for pupilsrsquo ideas about how they would like to learn further.ldquoWe recently we had an Immersion Day on the topic of volcanoes, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoA few of the pupils mentioned ways they would like to learn more about the subject. When we followed their suggestions a few weeks later, they were incredibly enthused ndash it really focuses them, develops their engagement.These pioneering techniques of giving the children an equal say in their education have a proven record.Albert Primary featured in Estynrsquos lsquoRecognising excellence in education and trainingrsquo publication for its innovative approach.The publication said: ldquoThe school provides pupils with an excellent range of high quality learning experiences.Mr Gilbert said: ldquoMost importantly the inspection report captures the ethos of our school and, in particular, it confirmed that we are achieving our aim to make the school a happy and secure place in which pupils grow in confidence and independence.Albert Primary also earned an award for being the top performing primary school in Wales in recognition of their implementation of the Renaissance Reading programme, and the impact it has on their childrenrsquos reading progress.The staff were experienced and enthusiastic. During the tour, I was treated to a brief rehearsal of the schoolrsquos summer production ndash The Lion King. The youngsters performing looked genuinely thrilled to be involved, and were remarkably talented singers.There is plenty of sport provision, with the deceptively spacious grounds playing host to several open tarmac areas and courts. Football, basketball, rounders, cycling and more were on offer, along with chess, drama and music clubs. For those looking to go off school site, Belle Vue Park is feet away from the front entrance, and often works with the school.This year, Albert Primary has been awarded the prestigious Platinum Flag Award after previously gaining three Green Flag Awards thanks to the environmental education programme, Eco-Schools.But no school is without its problems.A major concern for Albert Primary is having to balance a large deficit budget. In order to do so the school has lost a number of agency learning support staff, with the deputy head taking on a greater teaching commitment next year to make up for the shortfall.Another blow came after four years of saving and planning to convert a disused toilet block into a teaching and community centre.The funds, totalling pound,, had to be used to offset the deficit budget instead. The proposal was to refurbish the existing outbuilding to provide a new classroom facility for the oversubscribed main school to use, alongside the community.The governors are currently creating a task group of stakeholders to address future funding sources.But the spirits of the pupils and staff have not been dampened by financial dficulties.ldquoI believe that we are extremely fortunate in Albert Primary to have created such a positive and vibrant environment in which our children can learn, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoIt is the dedication and commitment of its staff and everyone associated with the school that makes Albert Primary the school that it is today ndash successful, happy and continually improving.Albert Primary was founded in  to accommodate all ages of children up to school leaving age.Much of its original character has been preserved and it now holds Grade  listed status. The school has some unusual Victorian artwork by Norton Nante and parts of the school were designed by highly respected Victorian architect J Coates Carter.A Victorian mural on the front of the building shows several children hard at work. One of them is holding a pet mouse on a lead.It is clear that this quirky attitude to learning has been present and successful in the school for a long time.Long may it last. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Abandoned - BlissThe first dog to arrive at the centre was -year-old Spaniel Grace, found by a member of the public at the side of the road. She was taken to the vet immediately, but after an owner didn’t come forward, she was brought to Dogs Trust.Two weeks ago, another Spaniel - aged eight and nicknamed Bliss by the team - was found tied to a fence not far from the rehoming centre. Like Grace, the Spaniel has not been microchipped, which has been a legal requirement for all dogs since  and the easiest way to identy a dog who has become separated from their owner. Shockingly just one week later, a Cairn Terrier - less than a year old, was found by a rehoming centre staff member at the very same spot where Bliss was left. Terrier Rizzo was lucky to be found as she is quite small and it would have been easy to miss her in the long grass.The most recent addition to the ranks of abandoned pooches is Sally, an eight-year-old Collie cross, who was found as a stray by a member of the public and brought to the rehoming centre.Abandoned - RizzoOonagh Philips, Rehoming Centre Manager said: “We want to remind anyone who no longer feels that they can care for their dog to contact their local rescue organisation for support. When a dog is abandoned on the road side, it not only puts them in danger, but also drivers. We are so thankful that all four of these dogs were found when they were.“Grace and Bliss were very shaken up by their ordeal when they came into our care and it took them a couple of days to build trust around people again. We could tell Rizzo hadn’t eaten in a while, which could have resulted in a deterioration of her physical health. Sally is incredibly sweet natured, and just like the others, will make a wonderful addition to the right home.“We are not sure why there has been a recent influx in dogs being abandoned. We always remind people that ‘A Dog is for Le®’ but we understand that le happens, and places like Dogs Trust are there to support any dog owner who experiences a bump in the road and needs our help. Sometimes the most responsible thing we can do as a dog owner is admit that we aren’t coping with our pets, but it is important to ensure they are kept safe and not left to fend for themselves.”If you

Ulster Business speaks to director Clare Kelly about a burgeoning firm which is leading the way in more than just business, but connectivity, co-working and wellness for its members Eighteen years ago and in its early stages of infancy, Glandore began its le in one building at Fitzwilliam Square in Dublin – capable of hosting just  members.Fast forward to the present day and it’s an all-island business with an -strong workforce across nine locations in Belfast, Dublin and Cork – playing host to as many as , people. And it’s very much a family-owned and run business, led by founder Michael Kelly with daughters Clare, Fiona and Rebecca each as directors within the company.Glandore’s high-end flexible working spaces have been up-and-running in Belfast for  years – with capacity for  members across its two locations here. However, the family’s connection to the city dates back to , when Michael first bought - Arthur Street, now Arthur Place.It’s been at the forefront of attracting some of the leading international foreign direct investmentto Belfast, working closely alongside Invest NI to bring in cyber-security and technology firms from the US and beyond – first setting up here in . Glandore offers its members a wide iety of flexible office space, co-working and hot-desking – designed so companies can grow organically. But it’s also focused on bringing its members together, connecting indigenous and international firms, while also considering wellness in the workplace, and improving its green credentials. Clare Kelly is a director of the family business – a qualied occupational therapist and Trinity College graduate, who joined Glandore in .She’s now tasked with focusing on the key marketing and business development elements of the burgeoning company – attracting and retaining members, and ensuring there remains a strong pipeline of clients.“We offer our members a erse range of services,” Clare tells Ulster Business. That includes short-term hot-desking for small businesses with just a handful of employees, to providing flexible high-end office space for companies with dozens, or hundreds of workers.”And while the flexibility allows firms to scale from small numbers to a larger workforce – taking short-term space for as little as just three months – Clare says many of the companies stay for several years, orto Glandore further down the line in their own business journey.“We also host a range of events, and can bring everyone together through the network of our members. That has allowed us to cater from very early start-ups, right through to the largest multi-national company, or scaling FDI business,” Clare says.“The dference with Glandore is the flexibility. A company may wish to bring in one or two people, and then concentrate on recruitment – but they can then scale with their growth, from say  to  people. “That flexibility and scale is key. In terms of Glandore, we are offering high quality space, but also offering a range of business services to our members.”Across its two Belfast city centre flexible workspace buildings, Glandore’s expanding network means it can now host around  members – with locations at Arthur House and the nearby Arthur Place.It has six locations in Dublin, including the Silicon Docks and Central Business District, and has boasted a long list of foreign direct investment firms, including Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox and Smartbox, and has also opened its newest office space building in Cork city.Glandore has forged strong relationships with Invest NI – helping provide high-end working environments for rapidly expanding FDI businesses – along with Belfast City Council, the Belfast Chamber and Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Some of its high profile international current, or former members, include cyber-security experts Rapid , digital marketing firm Bazaarvoice and global payments giant Cayan – a company which has now expanded into its Belfast headquarters at City Quays.The quality and bespoke nature of the offices are part of what helps Glandore stand out from the crowd. Clare says firms are able to specy exactly what they want, with a top-end design and fit-out team on hand to develop a specic working environment for each business.“When Glandore was set up by Michael in , he always focused on a high quality working environment,” Clare says. “We take premium office space in premium locations, and there is no expense spared in fit-out.“We provide a bespoke set up – whether they need a co-working space or a virtual office, for example. We can tailor that for each business. It’s not a cookie-cutter approach.”And while she says design and the aesthetics are important, behind the decor is the IT and security infrastructure to ensure that guests have the very best available to them.“We have always invested heavily in our network, and have our own on-site IT. We have an IT director, manager and team – so there is support even before day one. All of these things are important to firms of all sizes.”For Glandore, it’s not simply about putting guests on seats – there’s much more to the offering. “We have such a erse mixture of companies in the network and community, and we are able to mix the indigenous firms with the international companies, and actively, facilitate connections between our members.”That includes an alumni programme, which sees members past and present ing to celebrate their successful partnerships.“We bring back customers from the last  years, and representatives from Invest NI and Belfast City Council. It’s about making the connections between the current scaling members and those which have come before,” Clare says.“That support is invaluable. It can be very isolating in the those days when you are setting up, so it’s great to have someone you can bounce ideas off.”Glandore goes further still, with the introduction of both the Glandore Wellness Programme and Glandore Green Initiative – the latter focused on creating a greener and more sustainable office space.“We have been working with these companies for several years, and we get a bird’s-eye view,” Clare says. “One thing we have been very mindful of is the need for us to support from a wellness perspective.“We offer a complimentary wellness programme, which started in , long before it became a buzzword. It offers a way for our members to connect with each other, and help in retaining talent.”And while almost every business has experienced some Brexit-related impact, Clare says Glandore has reached its highest occupancy rate in its history – rising to % in Belfast.“It has been a very uncertain time and that has impacted businesses across Northern Ireland. There have been some delays in regards to FDI, but our hats go off to Invest NI which still attracting businesses into Northern Ireland.”And while there’s also scope for further growth in Belfast, there’s potential for that demand to move outside Belfast, with a potential to grow into the North West.“The hope is to continue our expansion as an all-island business, having operated on both sides of the border for  years, with capacity to grow the businesses in Belfast.“With the likes of Derry, that would be something on the agenda for Invest NI as part of its remit to win investment for outside Belfast. We will take the lead from the councils and from Invest NI, and we will look to see where we can add. If there isn’t space for a business to land, people will go where.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/bbobb.jpg","title":"coffee chain bob and berts creating  new jobs","story":"Posted on Monday  June  by John Mulgrew A Northern Ireland coffee shop chain is creating  new jobs as its expands it reach across the UK with eight new stores, it has emerged.
