The lava has been pouring down the flank of the volcano and into the ocean miles away.  The volcano has opened more than 20 vents in the ground that have released lava, sulfur dioxide and steam   Only one person has been seriously hurt as a result of the eruption when they were hit by a flying piece of lava The eruption has destroyed 50 buildings, including about two dozen homes.One person was seriously injured after being hit by a flying piece of lava.Activists have also warned that a geothermal power plant in Hawaii at risk of being overrun with molten lava from the erupting Kilauea Volcano is a \u0027ticking time bomb\u0027, claim local activists.Locals in the badly effected Puna district fear the fiery river of molten rock could overcome the plant which they have warned for decades was a disaster waiting to happen.And as aerial photos showed the lava flow looming closer to the perimeter of the Puna Geothermal Venture (PGV) plant, engineers worked into the night on Tuesday to cap the 11th and final well, which provides about 25 percent of the Big Island\u0027s power.As of Wednesday, lava had poured over warehouses just outside the plant and was about 100 yards from the facility as officials feared it could trigger the release of deadly hydrogen sulfate gas.On Thursday, Stovall said lava spatter from one vent was forming a wall that was helping protect the plant. Lava from that vent was shooting further into the air and producing the highest lava wall of all the vents, which was blocking molten rock from flowing north toward the plant.Plant workers have already removed 60,000 gallons of highly flammable pentane gas from the site and installed barriers and protective coverings over the area.          A satellite photo provided by DigitalGlobe shows lava coming out of fissures caused by Kilauea volcano, near Puna Geothermal Venture, a geothermal energy plant, which could explode if hit by lava           The wells at the Puna Geothermal Venture plant were plugged overnight as lava from Hawaii\u0027s Kilauea volcano inched closer to the site. The plant is pictured above on Tuesday But local activists, who for decades have argued the power plant should never have been built in a residential area, and have filed multiple lawsuits challenging its placement on Kilauea volcano, claim the danger is clear and present.Activist Kalikolehua Kanaele of the protector group Aloha Aina (Love the Living God), told DailyMail.com: \u0027This has been the greatest concern of this community for 50 years.\u0027If the wells break the gas could ignite and there could be a huge explosion. It\u0027s a ticking time bomb and we always knew this situation could arise. We just hope that a disaster can be averted and nobody gets hurt.\u0027Kanaele, 68, and others say the wells, which run as deep as 8,000ft, pose a serious risk from the lava if they overheat or are breached by underground seismic activity.If the wells break, they could release tons of flammable and toxic hydrogen sulfide into the air around the current evacuation zone, which is already choked with volcanic smog. The gas has the potential to cause huge explosions and winds could spark an emergency evacuation covering a 10-mile radius.This past two weeks the Puna district has been hit with as many as 140 smaller earthquakes every day.The PGV plant is 15 miles from the heart of the volcano, but while Ormat Technologies Inc – which runs the facility - last week insisted there was little risk of the lava reaching it, everyone\u0027s worst nightmare is coming true.Lava erupts several feet into the air in Leilani Estates area near Pahoa, Hawaii on Wednesday   A satellite photo shows lava coming out of fissures caused by Kilauea volcano, running towards the Puna coast, lower right, along Malama Ki Forest Reserve recreation area in Pahoa, Hawaii   This Wednesday photo provided by the U.S. Geological Survey shows the active fissure complex near Pahoa, Hawaii Tourism officials cheered news that a Norwegian Cruise Lines ship that tours the Hawaiian Islands would resume stopping in Kailua-Kona next week. Businesses catering to tourists on the cruise have been hurt since the company suspended Big Island port visits after the eruption began.The company said it would resume calling on Hilo, a town on the eastern side of the island closer to the lava, when conditions allow."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/23/12/0553BBDE000007D0-0-image-m-37_1527073990347.jpg","title":"Deutsche Bank slash thousands jobs control costs","story":"A flag for Deutsche Bank flies outside the German bank\u0027s New York offices on Wall StreetThe bank employs approximately 8,500 staff in London.Deutsche Bank has struggled with high costs and troubles with regulators over recent years.The bank replaced its CEO in April after three years of annual losses and lagging progress in streamlining its operations.Share this articleNew CEO Christian Sewing has said the bank will refocus on its European and German customer base and cut back on costlier, riskier operations where it does not hold a leading position in the market.Sewing said the bank is still committed to its international investment banking operations but must \u0027concentrate on what we truly do well.\u0027 The new strategy means stepping back from decades of global expansion in which the bank sought to compete with Wall Street rivals such as Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase.

She studied economics at the University of Cape Town and later earned a law degree from Leeds University in 2009.Chelsy worked as a trainee solicitor at the London law firm Allen \u0026amp Overy before quitting in 2014.

Europe and Moscow are making diplomatic overtures to save the Iran deal, now under threat after the recent US withdrawal.In a joint appearance before the start of the talks, Macron said: \u0027I believe we must work together on joint initiatives. Putin meanwhile said he was ready to talk \u0027about key international issues, the resolution of which are important to both France and Russia\u0027.Mother\u0027s fury after her altar boy son, 14, is sent home from...Convicted killer, 50, who beat street drinker to death is on...Share this articlePutin handed Macron\u0027s wife Brigitte flowers as he greeted the couple late in the afternoon at the Konstantin Palace, a former residence of Peter the Great set some 12 miles outside Saint Petersburg.The meeting comes almost exactly a year since the freshly elected Macron hosted Putin in Versailles, when the French leader accused Russian media of producing \u0027lying propaganda\u0027 during a joint press conference.The trip will also see Macron address the Saint Petersburg International Economic Forum.The talks take place after US President Donald Trump in early May controversially pulled the United States out of the 2015 landmark pact with Iran that placed limits on its nuclear programme in return for easing economic sanctions.    Putin and Macron are expected to discus the crisis in Iran as well as the ongoing war in Syria           Putin held talks last week with Angela Merkel and Japan\u0027s Shinzo Abe will arrive later this weekSaving the deal provides a rare point of agreement between Moscow and European countries, which have seen relations tank in recent years over crises in Ukraine and Syria, as well as accusations of meddling in foreign elections and the poisoning of an ex-Russian spy in Britain.Alexander Baunov of the Carnegie Moscow Centre said talks over Iran will be positive. He said: \u0027Russia shares the position of the majority of the international community including Western leaders.\u0027The West has realised that a dialogue with Putin is \u0027inevitable\u0027 in order to preserve the accord, he said.Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will also visit Russia at the end of the week.Baunov added: \u0027Merkel and Abe have already begun a thaw with Moscow and Macron is scared of losing the advantage that France has always had with Russia.\u0027  But there are a number of sticking points that will prevent a full rapprochement between Paris and Moscow.Chief among them is Syria, where at least 350,000 people have been killed since war broke out in 2011.Moscow intervened in 2015 to prop up its ally President Bashar al-Assad - in a move generally seen as decisive in turning around the multi-front conflict - while France has participated in strikes on regime targets.Another issue is the conflict in eastern Ukraine, which broke out after Russia annexed Crimea in 2014 and has so far claimed at least 10,000 lives.Paris and Moscow, along with Berlin, signed peace agreements in Minsk in 2015 that aimed to bring the fighting to a close but there is currently no end in sight.International investigators on Thursday said a missile that downed a Malaysia Airlines flight over eastern Ukraine in 2014 belonged to a Russian brigade. Moscow rejected the accusation.Before Macron\u0027s trip, Human Rights Watch also implored him to raise the issue of rights abuses with his Russian counterpart, following a crackdown on dissent and pressure on minority groups in the country.But the talks between the two presidents will not be the only bilateral activity of the day, as a raft of commercial agreements are also set to be signed during the economic forum.The presence of the French president at the forum \u0027legitimises visits by business people. Those who are worried about the risks, sanctions or criticism are covered to a certain extent by the president,\u0027 analyst Baunov said.\u0027If anything, the political leadership will get criticised for this rapprochement and not the business community.\u0027 "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/24/17/4C9771C900000578-0-image-m-16_1527177774764.jpg","title":"Is Roman Abramovich moving Tel Aviv","story":"Disgraced soldier kicked out of the army for offensive...Self-driving Uber \u0027saw mother-of-two pedestrian but did not...Share this articleThe Kremlin said Vladimir Putin was unaware of any attempt by Abramovich to seek Israeli citizenship.Presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: \u0027No, the Kremlin is not aware of it.

Our detached home there is modern and practical with six bedrooms, an open-plan kitchen, dining room and living room, all painted in bright colours. It’s cosy, family chaos, but also big enough for us to all come together and have our own space, too.I’ve been going to Anglesey on holiday since I was a child. It’s a really special area for me.We bought our place there in the village of Rhoscolyn, in 2015. I think a family home is different from a holiday home. It took me a year to get it how I like it: now it’s a stunning New England beach- style house which can sleep 12. It even has a hot tub. I rent it out when we’re not there.          Sarah can let her mind wander with guaranteed sunshine at a property in St Lucia (pictured)          The home in Rhoscolyn which they bought in 2015. Sarah had often visited Anglesey as a childThe St Lucia property was an obvious choice because it is somewhere we have loved going and meeting friends for years.With guaranteed sunshine, it’s also a place where my husband can truly switch off.There was land for sale in 2016, so we went for it. It took a year to build our four-bedroom, four-bathroom home.The children all have their favourite place. As for me, wherever my family is is where I want to be at that moment.  Jane Sayce, 59, is a marketing agent, and lives with her partner, Paul, 52, an electrician. She has two children Cassie, 32, and Joshua, 33, and a grandson Zae, one. She has homes in Cyprus, Shropshire and Cleethorpes. Jane says:Ever since I was a little girl growing up in a council house in the Midlands I always knew I’d have a property overseas one day.And I was right. Today, I still get a rush of pleasure waking up to azure blue skies and a twinkling, inviting swimming pool — and ending the day with something chilled and gorgeous, as I watch the sun go down.This is the life I adore in Cyprus for five months of the year.

When I returned to the UK, I married and raised my family. I’m one of life’s grafters and so when the children finally flew the nest, I set about making my dream a reality. I sold my UK property in Staffordshire and used the proceeds to buy a place off plan in Cyprus.It took three years to build my three-bedroom dream home in the sun. I’d fly out to see the progress and gradually fell in love with the Cypriot way of life. I’m not someone who ulges the costs involved, as I regard that as personal.When it was ready three years later, I sold my house in Staffordshire and moved here full-time. Not everyone was here in Paphos permanently and before long people began to ask me to manage their property. I found it was something I not only enjoyed, but was good at.I went from managing eight to then launching my own company and marketing approximately 100 holiday homes, although today I have scaled the business back to 80 properties.          It took Jane three years to build her three-bedroom dream home in the sun, in Cyprus          Marketing agent Jane Sayce, 59, at her holiday home in Paphos, CyprusThree years ago, I bought my two-bedroom ‘log cabin’ retreat in Shropshire. I find the summers too hot in Cyprus, and also it’s closer to Birmingham, where my grown-up children live.The wildlife is stunning I sit on the terrace and wind down while watching geese waddle by or listening to the woodpeckers in the forests.I am already thinking about my future though, which is why I have just snapped up a town property in Cleethorpes. It’s a rather chi-chi seafront flat, which I regard as a great investment. I can see it is somewhere we could both retire to when I eventually sell up.My family are rather proud of me. They know how have worked hard to achieve this. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/06/00/4BE50C2E00000578-0-image-m-22_1525561470263.jpg","title":"Look Aidan Turner dastardly MP taken shine Demelza","story":"    Heartthrob Ross Poldark carrying his wife Demelza from the sea in the popular BBC1 dramaRoss and his wife have already cheated on each other, with Demelza kissing naval officer Hugh Armitage, played by Burberry model Josh Whitehouse, in the final episode of series three.It came after she was told that Ross had kissed Elizabeth Warleggan, his first love and former fiancee.BBC made me a mincing camp joke but what\u0027s so funny about...If only he\u0027d been selling ice cream too!

The plant is pictured above on Tuesday But local activists, who for decades have argued the power plant should never have been built in a residential area, and have filed multiple lawsuits challenging its placement on Kilauea volcano, claim the danger is clear and present.Activist Kalikolehua Kanaele of the protector group Aloha Aina (Love the Living God), told DailyMail.com: \u0027This has been the greatest concern of this community for 50 years.\u0027If the wells break the gas could ignite and there could be a huge explosion. It\u0027s a ticking time bomb and we always knew this situation could arise. We just hope that a disaster can be averted and nobody gets hurt.\u0027Kanaele, 68, and others say the wells, which run as deep as 8,000ft, pose a serious risk from the lava if they overheat or are breached by underground seismic activity.If the wells break, they could release tons of flammable and toxic hydrogen sulfide into the air around the current evacuation zone, which is already choked with volcanic smog. The gas has the potential to cause huge explosions and winds could spark an emergency evacuation covering a 10-mile radius.This past two weeks the Puna district has been hit with as many as 140 smaller earthquakes every day.The PGV plant is 15 miles from the heart of the volcano, but while Ormat Technologies Inc – which runs the facility - last week insisted there was little risk of the lava reaching it, everyone\u0027s worst nightmare is coming true.Lava erupts several feet into the air in Leilani Estates area near Pahoa, Hawaii on Wednesday   A satellite photo shows lava coming out of fissures caused by Kilauea volcano, running towards the Puna coast, lower right, along Malama Ki Forest Reserve recreation area in Pahoa, Hawaii   This Wednesday photo provided by the U.S. Geological Survey shows the active fissure complex near Pahoa, Hawaii Tourism officials cheered news that a Norwegian Cruise Lines ship that tours the Hawaiian Islands would resume stopping in Kailua-Kona next week. Businesses catering to tourists on the cruise have been hurt since the company suspended Big Island port visits after the eruption began.The company said it would resume calling on Hilo, a town on the eastern side of the island closer to the lava, when conditions allow."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/23/12/0553BBDE000007D0-0-image-m-37_1527073990347.jpg","title":"Deutsche Bank slash thousands jobs control costs","story":"A flag for Deutsche Bank flies outside the German bank\u0027s New York offices on Wall StreetThe bank employs approximately 8,500 staff in London.Deutsche Bank has struggled with high costs and troubles with regulators over recent years.The bank replaced its CEO in April after three years of annual losses and lagging progress in streamlining its operations.Share this articleNew CEO Christian Sewing has said the bank will refocus on its European and German customer base and cut back on costlier, riskier operations where it does not hold a leading position in the market.Sewing said the bank is still committed to its international investment banking operations but must \u0027concentrate on what we truly do well.\u0027 The new strategy means stepping back from decades of global expansion in which the bank sought to compete with Wall Street rivals such as Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase.

Warren Air Force Base in Wyoming entrusted to protect nuclear missiles, a drug ring operated undetected for nearly a yea          Fourteen airmen were reprimanded. Six of them were convicted in courts martial of LSD use or distribution or both.None of the airmen was accused of using drugs on duty. Yet it\u0027s another blow to the reputation of the Air Force\u0027s nuclear missile corps, which is capable of unleashing hell in the form of Minuteman 3 intercontinental ballistic missiles, or ICBMs. Although seen by some as a backwater of the US military, the missile force has returned to the spotlight as President Donald Trump has called for strengthening US nuclear firepower and exchanged threats last year with North Korea. The administration\u0027s nuclear strategy calls for hundreds of billions of dollars in new spending in coming decades.The service members accused of involvement in the LSD ring were from the 90th Missile Wing, which operates one-third of the 400 Minuteman 3 missiles that stand \u0027on alert\u0027 247 in underground silos scattered across the northern Great Plains.\u0027Ready to fight TONIGHT\u0027: Trump\u0027s Pentagon ramps up the...Kim GHOSTED us, says Trump\u0027s secretary of state after...North Korea \u0027blows up its nuclear test site\u0027 in series of...Pentagon withdraws China\u0027s invitation to major US military...Share this articleDocuments obtained by the AP over the past two years through the Freedom of Information Act tell a sordid tale of off-duty use of LSD, cocaine and other drugs in 2015 and 2016 by airmen who were supposed to be held to strict behavioral standards because of their role in securing the weapons.In response to AP inquiries, an Air Force spokesman, Lt. Col. Uriah L. Orland, said the drug activity took place during off-duty hours. \u0027There are multiple checks to ensure airmen who report for duty are not under the influence of alcohol or drugs and are able to execute the mission safely, securely and effectively,\u0027 he said.Airman 1st Class Tommy N. Ashworth was among those who used LSD supplied by colleagues with connections to civilian drug dealers.\u0027I felt paranoia, panic\u0027 for hours after taking a hit of acid, Ashworth said under oath at his court martial. He confessed to using LSD three times while off duty. The first time, in the summer of 2015, shook him up. \u0027I didn\u0027t know if I was going to die that night or not,\u0027 he said as a witness at another airman\u0027s drug trial. Recalling another episode with LSD, he said it felt \u0027almost as if I was going to have like a heart attack or a heat stroke.\u0027Airman Basic Kyle S. Morrison acknowledged at his court martial that under the influence of LSD he could not have responded if recalled to duty in a nuclear security emergency.In prosecuting the cases at F.E. Warren, the Air Force asserted that LSD users can experience \u0027profound effects\u0027 from even small amounts. It said common psychological effects include \u0027paranoia, fear and panic, unwanted and overwhelming feelings, unwanted life-changing spiritual experiences, and flashbacks.\u0027It\u0027s unclear how long before being on duty any of the airmen had taken LSD, which stands for lysergic acid diethylamide. The drug became popularized as \u0027acid\u0027 in the 1960s, and views since then have been widely split on its mental health risks. Although illegal in the US, it had been showing up so infrequently in drug tests across the military that in December 2006 the Pentagon eliminated LSD screening from standard drug-testing procedures.   At least six airmen from the 790th Missile Security Forces Squadron were buying, distributing or using the illegal hallucinogen, LSD. In this February 2016 photo, members of the unit demonstrate their training for recapturing a Minuteman missile siloAn internal Pentagon memo at the time said that over the previous three years only four positive specimens had been identified in 2.1million specimens screened for LSD.Yet Air Force investigators found those implicated in the F.E. Warren drug ring used LSD on base and off, at least twice at outdoor gatherings. Some also snorted cocaine and used ecstasy. Civilians joined them in the LSD use, including some who had recently left Air Force service, according to two officials with knowledge of the investigation. The Air Force declined to discuss this.Airman 1st Class Nickolos A. Harris, said to be the leader of the drug ring, testified that he had no trouble getting LSD and other drugs from civilian sources. He pleaded guilty to using and distributing LSD and using ecstasy, cocaine and marijuana.He acknowledged using LSD eight times and distributing LSD multiple times to fellow airmen at parties in Denver and other locations from spring 2015 to early 2016.\u0027I absolutely just loved altering my mind,\u0027 he told the military judge, blaming his decisions to use hallucinogens and other drugs on his addictive personality.Other airmen testified that it was easy to obtain LSD in a liquid form spread on small tabs of perforated white paper. Airmen ingested at least one tab by placing it on their tongue. In one episode summarized by a military judge at Harris\u0027 court martial, he and other airmen watched YouTube videos and \u0027then went longboarding on the streets of Denver while high on LSD.\u0027Harris was sentenced to 12 months in jail and other penalties, but under a pretrial agreement he avoided a punitive discharge. The lead prosecutor in that case, Air Force Capt. C. Rhodes Berry, had argued Harris should be locked up for 42 months, including nine months for the \u0027aggravating circumstance\u0027 of undercutting public trust by using hallucinogens and other drugs on a nuclear weapons base.\u0027I cannot think of anything more aggravating than being the ringleader of a drug ring on F.E. Warren Air Force Base,\u0027 Berry said at the courts martial.In all, the AP obtained transcripts of seven courts martial proceedings, plus related documents. They provide vivid descriptions of LSD trips.\u0027I\u0027m dying!\u0027 one airman is quoted as exclaiming, followed by \u0027When is this going to end?\u0027 during a \u0027bad trip\u0027 on LSD in February 2016 at Curt Gowdy State Park, about 20 miles west of Cheyenne, where F.E. Warren is located. A portion of that episode was video-recorded by one member of the group a transcript of the audio was included in court records.Others said they enjoyed the drug.\u0027Minutes felt like hours, colors seemed more vibrant and clear,\u0027 Morrison testified. \u0027In general, I felt more alive.\u0027 He said he had used LSD in high school, which could have disqualified him from Air Force service he said that his recruiter told him he should lie about it and that lying about prior drug use was \u0027normal\u0027 in the Air Force.At his court martial, Morrison acknowledged distributing LSD on the missile base in February 2016. A month later, when summoned for questioning by the Air Force Office of Special Investigations, Morrison confessed and became an informant for the agency, an arrangement the Air Force said yielded legally admissible evidence against 10 other airmen. Under a pretrial agreement, he agreed to testify against other airmen and avoided a punitive discharge. He was sentenced to five months\u0027 confinement, 15 days of hard labor and loss of $5,200 in pay.Most of the airmen involved were members of two related security units at F.E. Warren - the 790th Missile Security Forces Squadron and the 90th Security Forces Squadron. Together, they are responsible for the security and defense of the nuclear weapons there as well as the missile complex.By coincidence, the No. 2 Pentagon official at the time, Robert Work, visited F.E. Warren one month before the drug investigation became public. Accompanied by an AP reporter, he watched as airmen of the 790th Missile Security Forces Squadron - whose members at the time included Harris, the accused leader of the drug ring - demonstrated how they would force their way into and regain control of a captured missile silo.Work, the deputy defense secretary, was there to assess progress in fixing problems in the ICBM force identified by then-Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, who ordered an investigation after the AP reported on personnel, resource, training and leadership problems in 2013-14. Those problems included the firing of the general in charge of the entire ICBM force for inappropriate behavior the Air Force said was linked to alcohol abuse. A month later the AP revealed that an unpublished study prepared for the Air Force found \u0027burnout\u0027 among nuclear missile launch officers and evidence of broader behavioral problems, including sexual assaults and domestic violence. Air Force officials say the force has since rebounded.In an interview, Work said he was not aware during his visit that anything was amiss. Nor was he briefed later on the investigation. He said he wouldn\u0027t have expected to be briefed unless the Air Force found that LSD or other illegal drugs were a \u0027systemic problem\u0027 for the nuclear force, beyond the security forces group at F.E. Warren.Work said he had never heard of LSD use anywhere in the nuclear workforce.For the inexperienced members of the drug ring, Harris, the ringleader, had set out several \u0027rules\u0027 for LSD use at a gathering of several airmen in a Cheyenne apartment in late 2015 that was recorded on video. Rule No. 1: \u0027No social media at all.\u0027 He added: \u0027No bad trips. Everybody\u0027s happy right now. Let\u0027s keep it that way.\u0027But social media proved their undoing. In March 2016, one member posted a Snapchat video of himself smoking marijuana, setting Air Force investigators on their trail.As the investigators closed in, one of the accused, Airman 1st Class Devin R. Hagarty, grabbed a backpack and cash, text-messaged his mother that he loved her, turned off his cellphone and fled to Mexico. \u0027I started panicking,\u0027 he told a military judge after giving himself up and being charged with desertion.The Air Force said Hagarty was the first convicted deserter from an ICBM base since January 2013. In court, he admitted using LSD four times in 2015-16 and distributing it once, and he said he had deserted with the intention of never returning. He also admitted to using cocaine, ecstasy and marijuana multiple times. He was sentenced to 13 months in a military jail.In all, disciplinary action was taken against 14 airmen. In addition, two accused airmen were acquitted at courts martial, and three other suspects were not charged."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/23/01/4C8AE92100000578-0-image-a-4_1527034213902.jpg","title":"Syria Kurds announce capture prominent French jihadist","story":"A handout image provided by the Syrian Democratic Forces (left) shows French jihadist Adrien Guihal, known as the voice that claimed 2016 attacks in France for the Islamic State group.

My parents ignited my property bug. When I was in my early 20s they gave me a plot of land next to their home and said I could do what I wanted with it. Battling for planning permission and studying plans allowed me to see the potential for investment. I sold it a few years later at a good profit.We bought a property in Cheshire three years ago for £850,000. I razed the ugly house and started again.We spent £500,000 building our perfect family home — four bedrooms, each with an en suite. It is now worth double what we paid and we love it. We bought the villa in Portugal in 2008 after falling in love with the area while visiting friends and built it from the ground up. It is a two-acre estate. It has four bedrooms, all en suite, with a pool and an outside kitchen and bar. It is worth around €3 million.We rent out the villa when we are not there.

The family lives in Cambridge and also have properties in Anglesey and St Lucia. Sarah, 45, says:After a trying day juggling the demands of five children, I like to let my mind wander. It doesn’t have to go too far: just to the beaches of Anglesey or the azure sea of St Lucia. And I can do that — and still be at home!I got on the property ladder after I was awarded financial compensation. I’d been badly injured in a hit-and-run accident in London in 1995.The sum I received just about allowed us to put a deposit on our first property in West London. It was while I was renovating the flat, enjoying experimenting with fabrics and colours, that I realised I could earn a living from design and interiors.

Yet during that time I was renovating our next home — another London flat. We sold up and moved to Cambridge in 2013, before our youngest child was born. Our detached home there is modern and practical with six bedrooms, an open-plan kitchen, dining room and living room, all painted in bright colours. It’s cosy, family chaos, but also big enough for us to all come together and have our own space, too.I’ve been going to Anglesey on holiday since I was a child. It’s a really special area for me.We bought our place there in the village of Rhoscolyn, in 2015. I think a family home is different from a holiday home. It took me a year to get it how I like it: now it’s a stunning New England beach- style house which can sleep 12. It even has a hot tub. I rent it out when we’re not there.          Sarah can let her mind wander with guaranteed sunshine at a property in St Lucia (pictured)          The home in Rhoscolyn which they bought in 2015. Sarah had often visited Anglesey as a childThe St Lucia property was an obvious choice because it is somewhere we have loved going and meeting friends for years.With guaranteed sunshine, it’s also a place where my husband can truly switch off.There was land for sale in 2016, so we went for it. It took a year to build our four-bedroom, four-bathroom home.The children all have their favourite place. As for me, wherever my family is is where I want to be at that moment.  Jane Sayce, 59, is a marketing agent, and lives with her partner, Paul, 52, an electrician. She has two children Cassie, 32, and Joshua, 33, and a grandson Zae, one. She has homes in Cyprus, Shropshire and Cleethorpes. Jane says:Ever since I was a little girl growing up in a council house in the Midlands I always knew I’d have a property overseas one day.And I was right. Today, I still get a rush of pleasure waking up to azure blue skies and a twinkling, inviting swimming pool — and ending the day with something chilled and gorgeous, as I watch the sun go down.This is the life I adore in Cyprus for five months of the year.

When I returned to the UK, I married and raised my family. I’m one of life’s grafters and so when the children finally flew the nest, I set about making my dream a reality. I sold my UK property in Staffordshire and used the proceeds to buy a place off plan in Cyprus.It took three years to build my three-bedroom dream home in the sun. I’d fly out to see the progress and gradually fell in love with the Cypriot way of life. I’m not someone who ulges the costs involved, as I regard that as personal.When it was ready three years later, I sold my house in Staffordshire and moved here full-time. Not everyone was here in Paphos permanently and before long people began to ask me to manage their property. I found it was something I not only enjoyed, but was good at.I went from managing eight to then launching my own company and marketing approximately 100 holiday homes, although today I have scaled the business back to 80 properties.

Empty homes account for 2.5 per cent of the dwelling stock.The document reported: ‘The number of owner-occupied dwellings increased between 2014 and 2017 after a period of decline. The proportion of dwellings in owner-occupation increased steadily from the 1980s to 2002 when it reached its peak of 69.5 per cent.

Investors did. BT’s share price fell by a third in a rising stock market and sits at its lowest level since 2012. The idend was merely held, making a nonsense of the chief executive Gavin Patterson’s confidence a couple of years ago that double-digit increases were in prospect. Staff, too, may be less than cheerful. Some 13,000 are about to lose their jobs as Patterson confronts the fact that BT’s revenues are falling again.But, no, it turns out that 2017-18 was a triumph, at least in the boardroom. The victory wasn’t the maximum possible under the terms of the executive bonus scheme but the outcome was “above target”, says the annual report. Even Patterson seems to have sensed that finding looks perverse because he volunteered for an “at target” score, meaning his bonus was £1.3m not the £1.6m that the mechanical formula said it should be.Come on, though, awarding a £1m-plus bonus in these circumstances to a boss on a guaranteed basic whack of £997,000 is ridiculous. The pay formula may record BT performing wonders on cash flow and “customer experience” but, when the share price has more than halved in two years, a remuneration committee chaired by the former BSkyB boss Tony Ball should be asking whether it is measuring the right things.A further prompt should have come from BT’s three-year incentive scheme, which paid out nothing and thus gave a reading closer to shareholders’ misery. BT was 20th out of 23 in a league table of peers judged by shareholder returns, missed its cash-flow target by £1.7bn and was miles off on revenues. This disconnect between the three-year scheme and the single-year bonus plan seems to have escaped Ball’s committee.The Competition and Markets Authority may have the audit market on its mind (after Carillion, it should) but here’s another inquiry worth doing – and more urgently. Heathrow Hub, which is the lower-cost scheme that would expand the airport by extending the existing northern runway, wants the CMA to investigate whether the owners of Heathrow have unfairly favoured their own more expensive £14bn plan to build a third runway.It is a pressing subject for two reasons. First, MPs are due to vote on Heathrow’s expansion in the summer. Second, the transport secretary, Chris Grayling, made an alarming statement at a select committee hearing in February that should have caused a bigger fuss.Grayling, who favours Heathrow’s proposal, said: “I have to say that the extended runway proposal is a very innovative one. At the end of the day … the biggest issue for us was that the promoters of that scheme could not secure from Heathrow a written guarantee that if we picked it they would do it. That seemed to be a fairly fundamental problem for us.”One can understand Grayling’s desire to be pragmatic. If the parliament votes for more capacity at Heathrow, it has to be confident the work will be done. But surely the first question is: which scheme is fundamentally better?The Airports Commission in 2015 opted for Heathrow’s third runway, calling the Hub idea “imaginative” and “viable” but “less attractive from a noise perspective” among other factors. Since then a furious debate has raged about whether the commission got the correct data on noise and safety, and made fair comparisons on capacity. That’s one for the technical experts but there is sufficient uncertainty for Grayling to switch sides credibly if he so wishes.That is why the Hub’s claim that Heathrow “abused its dominant market position” by, in effect, vetoing a rival’s cheaper and quicker proposal is serious. Heathrow denies the allegation but it would remove all suspicion if its owners – an international consortium led by Spanish group Ferrovial and the Qatar Investment Authority – committed to build whatever scheme parliament approves and survives the likely judicial reviews. That guarantee ought to be easy to give. The CMA should establish the facts. This air around Heathrow is bad enough without this lingering row."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f8fba307a2fb6471debb326968d456a45ad43655/0_389_2776_1665/master/2776.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b3896ee5ed61757e86eb244e118a2fb8","title":"tall stories the weird world of hong kong kowloon rooftops in pictures romain jacquet lagrez concrete stories","story":"From badminton to bonsai pruning to a precarious nap, it’s all going on high above the packed streets of Kowloon, Hong Kong.

A Life in Pattern, opening in London on Saturday at the Fashion and Textiles Museum, is the first exhibition dedicated to the Dublin-born designer, whose breakthrough came in the mid 90s with her iconic laminated bags that featured a simplified plant print in bright and bold colours.“I hope that visitors will take away a sense that our type of print is much, much bigger than Stem and that the body of work is more than they ever imagined,” says Kiely, who has had a close hand in the curation of the exhibition. Cue hand-drawn blooms, abstract animal designs, playful plant shapes and geometric forms.Over the past 23 years, Kiely’s eponymous label has, of course, evolved into more than a bag and fashion brand. In fact, it is as recognised – if not more so – now for its interior design and homewares, all of which is celebrated in the retrospective. Homeware currently accounts for about half of the brand’s sales, with the iconic enamel plant pot recently going though the one million sales mark.Kiely worked with the textile historian Mary Schoeser and the museum’s head of exhibitions, Dennis Nothdruft, to play with scale in order to maximise the impact of her plant-based patterns. As such, giant oversized mannequins wearing bespoke dresses will be displayed beside their miniature counterparts and there will be “an immersive installation” where visitors will “be absorbed in the kaleidoscopic colours and rhythms” of Kiely’s design world. Her mood boards, methods and processes will also be explored in detail.The exhibition’s timing is apt, given the frequency at which the lifestyle and fashion industries increasingly collide. Now, it’s common place for a fashion designer to have a collaboration with an artist on the side, or a cushion to be sold alongside a coat, yet Kiely was one of the first to spread her net. Her early influences of Mary Quant, Biba and Betty Jackson growing up in Ireland and the inspiration she has mined from Danish design, cinema and photography since, have translated as effortlessly to what you’ll find in your wardrobe as they have the kitchen cupboard since day one.Kiely attributes this to finding the right balance between consistency (“We don’t really follow trends, we do what we like and what we feel is nice for the season, so we’re on our own journey”) and reinvention – the latter of which is most keenly felt on the fashion front.Kiely is about to release her fourth fashion collaboration with the stylist Leith Clarke, L’Orla, which has seen a new generation of fans flock to the brand, led by style influencers such as Alexa Chung, Keira Knightley and the Duchess of Cambridge.“We are always looking to inspire ourselves we don’t rest and think, ‘Oh, that was incredible last season, let’s just do another version of that’. We’re constantly building, recreating and working with people who are really inspirational,” says Kiely.“Somehow, our prints have an uplifting effect,” she says, “and make people smile.”Orla Kiely: A Life In Pattern is on at The Fashion and Textile Museum from Saturday 25 May to 23 September 2018."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6dc1cc7e8ff9251178916019c5614c629a70e275/0_309_4208_2526/master/4208.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=59183d9e7b27c6f5f8c5aa7850cd5811","title":"chicken decapitation battered cats hollywood animal cruelty","story":"The sight of a duckling having its foot prised off in Lars von Trier’s new film sent Cannes audiences scurrying. But it’s nothing compared to these real-life horrorsIf I am not looking forward to Lars von Trier’s The House That Jack Built when it eventually comes to UK screens, it is not because of the violence against women and children that helped earn the film an early round of disgusted reviews. No, what really fills me with dread is the prospect of seeing a duckling having its leg torn off with pliers.Even after Peta weighed in to confirm that Von Trier didn’t really torture a duckling (the effect was achieved “using movie magic and silicone parts”), the idea leaves me feeling queasy. (Regardless, the film itself sent guests scurrying for the exit during its international premiere at Cannes earlier this month). Half a century of watching horror movies may have accustomed me to misogynistic violence on screen (which is not to say I enjoy it), but it hasn’t inured me to the mistreatment of animals.Had Von Trier really tortured that duckling, he would have been following in a long and dishonourable tradition of auteurs treating animals even more badly than they treat actresses. Andrei Tarkovsky had a horse shot in the neck and pushed down a flight of stairs in Andrei Rublev (1966). Jean-Luc Godard filmed a pig having its throat cut for Weekend (1967). Chickens were decapitated in Sam Peckinpah’s Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid (1973). Bernardo Bertolucci’s 1900 (1976) contains scenes of frogs being tortured and a terrified cat being strung up so that Donald Sutherland can crush it to death with his head. The director cuts away from the act (thank heaven) and I like to think Sutherland didn’t really kill the cat, but the Italians do have previous form in this regard. The writer Curzio Malaparte, in a 1943 essay about Mussolini, describes a traditional Tuscan holiday entertainment in which working-class men, hands tied behind their backs, would batter cats to death with their shaven heads.Francis Ford Coppola incorporated footage of a water buffalo being hacked to death in Apocalypse Now (1979). Béla Tarr’s Sátántangó (1994) shows a cat being manhandled Tarr insisted the cat wasn’t harmed, but clearly he wasn’t concerned about showing it being swung around by its forepaws. Between takes of Park Chan-Wook’s revenge thriller Oldboy (2003), the actor Choi Min-Sik, a “devout Buddhist”, was caught on film apologising to the live octopuses he was eating – which makes you think of Lewis Carroll’s Walrus, weeping for the oysters he is devouring.But then both films come trailing notoriety, having once been classed as “video nasties”. The extras on both re-releases include interviews in which the films’ respective directors awkwardly address the animal cruelty. Martino says: “In a way, it was a constructed scene because we put the monkey and python together, but we didn’t plan for that to be the ending … So it was really unpleasant to watch.”It is here that many cinephiles, including me, find ourselves faced with a dilemma. On the one hand, we are vehemently opposed to censorship. We are also aware that animals die every day to feed us, and we wear leather shoes. On the other hand, I would rather not watch scenes of animal cruelty, and if this makes me a hypocrite, so be it. It is upsetting enough watching a deer being swallowed by a python on one of David Attenborough’s nature specials, but Attenborough himself drew the line at reality-show contestants killing crocodiles, pigs and turkeys “just to get a shot”.Humans have been abusing animals for entertainment since the dawn of time, and film-makers haven’t shown themselves any more principled than bear-baiters or bullfighters. The otherwise admirable stunt pioneer Yakima Canutt invented a device called “The Running W”, which brought down galloping horses, often injuring or killing them in the process. At least 25 horses were killed or had to be put down during filming of The Charge of the Light Brigade (1936), so enraging Errol Flynn, the film’s star, that he attacked his director, Michael Curtiz. Such was the public outcry when a horse broke its spine after being ridden off a 70ft cliff during filming of Jesse James (1939) that American Humane (AH, the US equivalent of the RSPCA) was finally tasked with overseeing the treatment of animals on Hollywood sets.Even then, it seems AH’s trademarked seal of approval is no guarantee that “No animals were harmed”. While researching my book Cats on Film, I found claims that at least 20 cats died during the production of Koneko Monogatari (1986), a Japanese film about a ginger and white kitten and his pug pal, retitled by US distributors as The Adventures of Milo and Otis, with a voiceover by Dudley Moore. AH gave it a thumbs up, and the rumours have never been verified, but it is obvious when you watch the film that animals are frequently in distress. The BBFC cut 16 seconds from the film and gave it a U certificate, but outtakes of a cat “falling” off a cliff and desperately trying to scrabble out of the sea to safety are enough to make me never want to see it again.And here I am being hypocritical again, because while I balk at cruelty to kittens or ducklings, I can just about tolerate non-cuddly scorpions and ants being set on fire in The Wild Bunch (1969) or horrible reptiles hacked to bits in Cannibal Ferox. But hooray for CGI, which now makes any sort of real animal torture redundant. “Today, I’d film those scenes in a different way,” Lenzi admits in his interview on Cannibal Ferox’s Blu-Ray release. “I’d probably re-do it now with more help from the special FX department.”Anne Billson is the author of Cats on Film"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/91e75edaf77629dabaa38e69996eec6298cace2b/90_81_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c229143e8fab482f2d6f05b92df99d69","title":"liverpool step up pursuit lyon 70m rated nabil fekir","story":"• Forward has been named in France’s World Cup squad• Reds keen to replace departed Philippe CoutinhoLiverpool will step up their pursuit of Nabil Fekir after the Champions League final as they look to secure the £70m-rated Lyon captain before the World Cup.Fekir, who has played as an attacking midfielder and forward for his hometown club, is a major summer target for Jürgen Klopp with the Liverpool manager yet to replace Philippe Coutinho.Liverpool’s finances will also be swelled by around £70m for reaching Saturday’sChampions League final against Real Madrid.Klopp has already signed Naby Keita from Red Bull Leipzig for this summer, with the Guinea midfielder costing £52.75m, but is keen to strengthen his midfield options in order to challenge Manchester City for next season’s Premier League title.The 24-year-old Fekir has enjoyed another excellent season in France and earned a call-up to Didier Deschamps’ World Cup squad.

On Saturday he aims to deliver on a promise to spare his childhood friend the despair and disbelief that accompanied Liverpool’s triumph in Istanbul. The gift set will be complete when he brings a European Cup winner’s medal back home.“I remember AC Milan v Liverpool in 2005,” Mané explains. “Three-nil down, then 3-3 and penalties. This was a big memory for me. I was watching in my village, Bambali. I remember being with my friend, a big friend of mine, and at 3-0 down he was completely out of it. He stopped watching and ran like crazy to get away. Then he came back at the end and he could not believe it. Even to this day he cannot believe it. He came back after the game when Liverpool had won.”Mané dissolves into laughter at the 13-year-old memory, half his lifetime ago. The Liverpool forward laughed at his friend’s antics at the time – “I was not supporting Liverpool then, I was a Barcelona fan,” he admits – but thoughts of the club’s eighth European Cup final appearance stir pride. “If you had said then I would be playing the final I would say it is something incredible in my life,” he says. “Hopefully we are going to win.”Bambali, bedecked in red, will be united behind the Senegal forward against Real Madrid in Kiev. Their pride in Mané’s rise to global stardom is not lost on the 26-year‑old, who remains in regular contact with family and friends back home, including the one who missed the comeback that secured Liverpool’s last Champions League triumph. “I spoke to him yesterday,” Mané says. “He is a big Liverpool fan. He is still in Senegal. His name is Youssouph Diatta. He asked me that this time do not be 3-0 down.“Nobody in the village will work this day. My family still live in the village. My mum and my uncle. They are all going to be watching. There are 2,000 in the village. I bought 300 Liverpool jerseys to send to the people in the village so the fans can wear them to watch the final. I will be going back in the summer after the World Cup and hopefully I will be showing everyone a winner’s\u0026nbspmedal.”Istanbul staged the most famous rapid-fire Liverpool performance of all, with three goals in six second‑half minutes stunning Milan en route to the club’s fifth European Cup. But devastating bursts of firepower have been such a feature of Liverpool’s Champions League campaign under Jürgen Klopp that not even a Real team pushing for a hat-trick of titles provoke fear.Liverpool scored three goals in 12 minutes in the play-off against Hoffenheim, three goals in 16 minutes and two in another five‑minute spell against Maribor, two in nine at Sevilla and three in 15 minutes plus two in four against Spartak Moscow at Anfield. And that was just the group stage. Porto, Manchester City and Roma were all in effect banished from the knockout phase before they could identify the threat and regroup.He adds: “I am just thinking it is incredible to be in the final, not about pressure. I’m just happy and excited. It is the best time for the whole squad to play.“We are in the best shape there is no tiredness. This kind of game does not happen all the time and it is one of the most important of a career. It will not be easy. They have experience and are one of the best teams in the world, but we have quality and can beat any team in the world.”Liverpool are leading scorers in this season’s Champions League with 40 goals (excluding the six against Hoffenheim in the play‑off). Mané, Roberto Firmino and Mohamed Salah are responsible for 29 of them. It is a record that invites comparisons between Liverpool’s fearsome front three and the prodigious Real attack of Cristiano Ronaldo and Karim Benzema, albeit not from Mané himself.“You can write this, I didn’t say it,” he adds. “We are happy people name us at this level. Thank you for the compliment. It is something we have been working hard on to play in this Champions League. I am always honoured to play alongside these great players. People talk about the front three but it is the whole team that makes us better. They did a great job behind to help us score goals. It makes us happy.” A feeling no doubt shared in Bambali."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d847a8bbd1fa3b1b09b2b9e329769542834440cc/0_143_4930_2957/master/4930.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=81b627d06b5642f79fc1fffbbd702851","title":"wolfsburg lyon womens champions league final match report","story":"Lyon’s right-back Lucy Bronze described becoming the first England player to win the Champions League in its current format as “the best thing I’ve done to date.”Goals from Amandine Henry, Eugénie Le Sommer, Ada Hegerberg and Camille Abily handed Lyon their third consecutive Champions League title after they had fallen behind in an action-packed extra time.After a dull 90 minutes with the score at 0-0, the game sprung to life in style when a deflected strike from the Wolfsburg forward Pernille Harder, massively against the run of play, was followed by Henry’s top corner strike from a wonderful Hegerberg chip. In between Harder’s goal and the leveller, Wolfsburg had gone down to ten as Alexandra Popp picked up a second yellow for a rash challenge on Delphine Cascarino. The fresh legs of Shanice van de Sanden then sealed the tie for the French side as she three times raced clear on the right, first providing the assist for Le Sommer, then for an unmarked Hegerberg – her record-breaking 15th Champions League goal in a single campaign – and finally for Abily, on her final appearance for Lyon at 33.Lyon had dominated in normal time and had felt aggrieved when a Le Sommer header seemed to cross the line, only to be waved away. “Watching their goal go in was heartbreaking, and having just had a goal disallowed that definitely crossed the line was a very up and down situation,” said Bronze.“We push for more and more in these big games. Lyon and Wolfsburg are trendsetting and pushing women’s football. We do as much as we can as players on the pitch, but we need the referee and goalline technology to be up to standard as well,” she added.Bronze was full of praise for the Lyon substitutes, particularly the former Liverpool player Van de Sanden, whose pace was just too much for the exhausted legs of the German side. “Shanice was a game changer in the end, she got three out of four assists, came on and made the difference with the pace she’s got getting in behind. Both teams were tiring and she’s so energetic, works so hard and won us the game. She deserves every credit.”This was the third meeting of the two sides in a Champions League final. Both previous encounters were tight affairs in 2013 only Martina Müller’s penalty for Wolfsburg at Stamford Bridge could separate the European giants, and in 2016 Lyon won on penalties.The first chance of this match fell to Lyon after five minutes, after Griedge M’Bock Bathy was brought down in the middle of the park. A swung-in free-kick fell to Henry but her shot bounced clear off a Wolfsburg body. Minutes later, up the other end, Popp’s ball across the front of Sarah Bouhaddi’s goal was teasingly out of reach of the incoming Ewa Pajor.The tree-lined Valeriy Lobanovskyi Stadium was close to empty shortly before the whistle, perhaps thanks to heavy security. However, 35 minutes into the match the little 17,000-seater was heaving, mainly with locals.Lyon edged the first 45 with the tricky winger Amel Majri and the left-back Selma Bacha causing plenty of trouble for Anna Blässe on the left.However, the half had failed to light up, half chances and misplaced passes the order of the day. After 15 minutes Lyon began to up the pressure a little, and a Dzsenifer Marozsán corner was cleared as far as Bronze, whose volley went wide.With the Wolfsburg defence resolute and well organised, Lyon were forced to try their luck from distance, a swerving shot from the left-hand corner of the box by a frustrated Marozsán comfortably collected by Almuth Schult. As the half drew to a close, Harder, the heartbeat of the Wolfsburg attack, was increasingly forced to go deeper to get the ball.With Wolfsburg struggling to make anything happen, their manager, Stephan Lerch, swapped the winger Caroline Graham Hansen for Tessa Wullaert at the break to try to shake things up. An uneventful opening to the second half was brought to an abrupt halt when Sara Bjork Gunnarsdóttir crumpled to the ground, on her own, clearly in pain – the exertions of the German cup final win after extra time and penalties at the weekend starting to show in the legs of the players.Lyon spent much of the second period camped in the opposition half and they were denied a breakthrough in the 69th minute when a corner from the left found Henry, who flicked the ball goalwards. Replays seemed to show the ball crossed the line, but Noelle Maritz cleared and the referee waved away appeals. Lyon kept pushing for what would surely be a winner. Cascarino, on for the bright Bacha, sent in a low cross but Le Sommer’s shot was nicely saved by Schult.Wolfsburg came out fighting in extra time, as Harder raced forward and her deflected strike from outside the box gave the German side a surprising lead. It was then that the game exploded. Popp received her second yellow before Hegerberg’s lovely chip found the onrushing Henry, who put the ball into the top of the net. Moments later the holders took the lead as Van de Sanden raced down the right and her cross was met by Le Sommer to poke past the keeper.With Wolfsburg forced to push forward they were left even more exposed, and again, Van de Sanden found an unmarked Hegerberg to put the game out of an exhausted Wolfsburg’s reach in the first half of added time. Then Abily put a lovely curling strike beyond Schult with two minutes to play, giving her an emotional send-off as she rounded off Lyon’s record fifth European title, one she said was “amazing, I couldn’t hope for a better end. I came in and scored and we won, it was a perfect night for me.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3dd7722f85def4e3f18a542dc683a68f90cc2255/0_0_3598_2160/master/3598.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d578db01843dcae3c38b2d0b3e0577f8","title":"detroit become human review","story":"Playstation 4 Quantic DreamSonyThe human v android setup is hackneyed, but this choose-your-own-adventure-style descent into a near-future Detroit is served up with spellbinding artistryWith a gargantuan 4,000-page script, it is a near-miracle that Detroit: Become Human manages to tell a single coherent story at all. Yet this choose-your-own-adventure-style video game, in which humans live alongside an oppressed android workforce, has hundreds of potential storylines. Gradual, ever-developing and interwoven tales lead towards a myriad of endings. So vast is the scope of this mammoth work of interactive fiction that each person who plays it may have a close to unique experience. Indeed, the way that the story bends and morphs around the player is much more interesting than the story itself.Decisions have weight: do you pursue a rogue android across a busy highway, or let it escape? Do you choose to go against an android character’s programming, or comply with its human masters? Main characters can perish, cutting off their narrative completely. Whole scenes – hours of play – can be missed because of a single, seemingly insignificant decision. The variety of choices, and where they lead, is staggering. Detroit: Beyond Human opens up the bonnet, allowing players to see their path through the game on a branching tree diagram, and return later to direct their characters towards a different fate. Once the credits rolled, I could look back at what I had missed I doubt I had even experienced a fifth of this intertwined, spider-webbing multiverse the first time around.You play as three androids. Kara, or AX400, is a subservient housekeeper at the mercy of an abusive owner. Markus has a deep love for his ailing artist “owner”, but whether that translates into sympathy for humankind is your decision to make. The most intriguing character is Connor, as his stake in the inevitable human-android class war is less clear-cut. This robot detective is a professional traitor, programmed to hunt rogue androids who kill or harm humans, often taking him to dingy, Se7en-esque homicide crime scenes.These androids have to work out how (or whether) to free themselves in a human-run society that treats them with fear and hostility.Players are promised the ability to co-write these stories, but too often you feel trapped on train-tracks, able to pull levers to go down different routes, but unable to jump off altogether. In a game that forces you to consider free will at every turn, I repeatedly came to the conclusion that mine was limited. Adding to that frustration, hefty choices can be made almost by accident. In dialogue, you are regularly presented with four one-word reply options and what you choose decides fundamental aspects of your characters, such whether they are cold-hearted killers or inspiring leaders. While this adds gravity to your decisions, it can leave you feeling out of control. In my first playthrough, I ended up pushing all three characters into situations I did not intend to.Although stories are branching, all are wrapped around a central theme of inevitable android-human conflict, a somewhat overdone subject. Adding to unoriginality of the main plot and are some eye-rolling tropes, with forced references to race and class inserted for dramatic effect. Androids, for example, have to sit at the back of a bus. And one story strand pulls up disturbing parallels with history that many will find unnecessarily distressing. At one point, I genuinely encountered the line, “But who’s the real monster here?”Luckily, top-rate actors including Lance Henriksen, who already played an android in the Alien franchise (though this time he is human), carry each scene. And four years of meticulous motion capture and exacting cinematography is where Detroit: Become Human feels like a revolutionary achievement for video games.Countless late nights have gone into the levels, which are better described as film sets. Each room and prop is unique. Skin has pores, and drops splatter the faces of androids, which eerily don’t react. Tiles on a mouldy ceiling in a motel are inidually made. Fibres are visible in the upholstery of a piano stool. Office buildings have defibrillators. I spent a full five minutes admiring the details of a robot vacuum cleaner.Lighting is some of the most atmospheric in any game, and cameras do not merely hover but are directed continuously like a movie, with different filming styles to fit each of the three characters. Though it sells itself as an unrestricted story, some of Detroit’s best parts are the most tightly directed scenes. At one point, you can hack an android receptionist to bypass security. But if you run off to continue to the mission, you won’t see her eyes dart around the room in bewilderment as she visibly attempts to grapple with what just happened. The sum of these tiny touches is a credible future world, carried along by an impressive orchestral score.Detroit: Become Human is a spectacularly crafted game that bends and branches out around the player’s choices in an astonishing and unparalleled way. Although hampered by tired central plots and some predictable, occasionally hokey storytelling, the result is a technical feat in video game development and a meticulously detailed cinematic achievement."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a6ea89122b31b52033a74c13ecd08af030921d4a/0_88_3891_2335/master/3891.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=570c75d753c9b494f05e7df08fa56387","title":"ben stokes jos buttler england pakistan first test","story":"Joe Root’s side have now been dismissed for under 250 in seven of the 14 Test innings they have played since SeptemberSeems new dawns last longer in the Arctic winter than they do in English cricket. At Lord’s their latest broke at around 3.30pm, when Jos Buttler walked out to join Ben Stokes in the middle, then set again 40 minutes later when Stokes was dismissed leg-before and Buttler was caught at second slip. By 4.30pm, England were all out for 184. They had lost six wickets for 35 runs in 63 balls. Sudden and short as it all was, the mayhem lasted long enough to make one thing clear – whatever was wrong with the team’s batting in the winter, it hasn’t been fixed in the spring.It was the seventh time England had been dismissed for under 250 in the 14 innings they have played since they were last at Lord’s, when they beat the West Indies here in September. So much for home comforts. The green, green grass here wasn’t any easier or more forgiving than the hard surfaces of Brisbane and Perth, or any of the other spots where they were routed last winter.The conditions were tricky, the ground damp, the air thick and muggy, closed over with grey cloud, and Pakistan’s attack, four men with the knack of moving the ball this way and that, was well suited to it.Alastair Cook, at least, played well for his 70, all clanking straight-drives and neat clips and flicks off his legs. He looked like a batsman who had his game in order. His top-order team-mates, though, all fell to rash attacking strokes and sloppy prods, bad shots to good balls. Joe Root was caught flashing at a wide ball, Mark Stoneman’s defence was picked apart by a straight one, Dawid Malan was caught off the edge of a dangling bat and Jonny Bairstow bowled by a fine delivery that beat him on the outside. So in came Stokes. He asserted himself by collaring some clumpy drives, brute-force thwacks through cover and down the ground.The meaty crack of Stokes’s bat is so unmistakable that you would likely pick the shots as his even with your eyes shut. It’s crash-bang-wallop batting. There were five fours in his first 24 runs, and then a hearty heave-ho six off Pakistan’s young spinner Shadab Khan. Cook was out in the over after, beaten, brilliantly, by Mohammad Amir. The shock and disappointment the English fans felt at his dismissal was tempered by the fact that it bought Buttler to the crease for the first time in Test cricket since England were thrashed by India at Chennai in December 2016.When Stokes came back into the one-day squad in February, Buttler said there was a “back-to-school feel” about the squad. And you could feel that here, too. There was a flush of childish excitement when they came together, an expectant clamour in the stands. The promise of Buttler and Stokes batting together is enough to justify even Lord’s asking prices. They must be as potent and preternaturally talented a pair as England have ever fielded together at No 6 and No 7.It was only a fortnight ago that Buttler and Stokes were batting at the Wankhede Stadium, for the Rajasthan Royals against the Mumbai Indians. The two of them have come straight from the IPL to Test cricket. Between them they have hardly had a sight of a red ball in nine months. Stokes has played two first-class games since September, England’s two Tests in New Zealand, and Buttler hasn’t played any at all. He has spent the winter playing white ball cricket for England and an assortment of T20 sides, Rajasthan, the Sydney Thunder, the Comilla Victorians. It showed.Buttler threw his bat hard at his very first ball, chopped it just past his stumps and scurried a quick single. He followed that with a paddle sweep off Khan, and then a pair of breathtaking shots for four, a rubber-wristed flick to mid-wicket and a vicious jab down the ground. It was brilliant while it lasted, which wasn’t long. In the second over after tea Stokes was startled to find himself out leg-before on review. Moments later Buttler was surprised to find he was caught. It’s likely been a long time since anyone set him a second slip. Asad Shafiq clung on to a shot that might have taken his head clean off if he had misjudged it.For all the talk about how England’s new national selector, Ed Smith, was going to use statistical analysis to inform his decisions, Buttler seems more like a gut pick. As if, just like every other English cricket lover, Smith believes that Buttler is so gifted that he can’t but succeed in Test cricket. Buttler says the last time he was in the Test team he made the mistake of thinking he had to play differently. He says Smith and Root have been encouraging him to treat Test and T20 cricket in the very same way. “Whatever colour the ball is,” he says, “I’ve just got to go and play …” Which sounds fine. In theory."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/733ddd3872310a02ebc689d88a3a1919a3154f23/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5d87207ed84a0644f96bf66adc3dddfb","title":"sharent trap should parents put their children on social media instagram","story":"It’s more and more usual for people to share pictures of their children online – and some have even turned it into a lucrative business. Is it always wrong to mix kids and social media?Follow some bloggers or Instagram stars and you will know more about their children than you do about the children of your closest friends and relatives. You will see them sleeping or having tantrums in their swimsuits in paddling pools or having their nappies changed. You will see their mealtimes, their holidays and what they looked like on Christmas morning. You may have seen them in the minutes after they were born, umbilical cord still attached, and perhaps even before they embarked on this childhood of unwitting digital documentation, in a fuzzy black-and-white ultrasound picture. The ethics of this – publishing photographs of one’s children to build a social media following, and then monetising it – have always been shady, but the issue has been amplified this week.On Mumsnet over the past few months, there have been active threads criticising parenting bloggers or “influencers” – that euphemism for advertisers – mainly about the transparency of sponsored posts and advertising content, but also about the perceived exploitation of their children. The account of one Instagram-user, Clemmie Hooper, was taken down this week and though it is unclear who took it down and why – there were allegations of abusive comments under a post – she has in the past attracted criticism for the use of her children. Hooper’s account, Mother of Daughters, had nearly 470,000 followers and documented life with her four girls. The account of her husband, Simon Hooper, who runs Father of Daughters for his 845,000 followers, is still running – and his posts almost always feature one or more of his daughters. The couple have been singled out this week – neither would comment for this piece – but they are far from the only ones.So is sharing pictures online of our children something we should be worrying about? “In an age of visibility, it is important that parents discuss the pros and cons of sharing with their children, even when quite young,” says Sonia Livingstone, professor of social psychology in the department of media and communications at the LSE, and one of the project’s researchers. “We interviewed several families where even small children wished their parents would share fewer photos, and consult them more. We observed in a few families that children are even learning to tell their parents to stop. But insofar as this sharing is to bring families together, even when geographically dispersed, there are also advantages, and children appreciate those, too. It’s a matter of respect and consent, and protecting that is important, more than the actual fact of sharing itself.”Are generations of children now growing up without privacy? “I don’t think so,” she says. “The conditions of their privacy are changing, partly because of their own actions, partly others’. What will matter to children is to feel they have agency, respect and dignity – that’s at the heart of privacy. So anyone sharing or using their images should prioritise this.”Genevieve von Lob, clinical psychologist and author of Five Deep Breaths: The Power of Mindful Parenting, says: “More and more parents are questioning the wisdom of posting so much about their kids online. The pictures that are uploaded can form a permanent digital tattoo. Because it’s all so new for parents, we need to start thinking about asking children’s permission to post online.”If you think about how children are being profiled on the basis of social media images, there is a real riskMost children won’t have the finances to bring a court case, “and a child is normally not considered to have the capacity to bring legal proceedings themselves”. And the implications of such a case on family relationships could be disastrous. Bessant prefers the idea of educating parents and children “so there can be a dialogue at an earlier age. I’ve done research talking to parents about how they share information and what they think privacy is and there are a number of parents who said that once their children start to say, ‘I don’t want those photographs out there’, they would be quite willing to either not post at all, or only post once they have spoken to their kids.”Veronica Barassi, a media and communications lecturer at Goldsmith’s, University of London who is leading the Child Data Citizen research project, says “there is a moral panic” about sharing pictures online. However, she admits there are dangers. “If you think about big data and how children are being profiled on the basis of social media images, there is a real risk. I’m particularly interested in things like facial recognition: the way in which that data is sold, and the lack of transparency, is the most worrying aspect of so-called sharenting.”It’s important that parents consider the long-term implications for their child of having a highly visible digital footprintWhat, then, should parents do? Those setting out with the intention of making themselves and their children famous are one thing. “It’s important that parents consider carefully the long-term implications for their child of having a highly visible and widely shared digital footprint,” says Livingstone. “In our interviews with parent bloggers, we found they were becoming more conscious of this, and often taking care only to present their child in a positive light. Of course, it’s possible that this too could be problematic, creating an ideal self that the child must live up to.”As for the rest of us, who have no intention of using photographs of our toddlers to advertise a nappy brand but are still exposing them online, consent is key and “can begin very early,” she says. “Perhaps sharing should be kept to a minimum early on. Sharing photos with a handful of friends and family is one thing. Sharing on public sites is quite another, and I’m not sure parents should do that at all.”Much of it is common sense, says Bex Lewis, senior lecturer in digital marketing at Manchester politan University and author of Raising Children in a Digital Age. “Try not to put their school uniform in, try not to show that you have a regular pattern every day.” Most parents, you would hope, wouldn’t post pictures of their children naked but there are other things parents should perhaps think twice about. It is probably not fair, she says, to show pictures of a child having a meltdown, “although those are quite funny to watch”. Turn off geotagging, which tells internet users where you are, and lock down your privacy settings.

The former Apprentice contestant was in South Africa to produce a film about the treatment of white farmers when the two incidents happened, both of which were publicised on her social media accounts. One picture posted to her Twitter account showed Hopkins being resuscitated by paramedics after collapsing in the street after taking the ketamine, which she uses to reduce pain in a dislocated shoulder.Two days later she posted a separate video from Johannesburg airport in which she claimed she would miss her flight home because “my passport has been marked for spreading racial hatred here in South Africa”.She complained the Mirror had conflated the two issues in its original headline.The Mirror argued its reporting was accurate but later added a correction to the story which the newspaper felt made the chain of events clearer: “A previous version of this article suggested that Katie Hopkins was stopped from leaving South Africa because of the consumption of ketamine. We are happy to clarify that Ms Hopkins was detained for spreading racial hatred, which took place after the ketamine incident.”Hopkins took her case to the press regulator IPSO, arguing the update was not enough to “correct the misleading impression given to the millions of people who had been misinformed by the original headline”. She was concerned most readers would believe she had been detained for taking drugs, rather than alleged racism.Following an investigation the press regulator sided with Hopkins and concluded the original headline gave “the significantly misleading impression that the reason for the detention had been the consumption of ketamine”.As a result they concluded the Mirror had failed to take care over the accuracy of the piece and upheld the complaint."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cd926972de1f98c4633c72a1b8918102bdc492d4/0_139_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bac571dd63d68d9b2dab8e9c6dc206ed","title":"readers recommend share great solo performances","story":"Nominate in the comments and a reader will pick the best eligible tracks for a playlist next week – you have until Monday 28 MayAnything goes this week – so long as it’s a single person performing throughout, with instrumentals also welcome.

The Northern Irishman’s 67 marked only the seventh time in 25 attempts that he has returned a sub-70 scorecard in the tournament. His post-round annoyance stemmed from the fact this appeared to be the highest number he could have posted.McIlroy’s second shot to the par-five 18th was disrupted by an errant camera click. Irritation over that moment had just subsided when the 29-year-old missed a three-foot birdie putt. Such a troubled finish didn’t at all represent what had gone before.“These things happen, I’m sure he didn’t mean it,” said McIlroy, who received an apology from the photographer in question in perfect grace. “It’s a tough enough shot without something going off at the top of your swing, but it’s fine.“I think I did everything pretty well out there. I thought I gave myself a lot of chances, I took most of them. I’m a little frustrated I couldn’t get a birdie or two out of the last couple of holes but, overall, a really good start.”McIlroy dropped two shots, both on the front nine, with seven birdies more than atoning for that. After a low-key display at the Wells Fargo Championship and a missed cut at the Players Championship, this marked a sharp improvement. An early Friday tee-time affords opportunity to make further statements in this, an event McIlroy won in stunning fashion four years ago. “If I can hit the ball like I did today over the next three days, I think I’ll be right there,” he added. “I played a lot better today than I have done the last couple of weeks so it’s a good step in the right direction.”By close of play McIlroy trailed the pacesetting Lucas Bjerregaard by two shots. The Dane had played the outward nine in just 31 strokes while the South African duo Dean Burmester and Darren Fichardt pieced together fine 66s.Matthew Fitzpatrick, like McIlroy, signed for a 67, as did Richard Bland. The 45-year-old Bland has not won on the European Tour since joining in 2002. Shane Lowry was five-under on the 18th but an encounter with bushes and a lake meant the Irishman took seven and had to make do with a 69. Ian Poulter’s complex relationship with Wentworth continued as he slid to a 74."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b9ed340b48d38d88730ed413559a78e4a7bd4121/0_16_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c3eaa192e1314bb11bc6688369737df7","title":"super league castleford st helens match report","story":"• Castleford 18-40 St Helens• Barba a cut above to reinforce claim for Man of Steel awardNights like these are becoming all too common for the Super League leaders, St Helens, but you suspect the novelty is nowhere near wearing off yet. By the end, this was a familiar story, a dominant all-round performance spearheaded by the brilliance of Ben Barba – however, this victory carried extra significance, you feel.Only twice throughout the entirety of last season were Castleford beaten here St Helens have achieved that themselves in the last fortnight, following their victory in the Challenge Cup. That, if anything, underlines just how far ahead Justin Holbrook’s side are of the field at present.Hearts will have been in mouths midway through the second half here when Barba hobbled off after long since assuring another victory for the Saints. His odds surely continue to shorten for the Man of Steel award after this latest performance.How relieved St Helens fans will have been to hear Holbrook deliver a reassuring post-match update on the full-back, saying: “He’s fine, he’s just got a couple of bumps and bruises.” With a Challenge Cup quarter-final against Hull a week away, those words may have been the most welcome of the night for the supporters.The fact Castleford dominated last year’s regular season – much like the Saints are doing this – and ultimately failed to win the Grand Final should at least provide hope to them, and the rest, that things can change come play-off season but this was a chastening evening for them.A late flurry of tries aside, which added some respectability to the scoreline, they were well-beaten. “Players have got to be able to do their jobs better,” said the Castleford coach, Daryl Powell. “Too many of our players have to change if we are to have a chance of doing anything.”In effect, victory felt assured for the Saints by half-time, when they were leading 22-4 thanks to four wonderful tries, the pick of which was a sensational inidual effort from Barba, who raced the length of the field. He was ably assisted by the stand-off, Jonny Lomax, who will have done his England hopes no harm with this performance.Barba’s departure failed to stunt their attacking prowess while Jake Trueman and Oliver Holmes were among Castleford’s late scorers.The Saints finished the scoring with two wonderful breaks that were both finished by Théo Fages as their dominance at the Super League summit continued."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f183d9937a705b78a19c48d286edd2031e262242/149_311_5091_3054/master/5091.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=773dcc18600aac09386e55787cc05f9e","title":"amazon alexa recorded conversation","story":"The company, which has insisted its Echo devices aren’t always recording, has confirmed the audio was sentNo matter how suspicious it has seemed that Amazon is encouraging us to put listening devices in every room of our homes, the company has always said that its Echo assistants are not listening in on or recording conversations. Over and over again, company spokespeople have promised that they only start recording if someone says the wake word: “Alexa”.It’s a spiel Danielle, an Alexa user from Portland, Oregon, had believed. She’d installed Echo devices and smart bulbs in every room in her house, accepting Amazon’s claims that they were not invading her privacy. But today she asked the company to investigate after an Alexa device recorded a private conversation between her and her husband and sent it to a random number in their address book without their permission.Danielle found out her Alexa was recording when she received an alarming call from one of her husband’s colleagues saying: “Unplug your Alexa devices right now, you’re being hacked.”She told KIRO-TV in Seattle that at first she didn’t believe the co-worker, but then she said: “You sat there talking about hardwood floors.” Danielle realised the colleague must have heard everything.“I felt invaded,” she told KIRO-TV. “A total privacy invasion. Immediately, I said, ‘I’m never plugging that device in again because I can’t trust it.’”An Amazon customer service representative confirmed that Danielle’s audio had been sent to the number and apologised but didn’t provide any information about why the device had been activated. A spokesperson for the company said it had “determined this was an extremely rare occurrence”.At 6pm ET on Thursday, an Amazon spokesperson provided an updated statement with an explanation for why they believe Alexa forwarded the conversation. They said: Recognising the improbability of this series of mishaps occuring, they added: “As unlikely as this string of events is, we are evaluating options to make this case even less likely.”Although Amazon maintains this was a malfunction rather than proof Alexa is always listening, the company has filed patent applications in the past for functionalities that involve always listening, such as an algorithm that would analyse when people say they “love” or “bought” something. The patent included a diagram where two people have a phone conversation and were served afterwards with separate targeted advertisements."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5a3e5a1014d2a13599ce02cad6ad907319da1350/0_63_4798_2879/master/4798.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5842d06022490070adabe3b1e504fea2","title":"sites block eu users before gdpr takes effect","story":"Some companies push new onerous terms of service on users as GDPR rules come into force on FridayDozens of websites shut down their activities completely, others forced users to agree to new terms of service, and inboxes have been flooded with emails begging customers to remain on mailing lists as the GDPR rules come into force on Friday.The biggest update in data protection laws since the 1990s is posing major challenges for developers and businesses – while giving substantial new powers to consumers.Margot James, the digital minister, told the : “Of the eight guiding principles that governed the use of personal information under the old act, we have made an important addition – accountability. In the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, UK citizens more than ever need reassurances their data is as safe as it can be and that organisations are accountable for it.”She said businesses would now have to prove they had been given permission to use a inidual’s information, including contact details.“Except in certain, limited instances, organisations now must demonstrate they have our explicit consent to process our sensitive personal data. Generally, we’ve also given greater control to the British public over how their data is used. No doubt like me you’ll have received a flurry of emails in recent weeks from the organisations currently holding your data, and perhaps some you weren’t even aware did, asking for you to re-submit this consent.”The cascade of emails from businesses has become the most visible consumer-facing effect of the new regulation, sent by firms who want users to actively give their consent to remain on a mailing list. But, according to the Information Commissioner’s Office, such emails aren’t necessary to comply with the law.“Some of the myths we’ve heard are, ‘GDPR means I won’t be able to send my newsletter out anymore’ or ‘GDPR says I’ll need to get fresh consent for everything I do’,” Steve Wood, the deputy information commissioner, wrote on the organisation’s website earlier this month. “I can say categorically that these are wrong … You do not need to automatically refresh all existing consents in preparation for the new law.”Campaign groups and political parties who have come to rely on large email mailing lists to contact supporters could find they lose one of their main ways of communicating with the public. It has been suggested that businesses could be forced turn to more traditional methods – such as targeting customers with direct mail through the postal system – to reach customers.As the GDPR deadline neared, some websites and services started to push users to agree to onerous new terms of service before they could continue on to their destination. Websites run by Oath, the media firm formed through the merger of Yahoo! and AOL, received a blanket request on Thursday morning, asking users for consent “to use your … data to understand your interests and personalise and measure ads”. Users could click OK to move on, or follow a chain of further links to discover that the consent granted involved sharing data with more than a hundred ad networks. Another Oath site, Tumblr, placed a similar clickthrough before users. The blogging platform did offer some links to understand “how our partners use this data”. However, even this background information was hosted on Tumblr blogs, meaning users had to accept the terms in order to read information about the terms they were accepting. The US media network NPR took a simpler approach. Users could either agree to the new terms, or decline and be taken to a plain-text version of the site, looking for all the world like it had last been updated in 1996.It wasn’t just websites. PC hardware maker Razer issued an update to one of its computer mice, warning that users may find their devices weren’t working if they didn’t update Chinese smart-home manufacturer Yeelight disabled inter-connected lightbulbs because of the data protection regulation.And a growing number of companies are taking the nuclear option to ensure compliance: blocking all European users from their servers.Instapaper, a service owned by the US firm Pinterest which enables users to save articles to read at a later date, became the latest to disconnect European customers on Thursday. It said the cutoff was temporary while it made the required changes, and told users: “We apologise for any inconvenience, and we intend to restore access as soon as possible.” Pinterest did not respond to a request for comment.Other companies have taken a more permanent approach. Unroll.me, an inbox management firm, announced it was completely withdrawing services for EU companies due to an inability to offer its product – which is monetised by selling insights gleaned from reading users’ emails – in a way that was compatible with EU law. “We are truly sorry that we are unable to offer our service to you,” the company told EU users.American media network A+E has blocked EU visitors from all its websites, including History, and some multiplayer online games, including Ragnarok Online, have switched off their EU servers.Other firms have not gone so far as to blame the new regulation but have closed EU operations with convenient timing. Crowdpac, a political fundraising organisation set up by David Cameron’s former advisor Steve Hilton, announced it was closing its UK wing “for business reasons” until further notice. The company, which was still raising funds in the UK as recently as Sunday, now says it “hopes one day to be back”.Klout, a social media analytics service, and Super Monday Night Combat, an online game, will shut down on Friday. Lithium, the owner of Klout, said: “Klout no longer made sense as a standalone service. The upcoming deadline for GDPR implementation simply expedited our plans to sunset Klout.”Brian Honan, a data protection expert, said he viewed the shutdowns as a reasonable consequence of the new law. “The GDPR’s primary goal is to enhance the protections around the gathering and processing of the personal data belonging to iniduals residing within the European Union,” he said.“Companies have had well over two years to prepare for the enforcement date and to be ready.”Unfortunately, even going to the extremes of blocking every user based in the EU might not be enough to inure companies from the consequences of GDPR: the law applies to data processed on EU citizens wherever they are based in the world."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd512b80ed87fc2a914a40202e9815438b11ece0/0_967_4788_2873/master/4788.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4075921392701613db38e872b3ab65d6","title":"onenote evernote which is best for small business organise files smartphone tablet","story":"Matt’s dad wants to organise files and make them accessible via his phone and tablet. Which program should he choose?My dad runs a small business and has problems organising his files – Word documents, PDFs, photos – alongside his emails. He wants to be able to easily save the emails and files in folders in date order in a single place. He also wants the folders to be accessible from anywhere on his phoneiPad.I’ve tried simply saving the emails and documents into a single folder on his Mac, but this is a huge pain for the amount of emails he receives. MattOne of the advantages of the digitisation of information is that we can now store many different kinds of data together. Videos and sound recordings now sit happily alongside letters, photos, paper receipts and invoices instead of in separate ledgers or folders, or on different physical media such as cassette tapes, CDs, DVDs etc.Whether it’s worth adding emails is another matter, and I don’t think many people bother. You can, of course, save emails as text files or PDFs and add them to project folders. This works for a small number of emails, but – as you have found – it’s too much work to handle all emails that way. In any case, you can usually find the same emails by looking in a mail folder, or by searching for an email address or a job number. (Always include a job number in emails if a project involves working with different people in different companies.)If your dad wants to access his files from anywhere with a smartphone or a tablet, then he will probably need to put copies online. The simplest way to do this is to upload project folders to an online storage service such as Dropbox, Microsoft OneDrive, Google Drive or whatever. However, he’d still have to use different programs to access some different types of data.An interesting alternative is to store everything in a sort of portmanteau program that will also help organise it. The leading examples are Evernote and Microsoft’s OneNote. These are about as close as you can get to a “paperless office”, at least for a sufficiently small office.Outlook even had a “save to OneNote” feature that made it easier to file emails with other data, but it has gone missing – temporarily, I hope – from the latest version. Otherwise, both programs allow you add emails to your notebooks by almost identical means. First, you can forward them to an email address, so you could set up mail rules to forward selected emails to OneNote or Evernote. Second, you can “print” them to a OneNote or Evernote notebook instead of to a physical printer. It’s very tedious to do more than a few.Still, you can also add things like receipts and business cards by, in effect, using your smartphone as a scanner. Example apps include Microsoft’s Office Lens with OneNote and Scannable or Scantastic with Evernote.The OneNote v Evernote debate has been long and sometimes heated, but they are different products, and each does some things better than the other. If you want to clip web pages and share notes then Evernote is the clear winner.However, I think OneNote might be the better choice for your dad, because its hierarchical structure is logical and almost infinitely expandable. It works like an old-school ring binder or filing cabinet. (It’s very popular in schools.)You can open as many notebooks as you like, and give them all names. Inside a notebook, you can create as many tabs as you like, for different projects. Inside each tab, you can have as many pages as you like.It’s probably easier to get going with Evernote because you can treat it like a slop-bucket and find whatever you need by searching for it. (Yes, Evernote does have notebooks, and you can create stacks of them, but the point stands.) OneNote requires more setting up to work well, but its structured approach may be a better match for your dad’s business purposes.Both OneNote and Evernote are available as free web applications and as apps, so you can try them to see which you like. Just open an email account at Outlook – you don’t have to give your real name or any personal details – and you can use OneNote until you fill up your 5GB of free OneDrive space. If you find it does the job, you can increase the storage to 50GB for £1.99 per month.There are also free OneNote apps for the Mac, iOS, Windows and Android.In the same way, you can try Evernote, and its associated apps. The drawback is that the free Basic version does not have all the features of the Premium version, and is limited to 60MB of uploads per month. To make a proper comparison, you would need to pay £44.99 per year for the Premium version, which allows 10GB of uploads. (The Plus version has been discontinued.)Alternatively, you could sign up for a free trial of Evernote Business, which costs £10.99 per user per month. This is aimed at teams, but it includes Evernote Premium as well. You can compare the features online.OneNote’s other advantage is that it’s integrated into Microsoft Office, and gets third party support from sites like Onetastic. Not everyone cares about Office integration, but most large organisations run on it, and your mention of Word suggests that your dad already uses it.If your dad has Office 2016, then he already has a copy of the desktop version of OneNote. This version can create and store files locally, while also working online.People who already have Office 2016 can subscribe to Office 365 Business Essentials for £3.80 plus VAT per month. That doesn’t include support, but it does include the standard 1TB of online storage, which is enough for most people’s work files.The Office 365 Business version (£7.90 plus VAT per month) adds downloads of the full Office programs plus 247 phone and web support. The Premium version (£9.40 plus VAT per month) adds a custom domain email address plus extra features such as Microsoft Invoicing, Microsoft Bookings, Microsoft Planner and Outlook Customer Manager.Evernote has dominated this category of software on the Mac for two main reasons. First, Microsoft took more than a decade to add OneNote to the Mac version of Office: it appeared on Windows in 2003 – five years before Evernote – and on Mac in 2014. Second, the Mac version has never had the full capabilities of the Windows version. This is annoying even if you don’t really need the missing features.Unfortunately, the Mac version will never catch up. In fact, OneNote 2016 will be the last desktop version for either platform, and Microsoft has already stopped updating it. Worse, it has made the free versions of OneNote 2016 impossible to find, and I did try. (Like all the free versions, these can only store notebooks in OneDrive.)Instead, Microsoft is pushing users towards the app version, which is provided as standard in Windows 10. This sacrifices features such as Outlook integration, Onetastic compatibility, and the ability to create OneNote notebooks on local devices (though notebooks are cached locally).Last month, William Devereux from Microsoft’s OneNote team claimed that the app would be better than the desktop version – it has many new features – and that it would be consistent across the various platforms (web, Mac, iOS, and Android). A scan through the comments shows how well that claim went down.You may find the app does what you need. If not, bear in mind that OneNote 2016 will only be supported until 14 October, 2025.Have you got a question?

It takes Rich and two other men to roll the animal off the sled and on to the ice, while his wife and young children watch.His sister, Natasha Pottle, who shot the bear the night before, hands her brother the plastic bags used to store liver, hair and fat samples that will be sent away for lab testing. The animal will provide valuable information for Labrador’s biologists, a small windfall for his family and meat for the community. Rich has barely begun cutting into the hide when a parade of people from the village start arriving to take pictures, offer observations or just watch respectfully.“When you get a bear, everyone in town knows it,” Rich said.Scenes like this are being repeated up and down the rugged, remote coast this year. Despite vanishing sea ice and shorter, milder winters, Labrador’s polar bear population is actually growing – which means a bigger harvesting quota for Inuit hunters.There are more than 2,500 polar bears in the vast coastal area that includes Labrador and northern Quebec, according to Environment Canada – far more than was expected earlier in the millennium – and further signs the bears continue to rebound despite the impacts of climate change.Indeed, although scientists and Inuit sometimes clash over the estimates, the polar bear population of coastal Labrador is among the healthiest in the world.“When I grew up, a polar bear was kind of this mythical creature because you didn’t see them very often. You didn’t hear tell of people seeing them,” said Jim Goudie, wildlife manager for Nunatsiavut, the regional indigenous self-government.“This abundance of polar bears is not something my father’s generation grew up with. It’s only since the mid-80s there’s been the boom. Now there’s polar bears everywhere.”The reason, biologists suspect, is the boom in the harp seal population. As Newfoundland’s seal fishery has collapsed under international pressure, the harp seals of the north-west Atlantic have proliferated. They now number about 7.4 million animals – more then seven times the population in the 1970s.That has created a veritable feast for Labrador’s polar bears, who have shifted their diet from ring seals to their more southerly, promiscuous cousins.“They jumped on the harp seal boom,” Goudie said. “They appear to have adapted for this moment in time … We’re seeing them further south than in the past.”Labrador’s Inuit have hunted polar bears for thousands of years. But only recently have they been able to so carefully monitor and protect the population, thanks to a unique, indigenous-run conservation program managed by Nunatsiavut.The bear shot by Pottle was one of 12 killed by Inuit hunters this season under Nunatsiavut’s quota system, which doles out bear hunting licences through a lottery. A hunter has one week to get a bear before the licence expires and is transferred to another person. Only Inuit residents can apply for a licence, and it’s illegal to sell a licence to a big game hunter who is not from the region.In Inuit culture, a polar bear remains a deeply respected animal, called Nanuk in the Inuktitut language, and getting one is still considered the mark of a great hunter. The harvest remains such an important part of local tradition that it has its own statute in Nunatsiavut’s land claim with the federal government.But Pottle isn’t putting on any airs. Shooting her first polar bear was a terrifying experience, she said.“I was scared,” she said. “It was intense. We chased the tracks out on to the ice and there he was. Then our Ski-Doo stalled and he started coming toward us. That’s when I started calling for my brother.”Her brother, carrying the rifle on his back, circled around to keep the animal at a safer distance. Then he handed the gun to Natasha and told her to shoot.“She was crying, and I said: ‘What’s wrong?’ She said she’s never going polar bear hunting again,” he said. “I said: ‘It’s your licence. You’ve got to shoot it.’”The bear meat will be ided up and shared among the region’s community freezer program, which provides food for the elderly and others who can’t hunt for themselves. Wasting the meat is prohibited by Nunatsiavut law. Failure to share the meat or submit samples for testing means a hunter can be banned for five years.Inuit hunters can sell a bear pelt for $4,000 to $5,000 to a local taxidermist, who will auction it off to buyers around the world. In previous decades, when the international market for pelts was booming, the same bearskin could fetch as much as $30,000. Under Nunatsiavut’s program, a computer chip is embedded in the pelt to prove it was harvested through a legal hunt.Much like the coastal Inuit themselves, the polar bear’s world relies heavily on reliable, vast expanses of sea ice. As the region’s sea ice vanishes because of warming oceans and milder winters, the bear has had to adapt. The animals appear to be thriving, but winter is becoming increasingly unpredictable.The loss of sea ice has been dramatic, according to climatologist Robert Way. He points to the Canadian Ice Service historical database, which shows Nunatsiavut’s northern region has lost about a third of its ice cover in the past decade.Conservationists say the Nunatsiavut model is a lesson for other regions trying to manage their polar bear population. Goudie argues the Inuit, sometimes criticized by animal rights activists for allowing the bear hunt, have a vested interest in preserving the polar bears that live among them.“For Inuit, it would be like losing an entire piece of their culture,” he said."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Younger people tend to be poorer at turning out on election day, as does rural IrelandUK proposals to maintain regulatory alignment with EU for limited time are a \u0026lsquofantasy\u0026rsquoIreland\u0026rsquos femicide rate on par with those of England, Scotland and WalesAgency tells D\u0026aacuteil committee CervicalCheck \u0026lsquoassertion does not accord with the facts\u0026rsquoEoghan Murphy says attempt to affect result could be made by questioning electoral register procedureFormer TCD professor Gerard Hogan is leading authority on Irish ConstitutionLocal authorities must tell property owners if they will face levy by next FridayNo defined structure at BreastCheck for managing patient information, says HiqaOwner wanted to expand Merchant\u0026rsquos Arch Bar to cater to \u0026lsquobus loads of tourists\u0026rsquo\u0026lsquoI am going to really struggle to come back if it\u0026rsquos a No vote,\u0026rsquo says returned emigrantConference hears of \u0026lsquoexcessive duplication\u0026rsquo with \u0026lsquounnecessary form-filling\u0026rsquo2016 Census showed almost 400,000 people in Ireland live aloneFacebook video appears to show young men attempting to make exahusted pony stand upThree FF TDs indicate they will not back legislation for abortion up to 12 weeksFianna F\u0026aacuteil TD says article by Sammy Wilson and Owen Paterson has no recourse to factsR\u0026oacuteis\u0026iacuten Shortall claims Government \u0026lsquois not going to do anything\u0026rsquo to tackle issueBody of 24-year-old released to her family five days after Mark Hennessy killed herCampaigners used FoI to learn of 2011 Indaver and Department of Environment talksThe winning ticket was bought in Eason outlet in Wilton Shopping Centre, Co Cork"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3507562.1527190001!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"minister worried no campaigners may try to undermine vote","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tEoghan Murphy: the Minister says he has “full confidence in each of the presiding officers in each of our polling stations, that they will be able to do their job properly and accurately”.The Minister with responsibility for the electoral process has said he is “worried” that No campaigners may try to “undermine the integrity” of Friday’s vote on whether the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution should be repealed. Eoghan Murphy, the Minister for Local Government, said some campaigners could be attempting to undermine the referendum result by questioning the referendum process. Earlier this week in the Dáil, Independent Tipperary TD Mattie McGrath – a prominent No voter – said there are “irregularities” with the electoral register, claiming some people had been put on the register without their knowledge. He also asked if “international observers” would monitor the referendum process.Mr McGrath’s claims were rejected by Mr Murphy, and other figures campaigning for a Yes vote.Speaking to The , Mr Murphy said: “We have a very robust electoral process in this country. And I’d be worried that some people on the No side might be trying to undermine the integrity of the outcome by questioning that process and by questioning the procedure by which people get on the register of electors and go out and actually exercise their right and go and vote.“We don’t yet know what the outcome will be. Obviously we are advocating for a Yes and we hope there will be a Yes vote and I fully expect both people on the Yes and No side to respect the outcome of the vote.”Mr McGrath had claimed he had “emails from people all over the country who have been registered in Dublin when they have registered in Mayo, Cork and different places and they did not ask to be registered here”. “There were French students. And I had Majella on to me from Mayo. She was registered in Mayo, and I have confirmation of that, and she is now registered in Dublin, without asking or inquiring. There are irregularities.”He said he had written to Mr Murphy on the issue, and the Minister said he was aware of one incident of someone being added to the register when they should not have been. It did not, Mr Murphy said, mean this person is entitled to vote.A Garda spokesman said issues relating to polling cards are generally referred to local authorities.“If the council realises there is an issue, that cards have been issued fraudulently, then a returning officer would make a complaint to the Garda,” the spokesman said.Some local authorities have maintained that there will always be some slight anomalies in the voter registration process.Mr Murphy said he had “full confidence in each of the presiding officers in each of our polling stations, that they will be able to do their job properly and accurately”.“Where they have any concerns, it is their responsibility to ask questions, to seek identification. That falls to them to do that job but I have confidence in them to do that job and I have confidence in the processes that have been put in place.”Get the latest news and best analysis about the Referendum on the regulation of termination of pregnancy here"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3507678.1527192306!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"irish backstop provisions cannot be used for britain says eu","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritish prime minister Theresa May:  “The UK thinks everything has to change on the EU’s side so that everything can stay the same for the UK,”  a senior EU official said. Photograph: Will OliverEPAProposals that the UK would use the Irish “backstop” provisions in Britain as well as Northern Ireland after Brexit will simply not be acceptable, the EU told British negotiators at talks in Brussels this week.A senior EU official on Thursday night described the proposals from prime minister Theresa May as a “fantasy”.The UK is proposing to maintain regulatory alignment with the whole of the EU for a limited period after transition out of the EU to avoid cutting the North off from the rest of the UK and to obviate the necessity for a border on the Irish Sea.But its negotiators were told during three days of talks here that “regulatory alignment was not available on an all-UK basis”, because it would mean a form of cherry-picking and a breach of fundamental single market rules.And the UK could not be allowed simply to commit to joint all-UK customs controls on a “time-limited basis” because they would “undermine the whole purpose of the guarantee”.The EU official warned that progress on the Irish border – “let alone substantive progress” – was proving “elusive”.The UK is suggesting the withdrawal agreement protocol and its backstop guarantee should include an assumption that an eventual alternative arrangement will be agreed for frictionless borders between the UK and the EU as a whole. But if such an agreement is not forthcoming, officials here say, there must be the backstop provisions to fall back on. Time-limiting their application would remove that guarantee.In the Northern Ireland strand of the discussions, they had made progress on issues such as the single electricity market, and VAT rules, but had not discussed the “crunch” issues of the Border, regulatory alignment and customs.The issue was raised, however, by the UK team in the discussion on the future relationshiptrade agreement, where they said that Ms May was determined to implement the backstop on an all-UK basis “through the overall EU-UK relationship”.The EU team said that the “backstop must be Northern Ireland-specific”.“We have to do away with the fantasy that there is an all-UK solution to this,” the senior official said.A senior official described the talks on the full range of Brexit issues, from Northern Ireland to the future relationship, as frustrating, observing that: “To paraphrase The Leopard by Tomasi di Lampedusa, I have the impression that the UK thinks everything has to change on the EU’s side so that everything can stay the same for the UK.”The  reported senior sources at the Brexit department, however, rejecting the suggestion that Brussels had dismissed the UK’s new backstop plan, suggesting that it was “simply a negotiating position” and that they believed the EU was open to the idea. “It’s a public stance for them to take during the negotiation,” one said.A No 10 source added: “This is what they do every time. As usual we’ve heard it all before. There’s nothing they’ve said which concerns us.”In their discussions of an overall trade deal, the UK rejected the suggestion from the EU of a free trade pact, and pressed their demands for a generalised system of mutual recognition and managed ergence. EU officials said that a system of mutual recognition, however, would not be available outside the single market – it would require higher external levels of trust than internally.-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3507672.1527191618!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"varadkar no vote would send wrong message to women","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Taoiseach Leo Varadkar  with Fine Gael Ministers and colleagues during a final Fine Gael event  calling for a Yes vote. Photograph:  Gareth Chaney CollinsTaoiseach Leo Varadkar has said a Yes vote in the referendum on the Eighth Amendment could help lift the stigma for 170,000 women who have travelled abroad to seek a termination of their pregnancy.Mr Varadkar insisted he was not taking the outcome of the referendum for granted, but said he did not want to contemplate a No vote or what it would mean for women across the country.There has been a legacy of shame in this country, and the passage of this referendum would assist those women, he added. “A No vote would send out the wrong message, not just to women but to society. There has been in Ireland a legacy of shame in many ways. The fact women have had to travel, sometimes in secret, to other jurisdictions to end their pregnancies, and I hope that a Yes vote would end that stigma, and help to take away that legacy of shame that exists in our society.”Fine Gael members advocating a Yes vote gathered for the final time to encourage people to vote Yes. Mr Varadkar was joined by Tánaiste Simon Coveney, Minister for Health Simon Harris, Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe and several others.If there is a Yes vote the Government would publish the final Heads of a Bill to regulate the termination of pregnancy by the summer, and seek to legislate by the end of the year. The three TDs indicated they would not support legislation to allow for abortion up to 12 weeks regardless of the outcome of the referendum. However, they said they may seek to amend the Government’s Bill to allow for terminations in certain circumstances.Mr Breathnach said he hoped it would not be a Yes vote, but if it was he would be looking to legislate for the hard cases.“Common sense should prevail in the cases of fatal foetal abnormalities, rape and incest. I would support that. Most people understand the hard cases. The Dáil should debate that...we have reached a situation where people are in a crisis making their decision.”Ms Butler said she would not halt legislation in the cases of rape, incest and fatal foetal abnormalities. However, she would “never be in agreement with abortion on demand” because “every child has a right to life”.Mr ÓCuív declined to state whether he would support abortions in those cases, stressing his belief that “every human life is of equal worth”. It is understood senior members of Fianna Fail have contacted inidual TDs to “use their influence” to ensure members of the party who support a No vote do not threaten to block the legislation.There have been a number of TDs who claim they will not support the legislation regardless of the outcome of the referendum. One party source said there would be some TDs and Senators who would rush to the media to claim they can stop the legislation. “The message was to try to curb that enthusiasm because it is bad for the party,” the source added. Meanwhile, party leader Micheál Martin urged people to vote Yes .He said he understood this was not black and white, but urged people to vote Yes for women in “traumatic crises, and who want compassionate care in their own country”.Get the latest news and best analysis about the Referendum on the regulation of termination of pregnancy here-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3505414.1527073210!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"remaking a country malaysia s new leaders get to work","story":"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                            Malaysian politician Anwar Ibrahim speaks during a news conference next to his wife Wan Azizah Wan Ismail in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, on May 16th, following his release from prison.

Photograph: Vincent ThianAPMaria Chin Abdullah has faced death threats, detention without trial in solitary confinement and numerous police investigations, as she campaigned against corruption in her native Malaysia. She still faces prosecution for illegal assembly and is banned from travelling to the state of Sarawak in Borneo.Yet Abdullah will today, as she has for the past two weeks, go to work as an MP for Malaysia’s new governing Pakatan Harapan (Alliance of Hope) coalition. The 61-year-old mother of three is a powerful symbol of everything that has changed since the electoral shock on May 9th, when the ruling party was thrown out of power for the first time since independence in 1957.After decades battling human rights abuses by Malaysia’s authoritarian governments, most recently that of former prime minister Najib Razak, she must now confront an arguably bigger challenge: dismantling the old regime and implementing root-and-branch reform in her role as an MP. “For 61 years, it was only criticism but now we have to implement what we say,” says Abdullah. “It’s a tall order as the new coalition is not all homogeneous. Ironing out our differences and the principles of our new democracy will take some years.”The coalition rode a wave of anger against the perceived corruption of the Najib government. It represents one of the most dramatic, bloodless rejections of authoritarian rule in recent global politics, with the United Malays National Organisation (Umno) – in power for more than 60 years – ousted at the ballot box. Even more remarkable is the fact that this reformist revolution was led by former strongman Mahathir Mohamad, prime minister from 1981 to 2003, in alliance with his protégé-turned-nemesis Anwar Ibrahim. As the initial jubilation fades, Mahathir (92), restored as prime minister, faces the monumental task of delivering on his coalition’s promises to repeal repressive laws, reform corrupt institutions and ensure a fairer ision of the economic spoils.Scepticism over his Damascene conversion to participatory democracy is only one of the many hurdles in front of his government.During its long rule, Umno bent the legal system, civil service and state-owned companies to its own ends. But the repression, electoral manipulation and allegations of corruption reached their zenith under Najib, who has been banned from leaving the country after Mahathir launched a new investigation into accusations that billions of dollars were misappropriated from the debt-ridden 1MDB state fund set up by Najib.If Mahathir can get it right, this multi-ethnic nation of 31 million people could become an example in a region beset by repressive governments, reversing a years-long brain drain and transforming the prospects of this emerging market, which has attracted a wide range of global investors.But, from Myanmar to South Africa and Indonesia to Egypt, transitions from authoritarianism to more democratic systems have proved difficult. Anwar, the Pakatan Harapan figurehead freed from prison last week, is under no illusions about the challenge facing him – and Mahathir – if he takes over as prime minister within one or two years, as planned. “I’m a student of history,” he says. “I realise how revolutions and people’s movements have disappointed the masses.”He adds: “The central issue is still governance ... and democratic accountability. We can’t have the election commission involved in a fraudulent exercise, we can’t have the judiciary acting at the behest of the government, we can’t have a media that’s being cowed.”Even critics admit that Mahathir has moved rapidly since he was sworn in on May 10th to start dismantling the system he helped create. The prime minister won a full royal pardon for Anwar, who was first jailed under Mahathir between 1998 and 2004 before he was imprisoned again under Najib in 2015, and secured the departures of the attorney general and head of the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission.He has set up committees to advise on institutional and economic reforms, and to investigate 1MDB, from which at least $4.5 billion was erted and laundered, according to the US Department of Justice.But suspicion remains. Although Mahathir has appointed some leading civil society advocates and technocrats to these committees, he has chosen others, such as economic adviser and former finance minister Daim Zainuddin, who many Malaysians doubt are genuine reformers. His cabinet also contains a mix of opposition stalwarts such as Wan Azizah Wan Ismail, the deputy prime minister and Anwar’s wife, alongside more recent converts to reform such as Muhyiddin Yassin, a former Umno heavyweight and now home affairs minister.Many Pakatan Harapan supporters are giving Mahathir a chance to prove he has changed his spots, after his marshalling of the disparate coalition parties and his popularity with rural Malay voters helped them to win the election against great odds. They say he must maintain the reform momentum in order to keep together his coalition, which includes his Malay-dominated party of Umno defectors, Anwar’s People’s Justice party and the ethnic Chinese-dominated Democratic Action party.“The new government has made a good start but they’re facing a huge task, particularly in terms of legal reform,” says Sevan Doraisamy, executive director of Suaram, a human rights group. Suaram is one of several organisations that waged a decades-long battle to stop the Umno government and the police using vague laws to crush dissent. Last year alone, his organisation documented 155 cases where people faced legal action that violated their freedom of speech and recorded 280 cases of detention without trial under heavily criticised laws. Doraisamy and other activists want the government to institute an immediate moratorium on the use of such laws, before they can be amended or repealed when parliament returns in the next few months. Mahathir showed his new colours by using Twitter to rebuke the police for arresting a man who criticised him on Facebook and promising to review the relevant law when parliament convenes.Amanda Whiting, professor of Malaysian law at the University of Melbourne, says the problem goes far beyond the law itself to a “deeply entrenched” culture of intolerance for criticism and meddling in the judicial process.“There needs to be a cultural shift, they can’t just change the laws,” she says. “There’s a complete lack of trust in some of the major public institutions like the attorney general. There are severe doubts about the probity of decisions made – and the willingness of senior people to bow to pressure – and these are under investigation now.”This culture of corruption, collusion and nepotism has become deeply embedded in Malaysia’s bloated civil service, on which Mahathir has promised to bring the axe, starting with the 17,000 political appointees who served under Najib.Wong Chen, a Pakatan Harapan MP, claims that up to 40 per cent of annual government spending, which is forecast to be $59 billion (€50 billion) this year, is lost to corruption and wastage, with previous Umno governments readily handing out grants and contracts to friendly parties. “The path we need to take is clear,” he says. “The question is: do we have the will?”The allegations of corruption rose markedly under Najib, particularly surrounding 1MDB. At one point, $681 million was paid into Najib’s own bank account, in what he later said was a gift from Saudi royalty, most of which he said he repaid. He has always denied any wrongdoing over 1MDB. Mahathir has gone after his predecessor with zeal, appointing respected anti-graft officials to a task force to investigate possible criminal charges related to the fund. He has authorised the police to conduct extensive searches at properties used by Najib and his family, with several hundred designer handbags and dozens of suitcases full of jewellery, cash and other valuables confiscated from one luxury apartment complex in Kuala Lumpur alone.  Najib’s lawyer has criticised the “cavalier and irresponsible” manner of the police conduct, but Mahathir says the new government is following the rule of law, rather than seeking payback.“If anyone made any mistake, the law will decide, but I’m not going to take revenge in any form,” said Shukri Abdull, the new head of the anti-corruption commission, on Tuesday. The former deputy head of the commission claimed that he was forced out of the organisation during Najib’s reign after receiving death threats for pursuing the 1MDB case. With debt coupons to be paid, Mahathir is under pressure to move fast on 1MDB. New finance minister Lim Guan Eng says that the last government has injected nearly $1.8 billion into 1MDB since April 2017 to cover debt service obligations.“There are a lot of issues,” says one banker in Kuala Lumpur. “They need to identify where all the liabilities are, what shady deals have been done and what is the residual risk.”But Peter Mumford, the Asia director of Eurasia Group, a political risk consultancy, argues that there is a limit to how far the new prime minister will go to tackle corruption. “Mahathir needs to demonstrate he is cleaning up the system, but he will be cautious and selective in draining the swamp,” he says. “There are lots of skeletons in plenty of closets.”The opposition’s anti-graft campaign message was popular because it linked anger at the high cost of living and wide social inequality to the alleged excesses of the Najib administration.In particular, Pakatan Harapan promised to abolish the 6 per cent goods and sales tax introduced by Najib in 2015, to praise from international economists who believed it was wise for the government to ersify its revenue base away from oil production.The GST will be scrapped from June 1st. But the government has yet to come up with concrete plans for how to replace the lost money – which was forecast this year to be around $12 billion, or nearly a fifth of state revenues – or fund other populist pledges, such as reinstating some fuel subsidies and abolishing highway tolls.A senior economic adviser to the government says the rebound in oil prices since 2015 will give Malaysia ample breathing space for now – but not all analysts are convinced.“How are they going to make up for the lost revenues from the GST?” asks Steve Clayton, chief executive of JPMorgan in Malaysia. “There’s a pretty substantial hole to fill.”Mr Mahathir will also have to lay out how he will ensure that the fruits of Malaysia’s rapid economic growth – with gross domestic product expanding by 5.9 per cent last year – are more fairly distributed.Promised reviews – and possible renegotiations – of multibillion-dollar infrastructure projects agreed with the Chinese government as part of President Xi Jinping’s Belt and Road Initiative could help create more local jobs and business opportunities. But redrawing what Mahathir has called “unequal treaties” with China will be tough. Implementing so many sweeping changes at once is complex - and risky. Expectations are high and Malaysians are determined to hold the country’s leaders to account.“Our greatest fear is that the bad habits sneak back in and we end up with UMNO 2.0,” says Baharom, a 52-year-old personal trainer and supporter of Anwar. “But the difference this time is that the people have spoken. If they don’t reform, we will kick them out.”1981: Mahathir Mohamad becomes prime minister for the first time1998: Mahathir sacks Anwar, has him arrested and he is subsequently convicted of corruption and sodomy2003: Mahathir steps down as PM and is replaced by Abdullah Badawi2004: Anwar is released from prison2009: Najib Razak replaces Abdullah as PM and later sets up 1MDB2016: Anwar and Mahathir start reconciliation talks2018 (May): Mahathir elected as PM and frees Anwar, while putting Najib under investigation for corruption – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2018"},{"url":null,"title":"hawaiis erupting kilauea volcano pictures","story":"Kilauea volcano has created nearly two dozen lava-shooting fissures on Hawaii\u0027s Big Island since the eruption began, spewing lava and emitting toxic gases.Thousands have been forced to evacuate their homes and experts remain unsure of where more of the hazardous cracks might open up, or when the volcanic activity might stop.The eruption of Kilauea volcano in Hawaii sparked new safety warnings about toxic gas on the Big Island\u0027s southern coastline after lava began flowing into the ocean and setting off a chemical reaction.North Korea still open to talks with US as Donald Trump threatens Kim Jong-un after scrapping summitBritain to send frigate to the Gulf in most serious naval deployment since 1971Harvey Weinstein \u0026#39to be charged\u0026#39 over sexual misconduct allegationsCalls for junk food to have graphic cigarette-style warnings on packagingKirsty Wark: I\u0026#39ll throw my hat in the ring for Dimbleby\u0026#39s Question Time jobUK \u0026#39chasing fantasy\u0026#39 over plans to avoid hard Irish border, says EUUS denies involvement in Syria missile strike which kills 12 Putin and Macron question Trump\u0026#39s withdrawal from Iran deal and North Korea summitGardener\u0026#39s World presenter Rachel de Thame reveals she is battling breast cancer on live TVHow much water do you use in the morning?The Trouble with M\u0026ampS, review: a lacklustre account of how Marks lost its sparkHumans, series three, episode two review: Thoughtful science fiction with plenty of heart and dramaGDPR fraudsters con people out of thousands with wave of phishing emailsGrenfell survivors claim fire brigade\u0026#39s \u0026#39stay put\u0026#39 advice cost residents chance to escapeThe Grenfell Tower survivors: Lucky to escape, but living with the horror of what they sawVenezuela President Maduro vows to free jailed opposition activistsLorry transporting Batmobile among range of novelty cars engulfed in flames on the M4Property lawyer gets to keep home extension despite having no planning permission New helicopter fleet for Royal MarinesParachute trial: Emile Cilliers cheated and lied but proved irresistible to womenComment: Donald Trump\u0026#39s letter to North Korea is not madness.

The enduring commitment demonstrates Britain’s ongoing commitment operationally and diplomatically in the region, naval sources told The .Britain has had a presence in the Gulf for decades, but the three-week sea passage to deploy and recover a ship meant there were long periods with no Royal Naval assets in the region.The plan to base a Type-23 Frigate – and from the mid-2020s the next generation Type-31 – would likely see the whole ship’s company flown out to take over the vessel based in Bahrain.Routine maintenance of the ships would be carried out at the Mina Salman base, with the ship likely to remain in the region for about three years. The more comprehensive depth servicing every five to 10 years will be done in the UK. Gavin Williamson has announced the move in a show of support for NatoSmaller minehunter vessels have been based in the region for the last 10 years, but crews have deployed via Royal Fleet Auxiliary ships. The use of the new support base and a Type 23 frigate is a step change in naval capability.The Defence secretary also spoke of to the “increasing aggression and increasing assertiveness” of Russia. In 2010 the Royal Navy had to respond once to a Russian navy vessel approaching UK territorial waters. “Last year we had to respond 33 times”, he said.North Korea still open to talks with US as Donald Trump threatens Kim Jong-un after scrapping summitHarvey Weinstein \u0026#39to be charged\u0026#39 over sexual misconduct allegationsCalls for junk food to have graphic cigarette-style warnings on packagingKirsty Wark: I\u0026#39ll throw my hat in the ring for Dimbleby\u0026#39s Question Time jobUK \u0026#39chasing fantasy\u0026#39 over plans to avoid hard Irish border, says EUUS denies involvement in Syria missile strike which kills 12 Putin and Macron question Trump\u0026#39s withdrawal from Iran deal and North Korea summitGardener\u0026#39s World presenter Rachel de Thame reveals she is battling breast cancer on live TVHow much water do you use in the morning?The Trouble with M\u0026ampS, review: a lacklustre account of how Marks lost its sparkHumans, series three, episode two review: Thoughtful science fiction with plenty of heart and dramaGDPR fraudsters con people out of thousands with wave of phishing emailsGrenfell survivors claim fire brigade\u0026#39s \u0026#39stay put\u0026#39 advice cost residents chance to escapeThe Grenfell Tower survivors: Lucky to escape, but living with the horror of what they sawVenezuela President Maduro vows to free jailed opposition activistsLorry transporting Batmobile among range of novelty cars engulfed in flames on the M4Property lawyer gets to keep home extension despite having no planning permission New helicopter fleet for Royal MarinesParachute trial: Emile Cilliers cheated and lied but proved irresistible to womenComment: Donald Trump\u0026#39s letter to North Korea is not madness.

It is not keeping your cool in the shark tank, it is picking up the silent cues that matter.It ends: MI6 - secretly we are just like you.The Secret Intelligence Service is seeking to cast off its macho James Bond image in an attempt to attract more women and ethic minority recruitsThe agency\u0027s head of recruitment, a mother herself who has spent 20 years in the service, said the agency was deliberately trying to distance itself from the Bond image.The concept was to play on the Bond image but to explain very clearly that this was not James Bond, she said.In many respects the people we are recruiting have sets of skills that are common to many people in the population.MI6 can take advantage of this Bond image and then turn it on its head.The agency is looking to recruit 800 new staff by 2021.It has seen an upsurge in interest since the Salisbury nerve agent attack on the former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, blamed by the Government on the Kremlin, but is pushing a recruitment drive. MI6 chief Alex Younger said it was trying to attract the best candidates including women and members of the black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) communities who previously might not have considered applying.It is about having the widest possible choice of the best talent in the country, he said at a press briefing . I want people who would have never have thought about joining MI6 to think about joining MI6.Last year the agency launched its first-ever cinema advert with a similar message. North Korea still open to talks with US as Donald Trump threatens Kim Jong-un after scrapping summitBritain to send frigate to the Gulf in most serious naval deployment since 1971Harvey Weinstein \u0026#39to be charged\u0026#39 over sexual misconduct allegationsCalls for junk food to have graphic cigarette-style warnings on packagingKirsty Wark: I\u0026#39ll throw my hat in the ring for Dimbleby\u0026#39s Question Time jobUK \u0026#39chasing fantasy\u0026#39 over plans to avoid hard Irish border, says EUUS denies involvement in Syria missile strike which kills 12 Putin and Macron question Trump\u0026#39s withdrawal from Iran deal and North Korea summitGardener\u0026#39s World presenter Rachel de Thame reveals she is battling breast cancer on live TVHow much water do you use in the morning?The Trouble with M\u0026ampS, review: a lacklustre account of how Marks lost its sparkHumans, series three, episode two review: Thoughtful science fiction with plenty of heart and dramaGDPR fraudsters con people out of thousands with wave of phishing emailsGrenfell survivors claim fire brigade\u0026#39s \u0026#39stay put\u0026#39 advice cost residents chance to escapeThe Grenfell Tower survivors: Lucky to escape, but living with the horror of what they sawVenezuela President Maduro vows to free jailed opposition activistsLorry transporting Batmobile among range of novelty cars engulfed in flames on the M4Property lawyer gets to keep home extension despite having no planning permission New helicopter fleet for Royal MarinesParachute trial: Emile Cilliers cheated and lied but proved irresistible to womenComment: Donald Trump\u0026#39s letter to North Korea is not madness.

The trend is really worrying.”The government’s focus on improving the take-up of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (Stem) subjects could have played a part as figures show sciences and maths did not suffer the same fate at A-level. The number of entries in computing – one of the government’s flagship subjects – jumped by 26 per cent from 7,710 in 2017 to 9,685 this year. And uptake of the maths A-level rose by 3 per cent.Unions say the government’s exam reforms – such as the introduction of the tougher English GCSE– may also have deterred some students from studying English in sixth-form.Jill Stokoe, a policy advisor at the National Education Union, told The Independent: “I think part of it is the drive towards Stem.“With English, history and geography, it could be that the difficulty of the new GCSE specification has put people off at A-level.”And reforms – which mean AS levels no longer count towards final grades – are likely to have led to fewer students taking these subjects in Year 12 and then deciding to take them onto A-level.Figures show that entries for AS levels have fallen by almost 60 per cent this year – from 659,880 to 269,090 – continuing a trend triggered by the decoupling of AS levels from A-levels.UK news in picturesUK news in picturesAlastair Cook batting against Pakistan during the first test match of the summer at Lord’s cricket ground, London.

And in performingexpressive arts, entries among GCSE students plummeted by 40 per cent. Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the school headteachers’ union (NAHT), said: “Students’ experiences of a narrower curriculum at GCSE is now having an impact on their sixth form studies.”Disadvantaged students with lower grades do as well in medical schoolHe added: “It is now impossible to argue that the EBacc measure is not having a narrowing effect on young people’s choices at GCSE. “These reforms put schools in an impossible situation where they must reduce the opportunities they offer to pupils in order to satisfy an arbitrary government target.”A Department for Education spokesperson said: “The Government has worked with employers to reform GCSEs and make them gold-standard qualifications. They will prepare pupils for future success and help deliver the skills Britain needs to be fit for the future. Entries to the core academic EBacc subjects have increased, with over 4 million of these exams being taken this year, including significant increases to those taking the inidual sciences.They added: These subjects give pupils the best foundation to progress into further education and employment. Thanks to our reforms and the hard work of teachers, academic standards are rising with 1.9 million more children in good or outstanding schools than in 2010.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Is the adoption of other people\u0027s customs and cultures fair game or has political correctness gone mad?\u0026nbspDavid Barnett treads warily\u0026nbspLet’s get this out of the way: I am a straight, white, middle-aged man, so what follows you may take with a pinch of salt or disregard completely. But we’re going to talk, you and I, about the thorny issue of cultural appropriation.It was only a year ago that Oxford Dictionaries put the phrase into their official lexicons, with the definition, “the unacknowledged or inappropriate adoption of the customs, practices, ideas, etc. of one people or society by members of another and typically more dominant people or society.”Cultural appropriation is sometimes so blatant it smacks us in the face. The Black and White Minstrel Show ran on British television for – what seems now to us, looking back at it – and astonishing 20 years, from 1958.Even halfway through its run the show, in which white entertainers “blacked up” to sing songs in a Deep South of America style, was the subject of petitions calling for it to be taken off the air because of its in-your-face racism. It can hardly be seen now without an overwhelming feeling of embarrassment. How did we ever think that was acceptable?The show was harking back to the minstrel shows in 19th-century America, and blackface was a popular form of entertainment until the enlightenment of the 1960s, coupled with rising racial tensions across the US, finally put paid to it. Even Al Jolson, dubbed “the world’s greatest entertainer”, was renowned for performing in blackface. Jolson was Jewish, and while there can never be any excuses made today for blacking up, it’s interesting that in their 2008 book the Encyclopedia of American Jewish History, authors Stephen Harlan Norwood and Eunice G Pollack talk of Jolson’s 1927 movie The Jazz Singer in terms which suggest some kind of what we would today call intersectionality. For example: “Is there any incongruity in this Jewish boy with his face painted like a Southern Negro singing in the Negro dialect? No, there is not…The son of a line of rabbis well knows how to sing the songs of the most cruelly wronged people in the world\u0027s history.”Can a Jewish man really pretend to be a black man without racism? Is this cultural appropriation of the very worst kind or solidarity that only two historically subjugated peoples can appreciate? And what, then, of a Jewish woman who dresses up as a Japanese woman for entertainment?The cries of “cultural appropriation” were resounding around social media even before Netta Barzilai had finished her (ultimately competition-winning) performance of Toys, the Israeli entry in this month’s Eurovision song contest held in Lisbon.Netta wore a stylised kimono and was surrounded by dozens of maneki neko waving lucky cat statues. Twitter in particular was rather exercised by the thought of the cultural appropriation taking place before its very eyes. Or, I should say, mainly white Western Twitter. It seems the only people not too fussed were the Japanese themselves.According to the website soranews24, which repackages and discusses Japanese news stories for an English speaking audience, the overwhelming response on the ground seems to be a mildly nonplussed reaction.The site quoted from Japanese social media accounts which included the responses, “Culture is meant to be stolen. If it’s not worth stealing, then it isn’t culture”, “If people keep claiming ‘cultural appropriation’ then people will not touch our culture. Then, people will not understand our culture and it will be easier to become our enemy”, and, perhaps crucially, “Westerners care too much about silly things”.Is that the problem? Are we, Westerners, liberal Westerners, too over-sensitive of the feelings of others brought on by white guilt? Or are we right to call out what we think is wrong when we see it? Should we wait before speaking, to see what the actual people affected think? Or is it our duty to step in first?Perhaps it’s now we should go back to the Oxford Dictionaries definition of cultural appropriation, particularly the bit that talks about the “more dominant people or society”. Is Israel a more dominant culture than Japan? Or vice-versa? What do we think? What do they think?A couple of weeks before Eurovision, Eastern dress was setting Twitter alight again, this time when a Utah teenager posted online pictures of her wearing her prom dress which was actually a qipao, traditional Chinese dress. The 18-year-old was accused of cultural appropriation and casual racism. People of Chinese heritage chimed in with arguments on both sides of the debate, with some pointing out that the outfit was originally worn by women carrying out domestic duties, and thus not something to be really celebrated, and another writing, “I’m Asian and Chinese, you looked beautiful in that dress, I’m sorry you got bashed for it.”Cyprus\u0027 singer Eleni Foureira performs the song FuegoIsrael\u0027s singer Netta performs the song Toy Belgium\u0027s singer Sennek performs the song A Matter Of Time Estonia\u0027s singer Elina Nechayeva performs the song La ForzaCroatia\u0027s singer Franka performs the song Crazy Albania\u0027s singer Eugent Bushpepa performs the song MallCzech Republic\u0027s singer Mikolas Josef performs the song Lie To MeIreland\u0027s singer Ryan O\u0027Shaughnessy performs the song TogetherSwiss duo ZIBBZ\u0027s singer Corinne Gfeller performs the song StonesBulgarian group Equinox\u0027 singer Zhana Bergendorff (R) performs the song BonesLithuania\u0027s singer Ieva Zasimauskaite performs the song When We\u0027re OldFinland\u0027s singer Saara Aalto performs the song MonstersGreece\u0027s singer Yianna Terzi performs the song Oniro MouAustria\u0027s singer Cesar Sampson performs the song Nobody But YouAzerbaijan\u0027s singer Aisel performs the song X My HeartIceland\u0027s singer Ari Olafsson performs the song Our ChoiceArmenia\u0027s singer Sevak Khanagyan performs the song QamiMacedonian duo Eye Cue\u0027s lead vocalist Marija Ivanovska (R) and guitarist Bojan Trajkovski perform the song Lost And FoundBelarus\u0027 singer Alekseev performs the song ForeverNorway\u0027s singer Alexander Rybak performs the song That\u0027s How You Write A SongRomanian band The Humans perform the song GoodbyeSerbia\u0027s band Sanja Ilic \u0026amp Balkanika perform the song Nova DecaSan Marino\u0027s Jessika featuring Jenifer Brening perform the song Who We AreDenmark\u0027s singer Rasmussen performs the song Higher GroundPoland\u0027s singer Gromee feat.

The fashion shows routinely feature collections riffing off a range of global cultures. For the coming autumn, Gucci recently unveiled a series of headwear inspired by Sikh turbans. Vogue ran a photoshoot in its “Diversity Issue” last year with a model in full Japanese geisha outfit. Not unusual, and perhaps nothing wrong with it… save for in both cases (and in the Victoria’s Secret show last year in which a model flaunted a Native American-style headdress) all the models were white.Here’s where cultural appropriation smacks up against representation. Maybe if Victoria’s Secret had employed a Native American model, if Vogue had used a Japanese model, if Gucci had – as the Sikh Coalition suggested in the aftermath – used Sikh models who would have properly observed the correct way to wear what is, after all, a sacred clothing item, then the later dissemination of these items on to the high street might not be quite so problematic.There’s a difference, too, between fashion and performance. When I was very young, on a holiday at a Pontin’s camp on the North-West coast, I was wrapped in a blanket, had two stripes of lipstick put across my face, and a feather from a passing seagull taped to my head. I was entered into the fancy dress contest (I didn’t win). I was of course, a Red Indian, as Native Americans were called in those less-enlightened times.As bad as the Black and White Minstrels? Possibly. But “Red Indians” back then were almost a fictional, fairytale group of people, the image drawn from Monday matinee westerns not renowned for historical accuracy, from Peter Pan, from Hiawatha and Little Plum. Would I have dressed my children like that when they were the same age? Undoubtedly not. Times change. Sensitivities alter.Utah teenager, Keziah Daum, sparked a huge debate on Twitter about cultural appropriation after posting photos of her traditional Chinese prom dressAnd I look down at what I’m wearing right now as I type this. A T-shirt, which has its origins as an undergarment in 19th-century America. A pair of jeans, which were originally developed in Italy (Genoa, which gave rise to “jeans”) and France (the fabric of Nimes, or de Nimes, from which is derived “denim”). A pair of flip-flops (don’t judge me), evolved from the Japanese zōri which servicemen took back to America post-Second World War (though early flip-flops have been discovered in ancient Egyptian burial sites).I am a melange of styles borrowed, begged and stolen from around the world. Is this cultural appropriation, several generations down the line? Should I be wearing what my grandfathers wore? Polyester slacks and an Oxford shirt, a cardigan, brogues? Where is the line, and on which side of it are we?Music is another cultural appropriation battleground. Every time Katy Perry or Taylor Swift goes “ghetto” for another video, or Lana Del Ray puts on a Native American headdress, it’s there to see. White folks stole rock’n’roll from African rhythms filtered through the American South, we stole electronic dance music from the predominantly-black post-disco clubs of Chicago and Detroit, and Italy. Take away the cultural appropriation, and what’s left? A couple of rousing choruses of Knees Up, Mother Brown or The Lambeth Walk, perhaps.Should we talk about food? Those great British traditions such as pizza, or chow mein, or curry? A few miles from me, Bradford is awash with curry houses. The clientele is largely white. Is that cultural appropriation? Well, no, because most of the restaurants are owned and worked in by people of South Asian heritage. But what was deemed cultural appropriation was when, earlier this year, a restaurant called Fanny’s announced it was opening a venue for the purveying of “posh kebabs” in London’s Stoke Newington.The move was lambasted on Twitter because, for one, Stoke Newington is a hub for Turkish restaurants and takeaways… the people who, you know, invented the kebab. For another, because the people behind Fanny’s weren’t Turkish (one of the founders is called Claude Compton, for your information), and the tag-line “posh kebabs” intimated that these “lads from Fulham” were basically going to beat the Turks at their own game (as a side note, Fanny’s subsequently dropped the “posh” bit from their marketing and logo).Fanny\u0027s Kebabs finally dropped the \u0027posh\u0027 bit from their marketing (fannyskebabsInstagram)If you’ve made it this far, you might be wondering where I’m heading with all this. And the honest answer is, I just don’t know. Cultural appropriation seems, on the face of it, like it should be something that all of us should fight against, but the flip-side of that is knowing exactly just what it is and when we should call it out.As I said at the top of this piece, take what I say with a pinch of salt, given that I am a middle-aged white man. But where does that leave me, if we remove years of embedded cultural appropriation? Dressed in my grandad’s clothes, listening to a 78 of George Formby classics, and clutching a chip butty? And on that score, should I be calling cultural appropriation on the New York magazine The Insider’s awestruck piece last month on a Turkish restaurant that was selling this remarkable new thing, a sandwich stuffed with fries?The answer’s no, of course, because cultural appropriation will never affect me in the way it does other, marginalised people. I have working-class roots but I’m still pretty close to the top of the privilege chain all I can realistically get away with is some faux outrage at posh kids slumming it at Wetherspoons and Greggs for Instagram likes.But maybe those who identify as white, liberal allies should hit the pause button before calling out cultural appropriation, and just take a moment to think. The obvious stuff, the outright horror of the Black and White Minstrels and the more subtle but by no means any less problematic racism, yes, by all means, dig in. Dog-piling on teenagers for wearing a prom dress, maybe hold off a bit.Cultural appropriation is a big desert, and one on which we might have to draw our own personal lines in the sand as to what we know in our guts is wrong, and what we think might be, possibly, a little bit off.And with that, I bid you sayonara.Black and White minstralsor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The footage is about MI6 spies and the next scene should be of a James Bond type in a dramatic fight for survival. Instead, the camera pans out to show an aquarium and the visitors a woman reassuring her alarmed child.MI6’s first ever television advertisement is aimed at attracting recruits from ethnic minorities and women, and breaking stereotypes. The message is clear: the officer from the Secret Intelligence Service is not a macho white man, but the young black mother.MI6 are in the process of relaxing their rules of entry to reach the new recruitment pools. An official said: “We are making our Services’ nationality rules slightly more flexible to support our ersity agenda and a wider selection of candidates.”Blair denies knowledge of man tortured in Libya after MI6 renditionThere are no problems with getting people to join, say MI6, with 800 more staff due to be taken on to bolster the 2,700 strong cohort. There was a rush of applications after the nerve agent attack in Salisbury on Sergei and Yulia Skripal, something which tends to happen after high-profile cases involving terrorism and espionage.The aim of the campaign is to reach people who may not see the Secret Intelligence Service as a natural career. The voiceover for the advertisement says: “We are intelligence officers, but we don’t do what you think. It is not keeping your cool in the shark tank, it is picking up the silent cues that matter. Secretly, we are just like you.”MI6 have won a number of awards in recent years for promoting gender and ethnic equality. The latest figures, however, show that more progress needs to be made on both racial and gender balance. Overall, women make up 24.1 per cent in the senior civil service grade and 37.8 per cent among the non-senior category. There is not a single black or other ethnic minority member of the service’s senior staff and that group makes up just 6.8 per cent of the non-senior workforce.The advertisement will be first shown on Thursday evening. Alex Younger, the MI6 Chief, said at a preview for journalists: “I want to dispel the myths that still too often see potential candidates rule themselves out. The service I am proud to lead is global, modern and most capable with a deserved reputation of being one of the best intelligence services in the world.“My message remains simple, there is no ‘standard’ MI6 officer: if you have what it takes, then apply to join us. Our work is exciting, intellectually challenging and it matters. Regardless of background, if you have the skills we need and share our values, I want you to consider a career in intelligence in a service that reflects today’s society, MI6 needs the best people this country has to offer.”UK news in picturesUK news in picturesAlastair Cook batting against Pakistan during the first test match of the summer at Lord’s cricket ground, London.

She said: “I wanted a change after the birth of my third child. I wanted to do something that made a difference and this absolutely ticked that. Joining the service and serving the country seemed to be a worthwhile thing to do. I have found combining my job with my family life very manageable, certainly compared to the commercial world, which can be quite inflexible.”“I was apprehensive at first, I thought one of the requirements for the job was the ability to blend into the crowd, to be a grey man, which is not me, of course, at any level. But I find what I do interesting. I have been able to work against a full range of targets. I can put my views forward, challenge group think. I have been able to use my difference to my advantage.A senior director who had been 20 years with MI6 said an awareness of the need to be more inclusive “has been a process of evolution”. He wanted to stress the importance of thinking beyond the established norm and welcoming different views. “We are looking for people who are brave enough to speak up,” he said. “Having a more erse workforce will, we believe, help counter group think.”MI6’s head of recruitment, a mother of two children who has also spent 20 years in the service, said intelligence officers were required to have a “blend of emotional intelligence and impersonal skills”, an ability to form “instrumental relationships”, a “strong sense of integrity and creativity”, a “desire to work and live overseas” and “an interest in foreign affairs and culture”.The aim of the advertising campaign was to find a twist on the 007 theme. “The concept was to play on the Bond image but to explain very clearly that this was not James Bond,” she said. “MI6 can take advantage of this Bond image and then turn it on its head”.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Due to be released this summer, the\u0026nbspaction plan will be an official response to the survey’s findings.The news comes as the UK falls to fourth in Europe in the Rainbow Index, a yearly ranking of the progress made in LGBT+ rights, having topped the list in 2012.Though given the Conservative Party’s history of dragging their heels on LGBT+ rights, as well as May’s personal history of voting against progressive legal reform, not everyone is convinced. The Labour Party responded by labelling the plan as “empty PR”.Paul Twocock, director of campaigns, policy and research at Stonewall UK, welcomes the Government’s intention to publish an LGBT+ action plan. Stonewall research reveals that 20 per cent of LGBT+ people have experienced a hate crime within the last 12 months. For trans people, this figure increases to a staggering 40 per cent. Paul believes that the action plan, combined with the government’s recently reaffirmed commitment to launching a consultation on reforming the 2004 Gender Recognition Act, will improve life for LGBT+ people in the UK.Both the action plan and reform of the Gender Recognition Act should allow us to make important steps forward towards building a society where LGBT+ people are truly accepted, everywhere and by everyone and it will mean this government can maintain the UK’s impressive record as a world leader on LGBT+ equality.Susie Green, CEO of trans and gender identity charity Mermaids, cites hate crime as a major concern of trans youth. Susie believes that May’s action plan must urgently address this hostility, which is fuelled by sensationalist media coverage.We need stronger controls around media coverage of transgender people, and particular attention needs to be given to the use of online media to perpetuate hate crime. Young people and trans women in particular are targeted on social media, with little done to protect them.Susie would like to see statutory training for all areas of service around transgender children and young people, including schools, social care, police and healthcare. Lesson plans in school covering transgender identities should be mandatory, and included from primary school age.Teachers need to be equipped to deal with conversations around transgender children and young people, which is clearly not the case at present.Concerns over outdated sex and relationships education are also expressed by Liam Beattie, relationships and sex education policy lead at Terrence Higgins Trust. While Wales announced a progressive overhaul of their SRE curriculum, England still lags behind in its approach towards gender and sexuality in the classroom.\u0026nbspBeattie explains that a lack of inclusive sex education at school made him feel “invisible”.LGBT+ sex and relationships must be included when relationships and sex education becomes compulsory in all English schools from next year. Looking back, I’m still angry that I left school completely oblivious to the realities of HIV or the fact that, as a bisexual man, I was at higher risk than my sisters or straight friends.My gaps in knowledge had to be filled through speaking to gay and bi friends or using dating apps. We can’t continue to let young people down like this. The feelings of isolation and shame that follow so many LGBT+ people from childhood to adulthood can have a corrosive impact on their mental health. As a result, LGBT+ people are twice as likely to have a mental health condition compared to heterosexual people. Upon the announcement of May’s action plan, Paul Martin OBE, chief executive at LGBT Foundation, said:LGBT+ people continue to face a significant number of inequalities from poorer physical and mental health, increased risk of hate crime and discrimination, to loneliness and isolation and negative experiences in employment and we hope that a commitment to tackling these key issues will be outlined in the upcoming action plan.To alleviate these inequalities, human rights campaigner Peter Tatchell believes that the LGBT+ action plan must urgently confront homophobia in schools. He says:Nearly half of all LGBT+ pupils have been bullied, often leading to anxiety, depression, truancy, academic under-performance and self-harm.To combat anti-LGBT+ bullying and other forms of hate crime such as racism, the Prime Minister should make equality and ersity lessons mandatory in every school, from the first year of primary education onwards. The health and welfare of pupils must take priority.There should be no opt outs for faith schools and no right of parents to withdraw their kids.\u0026nbspAs Home Secretary, May faced criticism for her handling of asylum claims relating to sexual orientation and gender identity. At present, LGBT+ asylum seekers are still detained indefinitely, despite never having committed a crime. Leila Zadeh, executive director of the UK Lesbian and Gay Immigration Group, told indy100:An action plan to improve the lives of LGBT+ people should include clear and tangible commitments to improving the wellbeing and safety of LGBT+ people who are seeking asylum.As long as LGBT+ asylum seekers can be detained or made to share accommodation, there will be risks to their personal safety. The government should also review the quality of its decisions on asylum applications by LGBT+ people, to ensure none are returned to persecutionNigerian LGBT+ rights activist Bisi Alimi would like to see a national monument commemorating the struggle for LGBT+ rights in the UK. He believes that this will help to imprint the memories of the LGBT+ movement in public consciousness.This monument should put into account the iniduals across race, gender, religion and age that have shaped Britain pre and post Section 28 and should form\u0026nbsppart of the school curriculumThough while there are many voices welcoming the plan, there are also sceptics. Editor-in-chief of Attitude Magazine Cliff Joannou believes that, because of the government’s failure to introduce statutory LGBT+ inclusive relationship and sex education in schools, the legacy of Section 28 looms over schools and local authorities. He tells indy100:For Theresa May to announce her \u0027LGBT Action Plan\u0027\u0026nbspin a gay magazine on the anniversary of Section 28 is both ironic and crass.The government has shied away from tackling LGBT+ discrimination in faith schools, where homophobia and transphobia is most prevalent. Shockingly, conversion therapy is still legal in the UK.While these issues continue to affect young LGBT+ people we will be far away from the equal society that the government likes to fantasise over.Actions speak louder than words, and successive governments have failed to take any action on the very real issues that the LGBT+ community continues to face.More:\u0026nbspWales \u0027leads the way\u0027 with new LGBT-friendly sex education curriculum for next articleWe use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you.

The European Commission’s negotiators have already rejected the plan before its public announcement, as first revealed by The Independent earlier this week.“The regulatory alignment option is not available on the all-UK basis because it would amount to selective participation on the single market,” the senior EU official said, adding that the backstop “cannot be time limited”.It is incumbent on the UK to take the responsibility for its own decision“A backstop that would be strictly time limited would defeat the purpose of a backstop,” they said, before making clear that the Prime Minister’s plan for a UK-wide backstop would have to be withdrawn if progress is to be made at the June European summit.As well as the main issues of customs and the Irish border, side issues like the European arrest warrant and the Galileo satellite system have made little progress since March too. EU negotiators complain that the British side “do not understand” that Britain will not be able to use the European arrest warrant after Brexit, with Theresa May again having pledged to stay in the system just three months ago.“There are member states that simply cannot extradite their own nationals to a non-member of the EU. This is a constraint that unfortunately will apply once the UK is outside,” the senior official said.“The European arrest warrant is simply not available. I don’t think you can expect member states to change their constitutions in order to continue extraditing their nationals to the UK.“These are not bureaucratic issues. We are talking here about the lives and liberty of citizens. This is not something that can easily be done.”Brussels says the best the UK can hope for is to conclude a separate extradition treaty with the EU, as well as bilateral agreements on procedures like intelligence sharing.The row over Galileo has also been the subject of briefing and counter-briefing by the two sides. British sources briefed newspapers this week that they would demand the UK’s £1bn investment in the project back if British companies were locked out of the project. But EU sources disputed whether this stand had actually been made, describing the claim as “spin”.  The EU says British demands to retain the same access to Galileo as a member state are unreasonable. Though officials say Britain could potentially still use the system, they do not want to give British defence firms the right to build or run parts of it because they say that would effectively give the UK, a third country, the power to turn off the EU system for member states. Officials also pointed out that the UK itself had signed off the security rules restricting non-EU countries from running parts of system, as one of the 28 European Council members, before it knew it was going to leave.David Davis, the Brexit Secretary, who is travelling to Europe to drum up support for the UK to keep access to the satellite system, said: “Today we set out more detail on how we think the UK, as a third country, can continue to cooperate with the EU on security and keep our people safe and prosperous. As I travel around member states I hear how much our partners value the UK commitment to the EU’s security.“A relationship based solely on existing third country precedents, as some seem to be suggesting, would lead to a substantial and avoidable reduction in our shared security capability. Our citizens depend on this, let’s not let them down.”The senior EU official said they shared the UK’s concerns but that “this is a consequence on the UK position and it is incumbent on the UK to take the responsibility for its own decision”.Brexit so far: in picturesBrexit so far: in picturesBoris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

Officials say mutual recognition is not possible outside the single market, because it would amount to asking “the EU to trust the UK more, with less guarantees, than they trust each other”.Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief negotiator, has said Theresa May’s red lines mean Britain can only get a free trade agreement similar to the ones the EU has with Canada and South Korea, but the UK said today that this “shallow level of cooperation” was “inconsistent with our ambition”, which would require “a more formal and deeper institutional structure”.A UK Government source said:  “This is their public negotiating position, nothing more, nothing less. We presented 7 papers this week, in the interests of resolving difficult issues in the interests of both sides, so the claim we aren’t providing enough detail is laughable. “The risk is that if they follow down this track, putting conditions on our unconditional offers and trying to insult us, the EU will end up with a relationship with its third biggest economy and largest security partner that lets down millions of citizens in the EU and UK.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Sir Ivan Rogers, the UK’s old ambassador to the EU, was criticised after he advised ministers in 2016 that leaving the EU would take around 10 years. He stepped down from his post shortly after.The EU says under the December agreement just Northern Ireland would stay in full alignment with the single market and customs union to prevent a hard border, while UK negotiators say they actually agreed that the whole UK would do so. The relevant text is somewhat ambiguous as to what was agreed.EU officials do not want the backstop to apply to the whole UK because it would give Britain access to the single market without having to uphold the so-called “four freedom” or submitting to the European Court of Justice. The UK says it cannot accept the backstop only applying to NI because that would create a potential customs border between Great Britain and NI  – which the DUP oppose. Theresa May has relied on the DUP for her majority in the House of Commons since she called an election and lost seats last year.The time-limiting element has now been introduced by the UK because Cabinet Brexiteers like Boris Johnson fear that an indefinite backstop could be a backdoor way of keeping the UK aligned with the EU in perpetuity. Ministers have publicly confirmed that a time-limited backstop is on the way.Brexit threatens life on the Irish border: in picturesBrexit threatens life on the Irish border: in picturesJohn Murphy flies the European flag outside his home near the border village of Forkhill, Co ArmaghAn abandoned shop is seen in Mullan, Co Monaghan.

The agency emailed a notice to all US citizens in China about the employee at the consulate in Guangzhou who said there were “subtle and vague, but abnormal, sensations of sound and pressure”. It advised Americans to contact medical professionals if they experience any “unusual auditory or sensory of phenomena accompanied by unusual sounds or piercing noises”. The incident harkens back to when nearly two dozen US employees working in Havana had sought medical treatment between December 2016 to May 2017 for headaches, ear pain, dizziness, and hearing issues. Symptoms, sounds and sensations reportedly varied dramatically from person to person. Some have permanent hearing loss or concussions, while others suffered nausea, headaches and ear-ringing. Some are struggling with concentration or common word recall, The Associated Press has reported.A subsequent FBI investigation did not reveal evidence of a “sonic attack”. However, the reports put the largest strain on US-Cuba relations since former president Barack Obama forged closer ties in 2014. Recording of \u0027sonic weapon attack\u0027 on US diplomats in Cuba releasedBetween September and October 2017, US President Donald Trump expelled 17 Cuban diplomats from the US, ordered US staff in Havana to come back, and issued a travel warning to the small, island nation - all implying the administration believed Cuba had some role in the mysterious illnesses of the diplomats. Cuba, for its part, denied any wrongdoing and attributed the illnesses to a possible psychological cause. The State Department said it is not aware of any similar situations in China and did not identify the person who reported the systems or when that information was relayed to the agency.

And the politicians realise the scaremongering isn\u0026rsquot working.\u0026ldquoOf course Britain can be successful after Brexit, we were before and we will be again.When asked whether this signalled the failure of Project Fear, Mr Moreland said: \u0026ldquoI would hope so.

The remaining 35 per cent were uncertain.There was more good news for Mrs May when considering the fate of the UK-based workforce itself. When asked whether British workers will become \u0026ldquoless talented and skilled after Brexit, 39 per cent of respondents disagreed while just 31 per cent agreed.And while 35 per cent of people agreed they were \u0026ldquoworried about the lack of up-skilling of the UK workforce after Brexit, 36 per cent said they were unsure while a further 29 per cent said they did not agree.Outside of London\u0026rsquos Remain bubble, confidence in the UK\u0026rsquos economic future was particularly high.When asked \u0026ldquodo you believe high-skilled jobs will leave the UK for the EU?, 37 per cent of respondents in London said yes.This figure shrunk to 33 per cent in Manchester, 32 per cent in Glasgow, 29 per cent in Newcastle and just 19 per cent in Birmingham - where Brexiteers outnumbered Remainers in June 2016\u0026rsquos in-out referendum.The poll also showed a difference of opinions when broken down by gender. Women, for the large part, appeared more positive about the future of Britain\u0026rsquos economy than men.Just 11 per cent of women, compared to 17 per cent of men, said they were considering leaving the UK after Brexit.

a rival to GPS - refunded if it withdraws from the venture.Britain has rejected the EU\u0027s view that it cannot remain a full member of the project after Brexit as London insists it is in the interest of both sides to continue to work closely together on security issues.Brussels has made it clear that the UK cannot access the same encrypted Galileo information as EU members, or be involved in its development post-Brexit.The paper warns the UK will go its own way if its demands are not metExcluding the UK from full participation in Galileo will cost the EU one billion euro (\u0026pound880 million) and set the project back by three years, the document states.The paper said that the position adopted by Brussels risks being interpreted as a lack of trust in the UK.The UK... has a strong objection to its ongoing exclusion from security-related discussions and exchanges pertaining to the post-2019 development of Galileo.The paper warns the UK will go its own way if its demands are not met, stating: If agreement cannot be reached on the future balance of rights and obligations, and UK security and industrial requirements consequently cannot be met, the UK could not justify future participation in Galileo.In parallel, the UK is therefore exploring alternatives to fulfil its needs for secure and resilient position, navigation and timing information, including the option for a domestic satellite system.Excluding the UK from full participation in Galileo will cost the EU one billion euroThe UK wants Galileo to be a core component of the future UK-EU security partnership.Meanwhile, the Commons Brexit committee has suggested that the UK could end up staying longer in the customs union under Brussels rule because the Government has not come up with solution for customs arrangements.The committee was though criticised by Tory member Andrea Jenkyns who claimed it was \u0026ldquotoo Remain focussed under Labour MP Hilary Benn\u0026rsquos chairmanship.She announced she was resigning as a government parliamentary private secretary to have more time to focus on her Brexit committee work to help \u0026ldquoachieve the right Brexit."},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/139/590x/jc-964732.jpg","title":"jeremy corbyn northern ireland belfast visit ira labour party","story":"Jeremy Corbyn has been accused of snubbing IRA victimsThe row has acted as a reminder that Mr Corbyn was an IRA sympathiser during the Troubles and has always refused to specifically condemn the campaign of murder and brutality by Republican paramilitaries.The far Left Labour leader came in for strong criticism on his visit to Belfast for refusing to meet the bereaved families of IRA victims following an invitation by DUP MP Gregory Campbell.Mr Campbell said he had extended an invite to Mr Corbyn on behalf of victims nearly two weeks ago.The DUP MP said: Jeremy Corbyn is well known for having avoided specific issues relating to terrorism in Northern Ireland.

definition","story":"But for some, one other half just isnt enough, so here are the answers to your multiple questions about the world of polygamy.Polygamy is the act of marrying multiple spouses, that means having more than one husband or wife at the same time.The term is the opposite of monogamy which his the more common practice of having just one spouse at any given moment.The practice was once quite widespread across parts of the globe and is still practised by some to this day.But in most countries, the practice is now illegal or at the very least not officially recognised.There are generally assumed to be three forms of polygamy: polygyny, polyandry and group marriage.Polygamy is not explicitly a criminal offence in the UK but bigamy is.Bigamy is the practice of marrying someone whilst still married to another and is punishable by up to seven years in prison.Love rat Daniel Gundry was caught out when his wife saw him on Ant and Decs Saturday Night Takeaway with another woman.He was jailed for six months on January 10, 2018.It was stated in a written answer to the House of Commons that: In Great Britain, polygamy is only recognised as valid in law in circumstances where the marriage ceremony has been performed in a country whose laws permit polygamy and the parties to the marriage were domiciled there at the time.In addition, immigration rules have generally prevented the formation of polygamous households in this country since 1988.The practice is however not recognised by the benefits system.Polygamy was once a widespread way of structuring a family unit.References, particularly to men with multiple wives, can be found in the Bible, Torah, Koran, and Rig Veda holy texts.Despite its presence in the Old Testament, most branches of Christianity do prohibit the taking of more than one wife or husband.A notable exception to this rule are some adherents to the Church of the Latter Day Saints or Mormons.Some fundamentalist Mormons continue the practice despite the church ending the practice in 1890.Islamic doctrine states a man may have a total of four wives but puts restrictions on who those women can be and insists he must be able to provide for them all.Many Muslim majority countries allow the practice with Kuwait being the only one that imposes no restrictions.However it is prohibited in the Islamic nations of Turkey, Tunisia, Albania, Kosovo and Central Asian countries.Polyamory is the act of having multiple partners where all parties are aware of that fact but without the official act of marriage.It differs from polygamy in the sense that those involved will not be husbands or wives but simply partners in an intimate relationship.Many people who practice polyamory have a different view of sexual fidelity than is traditionally held, not regarding sexual exclusivity as a part of it.Because there is no official, religious or legal ceremony involved there are no laws in the UK restricting polyamory.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The two had been lovers after meeting in 1960 when being gay was banned.Scott, who worked as a model, was said to have had a full blown affair with the politician and even had liaisons in Thorpe’s Commons room.But after they parted, Thorpe was said to have viewed Scott as a dangerous blackmailer intent on revenge - something that could have wrecked his political ambitions.For while homosexuality was legalised in 1967 it was still taboo for people in the public eye.Scott had been lured on to Exmoor by a hitman, who was allegedly a part-time pilot called Andrew Newton who had been hired as part of the plot.He shot the model’s dog before turning the gun on Scott – but it jammed. Effing and jeffing, he sped off.After managing to hail down an approaching car, Scott blurted “Jeremy Thorpe” to the driver.A police investigation lead to a trial in the Old Bailey with the Liberal leader accused of conspiracy to murder along with three other men. But the jury did not feel convinced that Thorpe, a man of hitherto unblemished reputation and a national figure with a very distinguished public record could be capable of the crime. And he was acquitted along with the others.But Scott maintains Thorpe wanted him dead and said he only felt safe when the politician died in 2014.His younger self has been played by actor Ben Wishaw in the new BBC drama starring Hugh Grant called Very English Scandal."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict0004076666401.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"fairytale wedding prince harry meghan markle trevor kavanagh","story":"Nearly two billion people tuned in for the climax of a classic rom-com beyond the wildest dreams of a Netflix screenwriter.A war hero prince of royal blood getting hitched to a mixed-race divorced American TV star? Nobody would believe that.Yet the happy couple set aside family rows, petty jealousies and drunken sabotage and basked in the warm embrace of an adoring public.Windsor’s Disney-style ceremony was watched in broad daylight north of the equator and the middle of the night Down Under by happy viewers of all races and creeds.There is a message here for us all.Harry and Meghan’s wedding did more than unite this nation in sympathy and affection for a popular prince and the love of his life. It showed this country is world class.The sub-plot, of course, was the emotional union between the damaged children of two broken families.Fans have long yearned for Prince Harry to find happiness after the roller-coaster life and shocking death of his fabled mother, Princess Diana.They have warmed to a young man who transformed himself from a mixed-up kid to a likeable soldier, helicopter pilot and champion of war-damaged Invictus casualties.As for his bride, Meghan Markle is the glamorous star of hit TV series Suits, who dreamed as a child of becoming a princess.Best of all in this age of right-on political correctness, she is the daughter of a charming African-American mother and an Emmy-winning Hollywood lighting specialist.The House of Windsor is now truly multicultural.It is also hip.Our amazing sovereign, at 92, and doughty Prince Philip, 96, both heading for their royal telegrams, are the Queen and King of Cool.Where else in the world would you see an Elton John double act with Windy City preacher Bishop Michael Curry?This was a truly uplifting occasion, worn lightly by a once-stuffy Royal Family.Nobody does it better when it comes to choreographing mounted cavalry, trumpets, banners and horse-drawn carriages with an electric-powered E-Type and a vintage Rolls-Royce.All underscored by a sense of humour, as Harry and his supportive brother William exchanged banter at the altar of Windsor’s historic St George’s Chapel.Even the weather turned out in tribute, bathing Windsor Great Park’s glorious greenery in spring sunshine.There may have been some muffled coughs over Markle family squabbles but they were nothing compared with the torrid dramas leading to the Queen’s own “annus horribilis”.The world has become used to British pageantry.But this Royal Wedding was a timely reminder that Britain is not just a small island with a fading history on the edge of Europe.The Duke and Duchess of Sussex ride in a carriage down The Long Walk back towards Windsor Castle after getting married in St Georges Chapel, WindsorThe 21st-century United Kingdom is an unrivalled brand on the global stage.The world was witnessing more than mere pomp and circumstance.This was UK plc on international parade, joining hands with the global community in a way no other nation can match — even the mighty USA.Had Meghan married into the family of a French or American president, a German Chancellor or a Kremlin tsar, would anyone have tuned in?Neither China nor Russia could captivate so many friendly eyeballs.The Olympics might do it.But London 2012 revealed Britain is best on these occasions, too.On Saturday, Britain proved it is capable of reaching out to a world beyond borders.Harry and Meghan’s marriage bonded the UK indelibly with the US.If the new Duke and Duchess have kids, they will be American citizens — as well as British due to Harry’s lineage — and will eventually be liable to American tax.Importantly, this wedding had special significance for the 2.5billion citizens of 52 Commonwealth countries, especially in Africa and the Caribbean, who swear allegiance to the Queen.My Australian in-laws were constantly on the phone from Sydney this weekend, all thoughts of becoming a republic abandoned, to discuss the finer points of royal protocol.But this event was watched from lands with no current ties to Britain — South America, the Far East and the Gulf States.It was a showcase of modern Britain forever adapting to change, the key to our success as an outward-looking nation.There was a clear hint of defiance, too. This steely couple were doing it their way.Our Brexit negotiators — on both sides of the argument — should take note.That big wide world, viewing us in high definition on Saturday, is where Britain’s future lies.These are our markets.The audience liked what they saw and they want some of what we’re having.In marketing terms alone, it was priceless.Too often we underestimate our strength and standing.We have developed an absurd inferiority complex.We’ve been led to believe we are too weak and puny to stand alone on the global stage.Yet we are among the world’s greatest economies, second only to Germany in the EU.We are a nuclear power with a real professional army which has helped keep the peace in Europe, and have an envied place on the UN Security Council.Republican lefties despise all this stuff.They smear Britain’s record as a brutal colonial power while ignoring our global lead in abolishing slavery.Disturbingly, some Conservatives seem to agree the UK is washed up and past its prime.Since we cannot run our own economy, they say, we should hand the job to unelected bureaucrats in Brussels.These, remember, would be the same Brussels flunkies who created the euro, wrecked the economies of member states and put millions of unemployed young people on the scrap heap.Most of those workless youngsters gratefully upped sticks and moved here.I wonder why?Saturday’s Royal Wedding showed we are in the Premier League.Now the world is watching, perhaps with slightly less enthusiasm, as another British saga lurches towards its climax — another broken family consumed with jealousy and bent on revenge.The cast is familiar — the statutory drunk, a bully who prefers to talk with a gun in his hand, some characters who would prefer a car crash to a happy ending.Can we stop the bickering and reach a good Brexit deal?Why can’t the Leavers and Remainers put the country first, join hands, bury their differences and take a vow to work together to serve the national interest?Inspired by the Royal Wedding, by the poem Invictus, we can rise above petty differences.“We are the masters of our fate: We are the captains of our soul.”Want to celebrate Harry and Meghans wedding like a royal?Weve made a brand new Snapchat lens just for the big day!Unlock The Suns Royal Wedding lens on Snapchat here and send us your snaps to @TheSunUKOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Pity.The real surprise for some of you, though, might have been discovering that to give it an informal vibe, ­alongside Kirsty Young, BBC1’s 9am-and-beyond coverage was now being fronted by the strangely contorted ­figure of Dermot O’Leary — the former host of ITV’s The Marriage Ref.A show that may have been the ­perfect rehearsal for most royal ­weddings, but probably not this one.They weren’t alone, obviously.The Beeb had the joint surrounded, in fact, by among others Huw Edwards, ­fashion expert Jo Elvin, who was “across the dress” (as clueless as the rest of us), Alex Jones, Ore Oduba and Anita Rani, who performed the ­essential task of repeating what the other person had just said.Ore: “First glimpse of the dress, it’s going to be a moment.”Anita: “It’s going to be a moment.” Traditionally, of course, on these great state occasions, the moment TV crews start interviewing other TV crews is the cue for the coverage to descend into flannel, repetition, idle speculation, cliche (“Excitement’s ­building”), imponderable questions and outright stupidity.On Saturday, by slight contrast, the trigger was actually the arrival of Oprah Winfrey and the first trickle of celebrity guests, who had a clearly ­nervous ­Dermot asking: “When the invite says ‘hats’, does that mean hats are an absolute given?”“Absolutely, it does,” said Kirsty, slapping him down testily.It got progressively worse with each arrival as well.So by the time Amal Clooney wafted in alongside husband George, who was dressed as one of Modern Romance, even basic motor tasks seemed beyond some of the BBC team.Kirsty: “It can be difficult to wear a hat, can’t it?”Jo: “I think so, yes.”In fairness, it should also be stated this idiocy was certainly not restricted to the BBC.I switched over to ITV during the ­arrivals and heard Meghan’s old drama teacher, Gigi Perreau, say: “This is incredible and we’re right there. Well, we’re here but we’re also there, so it’s fabulous.”It’s just the nature of the beast.With so much time to fill, everyone will say these things.Only the BBC, though, could possibly leave me feeling queasy with the choice of one of its Royal Wedding experts.This was left-wing “social commentator” Afua Hirsch, who was privately educated and has led a life of unimaginable advantage, compared to most of us, but is also a professional victim who thinks pretty much ­everything is “racist”, wants Nelson’s Column torn down and wasn’t about to drop her agenda with such a large audience at her mercy.“While I have felt alienated by the inherited privilege,” said Afua, who’s enjoyed more than most, “my own struggles with identity have made me appreciate the need for cultural ­continuity.“So while I didn’t relate to the Royal Family, I did relate to that need for a sense of tradition.”Quite a brass neck, isn’t it, speaking out against the whole concept of the Royal Family, while simultaneously using them to increase your TV profile, as Afua had been doing all week.Instead of telling her so, or pointing out Harry’s ex Chelsy Davy had arrived while she was guffing away, a nodding Dermot said he could listen to Afua “all day”.A claim I doubt, frankly.Indeed, I reckon he’d have been throwing himself off Windsor Castle’s ramparts before breakfast if he’d tried.No one else, I suspect though, was listening to a single word she said.Nor will they have needed Afua’s lofty approval to enjoy a day filled with so many memorable events, including Bishop Michael Curry’s fiery address to the congregation, the ­reappearance of the Duke of Edinburgh and Meghan’s Rolls-Royce ­hurtling up the Long Walk past 100,000 Union Flags like it was being driven by Richard Hammond.These are all magical moments you’ll possibly want to watch again — and if you do, having sat through both start to finish, I’d probably recommend the ITV version.It had the better ­historic detail, was never in any danger of missing Chelsy Davy’s arrival and rounded everything off nicely as well.Over on the BBC, meanwhile, Kirsty did it by searching for profundities and going where angels feared to tread.“Something has travelled between Harry and Meghan that might be the next page of the story, where they give us a gorgeous little product of their union which we might enjoy too . . . ?”Though not if Naga’s honeymoon arrangements are to be believed, they won’t.Obviously.Want to celebrate Harry and Meghans wedding like a royal?Weve made a brand new Snapchat lens just for the big day!Unlock The Suns Royal Wedding lens on Snapchat here and send us your snaps to @TheSunUKOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Later, I went back with him after he had built a night school for the boys, and asked over a cup of tea: “Why are you doing this, Harry?”He replied: “This is the most important thing I do.”It tells you everything about who his mother was.Inside the Chapel, the hymn was Guide Me, O Thou Great Redeemer, which was played at Princess Diana’s funeral and one of her favourites.Di’s sister Lady Jane Fellowes delivered the only reading. Listening to it was Sarah, the Duchess of York, who had not been invited to other recent royal weddings.Inviting Fergie was a brilliant thing to do. During Diana’s troubled times every Sunday she would drive down to Berkshire to have lunch with Fergie, spending the afternoon talking about their divorces.Outside in the Chapel courtyard were 2,000 people from Harry and Meghan’s charities, including servicemen who have lost limbs.Harry is following Diana’s hugely successful campaign to stop landmines by working with those who have been wounded by IEDs.When Harry was flying back from one of his tours of Afghanistan he shared the plane with three soldiers who were in a coma.He realised these soldiers, if they recovered, would have limbs missing and facing a life of misery — which is why he inspired them with his support for the Invictus Games.And Harry and Meghan asked guests to make donations to the Children’s HIV Association.Harry has clearly never forgotten how his mother took the stigma out of Aids by embracing sufferers, including babies in Brazil.And then there was the ring. On Saturday night Meghan was wearing the emerald-cut aquamarine ring Diana first wore in 1996.Harry once told ITV’s Tom Bradby: “I wanted to do something that would make my mother proud.” He succeeded on Saturday.Want to celebrate Harry and Meghans wedding like a royal?Weve made a brand new Snapchat lens just for the big day!Unlock The Suns Royal Wedding lens on Snapchat here and send us your snaps to @TheSunUKOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

So is Her Majesty the Queen. They haven’t felt the need to label themselves as such we know from their actions.As the basic scriptwriting rule dictates, show don’t tell.To her credit, Meghan Markle championed many charitable causes that advocate female empowerment before she met Prince Harry, and no one is suggesting she shouldn’t continue with this work.But what grates about the above statement is the unsaid inference that here is a feisty, independent woman who, unshackled by pomp, ceremony and dutiful political impartiality, is going to drag the stuffy, deluded old monarchy kicking and screaming into the 21st century.That this go-get-’em gal from the US of A is going to shake things up with a few bumper-sticker sentiments and teach those Brits a thing or two about how the world works.Or perhaps we should leave it to Patrick Jephson, former private secretary to Princess Diana, a man very much in the know on the inner workings of the House of Windsor.In his book, The Meghan Factor, he says: “The one key skill Meghan absolutely must perfect is how to avoid being seen as any kind of a destabilising force. It’s a useful guideline when weighing the pros and cons of any intended course of action, from saving a local playgroup, to saving an endangered species, to saving the planet. What always comes first is saving the monarchy.”Quite. In other words, don’t get up the collective nose of the British public or they might just, ahem, pick it and flick you off into oblivion.As we saw on Saturday, as Bishop Michael Curry’s address entered what felt like its third decade, The Queen’s resolutely impassive expression suggests she’d make a fine poker player.We have no idea what she thought of it, nor Donald Trump, Brexit or the highly political Me Too campaign. She has opinions, of course. But what she doesn’t do is wear them like a badge.Just like her great-great-grandmother Victoria, who advocated “never complain, never explain”, The Queen knows the future of the monarchy lies in being a non-political figurehead who promotes national unity.Jephson adds: “If you acquire a profile, a purpose and a passionate public devotion independent of the royal mainstream, then you risk being perceived and presented as a threat to the Crown itself.”We already know what Meghan thinks about an awful lot of things, because her life so far can’t be edited.We also know that her soapbox has just got bigger thanks to her new status which, to those unused to it, could foster the corrosive misconception that everyone is hanging off your every word.Read my pursed lips: They’re not. They’re just being polite.So Meghan must learn fast that she’s a very minor cog in an ancient royal machine that has survived so long by saying nothing and doing its duty to its loyal subjects.Frustrating that may be for a “feminist” (or, indeed a manist), but that’s the trade-off for the largely taxpayer-funded life of luxury that is granted, not self-generated.As a celebrity, you can say what you like and we can choose to listen or not. But opinions divide people and, as a royal, you are supposed to represent everyone.Meghan needs to understand, and implement, that distinction sooner rather than later.HUMAN rights lawyer Amal Clooney was officially crowned “best-dressed guest” by fashionistas observing the Royal Wedding.According to one, she was “a sublime vision in marigold”, though personally speaking, Colman’s Mustard yellow might be more accurate.Either way, Ms Clooney once again proved adept at pulling focus from the other mere mortals floundering in her ever-stylish slipstream.By contrast, the Duchess of Cambridge’s understated, Alexander McQueen frock coat got a sniffier reception from certain fashion quarters, not least because she’s worn it three times before.They’re missing the point.A wedding is about the bride, not the guests.And Kate understood that perfectly by wearing something that wouldn’t propel her into the limelight on Meghan’s big day.Now that’s style.THOSE attending Chelsea Flower Show (no, me neither) have declared that “she-sheds” are the latest must-have – kitted out with radiators, chandeliers and squishy sofas.Alternatively, we could have all that inside the house and just send the other half out into the garden.AN Islamic school in Birmingham has warned female pupils against using tampons.The guidance, adopted as school policy, states: “Among the types of pads, tampons may not be appropriate due to insertion.”But the head of the school insists it has “no connection to faith”.Hmmmm. Meanwhile, it has emerged that women are having “virginity restoring” operations on the NHS at a cost of £1,000 a time.The 30-minute procedure involves the hymen – which can break after using tampons, doing sport or having sex for the first time – being stitched or reconstructed.One relationship counsellor suggested that one of the reasons was that some religious women were “over- whelmed” by feelings of sexual guilt and wanted to be “as pure as possible again” for their husband.Want to? Or are forced to by religiously driven, moral expectations not placed on the man they’re marrying?Either way, is this really something the NHS should be funding when money for other, more vital, operations is so scarce?MEMO to Sir Anthony Hopkins: Yes, families do fall out and just because you’re related doesn’t mean you have to like each other.But saying you “don’t care one way or the other” whether your 48-year-old daughter Abigail has children or not seems overly cold and perhaps partly explains your 20-year estrangement.In future, a simple, “We don’t speak and I’d rather not go in to it”, might be wiser.HOW come, in this age of state-of-the-art camera phones, when anyone spots the Loch Ness monster, beast of Bodmin Moor or any of the other fearsome creatures supposedly roaming our shores, the evidential photo is always out of focus?Exhibit A: The “lion” spotted in Oldbury in the West Midlands this week.Yep.

It’s the uncertainty caused by Remain diehards in the Commons and Lords bent on scuppering it and even destroying our Government.It is destabilising for firms not to know what Brexit will look like.

The Government must think again so that people don’t fall into debt or are left at risk of losing their home.”Lib Dem MP Stephen Lloyd added: “These lamentable figures show that thousands of people have still not responded to the significant changes on mortgage interest loans being pushed by the DWP.This is yet another cack-handed benefit change by the Tories which is wholly unnecessary, and is already causing anxiety amongst some of our most disadvantaged, marginalised citizens.The DWP said that any SMI claimants who havent got a phone call about the change will still get the benefit for at least six more weeks.Those affected are urged to contact the official hotline on 0800 731 0459 for pensioners or 0800 169 0310 for anyone of working age.A spokesman said: Over time, someone’s house is likely to increase in value, so it’s reasonable that anyone who has received financial help towards their mortgage should be asked to pay that back.“Everyone who signs up to the loan will continue to get help with their mortgage interest, and it’s only repayable if there is available equity when the property is sold.“If people decide to decline the loan now but change their mind in future the loan can be backdated so in effect there would be no break in payments.“We have already contacted everyone currently in receipt of SMI to explain the change but we are making sure people have time to review the documents, obtain advice and consider their options."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000283428196.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"burn wood they said itll be green they said how the eco freaks got us all wheezing","story":"Pollution in our cities is worse than it’s been for many years. The way things are going you could give your kids 20 Rothmans a day and they wouldn’t be much worse off than they already are.And the reason for this is a genuine scandal. A real eye-opener. It shows what happens when people in authority take notice of the people who know absolutely nothing. The Green lobby. The eco-freaks. The obsessive loons. The climate change fanatics.If you’re middle class, you’ve probably got one. They’ve become incredibly popular in the last decade.Trouble is they spew out enormous amounts of something called PM2.5 particles. That’s soot to you and me.They’re the major cause of soot in our cities and the main reason everyone you know is gasping for breath.We’re about to be sued by the European Union because pollution from these stoves is way above acceptable limits.But why do we have them?Because at the behest of the green movement, the government encouraged us all to have them. Burning wood is much better, they said, than gas or coal or oil. Renewable! Doesn’t churn out as much CO2!No, it just churns out lethal amounts of soot. Billions of pounds were spent by our government on a scheme to convert us to renewable heating systems.The brainchild of the disgraced Lib Dem halfwit Chris Huhne. Millions more was spent converting one of our biggest power stations to woodchip. The wood is shipped over 3,500 miles from the US (there’s eco-friendly for you). And it’s all made everything a lot, lot, worse as a consequence.Then there are diesel cars. You may have one. The government is getting tough on those, too.It’s now been discovered that they are much more polluting than petrol cars. It’s another major cause of pollution in our towns and cities.So why do we have them? Because the idiotic Greens told us to. Back in 2001 the Labour government offered tax breaks on diesel cars. Everyone rushed to buy one.A member of that Labour government has now ’fessed up and said it was the wrong decision, no question.But they wanted their Green credentials.And just look what trouble it has caused — 37,800 more deaths every year in this country simply as a consequence of those wood burning stoves. It is close to unbelievable.I wonder what the Greens will come up with next as an idea to save the planet.Maybe we should burn magpies, or sour cream and chive Pringles, or our own trousers.The truth is they haven’t got the remotest idea. They urge these measures upon us without the slightest notion of what might happen as a consequence.And the problem is that important people take them seriously. Governments, for example.And we end up paying through the nose for their idiocies — and then, a little later, gasping for breath.The wood burning stove business should convince all members of Parliament. Never listen to a green.No matter how nice he or she might seem. Just ignore them. They’re bad for your health.WHAT a shame – Roman Abramovich can’t get back into the country because we haven’t cleared his visa. So he’s sitting on his yacht somewhere, getting snippy. I’m not sure why we let Roman in in the first place.You don’t get his kind of money by being lovely to everybody, do you?First we helped wreck the Russian economy in the early 1990s by plundering its state run industries. Then we opened the doors to a whole bunch of Russkie gangsters – sorry, oligarchs – with boats the size of Poland. Anyway, I’ll probably end up glowing like a Belisha beacon just for writing this.BROADCASTER Dan Snow has admitted he lies to his daughters.He’s told them that during the war there were loads of female Spitfire pilots. Zooming around, shooting down krauts. He says he doesn’t want them to feel limited by their gender. He should have gone further. Told them that back then Britain was led by a nice lady called Winnie.And that the first person up Everest was a little girl called Hillary. And as for that Ada Hitler . . .THE Iraqis are executing the IS jihadi brides. Loads of them.Some of them are whining that they had no idea their husbands were evil Islamists. One of them said she thought she was marrying a rapper.Yeah, right love. We’ve got a few here, mind.Women who went out to join IS and then thought better of it. They’re lucky we won’t extradite them to Iraq.HEY – got your Royal Wedding gift bag yet? Guests to the wedding are flogging them on eBay for as little as £20,000. Hell of a bargain. I’ve got a bid in on one right now. It says it contains:I’VE got a bit of a soft spot for Victoria Beckham. She’s been criticised for not smiling at the wedding of Harry and Meghan.Some people have suggested Posh Spice was looking a bit grim because David had been out on the pull again. Nah. She wasn’t smiling because, basically, she’s a miserable cow.And I like that. Why should she have to wander around grinning like a village idiot?Keep the sulk and the pout, Vikki, love. Plus I liked what she was wearing at the bash. She was dressed as if for the funeral of someone she didn’t know very well. She looked great.SO, all four of the great American authors are dead. Both Tom Wolfe and Philip Roth died this week.Saul Bellow and the finest of them all, John Updike are already dead.These gentlemen were my heroes when I was growing up. But how long will they be remembered?Updike is already unfashionable on account of his alleged sexism. Wolfe and Bellow were quite right-wing, so the literary critics will quickly consign their books to the “dead white male” rubbish bin of history. And as a consequence, we will have lost an awful lot.Keep their work alive, whatever the critics tell you.

You shouldn’t be one of them.But the Labour Party has now decided that anyone who says they are a woman is eligible for political roles that are for women only. They do not ask for any more proof than that.As a Labour member and a woman on Wednesdays, that means I am eligible to stand for one of those roles.So, when the position of Women’s Officer came up for election, I decided to apply. The post involves encouraging women to join the party and speak for women and their experiences - and can only be held by women.Standing for the position was a chance for me to talk about self-identification with my local Party and bring my concerns to their attention.Of course, I was not expecting to win, but I was ready to do the job if I did.I was happy to let people make a democratic, informed choice.Women are worried that letting men say they are women without any checks is dangerous.There is a fear that some men will identify as women just so they can go into changing rooms or loos and spy on or attack women.Women also say that it will affect women’s rights to dignity and privacy, for example on women-only hospital wards or in shelters.Those are also real concerns, but a small minority of people don’t want them to be talked about.They call feminists like Germaine Greer - who has said transgender women are not women - out-of-touch or get angry when people yell out body parts or facts on TV.Those people are stopping a very important debate. I don’t feel that’s right.And self-identification is not just Labour’s position.Nearly every political party in the UK says that the Gender Recognition Act should be changed so that anyone can legally change their sex just by saying they are a man or a woman.The Labour Party made their decision so they could be ahead of the change to the law.Some trans people say that the current requirements set out by the GRA are humiliating and difficult to cope with on top of living their lives. That is a real concern and one that has to be listened to.However, I don’t agree with the idea that you should be able to legally change your sex just by saying you want to.It ignores the very real struggles that trans people face every day.It says that I have had the same life experience as people such as the L’Oreal and Playboy model Munroe Bergdorf, journalist and TV presenter Paris Lees and Lily Madigan - a transgender schoolgirl who was sent home from school for wearing a girls uniform.It says that their life-long fight to feel right in their bodies is the same as me identifying as a woman once a week.I can’t begin to imagine what their journeys have been like, but I know those journeys need to be recognised by more than just words.Following a recent meeting of Woman’s Place UK in Basingstoke, I talked with a reporter about my nomination for the Womens Officer role. The article that he wrote led to the Labour Party suspending me yesterday, with immediate effect.I am not allowed to attend meetings or stand for election and there will be an investigation.They seem to think that I am not enough of a woman.Some people online think the same. I have to ask the question, how much more of a woman would I need to be?I hope that what I did shows we need the debate on gender identity.We need to find the common ground so that trans people can live as they want to, while allowing women the dignity, privacy and safety that they deserve.We are all here thanks to women, so let’s talk to them.Really? I mean, really? I first came across David Lewis smug grinning face in a magazine earlier this week. Announcing he was a woman from morn to midnight on Wednesdays and boasting that he is changing nothing. Not his clothes. Not his routine. Not his womanly beard.Why? Because 15 minutes of fame. Because trans rights has gone too far. Because proposed law changes.He is not trans: has no idea what it is to be trans.The situation he is describing does not happen and has not happened anywhere, except when anti-trans campaigners break the law to make a point.Being trans is not fashion, trend or choice. Mocking transness in this dishonest way hurts people.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She was later arrested and thrown in the back of a police car.Describing his photograph of Kate in 2007, Max told The Sun Online: “Kate had been in Mahiki for a few hours and jumped into a taxi at around 2 or 3am.“I think she was telling the taxi driver where to go when I took the photograph and Prince Harry and Prince William got in their royal transport shortly after.He also said that Posh and Becks would get “mobbed” wherever they went and the photograph of actor Rhys Ifans putting his fingers up was “typical behaviour” because he “didn’t like having his picture taken”."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000408607579.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"mystery sea creature crocodile whale rhossili beach swansea","story":"The five-foot long carcass found on Rhossili Beach, Swansea has a long head, giant jawline and slender tail.Beth Jannetta, 41, who discovered the monster while walking her dogs, sent a photo of the creature to experts, hoping they would identify it.But boffins are not sure if it is a type of whale, dolphin or porpoise.Beth said: It looked like a well rotted cetacean to me. Other people think it is something different, like a crocodile.It would be very interesting to find out what species it is.”Bioscience expert Dr Dan Forman, from Swansea University, said: When you look at it the first time you may think it is a crocodile, but it is certainly not.There is a big bulge on the base of the skull which is characteristic of a cetacean.”He added: We get a reasonable amount of whales and dolphins, a lot which are dead and decomposed in places like Pendine and Rhossili.“From the data around carcasses washed up, there seems to be a cluster this time of year around June and July.Mark Hipkin, National Trust area ranger, who was called to collect the body, said he thought it was a porpoise.He said: We have porpoises washing up quite regularly, as well as dolphins and seals and sometimes sheep."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000408650365.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"apply here for our first summer internship scheme to work for the the number one paper","story":"The internships, for 18 to 25-year-olds, are available in roles including reporting, news-gathering, design and production, across print and online.Placements will last up to 12 weeks and be based mainly in London.

An 83,000 increase in the year was enough to see Romania leapfrog Ireland into second place.Polish remains the most common non-British nationality – with an estimated one million.There are more Poles than any other nationality in every single region of the UK – from 108,000 in the east Midlands to 63,000 in the south West.Alp Mehmet, vice chair of Migration Watch, said: “There is still no sign of a net outflow of EU-born people as a result of Brexit.“Indeed they are still coming in significant numbers and contributing to a population increase which is simply unsustainable.”The ONS showed how immigration has transformed towns across the UK with migrants now accounting for 29 per cent of the population in Boston, Lincs – up from just 3 per cent in 2007.East Staffordshire’s migration population has soared from 3 per cent to 17 per cent.Nearly six out of every 10 people living in Newham, East London – 57 per cent – were born outside the UK.The ONS pointed out there are more Indians and Pakistanis than Romanians by country of birth – but many have since taken up British citizenship.THE Brexit vote appears to have triggered a huge spike in EU nationals seeking a British passport.Some 40,014 applied in the year to the end of March, nearly double the previous year, official figures reveal.A total of 14,137 were from the EU8 bloc, including Poland and Hungary.Ex-PM David Cameron lifted immigration controls on Romania and Bulgaria in 2014 and numbers have soared ever since.Experts claim many Romanians and Bulgarians have come to the UK to fill the gaps left by Poles beginning to return home. There were just 78,000 Romanians living in the UK in 2010, putting it 15th below Bangladesh.Separate Home Office figures today revealed 148,000 National Insurance registrations were given out to Romanians in the year to March - a third of all those handed out to EU nationals.The Home Office said the number of foreign national offenders removed in the 12 months to March fell 11 per cent to 5,630.Last year, Romania threatened to block Brexit altogether unless Theresa May gave its country’s residents a guarantee of UK citizenship.The first Romanian to arrive in the UK to work after Mr Cameron relaxed controls – Victor Spirescu – died in a car crash this January.The man – dubbed the “poster boy” for Romanian immigration – was found to have taken cocaine when he lost control of a car near Newport Pagnell.Or is the reality different?Yes, Britain voted to control its borders, like any nation beyond the EU.But we are still the most welcoming country on Earth. "},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nip000407435715.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"prince philip cracked rib harry meghan wedding","story":"The Duke of Edinburgh - who was photographed with what looked like black eyes last Saturday - slipped while washing.The accident happened only days after he had thrown his crutches away following a hip op.The 96-year-old had been hailed a hero for making it to the Royal Wedding without crutches just six weeks after surgery.But a Royal insider said despite sustaining the painful rib injury he refused even the aid of a stick on Meghan and Harry’s big day.They told The Sun: “The Duke is not a fan of showering and prefers to bathe. But he’s a determined man and nothing was going to stop him attending nor would he take any kind of walking aid.”The Duke was praised for his no nonsense attitude as he smiled throughout last Saturday’s celebrations.Last night Sun doctor Carol Cooper branded him the “Iron Duke” saying he took the British stiff upper lip to a “new level”.She said: “I take my hat off to him. He is clearly a very resolute gentleman who will not stop doing what he needs to do.“Fractured ribs tend to be quite painful. It’s very rare for a fractured rib not to cause pain - even a tiny fracture.“Because your ribs move when you breathe, every breath you take can be painful.“Painkillers are often not very effective but it is possible to get have a local anaesthetic injected into the area to deaden the pain temporarily.”Prince Philip had spent days walking up and down stairs to get himself fit for the wedding after his hip replacement.Such was the speed of his recovery he was even warned to slow it down.Family biographer Penny Junor described his walk into the chapel - not even with a limp as “completely heroic”.She said: “Given that he is 96 years old and the operation was just six weeks ago, I think that shows what an extraordinary man he is.“That will have meant a huge amount to Prince Harry.

advertisers and countless ­others desperately want ­people to “review our privacy policy” and “accept new terms and conditions.”You might assume this has something to do with the recent Facebook scandal, where founder Mark Zuckerberg had to apologise for allowing users’ data to end up in the hands of political forces.But the real reason is a major shake-up of EU laws governing the information kept about you online.The less-than-snappily-titled General Data Protection ­Regulations (EU) 2016/679 comes into force tomorrow.The beefed-up “GDPR” rules mean everyone from hi-tech firms to public bodies need to change their ways.This should be good news if you are ­deluged by spam or ­embarrassed by party ­pictures on social media.Here, GRANT ROLLINGS answers some common ­questions about the changes.If that message came from a ­provider you actually like, such as a charity or your favourite football team, not responding will limit their future interactions with you.Under the new data laws you need to give clear consent to online tracking or being sent unexpected messages.And if you haven’t done so by today, that charity or football team might have to stop ­letting you know about new offers and deals.Don’t worry, though – if you miss today’s deadline it shouldn’t mean you are suddenly blocked by all the sites or services you have been ­subscribed to.Everything in the new digital age is snappy and easy to digest – apart from the long and baffling terms and conditions.That all changes from today.Under the new law, companies cannot use mind-numbing T\u0026ampCs full of impenetrable legal jargon to make you aware of the changes.The request for consent must be given in an intelligible, separate and easily ­accessible form.And if they are handing over your data to someone else, they have to spell it out in plain English.If you are suffering from unticking fatigue, help is on its way.Currently consumers face the annoying task of having to untick several boxes that ask them whether they are happy to receive “selected marketing” communications.After today, you will only receive ads from “marketing ­partners” if you are told their name and you actively tick or click on a box to say you want them.While the cascade will be greatly reduced, it won’t cease altogether.Legitimate companies should abide by the new rules but there is little to stop conmen sending emails offering to enlarge your ­manhood or informing you about a financial windfall waiting in Nigeria.If you lost out on a loan, a pay rise or a job because a computer has said “no”, you can now ask for a good old-fashioned human being to be involved in the decision- making process.The problem until now has been that computers have based their decisions on the information they are given.If the data held about you was incorrect or incomplete, you may have been treated unfairly.Adam French, a consumer rights expert from Which?, said: “For some workers an ­algorithm is used to judge whether they are completing their tasks quickly enough to be paid a certain rate.“With the new law, you’ll be able to get a human involved, because maybe you are being slowed down by faulty machinery and the ­computer doesn’t know that.”If there is a particularly sensitive image or over-opinionated late-night social media post that you don’t want anyone to see any more, help could be on the way.Under the new law you will be able to ask for so-called “Data ­Erasure”, so those words and images are removed from sight forever.But this “right to be forgotten” is not ­guaranteed and can be challenged by the firm holding the data.What caused the most outrage in the recent scandal involving Facebook was that British marketing firm Cambridge Analytica used data such as post “likes” to create a ­profile of millions of voters.But profiling is also used by firms to target adverts at consumers.And many companies, such as Facebook, have made a fortune by harvesting that data for advertisers.From now on firms will have to make it clearer that they do this, and consumers will be able to opt out of profiling for targeted ads.Ailidh Callander, a lawyer for ­Privacy International, which has campaigned for tougher data laws, said: “Companies are exploiting our data in ways we do not understand, making it their business to learn about your habits, sex interests, political beliefs and more.Companies must protect our data and the new privacy law pushes companies do this.”The new rules say that younger children cannot ­consent to online services without a parent’s agreement.But there is little to stop your kids from pretending they are an adult.There was outrage last November when taxi app Uber admitted it had kept secret a data breach that affected 57million of its customers and drivers.From today, firms will need to report any breach within 72 hours of first becoming aware of it.Failure to comply could result in a fine which is equal to two per cent of the firm’s annual global ­turnover.Every business, no matter how big or small, has to abide by the new data protection laws – from media giants to landlords with just one buy-to-let property.Public services also need to implement it, as do firms operating from outside of the EU if they want to do business within it.At the moment the Government intends to keep the new EU data laws after Brexit.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Warren Air Force Base, Wyoming, that was cracked following a slip-up on social media.Authorities launched an investigation after an airman posted a Snapchat video of himself smoking marijuana, despite strict rules from Airman 1st Class Nickolos Harris, the ringleader.Fourteen airmen were disciplined. Six of them were convicted in courts-martial of LSD use or distribution or both.“Although this sounds like something from a movie, it isn’t,” said Capt. Charles Grimsley, the lead prosecutor of one of several courts-martial.The acid ring, which began in 2015, was exposed in March 2016 but the details have not been publicised until now.It was composed of airmen from the 90th Missile Wing, which operates one-third of the 400 Minuteman 3 missiles that are “on alert” 24/7 and stored in underground silos across the northern Great Plains.One of the service members, Airman 1st Class Tommy Ashworth, said at his court-martial that he felt “paranoia, panic” for hours during his acid trip.“I didn’t know if I was going to die that night or not,” he testified.Harris pleaded guilty to using and distributing LSD and using ecstasy, cocaine and marijuana, telling a military judge, “I absolutely just loved altering my mind.”He said it was easy to score LSD and other drugs from civilian sources and admitted using acid eight times and passing it out multiple times to other airmen at parties in Denver and elsewhere from spring 2015 to early 2016.Harris implemented rules during parties: “No social media at all” and “No bad trips. Everybody’s happy right now. Let’s keep it that way,” he told airmen in a video recorded at a Cheyenne apartment in 2015.The disgraced airman was sentenced to 12 months in jail and other penalties — but avoided a punitive discharge as part of an agreement with prosecutors.The AP’s report is the result of documents obtained over the past two years through the Freedom of Information Act.Air Force spokesman Lt. Col. Uriah L. Orland maintained the drug use took place during off-duty hours.“There are multiple checks to ensure airmen who report for duty are not under the influence of alcohol or drugs and are able to execute the mission safely, securely and effectively,” he said.A version of this story originally appeared on the New York Post."},{"url":null,"title":"norwich men fashion style alan partridge","story":"Almost half of those in the city that spawned fashion disaster Alan Partridge think they look the best.That compares with 30 per cent of Liverpudlian men ranking themselves top.The figure was 28 per cent in London, 23 in Leeds and 22 in Manchester.A third of fellas in Norwich also think the city is well known for good-looking guys.Men there pay out £45 a month on their hair and wet shave compared to just £11 in Cambridge.They also spend £77 a month on clothes — £15 more than guys in London.Just for Men Moustache \u0026amp Beard, which carried out the study, said: “Norwich might be the home of Alan Partridge — whose love of golfing jumpers, string back driving gloves and horizon blue ‘action slacks’ is well known  — but the men of the city obviously take more pride in the way they look.”The poll of 1,500 UK men also found the average bloke found his sense of style aged 34.Well-kept eyebrows, getting a haircut every six weeks, owning a dinner jacket and having spotless trainers are signs of a modern, image-conscious man.And 32 per cent said having the right facial hair was fundamental to looking good.The Just For Men spokesman added: “The emphasis has shifted from simply having the facial hair, to how well kept that facial hair is, particularly in terms of being neat and full.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Russell Edwards, who weighed almost 20 stone, realised his fast food habit was getting out of control after he looked at his bank statements and noticed how much cash was being spent on burgers and chips. He says he was eating breakfast at McDonald\u0027s at least five times a week. However, the 37-year-old soon turned his life around after swapping McDonald\u0027s for power walking on his lunch breaks.  When we had our son, things started to change in my life and I didn\u0027t realise it at the time - but I started to struggle with my weight, Russell told Wales Online.  Having a new child meant I had no time for fitness and I let myself go. He was a poor sleeper, so I\u0027d stay up all night watching Netflix and started eating chocolates and biscuits at around 2am.  Russell said things started to get worse after he left his job as a health club manager at The Miskin Manor Hotel \u0026amp Health Club and landed a new job at a water treatment company - which was right next door to a McDonald\u0027s restaurant. The job was office based and right next door there was a Greggs and a McDonald\u0027s. I was so big that I started to get lazy - which meant I\u0027d sleep late in the mornings and wouldn\u0027t have time to make breakfast. It wasn\u0027t long before Russell started stopping in McDonald\u0027s before work. It\u0027s lethal having a contactless debit card - because I didn\u0027t realise what I was spending there, he said. I was having breakfast there around five days a week.  It started with a coffee and then coffee and a breakfast meal and then all of that and a wrap as well. And sometimes I\u0027d even have lunch there too. One month I remember checking my bank statement and I\u0027d spent \u0026pound200 at McDonald\u0027s. I couldn\u0027t believe it! Russell added: It wasn\u0027t McDonald\u0027s\u0027 fault - you can make good choices there these days, but I was just making the wrong choices. It was my own fault - I chose to eat it and I slipped into a bad habit. Russell said his weight at the time - which was around 19 stone 4lbs - was not only effecting his physical health, but his mental health too, making made him desperately unhappy. I came home from work one day and my son said to me \u0027Dad, Dad - come and play with me\u0027 and I had to say no because I was too tired. Seeing his face all upset made me think - what are you doing? I wasn\u0027t tired I was just overweight. Russell said another experience which played a huge factor in his decision to lose weight was when he travelled to Toulouse to watch Wales during the UEFA Euro 2016 Championship.  I hadn\u0027t tried on any of my clothes, so before the game I realised none of my Wales tops fitted me and I couldn\u0027t button up my 44-inch waist shorts. I had to go out and buy XXL clothes.  Looking back at photos from two years ago, what stands out is the shirt I wore to the games, Russell said. It was the biggest size I had ever had to buy and although I knew then that I had to do something about it, I couldn’t. I was in a rut and it was really hard to get going. He added: I told my brother - who was with me in France at the time - I\u0027m not going to be like this next year. When he returned from his trip, Russell - who left his office job to return to work at the health club - started running in the lane behind his house. He also bought a Fitbit watch to track his steps. I was too self-conscious to go to the gym. I was worried people would laugh. So I started running in the lane behind my house. And I was very unfit. I could only run for around three minutes.  I was also only managing around 1,000 steps a day on my watch, and 800 of those were just walking to and from my car to get to work. So, I set myself a target of reaching around 10,000 a day. Russell also made an effort to change his diet in conjunction with the watch - which meant cutting out his McDonald\u0027s breakfast and lunch. I knew the watch wouldn’t work miracles on its own, but I understood it would make me accountable for my activity, or lack of it, he said. I started focusing on healthy meals and cooking more at home - things like spaghetti bolognese and fish. I still had the odd treat too, but I cut out McDonald\u0027s totally. Despite his lifestyle and diet changes, Russell says it was running that really helped him transform his life. So much so, that last year he completed his first 10k race and has signed up for this year\u0027s Cardiff Half Marathon. He\u0027s now hoping to inspire others to follow suit.

It wasn’t exactly encouraging.\u0026#8221Mark was 19 when he left Dundee and decided to travel Europe by rail, and it was those experiences that prompted him to write a book, a gay coming-of-age adventure titled Changing Trains.\u0026#8220The main character in the story is Sam, but much of it is based on my own experiences travelling alone in Europe in 1985,\u0026#8221 he said.\u0026#8220I’m a big fan of the novelist Christopher Isherwood, whose books formed the basis for the film Cabaret.\u0026#8220My title is a nod to his book Mr Norris Changes Trains.\u0026#8220Isherwood’s Fraulein Schroeder is remembered in my book as Madame Gilbert and all the young female characters that Sam encounters in my book kind of collectively represent Isherwood’s Sally Bowles.\u0026#8221\u0026#8220When I travelled across Europe in 1985, we were still in the cold war era \u0026#8211 weird to think we could heading that way again now \u0026#8211 and it was pre-Shengen, so I had to go through border controls as I entered and left each country and there was no euro at this point, so I had to get my head around constantly changing my currencies \u0026#8211 pounds to francs to pesetas to lira. This is all described in the book, and I have a little fun with it.\u0026#8221Mark began writing the book in 2010, while he was travelling between his work in London and a small house in France.\u0026#8220I’m a huge fan of Ian Fleming’s James Bond stories and when I travelled to places like Paris, Monte Carlo, Venice and the French Riviera \u0026#8211 all places that have appeared in Fleming’s novels \u0026#8211 it really felt like you were in the world of Bond, so I play with this a bit too,\u0026#8221 he said.\u0026#8220And when I went Interrailing, I travelled \u0026#8211 as everyone did back then \u0026#8211 with a number of compilation tapes for my Walkman, so the soundtrack to the book is also very 80s.\u0026#8220Everything from Duran Duran’s Bond theme ‘A View to a Kill’ to Simple Minds’ Glittering Prize album. Fab music.\u0026#8221The story starts in Dundee, and Mark said it was central to the story of Sam\u0026#8217s journey from uncertain, undecided small-town boy to a modern, outward-looking European with a sense of direction in his life.\u0026#8220Once the main character Sam has left Dundee and is discovering new cities like Paris, Barcelona and Monte Carlo, he often compares them with his origins. His experience of ‘otherness’ opens new possibilities to him, ones that weren’t available in Dundee at that time,\u0026#8221 Mark said.He initially started looking for a publisher for the book but decided instead to self-publish and said the reviews had been great.\u0026#8220I’ve been amazed at how many people have said it really took them back to that period and reminded them of their own lives back then. I love that it resonates with them,\u0026#8221 he said.\u0026#8220I’ve also done some readings in London and a few guest spots on blogs. But I’m fairly unknown as an author, so it’s a hard slog to get seen and heard.\u0026#8220There’s still lots of work to do.\u0026#8221\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/5b0288303a011.jpg ","title":"dundee people dundee student lucy gets a good look at cruise ship for school project","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAs the cruise ship Magellan sailed away from Dundee, Lucy Anderson was there to wave it off.The Dundee seven-year-old was studying the Titanic for a school project, her mum Pauline said, and wanted to see how big a cruise ship really was.\u0026#8220We just decided as we knew someone who was going on this one and have never seen any off them leave from Dundee before,\u0026#8221 Pauline said.\u0026#8220We went down to the Stannergate where a lot of other people obviously had the same idea.\u0026#8221Along with her big brother Lewis, 11, Lucy had a good view as the 726 foot ship sailed out to sea.\u0026#8220She was amazed with it and was standing waving to everyone standing on deck,\u0026#8221 Pauline said.\u0026#8220Not sure if it’ll help her but she now knows where the rooms with balcony’s are and ones that only have windows and where the captain is.\u0026#8220It was so good to see and is such a good thing for Dundee at the moment that these boats are coming quite regularly now \u0026#8211 hopefully a sign of more good things to come to the city.\u0026#8221\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/1-1.jpg ","title":"dundee people pictures may fayre raises 600 for dundee school","story":"\t\t\t\t\tIt may have been competing with a royal wedding and brilliant sunshine, but a Dundee school\u0026#8217s fayre still raised £600.Lynne Rihoy, Chairperson of the Claypotts Castle Primary Parent Council, said the fayre was a success.\u0026#8220It wasn\u0026#8217t as busy as previous fayres, but given the royal wedding and the fabulous weather outside, we still managed to raise around £600,\u0026#8221 she said.Kids were treated to face-painting, a visit from the local police and other games.\u0026#8220It seemed to be quite popular,\u0026#8221 she said.Lynne said the event was one of two the Parent Council organised each year, with the money raised going back to the school to fund books, school trip, leavers jackets and other things the school couldn\u0026#8217t cover.    \t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/5b02866b031c0.jpg ","title":"dundee people pupils run for very worthy cause","story":"\t\t\t\t\tOne hundred pupils and staff from Perth High School took part in the Perth Park Run to raise funds for the Teenage Cancer Trust.Teacher Dr Stephen Jones formerly worked for the trust and he also ran in the London marathon, raising £3,000 for this very worthy cause.The Perth High contingent were resplendent in their Teenage Cancer Trust T-shirts as they raced round the North Inch.Dr Jones’ initial goal was to raise £100 for every mile of this London marathon run but he is now on target to collect about £3,000.The other staff members and pupils raised a further £2,600 through their efforts.Dr Jones added: “This a fine gesture by staff and pupils.

Prior to that the Tangerines were unbeaten in 15 of 16 league games he played.With the 25-year-old set to return around the start of the new season, Duff believes it was vital United beat off interest from Championship rivals Ross County to get him fixed up on a new two-year contract. Having known him since he was a kid at Aberdeen the best part of a decade ago, Duff is well placed to judge what he can do.“I actually watched one of United’s play-off games with Fraser and from speaking to him I know he is working hard to get back fit,” he said.“He’s about to start running again so it shouldn’t be too long before he is back. That, and him signing a new deal, is very good news for United.“You saw the quality he has when he played for part of last season.“He was a bit of a stand-out in the United team and I will not be surprised if that’s the case again next season.“It really will not surprise me if they build the team around him because that’s the level of ability he has.”With most of last season’s team gone, Fyvie will be surrounded by new faces.That will make United something of an unknown quantity and bringing so many players in at one time has to be something of a gamble.For Duff it’s a calculated risk and, so long as the right type of player is sourced, he believes the team can gel.“I think if you go out and get the right players with the right attitude and philosophy, it can work.“You want players who want to come in and work hard to prove, basically, why the club signed them and that they should be playing at a club like United. If they do that then United can be where they want to be.”And having spent the best part of a decade at Tannadice from the start of his career, he would like nothing better than to see them back in the top flight.Last week he was back in a United strip for Dave Bowman’s annual game to raise cash for skin cancer and dementia charities. Running out at Tannadice reminded Duff where United should be.“You look around the place and it’s geared up for the Premiership but no one has the divine right to be there, you have to earn it. It will be a battle again next season because it’s a tough league.“But I was here nine-and-a-half years from when I was a kid and the upbringing here was very good – second to none – so I want United back up.”At 36, and despite recently taking on a new job with the Connect Energy Group that involves a lot of travelling, Duff has no plans to hang up his own boots.Next season he’ll again be plying his trade in the Highland League with Inverurie Locos.“The new job is keeping me busy but I do get Saturdays off so I’m available and happy to keep playing.“We finished third last year, so the aim is to go a bit higher next season.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"livingston star byrne on dundee united radar","story":"\t\t\t\t\tLivingston promotion hero Shaun Byrne is the latest player to be linked with a move to Dundee United.But the Tangerines will face stiff competition from elsewhere if they do move for him.The 24-year-old was part of the side that clinched promotion to the Premiership by beating Partick Thistle in the play-offs on Sunday.He’s now out of contract and that’s alerted United, Falkirk and a string of English clubs.

proud of stints at both dundee and united but focus is now on hibs","story":"\t\t\t\t\tSought-after Simon Murray’s future will not be decided until July at the very earliest.And while the striker, who’s just finished a loan spell at Dundee, is extremely flattered by interest from the other side of Tannadice Street, his first choice is to remain at parent club Hibs.Murray is currently enjoying his summer break but is well aware of speculation linking him with a return to first full-time employers Dundee United.Beaten Scottish Cup finalists Motherwell are also known to be considering a summer move for him and, dating back to his time at United, several clubs in Europe have monitored his progress.As recently as Dundee’s victory over St Johnstone last month, one sent their chief scout to update their file on him.For the 26-year-old, however, the next piece of business he aims to be involved in is a battle to re-establish himself at Easter Road.“I am contracted to Hibs for another year and, although I spent the second half of the season on loan at Dundee, my aim has always been to go back there.“I still finished the season top scorer for them and, even when I went to Dundee in January, the plan was always to go back.“At the time I spoke to Neil Lennon and he stressed whether or not I went was entirely down to me.“I could have stayed and he would have considered me for selection but really the move came up because Anthony Stokes had left and they needed a No 10.“They wanted Scott Allan and the only way the deal was going to be done was if I went to Dundee, so the gaffer did say to me I would be back in the summer.“He’s told me I can stake a claim for a place in the team next season and I know, if he says that, he means it, because he’s very honest with me.”Should things not work out in his second season at Hibs, Murray will look at his situation.“Obviously, if they sign another striker or decide to go another way I’ll have to think about what happens next, so it is good to know other clubs are interested. If it doesn’t work out, the only person I will blame is myself but I feel the move to Dundee has been good for me because it’s got me a lot more Premiership experience.”He admits had the loan interest at the turn of the year been from someone other than Dundee, there’s a fair chance he would have opted to stay put.“A lot’s been said about me being a Dundee fan and that was a factor.“More important was it was a move that wasn’t going to involve me having to get used to a new city or league.“I stayed at my mum’s when I was back up and I already knew some of the boys, so it was easy to settle in. I’m not saying I wouldn’t have gone somewhere else but all that made it an easier choice to come.”And, as a proud Dundonian, Murray admits the fact he’s joined a select band of players to have worn dark blue and tangerine is pleasing.“I will look back at the end of my career and be proud I played for Dundee and United. While I’m a Dundee fan, even before I was at United I was never one who didn’t want them to do well.“I always went to see both teams and I still do. I’m a football fan and I want to see both sides from my city doing well.“Now I’ve got a United connection, they are a club I will always have a lot of time for.“They were the team that gave me my chance in the game full-time and I’m grateful for that.“I still know a lot of people there and they are very good people who I respect a lot.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/5b03eb105ae54.jpg ","title":"zimbabwe international striker macauley bonne tops dundee wishlist","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee are in the hunt for a goalscorer and Leyton Orient marksman Macauley Bonne is top of their wishlist.The Zimbabwe international scored 25 goals for the National League side last season, sparking the Dark Blues interest.Born in Ipswich, Bonne started his career at Colchester United, where he played with current Dundee midfielder Glen Kamara briefly, before loans at Lincoln City and Woking.It’s been at Brisbane Road, however, where he’s shone, smashing in 22 league goals last season.With a year remaining on his current deal there, a fee will be required to prise him from Orient and that could be a sticking point with the non-league side holding out for six figures.With Shrewsbury, Portsmouth and Burton Albion all interested, too, Dundee have fierce competition to land the 22-year-old striker.Orient are also keen to keep him on a longer contract but a mid-table finish in the National League is unlikely to have been enough to keep him amid interest from other clubs.Dens gaffer Neil McCann highlighted a lack of killer instinct in his side throughout last season, something he is determined to rectify this summer with a proven goalscorer.With money in the bank from the January sale of defender Jack Hendry, Dundee have the funds behind them to strengthen that area of the team.And having already raided the English non-league for Roarie Deacon last summer and Elton Ngwatala last week, Neil is hoping he can attract another National League star to come north of the
